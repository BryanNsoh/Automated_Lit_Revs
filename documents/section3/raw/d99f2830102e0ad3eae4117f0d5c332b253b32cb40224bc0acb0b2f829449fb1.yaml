  description: Agricultural irrigation using reclaimed urban wastewater (RWW) represents
    a sustainable practice to meet the ever-increasing water stress in modern societies.
    However, the occurrence of residual antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria
    (ARB) in RWW is an important human health concern. This study applied for the
    first time a novel Simple-Death dose-response model to the field data of Escherichia
    coli and Pseudomonas spp. collected from three greenhouses for cultivation of
    tomatoes irrigated with RWW. The model estimates the risk of infection by enteropathogenic
    E. coli associated with consumption of tomatoes and the risk of eye-infection
    caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cultivation soil through hand-to-eye contacts.
    The fraction of antibiotic resistant (AR)-E. coli measured in irrigation water
    and AR-Pseudomonas spp. in soil was incorporated in the model to estimate the
    survival of ARB and antibiotic susceptible bacteria in the presence of trace level
    of antibiotics in human body. The results showed that the risk of E. coli infection
    through consumption of tomatoes irrigated with RWW is within the WHO and USEPA
    recommended risk threshold (<10−4); Pseudomonas aeruginosa eye-infection risk
    is at or below the acceptable risk level. The presence of residual antibiotic
    in human body reduced the overall risk probabilities of infections but selectively
    enhanced the survival of ARB in comparison to their susceptible counterparts,
    which resulted in antibiotic untreatable infection. Therefore, the outcomes of
    this study call for a new risk threshold for antibiotic untreatable infections
    and highlight the key importance of adopting work safety measures for better human
    health protection.

    using reclaimed urban wastewater (RWW) represents a sustainable practice to meet
    the ever-increasing water stress in modern societies. However, the occurrence
    of residual antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in RWW is an important

    collected from three greenhouses for cultivation of tomatoes irrigated with RWW.
    The model estimates the risk of infection by enteropathogenic E. coli associated

    aeruginosa in cultivation soil through hand-to-eye contacts. The fraction of antibiotic
    resistant (AR)-E. coli measured in irrigation water and AR-Pseudomonas spp. in

    susceptible bacteria in the presence of trace level of antibiotics in human body.
    The results showed that the risk of E. coli infection through consumption of tomatoes
    irrigated with RWW is within the WHO and USEPA recommended risk threshold (<10−4);
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa eye-infection risk is at or below the acceptable risk level.
    The presence of residual antibiotic in human body reduced the overall risk probabilities
    of infections but selectively enhanced the survival of ARB in comparison to their

    simulationSimple-death modelWater management 1. Introduction Globally, there has
    been a rapid growth in the number of initiatives aimed at advancing more sustainable
    water use, including the recycling and reuse of treated wastewater. Recycled,
    or reclaimed wastewater is applied to flush toilets and urinals, irrigate parks,
    golf courses, crops, and for industrial cooling and ornamental fountains or water
    features. Reclaiming wastewater, as a non-traditional water source, can alleviate
    water stresses in municipal and agricultural areas alike and diversify water supply
    portfolios. Treated wastewater is already a common water source for irrigation
    in many semi-arid regions of France, Spain, Italy, Israel, Cyprus, Malta, and
    the United States (US). The growth and extension of the wastewater reuse practice
    for agricultural irrigation also led to an increase in the health and environmental
    concerns associated with this practice. To promote the safe implementation of
    this sustainable practice, the EU has recently published the minimum quality requirements
    for water reuse (Regulation (EU) 2020/741). Nevertheless, this EU regulation,
    similarly to other existing guidelines and regulations, establishes the compliance
    requirements at the water delivery point, but not at the point of use. Understanding
    the behavior of pollutants and the potential for water quality deterioration from
    the point of delivery to the end user is paramount for risk assessments and should
    be addressed with field data under real conditions. Antibiotic resistance (AR)
    is a worldwide growing public health concern, while funding and research for new
    antibiotic development are predicted to decrease (Kelly et al., 2016). The US
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Centre for Disease
    Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimate that more than 2.8 and 0.67 million AR
    infections and more than 35,000 and 33,000 associated deaths occur every year
    in the U.S. and Europe, respectively (CDC, 2019; WHO, 2022). Urban wastewater
    treatment plants (UWWTPs) have been identified as contributors to increased AR
    since human waste can carry antibiotics, heavy metals, and pharmaceuticals as
    well as diverse bacterial communities. UWWTPs become hotspots of enriching antibiotic
    resistant bacteria (ARB) and spreading the antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) through
    different mechanisms such as selective pressures and horizontal gene transfer
    (Guo et al., 2017). Therefore, the use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation
    poses a human health threat for acquiring of ARB and ARGs through the food chain.
    Soil and water in farming environments may further contribute to proliferation
    of ARB (Christou et al., 2017). In fact, exposure to ARB through the food chain
    and their isolation from irrigated agricultural soils have increasingly been reported
    (Rahman et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the risk of developing AR infections associated
    with the agricultural reuse of reclaimed urban wastewater is still unknown due
    to the gaps in quantitative ARB data in the food chain and ARB risk models. The
    application of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) in various agricultural
    scenarios, where crops were irrigated with reclaimed wastewater, related to enteric
    viruses and other pathogenic bacteria or parasites have been documented (Bailey
    and Sobsey, 2022). Nevertheless, the lack of microbial data collected at the point-of-use
    of these wastewater reuse fields increases the uncertainty associated with QMRA
    studies, and studies to estimate the health risk of agricultural workers is practically
    absent. Moreover, there is a significant gap in the assessment of risk and exposure
    to ARB due to the previous lack of models to quantify the human dose-response
    to such bacteria. In this regard, this gap was recently filled by a new approach
    to dose-response models for ARB reported by Chandrasekaran and Jiang (2019), which
    can predict the risk of illness as well as if it is treatable or not by antibiotic
    therapies based on a stochastic simple death process for a mixed population of
    antibiotic susceptible and resistant bacteria (common in environmental samples)
    and the presence of residual and sub-inhibitory antibiotics concentration (Chandrasekaran
    and Jiang, 2019). Nevertheless, this potentially useful ARB model framework has
    not yet been applied to risk assessment in an environmental scenario. With this
    backdrop, the aim of this study is to estimate the ARB infection risks for consumers
    and farmers associated with different reclaimed wastewater management scenarios
    for tomato irrigation in three greenhouses. Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli data
    collected from research fields were analyzed using the Simple-Death dose-response
    model for QMRA. The results demonstrated the relationship between the fraction
    of ARB and the risks of developing AR infection. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Risk scenarios for irrigation water and soil The risk assessment was performed
    based on the experimental data collected in a field study in intensive agriculture
    (Nahim-Granados et al., 2023). In this study, three family-based agricultural
    greenhouses for tomato cultivation by drip irrigation with RWW were monitored
    during a full cultivation cycle (ca. 7 months). These greenhouses were selected
    to represent risk scenarios associated with different management practices for
    reclaimed water. Briefly, irrigation water in Greenhouse 1 (G1) was used as directly
    received from the RWW distribution system of the water reclamation plant (chlorination
    treatment) without previous storage. Greenhouse 2 (G2) was irrigated with RWW
    after its storage in a secondary reservoir open to air for ca. 1 month. Storage
    of RWW is the most common practice to balance the treated effluent flow and irrigation
    needs. Finally, Greenhouse 3 (G3) was irrigated by a mixture of groundwater and
    RWW in a proportion of ca. 3:1 that was stored in a secondary reservoir. The risk
    characterization of the RWW was based on the concentrations of E. coli and AR-
    E. coli (resistance to cephalosporin and carbapenem class of antibiotics, see
    Table S1 for names and concentrations of antibiotics used in the inhibition test)
    collected from the irrigation (dropper) water. Pseudomonas spp. and AR-Pseudomonas
    (resistance to carbapenem class of antibiotic, Table S1) were collected from the
    soil samples in each greenhouse. Note that, in QMRA calculations, bacterial concentration
    that was reported as “non-detected” was replaced with the value of half of the
    quantification limit, a common strategy for managing “non-detected” results. 2.2.
    Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) QMRA was conducted based on
    the four main components outlined by the WHO (World Health Organization): (i)
    hazard identification; (ii) hazard characterization; (iii) exposure assessment;
    and (iv) risk characterization (WHO, 2021). A diagram illustrating the overall
    QMRA approach specific for this study is shown in Fig. S1. All calculations and
    algorithms were implemented using MATLAB version R2022b. Monte Carlo simulation
    was used to represent the propagation of variability and uncertainties through
    randomized selection of the distribution-based input parameters according to their
    probability distributions and generating output values by computation of 10,000
    iterations (or until attaining steady state distributions). 2.2.1. Hazard identification
    ARB poses a hazard to human health through a wide range of exposure sources and
    pathways. Nevertheless, consumer exposure to ARB contaminated vegetables (frequently
    associated with RWW irrigation) is a major concern due to the potential colonization
    of the human gastrointestinal tract and the possible ARG transfer to other bacteria
    strains or species in the human gastrointestinal tract (Hölzel et al., 2018).
    Among the different antibiotic resistant foodborne pathogens, AR-E. coli stands
    out as a major concern due to E. coli prevalence at high concentrations in the
    environment and the frequency of human exposures (Aiello et al., 2007). Besides
    E. coli, Pseudomonas spp. is a ubiquitous bacterium with the ability to colonize
    multiple niches due to its metabolic versatility and its broad adaptation to different
    conditions. Pseudomonas is commonly associated with eye infections, ear infections
    (swimmer''s ear), and hospital-acquired respiratory infections. Its ability to
    form biofilms can explain the wide persistence and detection of this species in
    soils and food-related products (Moradali et al., 2017; Allydice-Francis and Brown,
    2012). AR- E. coli and Pseudomonas, including carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas,
    have been reported in tomatoes (Obeng et al., 2018; Estepa et al., 2015). Therefore,
    both E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. are useful indicators for farm-related ARB.
    Human infection by ARB could lead to treatment failure and the imposition of additional
    health hazards that decrease the therapeutic options to treat the infection. In
    line with the potential indicators of foodborne ARB species mentioned above, 3rd
    generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas
    spp. are the most important threat to human health. They are included as ARB indicators
    by the European Commission as well as in the priority 1 (critical category) list
    of antibiotic resistant pathogens by the WHO, which consists of 12 bacteria considered
    to pose the greatest threat to human health (ECDC-EFSA-EMA, 2017; WHO, 2017).
    According to a recent report, cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and carbapenem-resistant
    Pseudomonas are responsive to ca. 300,000 and 62,000 annual infections and ca.
    9000 and 4000 deaths, respectively (Cassini et al., 2019). Tomato is considered
    a high-risk vegetable for pathogen contamination because it is frequently consumed
    raw, and bacteria are frequently detected in agricultural soils and on raw tomatoes
    (Remington et al., 1981). Potential internalization of the bacteria inside the
    fruit body further increases the human exposure risks (Hirneisen et al., 2012).
    Nevertheless, it is important to note that the risks associated with tomatoes
    are lower than for other vegetables which are closer to the contamination source
    or/and have higher surface area, such as leaves and root vegetables. Based on
    the above assessments, cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and carbapenem-resistant
    Pseudomonas were selected as the microbial hazards of this study. Human exposure
    through consumption of raw tomatoes contaminated by E. coli and through soil contact
    to Pseudomonas during agricultural practices were identified as the exposure pathways.
    In the QMRA model, only the risk of the 3rd generation cephalosporins-resistant
    E. coli was assessed, although all AR- E. coli isolates were also resistant to
    the 1st generation cephalosporins (i.e., cephalexin) antibiotic (Nahim-Granados
    et al., 2023). The 3rd generation cephalosporins antibiotic is more effective
    against gram-negative bacterial infections, thus resistance to this class of antibiotics
    has greater health implications. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) of
    E. coli responses to cefixime (a 3rd generation cephalosporin) was used to estimate
    the death rate in the presence of this antibiotic in the dose-response assessment
    (Section 2.2.2, supplementary information S1). The imipenem resistant Pseudomonas
    was used to represent Pseudomonas resistant to carbapenems class of antibiotic
    although the isolates were resistant to both imipenem and meropenem. Imipenem
    resistance seems to be a logical assumption for environmental Pseudomonas because
    the resistance is due to the loss of a substrate-specific outer membrane porin
    and the expression of a chromosomal β-lactamase. In comparison, meropenem resistance
    in Pseudomonas includes overexpression of multidrug efflux pumps and membrane
    permeability changes, which is less likely to occur in-vivo (Zhanel et al., 2007).
    The PK/PD of Pseudomonas responses to imipenem was used to estimate the death
    rate in the presence of this antibiotic in the dose-response assessment. 2.2.2.
    Hazard characterization (dose-response assessment) The hazard characterization
    involves the application of a dose-response model to quantify risks through exposure
    to both ARB and antibiotic-susceptible bacteria (ASB). A novel Simple-Death dose-response
    model previously reported by Chandrasekaran and Jiang (2019) was adopted to analyze
    the response of individual ARB and ASB in the presence of residual antibiotic
    concentrations. The model computes the total risk and predicts the health outcomes,
    i.e., if illness is treatable with antibiotics or not. The extinction of ARB indicates
    antibiotic treatable illness, while the survival and proliferation of ARB indicates
    antibiotic untreatable infection. The Simple-Death dose-response model can be
    expressed in the similar form as the classical exponential and beta-Poisson dose-response
    models with the best-fit parameters derived by Chandrasekaran and Jiang (2019).
    A summary of the models relevant to this study is presented in the supplementary
    information S1. The model parameters used in the model and sources are presented

    tomatoes Microbial contamination of vegetables during cultivation can occur through
    several different pathways (O''Flaherty et al., 2019). Irrigation water was considered
    as the contamination source in this QMRA study, where ASB and ARB concentrations
    of E. coli in irrigation water (Cw, CFU/100 mL, Nahim-Granados et al. 2023) were
    fitted with a non-parametric cumulative distribution function (CDF) curve. The
    probability of encountering specific ASB and ARB concentrations during tomato
    irrigation were generated by Monte Carlo random sampling of the CDF. Bacterial
    concentrations reported as below the detection limit of 1 CFU/100 mL were replaced
    with ½ of the detection limit. Since enterotoxigenic E. coli is only a fraction
    of total E. coli, we collected literature data of E. coli and those carrying the
    Shiga toxin gene (stx) in wastewater from eight Spanish wastewater treatment plants
    (Blanch et al., 2003; García-Aljaro et al., 2004). The amount of enterotoxigenic
    E. coli in the irrigation water was estimated using an additional Monte Carlo
    simulation based on their distributions (FE) in the wastewater (Blanch et al.,
    2003; García-Aljaro et al., 2004). To estimate the retention of irrigation water
    (W) on tomatoes, we adopted a value of 0.00016 mL/100 g previously reported by
    (Oron et al., 2015) and bound it by a triangular distribution between 0 and 0.0036
    (water retention measured for cucumbers) for uncertainty. The adoption of this
    low probability of vegetable-water contact in our specific scenario is to consider
    that: (1) surface drip irrigation applied in the study has a lower probability
    of water contact with plant than other methods such as spray irrigation, and (2)
    tomatoes as hydrophobic hanging fruits in the plant has a lower water contact
    rate than roots and leaves (Oron et al., 2015). The bacterial natural decay on
    tomato surfaces from the time of harvest to consumption was experimentally determined
    using a 3-day holding time, according to previous studies reporting that ca. 80%
    of the people store fresh vegetables more than 3 days before consumption (Jacxsens
    et al., 2015). For decay estimation, the tomatoes were submerged in isotonic water
    (0.9% NaCl w:v) spiked with E. coli for 5 min. The surface contaminated tomatoes
    were then split into two equal groups. For the first group, the bacteria were
    eluted from tomatoes and were analyzed by culture assay to determine the initial
    bacterial load (day 0). The same procedure was performed for the second group
    of tomatoes on day 3. The resulted 3-day holding decay (λh) was calculated as
    −1.02 ± 0.09 log CFU/100 g for E. coli. The reduction of the microbial contamination
    on tomatoes surfaces after home washing (λw) was according to a previous report;
    2.1 ± 0.33 log CFU/g reduction after 15 s was included in the computation of exposure
    (Kilonzo-Nthenge et al., 2006). Both inactivation rates were inserted into the
    model as normal distributions (Table 2). Since the recommendation of washing vegetables
    before consumption is not practiced by all consumers, the literature reported
    percent of people who wash vegetables at home prior to consumption (%wash = 84.7%)
    was also integrated in the exposure model (Barker et al., 2013). Table 2. Parameters

    average bodyweight for an adult (68.5 kg) (Brancato et al., 2019). Finally, the
    exposure dose of E. coli through consumption of RWW irrigated tomatoes can be
    calculated with: (1) All values and definitions of parameters used in the exposure
    models are listed in Table 2. 2.2.3.2. Hand-to-eye transfer of soil Several studies
    have indicated the concern for exposure and eye infection risk of Pseudomonas
    due to handling contaminated water or soil (Balfour-Lynn (2021). While newsworthy
    outbreaks of Pseudomonas often stem from eyedrops or contact lenses (U.S. Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023), the CDC warns of potential risk from
    soil contact and transfer (CDC, 2019). Based on this concern and the high abundance
    of Pseudomonas in the greenhouse soils, we assessed the risk of human eye exposure
    to Pseudomonas in soil through hand-to-eye contact while working in the field.
    Eye exposure to Pseudomonas can result in severe eye infection or corneal ulceration.
    The corneal exposure model represents a very different infection risk from the
    tomato scenario, which focuses on field workers rather than consumers. According
    to Lawin-Brüssel et al. (1993), the beta-Poisson dose-response model fits best
    to the clinical data of Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced ocular infection. Therefore,
    Simple-Death dose-response in the form of beta-Poisson model dose-response was
    used for risk characterization. The hand-to-eye exposure for Pseudomonas is modelled
    after the hand-to-face model of Dean and Mitchell''s (2020). Briefly, the model
    integrates the concentration of bacteria in the soil ( , the soil adherence to
    the hands ( , the surface area of the fingertip ( , the transfer efficiency from
    finger to eye ( , and the number of transfers ( ) over a set exposure time ( ).
    The surface area of the fingertip used here is from measurements of the volar
    area of the index finger, and half of the mean surface area was used to represent
    the fingertip (Murai et al., 1997; Rusin et al., 2002). The transfer efficiency
    (Et) applied is from various studies of hand-to-face transfer, applying the efficiency
    from hand-to-lip membrane to exposures of both mouth and eye (Table 2). The number
    of transfers (TR, rate over time) is based on observations of face touching (both
    eye and mouth) and was halved for our study to represent eye touching only, per
    the findings of Nicas and Best (2008). As the identified dose-response model and
    causative agent of keratitis is known to be specifically P. aeruginosa, our empirical
    soil data for Pseudomonas spp. was attenuated in a similar fashion as the E. coli
    model for pathogenic portion of the bacteria. A ratio of P. aeruginosa to total
    Pseudomonas spp. (FP) was identified from treated wastewater effluent (Limayem
    et al., 2019) and included in our exposure model (Eq. (2)). All parameter values
    or empirical distributions for Monte Carlo sampling of Pseudomonas concentrations
    in soil are listed in Table 2. The equation combining these parameters (denoted
    above) to calculate the dose of eye exposure is: (2) 2.2.4. Risk characterization
    The probability of infection (P(d)) is calculated based on the dose for a single
    (one tomato meal per day) or one day (working in filed) exposure event, which
    is equivalent to the daily risk of infection. However, the common risk benchmark
    used by risk management agencies (i.e., EPA and WHO) is the annual infection risk
    (Pannual), a parameter that considers the risk of multiple exposures through several
    events in a year. This parameter is calculated according to the independence theorem
    previously reported (Eq. (3)) and computed using the Monte Carlo method (Haas
    et al., 2014). (3) Where P(d) is the distribution of the daily risk, the subscript
    i represents the ith iteration and N represents the total number of iterations,
    i.e., the number of exposure occasions per year. The number of meals that involves
    tomato consumption per year (N = 292) was estimated by dividing the total annual
    of tomatoes ingested in a year (15 kg/year) by the average serving size (M, 51.38
    g) (EC, 2022). Five days were used as the number of days that workers were exposed
    to soil contaminated by Pseudomonas during the first stage of the cultivation
    based on the information provided by the farmers and considering the worst scenario.
    All parameters for the risk assessment are listed below in Table 2. 3. Results
    The CDF plots of empirical data for E. coli in greenhouse irrigation water and
    Pseudomonas in greenhouse soil are shown in Fig. 1 with raw data presented in
    Table S1 (Supplementary Information). The values were left-truncated at ½ of the
    detection limit for measurements below the detection limit (Table S1) before Monte

    functions (CDFs) of the empirical data collected from fields. The histograms are
    the simulated results of empirical random sampling (10,000 values) used for and
    in the exposure models. Gray and red represent concentrations of total E. coli
    and AR-E. coli, respectively; Blue and green represent total Pseudomonas and AR-Pseudomonas,
    respectively. Both the measured data and simulated concentrations span several
    orders of magnitude. The fraction of ARB ( ) was low in most of the cases: less
    than 0.20 in ca. 60 % of the data for Pseudomonas measured in soil, and less than
    0.20 in ca. 75 % of the data for E. coli in water. The simulated total bacteria
    and ARB concentrations were paired to provide for estimation of the extinction
    probability of ARB and ASB during infection, bounded at a maximum . The results
    of annual infection risk from E. coli through consumption of raw tomatoes are
    shown in Fig. 2. The quantitative risk is illustrated as the median with shaded
    areas for 50, 75, and 95 % confidence intervals for the 10,000 iterations as they
    change with the residual antibiotic concentration, . As expected, in the presence
    of the trace amounts of antibiotic in the body ( ), the overall risk of infection
    decreases, as the likely exposure dose is a mixture of both ASB and ARB. However,
    as illustrated by the change from black to red of the median risk line (Fig. 2),
    the infection outcome also changes from antibiotic treatable (black) to antibiotic
    untreatable (red). In other words, at higher sublethal antibiotic concentrations
    C, any bacteria that survive and go on to cause infection are more likely to be
    ARB. This is represented in all three greenhouse scenarios in Fig. 2. Download

    Median annual risk of enteropathogenic E. coli infection (solid line) through
    consumption of raw tomatoes irrigated with RWW for each of the three greenhouses.
    The 50, 75, and 95 % confidence intervals are shown as gray shaded areas from
    dark to light. The transition from black to red in the solid line indicates the
    transition of infection outcome from antibiotic treatable to antibiotic untreatable
    as the antibiotic concentration in human body varies from 0 to 0.3 mg/L. In general,
    the annual risk of infection values for all the greenhouses complies with the
    WHO/USEPA recommended level (< 10−4) highlighting the safe consumption of tomatoes
    irrigated with RWW. No significant differences in the annual risk of infection
    for greenhouses 2 and 3 were observed, while the annual risk of infection for
    the greenhouse 1 fell to 0 or near 0 for all simulations due to low detections
    of E. coli (Fig. 1) and far lower concentrations of pathogenic strains after inactivation.
    Similar results are illustrated in Fig. 3 for annual risk of severe eye infection
    (eye ulceration) due to exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the soil through
    hand-to-eye contact during farming. A low annual risk of eye-infection below 10−4
    with the median risk plateauing around 10−7 to 10−6 for C > 0 mg/L was observed.
    Again, the overall risk is the highest when C = 0, but as it is reduced by antibiotic,
    the infection is more likely to be untreatable by said antibiotic. The risk plateaued
    at antibiotic concentration ca. 0.05 mg/L which is much sooner than E. coli risk
    which plateaued at antibiotic concentration approaching ca. 0.2 mg/L, indicating
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa eye-infection through soil exposure is more sensitive to
    trace amounts of antibiotic in the human body and so more easily treated. Download

    concentration in human body varies from 0 to 0.1 mg/L. 4. Discussion This QMRA
    study investigated two likely and unique scenarios of exposure to pathogens in
    RWW used to irrigate tomato crops in greenhouses. The outcomes of the study showed
    that annual infection risk for enteropathogenic E. coli was very low, less than
    10−9 in the absence of antibiotics, especially as compared with other QMRA studies
    for viral risks associated with consumption of RWW irrigated produce. This result
    suggests that RWW irrigation for tomatoes is within the acceptable risk threshold
    (< 10−4) if AR is not included into the consideration. Comparison of the risk
    outcomes from three greenhouses, each adopted a different RWW management practice,
    showed that G1 had the lowest risk because G1 had the lowest E. coli concentrations
    (Fig. 1). Although the irrigation water was originated from the same RWW, only
    G1 did not store the RWW in open ponds. The higher bacterial concentrations found
    in G2 and G3 irrigation water may be due to the regrowth of E. coli or recontamination
    of RWW by wildlife during storage in open ponds. This result indicates that direct
    application of RWW from treatment facility is the safest practice. Onsite storage
    can increase the bacterial concentration and therefore the risks. Moreover, the
    negative impact of storage was not completely diminished when blending the storage
    water with groundwater as shown in the case of G3. This comparison highlights
    the importance of considering water quality at point of end-use not only at the
    point of RWW discharge although the results obtained indicated an acceptable risk
    threshold for all three water management options. The higher risk outcomes reported
    in previous QMRA studies for consumption of vegetable irrigated with RWW are mainly
    focused on pathogenic human viruses (Gonzales-Gustavson et al., 2019; Mok et al.,
    2014). Human norovirus in RWW presented the highest risk for consumers with risk
    level at ca. for annual consumption of lettuce (Gonzales-Gustavson et al., 2019).
    Not only the concentration of the target pathogen plays a critical role in the
    risk outcome, but also the unique dose-response relationship that is applicable
    to each hazard is critically important. A much lesser dose of a virus, for example,
    could correlate with a higher probability of illness than an equal-or-greater
    dose of a bacteria. One example is the exponential dose-response model for enterovirus
    in which a dose of viruses represent a 50 % probability of response, while the
    same probability requires a dose of CFU E. coli (Cliver, 1981). Moreover, none
    of the previous QMRA studies used viral pathogen data measured directly in irrigation
    water. The viral pathogen concentrations were estimated using the viral concentration
    in the untreated wastewater with estimated pathogen reduction through engineering
    treatment processes and decay through water distribution (Hamilton et al., 2006).
    Using empirical data collected directly from irrigation water at the point-of-use,
    as carried out in the current study, represents the most creditable data of hazard
    concentration in QMRA. Another contribution of the higher risk estimations in
    previous QMRA studies is the type of fresh vegetable used in the exposure pathway
    analysis. The choice of vegetables that are consumed raw for possible contamination
    is apparent, with leafy greens, cucumber, and tomato being the most common. These
    vegetables differ in amount consumed per year, by region, and by age group, but
    one remarkably variable parameter is the amount of water holding for each respective
    vegetable. The reported value for water holding on lettuce leaves (mL/g) is 0.108,
    while for cucumbers it is around 0.0036 (Hamilton et al., 2006; Shuval et al.,
    1997), and for tomatoes it is estimated as 0.00016 (Oron et al., 2015). The ability
    of leafy vegetables to hold more water lends them to better transport pathogens
    from the farm to the consumer. The orders-of-magnitude difference in the mass
    of water holding per mass of vegetable is reflected in the reduction of risk for
    the smoother and highly hydrophobic surfaces of cucumber and tomato plants (this
    study), ultimately due to a large disparity in the final dose the consumer may
    be exposed (Mok et al., 2014). The Pseudomonas exposure model was conducted to
    highlight the possible health risks for workers in the greenhouses in addition
    to the consumers. Research in this area is significantly lacking in comparison
    with consumer-focused risk analysis. Farm workers can be exposed directly to pathogens
    in soil during planting, plant defoliation and secondary stems removal through
    the observed high rates of hand-to-soil and then hand-to-mouth contacts (Antwi-Agyei
    et al., 2016). The prevalence of Pseudomonas spp. and AR- Pseudomonas spp. in
    the greenhouse soil motivated the hand-to-eye model in this study for a severe
    eye infection (or eye ulceration) as endpoint. However, it is important to note
    that the Pseudomonas spp. and AR-Pseudomonas load detected in all three greenhouses
    cannot be only attributed to the water-soil transfer after irrigation with RWW.
    Manure of soils is a common practice in the intensive greenhouse agriculture and
    several studies reported the enrichment of Pseudomonas spp. and AR-Pseudomonas
    in soils after manure treatment even at higher concentrations that those detected
    in this study (Udikovic-Kolic et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2014). Therefore, the
    calculated risks for farmers include all sources of Pseudomonas spp. in soil and
    are not only those attributed to RWW irrigation. Although the outcomes of this
    analysis indicate higher annual risk probabilities to farmers/workers from soils
    than the consumer risk for tomato consumption in all three greenhouses, it is
    important to point out that conservative conditions which can overestimate the
    related risk were adopted in the soil risk scenario. These conditions include
    considering the maximum numbers of days per year with soil contact (5 days/year),
    and assuming no preventive measures such as handwashing or the use of Personal
    Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves or eyes protection. Overall, the results
    indicate that eye infection risk from soil exposure does not have to be directly
    related to irrigation with RWW and that the overall risk can be drastically decreased
    if preventive measures like education/ training on hygiene and PPE are adopted.
    This study is the first application of the novel Simple-Death dose-response model
    to field data for assessing the risk of antibiotic resistant infections. This
    study demonstrates that while using this new type of dose-response models introduces
    new variables, it does not fundamentally change how a QMRA is conducted, yielding
    results comparable to that of a “traditional” exponential or beta-Poisson dose-response
    model (See Supplementary Information Fig. S2). The risk outcome (annual risk)
    is the same when there is no antibiotic present in the host body, results that
    validate the Simple-Death dose-response model. The development of infections that
    are untreatable by antibiotics depends on the trace level of antibiotic in the
    human host. There is a critical antibiotic concentration for the transition from
    a treatable to an untreatable infection and the critical antibiotic concentration
    for such transition varies from one pathogen to another. The trace level of antibiotic
    in human host could be from food, water, or past use of antibiotic for treatment
    of infection. There have not been reports of trace level of antibiotic in human
    body except the dose in the days following antibiotic treatment. The clinical
    study, however, suggests that antibiotics are rapidly clearing out after antibiotic
    therapy, but residual level of antibiotic has not been measured and cannot be
    discarded (Legrand et al., 2008). In this study, the antibiotic concentration
    C was varied at low concentrations to demonstrate its impact on the results. Therefore,
    the overall results of this study indicate that high concentration of pathogen
    exposure and high fraction of ARB increase the overall risk of infection, while
    the residual concentration of antibiotic in human system impact the transition
    from antibiotic treatable to antibiotic untreatable infection. 5. Conclusions
    A Simple-Death dose-response model for ARB was applied to two different exposure
    models for QMRA for the first-time using field data of E. coli, AR- E. coli, Pseudomonas
    and AR- Pseudomonas in water and soil collected from three greenhouses that adopted
    RWW for irrigation. The following conclusions are made based on the outcomes of
    this study: • The risk outcome (annual risk) from Simple-Death dose-response model
    yields the same results of a “traditional” exponential or beta-Poisson dose-response
    model when there is no antibiotic present in the host body. • The overall risks
    of E. coli infection through tomato consumptions are low and within the recommended
    values in all three greenhouses regardless of water management practices. • Onsite
    storage of RWW has the potential to increase the overall E. coli infection risk
    through consumption of tomatoes. • The development of antibiotic resistant infection
    is highly sensitive to the concentration of trace amount of antibiotics in human
    body and varies from one pathogen to another. Although the trace antibiotic concentration
    in human host can lower the overall infection risk, their presence significantly
    increases the risk of developing infections that are not treatable by antibiotic
    therapy. • Preventive/hygiene measures should be promoted among farmworkers to
    reduce the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant eye-infection. • The policy
    guidelines for water reuse in agriculture irrigation should include a new threshold
    of antibiotic resistant infections for better human health protection. CRediT

  description: Pathogenic microorganisms can cause infection, sepsis, and other diseases
    in humans. Although municipal wastewater plants are important sources and sinks
    for potential pathogenic microorganisms, data on rural wastewater treatment processes
    are limited. The proximity of rural wastewater facilities to human settlements
    and the trend toward wastewater resourcing could pose risks to humans. Here, a
    typical village in southern China was selected to analyze potential pathogenic
    microorganisms in wastewater, sewage sludge, and aerosols during the collection,
    treatment, and discharge of domestic wastewater. The succession characteristics
    and concentration variations of potential pathogenic microorganisms throughout
    the wastewater treatment process were identified using high-throughput sequencing
    and culture methods. Bacteria-associated health risks in facility aerosols were
    estimated based on average daily dose rates from inhalation and dermal exposure.
    Lower amounts of pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungi were detected in the
    effluent of the 1-ton treatment scale and the 10-ton treatment scale facilities,
    compared to those in the influent. Pathogen effluent concentrations were significantly
    lower than influent concentrations after treatment in rural wastewater facilities.
    16 and 29 potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi were detected in aerosols from
    wastewater treatment facilities, respectively. Furthermore, the potential pathogen
    concentrations were higher than those in the background air. Aerobic units are
    the main source of pathogen emissions from aerosols. There were 42 potential pathogenic
    bacteria and 34 potential pathogenic fungi in the sewage sludge. Biochemical units
    were the main source of potential pathogens in sewage sludge, and more potential
    airborne pathogens originated from wastewater. In rural wastewater resourcing
    processes with greater pollutant exposure, the effluent of rural wastewater treatment
    facilities (WWTFs), downstream rivers, and facility aerosols, could be important
    potential sources of microbial risk. Inhalation is the main pathway of human exposure
    to airborne bacteria. Therefore, more attention should be focused on microbiological
    risk in rural wastewater treatment processes.

    Rural wastewaterBioaerosolsSewage sludgePotential pathogensExposure risk 1. Introduction
    Approximately 510 million people live in rural areas of China by 2021, representing
    36.11 % of China''s total population (Xing et al., 2022). In 2022, about 34 billion
    tons of sewage were discharged in China''s rural areas. With the implementation
    of China''s rural revitalization policy, the rural sewage treatment rate has exceeded
    20 % (Sheng et al., 2020). Rural domestic wastewater is characterized by its dispersion
    and the instability of wastewater quality and quantity, being unsuitable for centralized
    treatment (Huang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). The wastewater from rural households
    is usually collected by simple pipelines and flows into decentralized sewage treatment
    facilities next to the farmers’ residence, and the effluent is discharged directly
    into the nearby waters, which is the common wastewater treatment model in rural
    areas. In response to China''s dual-carbon policy, the on-site requirements for
    sewage resourcing have increased. Currently, some simple ecological wastewater
    treatment systems are commonly used for decentralized treatment of domestic wastewater
    from rural households in Europe, the United States and other developed countries,
    without the disinfection if there are no special water requirements (Otter et
    al., 2020). In China, the disinfection of rural wastewater is not yet mandated
    by current regulations, thus rural wastewater is often discharged without disinfection.
    Consequently, the short collection process, relatively simple treatment methods,
    treatment facilities in close proximity to living quarters, often without disinfection
    and on-site discharge and resourcing may increase the risk of microbial exposure
    to residents from the rural wastewater treatment process. Many pathogenic microorganisms
    are present in wastewater (Wéry et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2020). Escherichia
    coli, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas, etc. among bacteria, Aspergillus fumigatus,
    and Candida, etc. among fungi, norovirus, sapovirus, and enteric adenovirus, etc.
    among viruses, are common pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater that can cause
    diarrhea, respiratory system diseases, infections of the upper respiratory tract,
    and gastrointestinal diseases in humans under certain conditions (Greer et al.,
    2009; Levantesi et al., 2012; Millner et al., 1977; Shingare et al., 2019; Zheng
    et al., 2020). Some pathogenic bacteria and viruses have been found in several
    units of WWTPs (Lv et al., 2006; Osuolale and Okoh 2017; Wen et al., 2009). Furthermore,
    a certain amount of pathogenic or potential pathogenic microorganisms have been
    detected in aerosols of urban WWTPs (Han et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019a). Some
    potential pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptomyces
    have been widely reported in aerosols of urban WWTPs (Uhrbrand et al., 2017; Yang
    et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019b). Yang et al (2019c) showed that several pathogenic
    microorganisms were found in WWTP aerosols at a concentration of 71–2566 CFU/m3.
    Sewage sludge also contains several pathogenic microorganisms (Romdhana et al.,
    2009; Suarez et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2022). Bacteria, such as E. coli with
    concentrations as high as 4–6 log MPN/g dry matter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with
    around 2.2 × 108 copies/g, and Salmonella with concentrations of 102–104 MPN/100
    mL, respectively, have been reported in the sewage sludge of WWTPs (Gantzer et
    al., 2001; Guzmán et al., 2007; Wéry et al., 2008; Zhan et al., 2022). Domestic
    wastewater with rich nutrients provides brilliant living conditions for potential
    pathogens (Kristian Stevik et al 2004; Ribeirinho-Soares et al., 2022). Pathogenic
    microorganisms in rural wastewater treatment processes may pose a greater risk
    to human health and the surrounding environment due to the requirements for sewage
    and sludge resources, simpler treatment processes, presence of pathogenic microorganisms,
    and proximity to villagers. However, basic data on pathogenic microorganisms in
    rural wastewater treatment processes are lacking and the consequential risks are
    unclear. Therefore, in this study, a typical village in southern China was selected
    to investigate the characteristics, concentrations, sources, and risks posed by
    potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi in wastewater, sewage sludge, and aerosols
    during the collection, treatment, and discharge of rural domestic wastewater.
    Five common and potential harmful pathogenic microorganisms (total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae,
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fecal coliforms, and potential pathogenic fungi) were
    selected for incubation to characterize changes in the concentrations of potential
    pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater and bioaerosols during wastewater treatment.
    The primary objectives of our research included: 1) Determining the potential
    pathogens genera and the specific pathogens concentration; 2) Analyzing the sources
    of pathogens present in aerosols and sewage sludge; 3) Assessing the microbiological
    risk associated with effluent and the exposure risk to airborne bacteria in treatment
    facilities. This study aims to provide a theoretical basis and scientific data
    on the level, impact, control of microbial risks and the establishment of methods
    to block the spread of pathogenic microorganisms in the rural wastewater treatment
    process. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area This study was conducted in
    a village in Shanghai, China (Fig. 1). The study area is typical of rural areas
    in southern China, with a well-developed water supply and wastewater network,
    as well as well-operated and well-maintained wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs).
    There are 18 decentralized and integrated WWTFs buried underground, enclosed,
    regularly maintained, and cleaned of sewage sludge every 6 months. Sewage sludge
    was collected and transported out of the villages by sludge trucks for centralized
    treatment. Fig. 1 illustrates the service area and distribution of the WWTFs;
    they are considerably close to residential areas, approximately 2–15 m from residential
    houses. Among these WWTFs, 14 (number 1–14) were designed for a scale of 1 t to
    serve an average of 3–7 households, and (number 15–18) were designed for a scale
    of 10 t to serve 40–50 households. The influent of all facilities primarily consisted
    of domestic sewage with no industrial wastewater, treated using conventional anoxic
    and aerobic (AO) processes, characteristic of rural China. The treated effluent
    was discharged directly into a nearby river without disinfection and used as potential
    agricultural irrigation water. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download

    from two WWTFs with different capacities in Autumn (October, 2021): WWTF-1t (number
    14 in Fig. 1) with a 1 t capacity, treating domestic wastewater from six households
    and WWTF-10t (number 16 in Fig. 1) with a 10 t capacity, treating domestic wastewater
    from 43 households. Twelve water sampling points (including one upstream of the
    river), two sludge sampling points, and four air sampling points (including one
    ambient air sampling point) were established in the wastewater treatment area
    (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (121KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. The distributions of the sampling sites. Water samples were collected
    from the inlet pipe, facility influent, anaerobic unit, aerobic unit, facility
    effluent, upstream and downstream of the river. Additionally, sludge samples were
    collected from mixed sewage sludge at the bottom of the facility. All samples
    were collected in sterile bottles, transported to the laboratory on ice, and stored
    at −20 ℃ until further analysis. Air samples were collected from farmers'' toilets,
    inlet pipe maintenance points, anaerobic units, aerobic units, and upwind. The
    total suspended particle (TSP) samples were collected using a medium-flow sampler
    (TH-150, Tianhong, Wuhan, China) fitted with quartz membranes (90 mm, Whatman
    QM-A). Before sampling, the membranes were heated in a muffle furnace at 500 ℃
    for 4.5 h to remove organic compounds and the membrane holders were cleaned with
    75 % ethanol before sampling (Yang et al., 2019a). Medium-flow samplers were used
    to collect the TSP samples continuously for 8 h at a constant flow rate of 100
    L/min and 1.5 m above the ground (the average height of human breathing) (Mainelis
    et al., 2005). After sampling, the membranes were removed from the samplers and
    stored in a sterile environment at −20 ℃ until further analysis. A six-stage Andersen
    Cascade Impactor with 400 holes in each sieve plate (228–9530 K, SKC Gulf Coast,
    Inc. USA) was used to collect culturable bioaerosols at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min
    over 3 min. The aerodynamic cut-size diameters from stage 1 to 6 are >7.00, 4.70–7.00,
    3.30–4.70, 2.10–3.30, 1.10–2.10, and 0.65–1.10 μm (Andersen 1958). Aerosol particles
    with an aerodynamic diameter of < 3.30 μm are defined as respirable fragments
    (RFs) (Uhrbrand et al., 2017). The sampler was sterilized with 75 % ethanol after
    each sampling. Two parallel samples were collected at each point. To measure bacterial
    bioaerosols, nutrient agar plates were incubated at 37 ± 1 ℃ for 48 h after sampling
    (Li et al., 2013). The culturable fungal bioaerosols were incubated at 37 °C for
    48 h after sampling on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) plates (Scognamiglio et al.,
    2010). MacConkey agar was used to sample Enterobacteriaceae in bioaerosols, the
    sampled Enterobacteriaceae were incubated at 30–35 °C for 24 h, Pseudomonas CN
    agar was used for Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were incubated at 36 ± 1℃ for 48
    h (Brandi et al., 2000). MFC agar was used to culture fecal coliform at 44.5 ℃
    for 24 h (Maheux et al., 2011). The number of colonies counted after incubation
    was used to determine the concentration of culturable bioaerosols, expressed as
    colony-forming units per unit volume (CFU/m3). During air sampling, temperature
    and relative humidity were measured using a dew-point thermohygrometer (WD-35612,
    OAKTON, Germany). Wind speed was measured using a portable anemometer (HD2303,
    Delta OHM, Italy). Solar radiation was measured using an irradiance meter (HD2302.0,
    Delta OHM, Italy). The meteorological conditions recorded at each sampling point
    are presented in Table S1. 2.3. Analytical methods 2.3.1. Microbial analysis The
    microbial communities in airborne, wastewater, and sludge samples were analyzed
    using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. The microorganisms in aerosol
    and wastewater/sludge were enriched by PES membrane disc filter and using the
    Power Soil® DNA Isolation Kit (MoBIo, Carlsbad, USA). The V3 and V4 regions of
    bacterial 16S rRNA were amplified by PCR using primers 338F and 806R. The ITS1
    and ITS4 regions of fungal 18S rRNA were amplified by PCR using primers ITS1 and
    ITS4. The PCR conditions and procedures were as described by Yang et al. (2019a).
    The PCR products were pooled, purified using the Axyprep DNA Gel Extraction Kit
    (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA), and quantified using QuantiFluor™-ST
    (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) (Han et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). High-throughput
    sequencing was conducted by the Illumina MiSeq platform (Majorbio, Shanghai, China).
    Raw sequencing reads were de-multiplexed and filtered using QIIME (version 1.9.1).
    Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered by UPARSE (version 7.1, http://drive5.com/uparse/)
    with 97 % similarity (Edgar, 2013). 2.3.2. Chemical analysis The physicochemical
    properties of the water samples are described in Fig. S1. The pH of the water
    phase was determined through a pH meter with a glass electrode (INESA, China).
    The suspended substance (SS) was measured by filtering the water samples through
    a microfiltration membrane and drying to a constant weight at 105 °C. The COD,
    TN, NH3N, and TP were determined using the Hach method with a spectrophotometer
    (HACH DR 2800, HACH, Loveland, CO, USA), and specific testing steps are shown
    in Table S2. 2.4. Exposure risk assessment The exposure rates and risk assessment
    of airborne bacteria were estimated based on US EPA guidelines (USEPA, 1999).
    The ADD through inhalation and skin (ADDinhalation, ADDdermal) can be calculated
    using Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) (2) Where ADDinhalation and ADDskin represent the
    average daily doses of exposure by inhalation and skin contact [CFU/(kg.d)], respectively;
    C indicates the airborne bacterial concentration (CFU/m3); IR is the inhalation
    rate (m3/d); EF is the exposure frequency (d/yr); EDinhalation and EDskin refer
    to the contact time through inhalation and skin contact (yr), respectively; SA
    is the surface area of skin contact (m2); ABS is the dermal absorption factor
    (m/h), ABS = 0.001 for bacteria; AF is the skin adherence factor; BW is the body
    weight (kg); and AT is the average lifetime (d). Airborne bacteria are noncarcinogenic,
    and the noncancer risks of exposure through inhalation and skin contact were assessed
    using Eqs. (3) and (4). (3) (4) Where HQ is the hazard quotient and HI is the
    hazard index, representing the sum of the risks of each contaminant from multiple
    exposure pathways. RfD is the reference dose [CFU/(kg.d)], representing the maximum
    acceptable daily dose of a substance. And the reference dose of 500 CFU/m3 was
    used according to the recommendations of the Bioaerosols Committee of the American
    Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), which suggests that
    the concentration of cultivable bacterial exposure should not exceed 500 CFU/m3
    on a working day (Yang et al., 2019b). HQ < 1 or HI < 1 indicates that risks can
    be ignored, whereas HQ > 1 or HI > 1 indicates that potential adverse health risks
    are a concern (Chen and Carter, 2017). All parameters in Eqs. (1) and (2) are
    summarized in Table S3. 2.5. Statistical analysis Changes in the concentrations
    of potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater and aerosols were mapped
    using Origin 2019b. The heatmap was used to show the distribution characteristics
    of potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater, sewage sludge, and aerosols.
    The similarity and spatial distribution of potential pathogenic microorganisms
    were analyzed using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). SourceTracker (https://github.com/danknights/sourcetracker)
    was used to track microbial sources based on a Bayesian algorithm (Wang et al.,
    2017). Heatmaps, PCoA, and SourceTracker analyses were conducted using R Studio

    in the wastewater treatment process 3.1.1. Potential pathogenic microorganisms
    in wastewater and sewage sludge during the wastewater treatment process The bacteria
    collected from AnaU-10t had the highest species richness (Table S4), whereas the
    highest species richness of fungal genera (Table S4) was in Eff-10t. The PCoA
    (Fig. 8a, b) indicated a distinct variation in the bacterial and fungal communities
    in wastewater/sludge observed in WWTF-1t and WWTF-10t. Trichococcus and Enterococcus
    were the dominant bacterial genera in Inf-1t and Inf-10t, respectively (Fig. 3a).
    Thiothrix and Limnohabitans were the key bacterial genera in Eff-1t and Eff-10t,
    respectively. The predominant bacterial genera were Acinetobacter and Streptococcus
    at IP-1t and IP-10t, respectively, Thiothrix and C39 at AnaU-1t and AnaU-10t,
    Thiothrix and Flavobacterium at AerU-1t and AerU-10t, Flavobacterium at the river
    downstream (RD), Novosphingobium at the river upstream (RU), Thiothrix and norank_f_Saprospiraceae

    Potential pathogenic fungal genera. Cladosporium and Cutaneotrichosporon were
    the dominant fungal genera in Inf-1t and Inf-10t, respectively; unclassified_p_Rozellomycota
    and unclassified_k_Fungi were the key fungal genera in Eff-1t and Eff-10t, respectively.
    The main fungal genera were unclassified_k_Fungi and unclassified_p_Rozellomycota
    at IP-1t and IP-10t, respectively, unclassified_p_Rozellomycota at AnaU-1t and
    AerU-1t. Didymella in RU and unclassified_k_Fungi in AerU-10t, AnaU-10t, RD, SS-1t,
    and SS-10t. Hence, a change in the dominant wastewater bacterial and fungal genera
    occurred across units, suggesting microbial succession throughout the wastewater
    treatment process. A comparison with the pathogen database revealed 66 and 45
    potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi in wastewater and, 42 and 34 in sewage
    sludge (Fig. 3c, d) (Woolhouse et al., 2012). Furthermore, 52 potential pathogenic
    bacteria with a total relative abundance of 2.96 % and 35 potential pathogenic
    fungi with a total relative abundance of 5.62 % were detected in the effluent,
    exceeding that in the upstream and downstream. Potential pathogens in wastewater
    also undergo succession during the process, potentially due to the different adaptabilities
    and nutritional competitiveness of pathogens to various treatment units. The dominant
    potential pathogenic bacteria in wastewater were Bacteroides at Inf-1t, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1
    at Eff-1t, Enterococcus at Inf-10t, Leptospira at Eff-10t, Acinetobacter at IP-1tand
    RD, Pseudomonas at AnaU-1t and AerU-1t, Streptococcus at IP-10t, Mycobacterium
    at SS-1t and SS-10t, RU. The predominant bacterial genera in AnaU-10t and AerU-10t
    were Leptospira (relative abundances: 1.65 % and 1.70 %, respectively). While
    some studies found Arcobacter, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Salmonella, and Yersinia
    were mainly present at the influent of WWTPs, Aeromonas, Vibrio Arcobacter, and
    Streptococcus were predominant pathogens in effluent of WWTPs, Enterococcus and
    Bacteroides dominated sewage sludge from WWTPs, of which predominant pathogenic
    bacteria was different from that in WWTFs (Huang et al., 2020; Kristensen et al.,
    2020; Wardi et al., 2023). Cladosporium and Trichoderma were the major pathogenic
    fungi in Inf-1t and Eff-1t, respectively, and Trichoderma and Engyodontium in
    Inf-10t and Eff-10t, respectively. Cladosporium predominated at AnaU-1t, AnaU-10t,
    AerU-10t and RU, Trichoderma at AerU-1t, RD and SS-10t, Scedosporium at IP-1t,
    Alternaria at SS-1t, Rhodotorula at IP-10t, respectively, of which dominant genera
    in the wastewater treatment process was more stable compared to pathogenic bacteria.
    While Olpidium and Paecilomyces have been identified as key pathogenic fungal
    genera in WWTP sewage, which was inconsistent with the findings of rural wastewater
    treatment facilities (Assress et al., 2019). 3.1.2. Potential pathogenic microorganisms
    in the bioaerosol The Chao index of bacteria in bioaerosols at each sampling site
    ranged from 22.50 to 64.75, lower than wastewater and sewage sludge, with the
    highest index observed at sampling site Bio-10t (Table S4). The Chao index of
    fungi in bioaerosols at each sampling site ranged between 76.00 and 302.50, with
    some higher than those in the wastewater units. The highest fungi Chao index was
    also observed at the Bio-10t sampling site, potentially due to the greater number
    of fungi in WWTF-10t, treating domestic wastewater generated by more farmers.
    The bacterial communities of Bio-1t and Bio-10t were similar, while the fungal
    communities were in variation (Fig. 8a, b). The dominant bacterial and fungal
    genera were Denitratisoma and unclassified_f_Didymellaceae at Bio-1t (Fig. 3).
    The predominant genera in the Bio-10t aerosols were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1
    and Cladosporium. Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12 and Aspergillus were the dominant
    genera in the farmer''s toilet (FH). The pathogen database revealed potential
    pathogenic bacterial (n = 16) and fungal (n = 29) genera in the air samples (Woolhouse
    et al., 2012). The most potential pathogenic bacterial genera (n = 12) were detected
    at Bio-10t (total abundance: 49.53 %), followed by Bio-1t, and BGG. The most potential
    pathogenic fungal genera (n = 22) were also detected at Bio-10t (total abundance:
    80.84 %), followed by Bio-1t, and BGG. This suggests that sufficient potential
    pathogens escape from WWTFs with more detected in larger facilities due to more
    aeration (Wang et al., 2019). Potential pathogens, such as Enterococcus, Acinetobacter,
    Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, etc., were identified in the air samples. It demonstrates
    that various pathogens dominated at different sampling sites, which may be due
    to the different compositions of the microbial community in the wastewater and
    surrounding air. The dominant potential pathogenic bacterial genera in the aerosols
    were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 at Bio-10t and FH, Corynebacterium at BBG, and
    Ralstonia at Bio-1t. Some studies have reported that in WWTPs, Mycobacterium and
    Bacillus were the dominant pathogens at aeration unit and anaerobic unit of A/A/O
    process, Staphylococcus was predominant potential pathogen at sequencing batch
    reactor (SBR), Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, and Arcobacter were the predominant
    potential pathogens at oxidation ditch of oxidation ditch (OD) processes, Arcobacter
    was the predominant potential pathogen at oxic tank of anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A/A/O),
    which were inconsistency with the results of this study (Yang et al., 2019a; Yang
    et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2019c). In our study, Schizophyllum was the dominant
    pathogenic fungi at Bio-1t, Aspergillus at FH, Cladosporium at Bio-10t and BGG.
    Meanwhile, Aspergillus was the dominant pathogenic genera in aerobic section of
    biochemical tank of WWTPs with A/A/O process (Wang et al., 2022). 3.2. Variation
    in concentration of potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater and aerosols
    during the wastewater treatment process Potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi
    are important indicators for assessing the microbiological safety of wastewater
    (Bradford and Segal. 2009; Ramirez et al., 2005). Herein, besides analyzing the
    relative abundance of potential pathogens in the wastewater treatment process,
    five common and harmful potential pathogenic microorganisms (total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae,
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fecal coliforms, and potential pathogenic fungi) were
    cultured and analyzed. 3.2.1. Concentration of potential pathogenic microorganisms
    in wastewater The total bacteria ranged from 2.50 × 105 to 1.35 × 108 CFU/L (Fig.
    4a); the highest concentration was obtained at Inf-1t, whereas the highest bacterial
    count during the process of WWTF-10t was detected at the influent unit as well,
    with about 1.20×108 CFU/L. The bacterial concentration in functional units (anaerobic
    and aerobic units) was lower than that in influent units (P < 0.01, ANOVA; Table
    S5), suggesting that the functional unit conditions may have an inhibitory effect
    on bacterial growth in WWTFs due to weaker nutritional competitiveness compared
    to other dominant genera or physical factors, such as dissolved oxygen concentration,
    etc. (Arora et al., 2021). The bacterial concentrations in effluent were lower
    than those of the influent. However, the concentration of bacteria in RD reached
    3.25 × 106 CFU/L, lower than the effluent but higher than the RU (Table 1). Download

    Pathogenic fungi concentration (CFU/L) 2.50×103 5.00×103 2.50×103 2.00×104 Enterobacteriaceae
    are a family of various gammaproteobacteria, including common (Klebsiella pneumoniae,
    E. coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter spp.) and rare (Proteus mirabilis and
    Raoultella planticola) human pathogens, which could contribute to serious nosocomial
    and community-onset bacterial infections in humans (Cooney et al., 2014; Espigares
    et al., 2006). The Enterobacteriaceae concentration in the process was between
    7.50 × 105 and 1.73 × 108 CFU/L. The Enterobacteriaceae detected in Inf-1t and
    Inf-10t were approximately 2.83 × 107 CFU/L and 3.10 × 106 CFU/L, respectively.
    The Enterobacteriaceae concentration in the aerobic unit was significantly lower
    than in the influent (P < 0.01, t-test; Table S6). Furthermore, the Enterobacteriaceae
    concentrations in the effluent were lower than in influent, demonstrating that
    the rural WWTFs have a reduction effect on the Enterobacteriaceae concentration.
    Although Enterobacteriaceae with 2.55 × 106 CFU/L at RD was lower than in the
    effluent, it was higher than RU (Table 1). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a motile,
    non-fermenting, gram-negative, rod-shaped, and blue-green pigmented pathogenic
    bacterium commonly found in wastewater, infecting humans and causing diseases
    such as pneumonia (Sathe et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2015). Throughout the wastewater
    treatment process, the concentration of P. aeruginosa ranged from 4.50 × 104 to
    2.10 × 106 CFU/L. The maximum concentration was obtained at Inf-1t, with approximately
    2.10 × 106 CFU/L, whereas the concentration of P. aeruginosa at Inf-10t was 1.65
    × 106 CFU/L. As the influent flowed through the anaerobic and aerobic units, there
    was a significant reduction in the concentration of P. aeruginosa (P < 0.01, ANOVA;
    Table S7). The value in the effluent of the facilities was lower than the influent.
    However, the concentration of RD was over 70 times higher than RU. Fecal coliforms
    are a threat to water biosecurity and an indicator of water pollution (Scott et
    al 2022). In this study, the fecal coliform concentration was between 2.50 × 103
    and 7.25 × 105 CFU/L. Inf-1t had the highest concentration of approximately 7.25
    × 105 CFU/L, and a concentration of 1.85 × 105 CFU/L was detected at Inf-10t.
    Fecal coliform concentrations in the anaerobic and aerobic units were significantly
    lower than in the influent (P < 0.05, ANOVA; Table S8). Furthermore, the value
    at Eff-1t was 9.25 × 103 CFU/L, whereas Eff-10t with 2.50 × 103 CFU/L was detected
    as the lowest value during the treatment process (Table 1). In this study, the
    fungi mainly included Candida and Aspergillus, which are potential pathogenic
    fungi that could cause human infections (Biedunkiewicz and Ozimek, 2009). The
    fungal concentration ranged from 2.50 × 103 CFU/L to 5.05 × 105 CFU/L and the
    concentration of influent at WWTF-1t and WWTF-10t was 7.50 × 104 CFU/L and 6.75
    × 104 CFU/L, respectively. Fungal concentrations in anaerobic and aerobic units
    were significantly lower than those in the influent (P < 0.01, ANOVA; Table S9).
    The concentrations of fungi in the effluents of WWTF-1t and WWTF-10t were 5.00
    × 103 CFU/L and 2.50 × 103 CFU/L, respectively. Moreover, the concentration of
    the RD was much higher than the RU (2.50 × 103 CFU/L), with 2.00×104 CFU/L (Table
    1). The concentrations of various pathogens in the effluent were significantly
    lower than those in the influent (P < 0.01, t-test; Table S10), indicating that
    the rural WWTFs have a certain reduction effect on the concentration of potential
    pathogens in wastewater (Srivastava and Chattopadhyay, 2022; Wen et al., 2009;
    Wéry et al., 2008). Additionally, the concentration of each potential pathogen
    in the RD was higher than in the RU, which may have been caused by the higher
    concentration of pathogens in the effluent. 3.2.2. Concentration of potential
    pathogenic microorganisms in bioaerosols Aerosol samples collected from the wastewater
    treatment process showed the highest concentration of bacteria in Aer-1t (≤ 3243
    CFU/m3), Enterobacteriaceae in Aer-1t (≤ 776 CFU/m3), P. aeruginosa in Ana-10t
    (≤ 1181 CFU/m3), fecal coliforms in Ana-1t (≤ 406 CFU/m3), and fungi in IP-1t
    (≤ 2717 CFU/m3) (Fig. 5). The results showed that the biological units of the
    facility were the main emission sources. The concentrations of selected microorganisms
    in Ana were lower than those in Aer, likely due to more bioaerosols being produced
    and released into the surrounding atmosphere during aeration (Wang et al., 2019).
    Moreover, the pathogen concentrations of FH, IP-1t, and IP-10t were all higher
    than for BG-1t and BG-10t, suggesting that the inlet pipes and toilet are potential
    sources of risk for potential pathogens escape in bioaerosols. Download : Download

    concentration and particle size distribution of potential microbial risk sources

    the figure indicate the proportion of respirable fragments (< 3.30 μm) and large
    particles (> 7.00 μm) in the bioaerosol particulate matter, respectively. Excluding
    P. aeruginosa, the concentrations of all other pathogens in Ana-1t and Aer-1t
    were higher than in the 10t facility, which may be due to the more pronounced
    inhibition of pathogenic bacterial growth in larger facilities with higher purification
    efficiency. The results also indicated that airborne particulate matter in the
    biological treatment unit of 1t and 10t facilities had RF concentrations and proportions
    of bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, fecal coliforms, and potential
    pathogenic fungi, accounting for ≥33 % of the corresponding concentrations of
    the selected airborne microorganisms. BBG showed lower RF concentrations and proportions
    than the biological treatment unit. Higher RF concentrations were detected in
    the FH than in BBG. The largest fraction (aerodynamic diameter > 7 µm) of the
    five airborne potential pathogens was found at all sampling sites. The percentage
    of the largest fraction of bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, fecal
    coliforms, and potential pathogenic fungi in the biological unit at the 1 t and
    10 t facilities was lower than the RF proportions (Fig. 5). Therefore, a higher
    risk of lower respiratory tract infections and inflammation may be associated
    with exposure to biological units of facilities. 3.3. Source allocation SourceTracker
    was used to analyze the sources of potential pathogens in aerosols, as well as
    potential pathogen sources in sewage sludge. The source proportions of aerosols
    from the WWTFs, corresponding wastewater, air, and unknown sources were 36.55
    %, 18.13 %, and 45.32 %, respectively, at WWTF-1t and 40.51 %, 19.08 %, and 40.41
    %, respectively, at WWTF-10t (Fig. 6). The unknown sources were likely surrounding
    plants, soil, and dust. The source proportions of sewage sludge from the WWTFs,
    corresponding biological units, influent, and unknown sources were 29.28 %, 36.55
    %, and 43.07 %, respectively, for WWTF-1t and 41.36 %, 25.33 %, and 33.31 %, respectively,
    for WWTF-10t. Unknown sources were likely air and effluent. The microbial populations
    in the WWTF-1t and WWTF-10t aerosols were dominated by microorganisms from sewage,
    whereas those in the sewage sludge were dominated by microorganisms from biological
    units (anaerobic and aerobic). The wastewater proportion of aerosols and the biological
    unit proportion of wastewater in WWTF-10t were higher than that in WWTF-1t, respectively.

    influent pathogens. The dominant potential pathogenic genera in the biological
    units were Pseudomonas, and Cladosporium. Most of the dominant species in air
    and wastewater were found among airborne potential pathogens, whereas numerous
    species in the influent and were also detected in the sewage sludge (Fig. 7).

    Fig. 7. Venn diagram showing potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater,
    bioaerosol, and sewage sludge. (a) Bacterial population; (b) Fungal population.
    As mentioned in Section 3.1, 66, 16, and 42 potential pathogenic bacterial genera
    were detected in wastewater, bioaerosols from facilities, and sewage sludge, respectively.
    For bacteria, 15 and 28 potential pathogenic genera in wastewater were shared
    with aerosols and sewage sludge, respectively, while 13 potential pathogenic bacteria
    in aerosols were shared with sewage sludge. Thirteen shared potential pathogenic
    bacteria were identified among them. Additionally, 16/66 potential pathogenic
    bacteria detected in bioaerosols were shared with the wastewater (Fig. 7). Peptostreptococcus
    was identified in bioaerosol but not in the wastewater and sewage sludge; therefore,
    it was probably contributed by surrounding soils, plants, and dry dust/material
    present in the ambient air of wastewater facilities (Uhrbrand et al., 2017). For
    fungi, 44, 25, and 34 potential pathogenic fungal genera were detected in wastewater,
    bioaerosols, and sewage sludge, respectively. And 23 and 33 potential pathogenic
    genera in wastewater were shared with aerosols and sewage sludge, respectively,
    while 20 potential pathogenic fungi in aerosols were shared with sewage sludge
    (Fig. 7). Twenty potential pathogenic fungi were shared among them. Likewise,
    23/25 potential pathogenic bacteria detected in bioaerosols were shared with the
    wastewater. Myriodontium and Scopulariopsis were identified in bioaerosol but
    not in the wastewater and sewage sludge; therefore, they were probably contributed
    by the surroundings (Uhrbrand et al., 2017). Verticillium in the sludge was not
    detected in wastewater and facility bioaerosols, as they likely also originated
    in the surrounding environment, such as soil or plants. PCoA was used to illustrate
    the variation in potential pathogenic bacterial and fungal populations in wastewater,
    air, and sewage samples collected from different sampling sites. For pathogenic
    bacteria, the first two components, PCoA1 and PCoA2, explained 23.75 % and 15.00
    % of data variation, respectively (Fig. 8c). For pathogenic fungi, the first two
    components accounted for 26.75 % and 17.09 % of the variation, respectively (Fig.
    8d). A separation was observed between the wastewater samples collected from WWTF-1t
    and WWTF-10t. Sewage, air, and sludge samples from the same treatment facility
    clustered close to each other, indicating similar pathogen communities. Wastewater,
    airborne, and sewage sludge bacterial and fungal populations in samples collected
    from WWTF-1t differed greatly from those acquired from WWTF-10t, whereas these
    populations showed similarities in samples from the same facility. Download :

    genera; (d) Potential pathogenic fungal genera. 3.4. Risk assessment There were
    42 potential pathogenic bacteria (total relative abundance = 2.68 %) and 34 potential
    pathogenic fungi in the sewage sludge (total relative abundance = 1.53 %), respectively
    (Table 1). Since the sewage sludge of the facilities in this study was collected
    every 6 months and transported out for centralized treatment, with minimal exposure
    to residents, the microbial risks in the effluent and aerosols were primarily
    evaluated in this study. Potential pathogens in rural wastewater treatment process
    effluents and aerosols could directly or indirectly influence the environment
    and human health. Therefore, in this study, the microbial risk in wastewater and
    aerosols (e.g., bacteria) during rural wastewater treatment processes was evaluated.
    A total of 52 potential pathogenic bacteria (total relative abundance = 2.96 %)
    and 35 potential pathogenic fungi (total relative abundance = 5.62 %) were detected
    in the effluent, higher than in the RU (bacteria = 37, 2.04 %; fungi = 9, 0.03
    %) and RD (bacteria = 41, 16.71 %; fungi = 19, 11.99 %) (Table 1). Hence, more
    potential pathogens with higher relative abundances were detected downstream of
    the river than upstream, which could be influenced by effluent from the facilities.
    Fecal coliforms are an important bacterial indicator for evaluating microbiological
    indicators of wastewater. The effluent fecal coliform concentrations in WWTF-1t
    and WWTF-10t were 9.25 × 104 CFU/L and 2.50 × 103 CFU/L, respectively, which were
    higher than those in upstream and downstream. Furthermore, the effluent concentrations
    of total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pathogenic
    fungi were lower than the influent but higher than RU. Whereas the concentrations
    of the RD were higher than for RU. Therefore, it suggested that the higher values
    of potential pathogenic genera, relative abundance, and concentration in the river
    downstream compared to upstream could be caused by WWTF effluent, increasing the
    risk of pathogenic microorganism exposure in natural water bodies. However, several
    studies reported that the microbial diversity and the pathogen concentration of
    wastewater from WWTPs are decreased after disinfection. For instance, the Enterococci
    concentration decreased from 5.47–6.19 log10 CFU/100 mL to 0.18–1.53 log10 CFU/100
    mL after disinfection. Similarly, E. coli concentration, initially ranging from
    5.80 × 103 - 2.80 × 104 CFU/100 mL, experienced a substantial reduction of 1–4
    log10 following disinfection. Additionally, the presence of Staphylococcus aureus
    and Bacillus subtilis was notably diminished through UV or chlorine disinfection.
    These findings underscore the efficacy of disinfection in mitigating the microbial
    risks associated with effluent (Chen et al., 2023; Korajkic et al., 2022; Wang
    et al., 2023). Inhalation and skin contact with bacteria were the main pathways
    of exposure. The airborne risk to adult males and females during the maintenance
    of the WWTF was calculated from the perspective of bacteria. For both adult males
    and females, the health risks of airborne bacteria by inhalation were several
    orders of magnitude higher than those by skin contact (Fig. 9), suggesting that
    inhalation was the main pathway of airborne bacteria exposure, which is consistent

    The risk assessment results of each stage during rural wastewater treatment facilities.
    The HI inhalation of WWTF-10t (HImales = 2.50E+00>1; HIfemales = 2.42E+00>1) for
    both adult males and females was less than in WWTF-1t (HImales = 3.09E+00>1; HIfemales
    = 2.98E+00>1) (Fig. 9), suggesting non-negligible inhalation risks of WWTF with
    higher risks for adults in wastewater treatment of WWTF-1t. A similar phenomenon
    was observed at Aer-1t, and Aer-10t. At sites with high levels of airborne bacteria,
    such as Aer-1t and Aer-10t, health risks were higher. This may be due to intense
    aeration, causing more bacteria to escape into the air. A previous study reported
    inhalation risks are significantly higher at aeration tanks with high airborne
    bacteria loads, suggesting that an outbreak of airborne bacteria at these sites
    would cause high-risk scenarios in the WWTPs, which is similar to the results
    of this study (Yang et al., 2019a). The highest HQ inhalation value was observed
    at the Aer-1t, followed by IP-1, Aer-10t, Ana-1t, Ana-10t, and IP-10t. As with
    WWTFs, the highest value of HQ-inhalation was also found at the aeration units
    of WWTP (Yang et al., 2019c). The HQ for males at Aer-1t and IP-1 was 1.13E+00,
    and 1.00E+00, respectively, and 1.09E+00 for females at Aer-1t was, suggesting
    that airborne bacteria exposure could cause adverse health effects for males and
    females at these sites. Yang et al. (2019b) found the HQ values of 1.98E+00, which
    was higher than that in Aer-1t, suggesting noncarcinogenic risks of bacteria in
    WWTP aeration units (Yang et al., 2019b). Microbial aerosols detected in the anaerobic
    and aerobic units of WWTFs indicated higher proportions of RF than BBG, suggesting
    an increased inhalation risk for WWTF workers. Moreover, the release risks of
    pathogens, such as Enterobacteriaceae, fungi, fecal coliforms, and Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa, from the WWTF were exigent, for which toxicity may be superimposed
    (Han et al., 2020). 4. Conclusions This study investigated the potential pathogens
    succession characteristics, concentration variation, source exploration, and risk
    assessment in rural wastewater treatment process in China. The main conclusions
    are as follows: The concentration of potential pathogenic genera in the effluent
    was significantly lower than in the influent after treatment by the rural wastewater
    facility; the river downstream could be affected by the effluent and be higher
    than river upstream. Rural wastewater treatment facility aerosols contained more
    potential pathogenic genera with a higher total relative abundance than the background
    air. The highest concentrations and the largest proportions of RF in aerosols
    were almost exclusively found in the anaerobic and aerobic units of rural WWTFs.
    The effluents of rural WWTFs could pose a potential microbiological risk to humans
    and the environment. For maintenance staff and residents, inhalation is the main
    pathway of exposure to airborne bacteria, and bioaerosols from WWTFs could pose
    potential health risks as well. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    Irrigation is the most significant consumer of freshwater worldwide. Deciding
    on the right amount of irrigation is crucial for sustainable water management
    and food production. The Penman-Monteith (P-M) reference crop evapotranspiration
    (ETO) is the gold standard in irrigation management and scheduling; however, its
    calculation requires measurements from multiple sensors over an extended reference

    surface green impedes having a dense network of ETO stations. To solve this challenge,
    this research aims to develop an input-limited ETO estimation approach based on
    historical weather data and machine learning (ML) algorithms to relax the need
    for a reference grass surface. This approach, called \"SolarET,\" takes solar
    radiation (RS) data as its sole input. RS is the only meteorological driving factor
    of ETO that does not rely on the measuring surface. To test the generalizability
    of SolarET, we test its performance over unseen arbitrary locations across California.

    the most significant anthropogenic alternation to the natural hydrological cycle,
    accounting for about 70% of the global freshwater withdrawal (Siebert et al.,
    2010, Foley et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2022). Population growth and economic
    development require increasing food production in the future, and expanding sustainable
    irrigation is essential to satisfy this burgeoning demand (Schmitt et al., 2022,
    Karimzadeh et al., 2024). Reference evapotranspiration (ETO) is a decisive factor
    for water resources management in weekly and monthly resolutions and for irrigation
    scheduling in daily intervals. A common approach for irrigation management is
    to adjust the daily ETO with crop- and growth stage-specific coefficients to determine
    the potential crop evapotranspiration (ETC) (Ji et al., 2017, Fernández, 2023).
    Under the hypothesis that the crop is fully irrigated and without any growth-limiting
    factors (biotic and abiotic factors), the volume of water lost by the crop should
    be topped up with irrigation water (Haghverdi et al., 2021). Anything more than
    this \"correct amount\" (non-consumptive water use) is considered unproductive
    as it will be lost by evaporation, runoff, or deep percolation, while anything
    less than this amount will develop water stress and potentially yield loss. Therefore,
    a realistic estimate of daily ETO is essential for sustainable water management
    and food production. The FAO 56 Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold standard
    of ETO calculation (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965, Allen et al., 1998). Compared
    to other empirical or semi-empirical equations, P-M is a physical-based equation
    that combines energy balance and mass transfer method and considers aerodynamic
    and surface resistance factors to calculate the evapotranspiration rate over a
    standardized cropped surface (Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, P-M requires a complete
    weather station (several sensors for measuring multiple parameters) to be installed
    over an extended reference grass surface to achieve reliable results. This surface
    should be homogeneously extended towards different directions (enough fetch) to
    satisfy the heat and vapor advection assumptions. Moreover, the grass should be
    well-watered to avoid any water stress. Meeting these conditions is troubling,
    especially where labor for maintenance is scarce or expensive, and land and water
    resources are limited, which is very common in agriculturally productive regions.
    Utilizing fertile land and scarce water and labor resources for weather stations
    is not appealing to growers and stakeholders. The other problem is the number
    of stations required for irrigation management. Due to the diversity of micro-climates
    in croplands, only a dense network of stations is practically helpful for irrigation
    management. To address the abovementioned challenges, this research aims to develop
    an ETO estimation approach that relaxes the need for a reference surface. ETO
    has four meteorological driving factors: solar radiation, air temperature, air
    humidity, and wind speed (Ahmadi et al., 2022). From these factors, solar radiation
    (Rs) is the only one that does not rely on surface characteristics, as it is a
    function of incoming solar energy only. Therefore, our approach called \"SolarET\"
    uses RS, which is measured with only one sensor (i.e., pyranometer) placed on
    any arbitrary surface as the sole input parameter. There are numerous input-limited
    alternatives for ETO estimation in the literature, ranging from empirical models
    (e.g., Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) to machine learning (ML) applications (e.g.,
    Chen et al., 2020). Almost all well-known empirical models were developed decades
    ago over restricted training data samples, sampling locations, and computational
    resources (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985). These methods
    tend to aggregate all un-measured inputs and uncertainties deterministically into
    one empirical coefficient, which might result in inaccurate results. Also, none
    of these methods rely only on solar radiation data. On the contrary, these methods
    need information on air temperature and humidity. Since this information is a
    function of the surface, the empirical equations cannot relax the need for the
    reference grass surface. Similarly, ML alternatives available in the literature
    take air temperature and humidity as their inputs and are not primarily focused
    on bypassing the reference surface (Chen et al., 2020, Dong et al., 2022, Kushwaha
    et al., 2022). Our proposed approach uses decision tree- and neural network-based
    ML regression models to estimate daily ETO with hourly and daily RS data. The
    ML models employed in this study have shown superior performance for similar regression
    problems based on the available literature and ML competitions (Rodriguez-Galiano
    et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2020, Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020, Zhangzhong et
    al., 2023). Contrary to the available ML methods for daily ETO forecasting, which
    use only daily meteorological inputs, this research leverages hourly RS inputs
    to take advantage of the information gained from this finer temporal resolution
    data. Another essential difference between SolarET and available ML-based alternatives
    for ETO estimation lies in its generalizability. Our test set consists of unseen
    weather stations to ensure SolarET''s generalizability and applicability to new
    arbitrary locations in California. In other words, we train our models on data
    collected from some stations/locations and then test them using a previously unseen
    dataset from new stations. We use California as the case study to evaluate the
    applicability of SolarET. California is one of the most hydrologically altered
    regions in the world (Zimmerman et al., 2018). California is also one of the most
    agriculturally productive regions on the planet, with heavy reliance on irrigation
    (Lobell and Bonfils, 2008, Tindula et al., 2013). Another reason California is
    a suitable case study for this research is the reliable, long-term data available
    from several weather stations in California (Ahmadi et al., 2023). To examine
    the performance of SolarET, we test it against Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestley-Taylor
    (PT), and Romanenko empirical models. HS and PT models are developed using California
    data and are widely used and highly trusted for ETO estimation (Tabari et al.,
    2013). Leveraging high temporal resolution data, cutting-edge regression algorithms,
    and big training data availability, we hypothesize that SolarET can outperform
    empirical alternatives without requiring surface-dependent inputs. In other words,
    we hypothesize that SolarET can surpass comparable methods in terms of prediction
    accuracy, cost-effectiveness, and generalizability. 2. Study area and dataset
    California was chosen as the case study of this research. It is one of the world''s
    most prominent agriculturally productive regions, heavily dependent on irrigation.
    According to the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), in an average
    year, approximately 9.6 million acres are irrigated with roughly 42 billion cubic
    meters of water. To assist irrigators in managing this immense water demand, DWR
    and the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) developed a program called
    the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) in 1982. CIMIS
    consists of over 145 automated weather stations that measure meteorological inputs
    of the Penman-Monteith equation in a standardized condition. Daily and hourly
    reports of ETO and its meteorological driving factors are publicly available on
    the CIMIS website (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). More information about the CIMIS
    program can be found on the CIMIS website. For this study, daily and hourly data
    on required variables from 131 active CIMIS stations are acquired. While some
    of those stations are located in research facilities, most are installed on private
    lands (often growers) where proper maintenance (mainly grass and fetch requirements)
    is a limiting factor. For this work, stations are chosen according to their condition
    and maintenance records, and problematic stations (e.g., stations with poor maintenance,
    inadequate or infrequent irrigation, and non-grass reference surface) are eliminated
    to ensure the quality of the input data. The train set consists of 114 stations.
    The train set data is acquired from January 1, 1995, to December 31, 2022 (i.e.,
    28 years of data). Although all the stations in the train set have data until
    the end of 2022 (i.e., they are active stations), their installation date varies,
    and some of them have been installed after 1995 and, therefore, have less than
    28 years of data. CIMIS divides California into 18 homogeneous climatic zones
    with similar meteorological and evapotranspiration characteristics. To test the
    applicability of the proposed methodology in estimating ETO at climatically diverse
    and unseen arbitrary locations, 17 stations, each representing a climatic zone,
    were chosen as the test set. Zone 11 is eliminated, as it does not have any reliable
    station. Names and characteristics of these climatic zones can be found in Table
    A1 in the appendix. Readers are referred to Ahmadi et al. (2022) for more information
    about these zones. To evaluate the generalizability of the proposed ML models,
    they have never been exposed to the test set, even for validation purposes. All
    the results reported in this paper represent the models'' performance on this
    unseen test set. To eliminate biases due to data length and climatic variability
    in longer time spans (e.g., wet or dry periods), the test set consists of data
    from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2022 (five years) for all stations. In total,
    19,088,736 hourly data records have been used in this study, with 18,447,984 records
    used as the training set and the remaining 640,752 records employed as the test
    set. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of training and testing stations across California.

    3.1. Reference evapotranspiration The Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation is the gold
    standard for calculating ETO (Penman, 1948, Monteith, 1965). CIMIS calculates
    ETO using the P-M equation version described in the American Society of Civil
    Engineering-Environmental Water Resources Institute paper (Allen et al., 2005).
    CIMIS does not use the daily meteorological variables and daily P-M equation to
    calculate daily ETO. It reports the summation of 24 hourly ETO values from midnight
    to midnight as the daily ETO. Ahmadi et al. (2022) showed that the summation of
    hourly ETO values results in similar outputs as using the daily P-M equation.
    CIMIS uses Eq. 1 to calculate hourly ETO (Allen et al., 1998, Allen et al., 2005,
    Walter et al., 2000, Pereira et al., 2015). (1) Where Cd (the ratio of bulk surface
    to aerodynamic resistance) is equal to 0.24 and 0.96 during daytime and nighttime,
    respectively. : standardized reference evapotranspiration (mm h−1), which approximates
    grass ET : the slope of saturation vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1) at mean air
    temperature (T) : net radiation (MJ m−2 h−1) estimated from solar radiation and
    other input variables : soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 h−1): G=0.1·Rn daytime
    and G=0.5·Rn nighttime : psychrometric constant (kPa°C−1) : mean hourly air temperature
    (°C) : mean hourly wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1) : saturation vapor pressure
    (kPa) at Ta : mean actual vapor pressure (kPa) from dew point temperature (°C),
    or relative humidity (%) and temperature (°C) : latent heat of vaporization (2.45
    MJ kg−1 for water temperature of 20 °C) This equation''s first and second fractions
    are the radiation and aerodynamic terms of the P-M equation. This research uses
    the daily ETO value reported by CIMIS (i.e., the summation of hourly values) as
    the target value or predictand of ML models. 3.2. Data preprocessing and feature
    selection To relax the need of reference surface to estimate ETO, this research
    uses only solar radiation data measured by a pyranometer as the input of ML models.
    This study uses hourly RS as input to leverage more detailed measurements and
    capture the variations in solar radiation during the day. Therefore, each sample
    consists of an input vector of size 24 and a target value, which is the daily
    ETO. To ensure the reliability of input data, all samples with zero RS values
    for daytime (i.e., from 8 AM to 5 PM) have been removed from the dataset. Therefore,
    of the 795,364 daily samples used in this study, 1224 samples were eliminated.
    As only 69 of these eliminated samples are from the test set, we hypothesized
    that this process would not bias the distribution of samples in the test set and
    the study results. To ensure the robustness of ML models and improve their accuracy,
    three data preprocessing steps were taken: 1) eliminating records with null values:
    Null values are removed from the dataset to ensure accuracy, eliminate inconsistencies,
    and transform the data into a suitable format for inputting into the models. This
    filtering removed 6752 records from the training set of ML models and 4830 records
    from the test set. 2) Eliminating records with ETO values higher than 15 mm/day:
    we hypothesize these values are due to sensor errors or poor maintenance conditions.
    This filtering resulted in the elimination of 10 records from the training set.
    3) Using robust scaler: While traditional scaling techniques such as min-max scaling
    or standard scaling rely on the mean and standard deviation of the data, robust
    scaling uses different statistics that are less sensitive to outliers. Specifically,
    it leverages the median and interquartile range (IQR) to scale the input data.
    By reducing the potential impact of extreme values on the performance of ML models,
    robust scaling helps to mitigate the influence of outliers in the input variables.
    Eq. 2 shows how scaled data records are calculated using the robust scaling method:
    (2) Where, as the names suggest, is the value before scaling, and is the median
    of the data distribution; is the value after scaling. and are the 75th quantile
    and 25th quantile of the data distribution, respectively. Two strategies are employed
    for selecting the inputs of ML models. In the first strategy, all zero RS values
    (i.e., nighttime) have been substituted with the daily mean RS value. In this
    strategy, which is called \"mean substitution,\" each input record for the ML
    models has 24 features. To implicitly capture the daylight period, the mean daily
    RS is calculated as the sum of all hourly RS values divided by the number of non-zero
    RS values. This procedure differs from calculating daily RS, where 24 is the denominator.
    As the second strategy, we used feature selection methods to assign quantitative
    feature importance measures to each hour (i.e., each feature). In this strategy,
    only the most essential features are used as the input to train the models. To
    analyze the model performance under different feature selection strategies, we
    used correlation-based (Pearson and Spearman), information-based (Mutual Information),
    and intrinsic (CatBoost) feature selection strategies. To compare the use of hourly
    RS values against coarser temporal resolution inputs, we also tested using daily
    RS as input. In the case of daily Rs, we used a sine function of Julian date as
    the second feature to capture the seasonality. Using a sine function of the Julian
    date has merits over using the raw Julian date, as it can simulate the cyclic
    nature of input records (Eq. 3). (3) Where is the Julian date and is the cyclic
    Julian date value used as the second feature along with daily RS for the daily
    ML models. 3.2.1. Pearson correlation The Pearson correlation coefficient or Pearson''s
    \"r\" measures the linear correlation between two data sets or two random variables.
    It is a normalized measure of covariance, and therefore, its value is always between
    −1 and 1, while 1 shows the perfect positive linear correlation and −1 indicates
    the perfect negative linear correlation. When there is no linear correlation between
    the two variables r equals zero. The Pearson correlation of two random variables
    X and Y ( is defined as: (4) Where is the covariance of two variables, and and
    are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively. We used the Pandas library
    in Python to calculate the Pearson correlation. 3.2.2. Spearman correlation Spearman''s
    rank correlation (rs) coefficient is a nonparametric (distribution-free) rank
    statistic that measures the strength of correlation between the ranking of two
    variables (Hauke and Kossowski, 2011). Although the Spearman correlation between
    two variables X and Y is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values
    of those two variables, i.e., R(X) and R(Y), the Spearman correlation is not a
    measure of the linear relationship. Spearman''s coefficient assesses how well
    an arbitrary monotonic function (linear or not) can describe the relationship
    between two variables. Eq. 5 shows how rs is calculated. Like the Pearson correlation,
    rs values are between −1 and 1. We used the Pandas library in Python to calculate
    the Spearman correlation. (5) 3.2.3. Mutual information Mutual information (MI)
    measures how much information about a random variable we can acquire by knowing
    another random variable. MI is a non-negative dimensionless quantity with units
    of information (bits) that quantifies the dependency between two variables. MI
    measures the amount of information gain or uncertainty reduction about one variable
    given knowledge of another. MI is a non-negative measure between 0 and 1. It is
    equal to zero if and only if two random variables are strictly independent, and
    higher values mean higher dependency (Kraskov et al., 2004). In contrast to the
    Pearson correlation coefficient or other linear correlation measures, MI is also
    sensitive to dependencies that do not demonstrate themselves in covariance; therefore,
    it is more generalizable and reliable for feature importance evaluation, especially
    in non-linear contexts like evapotranspiration equations. Detailed information
    about MI can be found in the references (Kozachenko et al., 1987; Kraskov et al.,
    2004; Ross, 2014). We used the Scikit-learn software library in Python to calculate
    MI. 3.2.4. CatBoost feature importance The CatBoost regression model performs
    automatic feature importance analysis on the input data during training. After
    training the model, the relative importance of each input feature can be acquired.
    This measure shows how much, on average, the model prediction changes if the feature
    value changes. Higher feature importance values indicate more significant changes
    to the prediction if the feature value changes. CatBoost feature importance is
    a non-negative value. Feature importance values are normalized so that the sum
    of the importance values of all features is equal to 100. This normalization enables
    a relative assessment of the importance values across various features. For feature
    importance analysis, we chose the hyperparameters of the CatBoost model according
    to outperforming CatBoost models trained on similar datasets on Kaggle, with no
    further hyperparameter tuning. 70% of the data was used to train the model, and
    30% as the test set for model evaluation. More information about the CatBoost
    model is provided in the following sections. We used the catboost library in Python
    to calculate the CatBoost feature importance. 3.3. Machine learning Five ML algorithms
    were chosen to test if only RS data can predict ETO over California. We selected
    highly used and well-known regression algorithms. These algorithms have demonstrated
    superior performance in literature and ML competitions with datasets similar to
    the one used in our study (Zhang et al., 2020). We also used an automatic hyperparameter
    tuning framework to optimize the hyperparameters of the CatBoost algorithm. We
    used this automatic hyperparameter optimization only for CatBoost since CatBoost
    was the best model in our pilot model training, utilizing only a portion of input
    data. Also, according to the literature and ML competition results, CatBoost has
    demonstrated superiority in similar regression problems. Specifically, Zhang et
    al. (2020) showed that the CatBoost model is the most accurate compared to similar
    ML models for daily ETO estimation. 3.3.1. CatBoost CatBoost is an open-source
    gradient-boosted decision tree with widespread applications for classification
    and regression tasks to many data types (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018, Dorogush
    et al., 2018). CatBoost aims to mitigate the challenges of overfitting and target
    leakage through its innovative techniques (Asghari et al., 2023). The algorithm
    introduces two main innovations compared to other gradient-boosted decision trees:
    ordered target statistics and ordered boosting (Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020).
    The term \"ordered target statistics\" refers to the technique CatBoost uses to
    encode categorical variables. \"Ordered boosting\" is a refinement of gradient
    boosting (Prokhorenkova et al., 2018). Through this technique, a decision tree
    model is recursively trained on the prediction residuals of data points. This
    approach allows the model to obtain unshifted residuals by applying the current
    model to new training examples at each step, leading to reduced overfitting. The
    main difference between CatBoost and other gradient boosting algorithms like LightGBM
    and XGBoost is that CatBoost uses symmetric or balanced trees. In other words,
    in CatBoost, the splitting condition is consistent across all nodes at the same
    tree depth. Symmetric trees are faster to train and less prone to overfitting.
    Nevertheless, symmetric trees are weaker learners than asymmetric trees, and therefore,
    they generally make worse predictions. However, as the main idea of gradient boosting
    is to combine numerous weak learners to make predictions, the CatBoost algorithm
    tends to make more accurate predictions than LightGBM and XGBoost in several cases.
    Detailed information about the CatBoost algorithm can be found in Prokhorenkova
    et al. (2018). We used the CatBoost package in Python to develop the CatBoost
    model. We employed Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework for automatic
    hyperparameter tuning of the CatBoost model (Akiba et al., 2019). Optuna allows
    users to dynamically construct the hyperparameter search space by offering a define-by-run
    API. Optuna has a user-friendly setup, and it provides efficient sampling and
    pruning algorithms for customization. Detailed information about Optuna and its
    algorithm can be found in Akiba et al. (2019). We did not use the test set in
    automatic hyperparameter tuning to ensure our ML models'' generalizability and
    avoid data leakage in our study. Instead, we utilized a cross-validation set consisting
    of 16 stations from the training data, where each represents a distinct climatic
    zone. This cross-validation set mimics the unseen test set. With Optuna, we conducted
    100 trials to optimize the CatBoost model hyperparameters. 3.3.2. Deep neural
    network The feed-forward neural network is the ancestor of all deep learning architectures.
    Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well-known and well-studied architectures with
    innumerable applications as predictive regression models and are commonplace in
    ET prediction and forecasting (Kumar et al., 2002, Kim and Kim, 2008). Although
    gradient-boosted algorithms, such as XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, are generally
    considered more suitable for tabular datasets (Shwartz-Ziv and Armon, 2022), such
    as the dataset used in our study, we also included a deep neural network (DNN)
    algorithm in our models to assess its performance relative to other methods. We
    used the TensorFlow library in Python to build our DNN model. Our model has three
    hidden layers with 16, 32, and 16 units, respectively. The activation function
    of input and hidden layers is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Mean Squared Error
    (MSE) is the loss function of the network. Ridge Regression (L2) and Lasso Regression
    (L1) are used as kernel and activity regularizers, respectively, with a regularization
    parameter of 0.01. The model uses Adam optimizer and is trained over 30 epochs
    with a batch size of 64. 3.3.3. LightGBM LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine),
    originally proposed by Ke et al. (2017) and developed by Microsoft as a free and
    open-source framework, efficiently implements the gradient boosting algorithm
    and reduces memory usage. Gradient boosting is an ensemble method where ensembles
    are constructed from decision trees. Models are fit through a gradient descent
    optimization algorithm, where the loss gradient is minimized as the model is tuned
    (Brownlee, 2020). We used the LightGBM package in Python to develop the LightGBM
    model. We used a maximum of 30 tree leaves and a maximum of 7 tree depths for
    base learners. We used 2000 boosted trees to fit. More information about the LightGBM
    method can be found in Ke et al. (2017) and Al Daoud (2019). 3.3.4. Random forest
    Random forest (RF) is a supervised learning algorithm used to solve classification
    and regression problems. RF is a bagging technique that trains many decision trees
    in parallel, and its results are based on an ensemble of the trained trees. When
    used as a regression model, RF returns the mean or average prediction of the individual
    trees as the model''s output. Detailed information about the RF algorithm can
    be found in the references (Ho, 1995, Breiman, 2001). We used the Scikit-learn
    software library in Python to build the RF model. We used 1000 trees in the forest,
    with a maximum depth of 9. 3.3.5. XGBoost XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)
    is an open-source gradient-boosting software library. XGBoost provides a parallel
    tree boosting (also known as gradient-boosted decision trees) that efficiently
    solves classification and regression problems. More information about the XGBoost
    model can be found in the references (Chen et al., 2015, Chen and Guestrin, 2016).
    We used the XGBoost library in Python to build the XGBoost model. We used 1000
    trees in the ensemble, with minimum depth and maximum leaves of 7 and 9, respectively.
    The learning rate was set to 0.3. 3.4. Empirical models We evaluated the performance
    of our input-limited data-driven approach against available input-limited alternatives
    for ETO estimation. Three well-known and reliable methods were chosen for this
    aim: a radiation-based method (i.e., Priestley-Taylor), a temperature-based method
    (i.e., Hargreaves-Samani), and a mass transfer-based method (i.e., Romanenko).
    Although none of these methods eliminate the need for a standard reference surface
    and their meteorological inputs rely on the measurement conditions, the comparison
    between SolarET and the methods is beneficial as they are well-established, widely-used
    procedures for ETO estimation. 3.4.1. Priestley-Taylor As shown in Eq. 1, the
    P-M equation consists of a radiation term and an aerodynamic term, where the latter
    groups the elements that represent the surface-atmosphere interactions (Pereira,
    2004). By analyzing data collected over various surfaces, Priestley and Taylor
    (1972) proposed an empirical adjustment to the P-M equation (Mallick et al., 2014).
    The Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation neglects the aerodynamic term and corrects
    the estimated ET by a dimensionless coefficient α (the Priestley-Taylor parameter).
    This coefficient accounts for the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit and air and
    surface resistances to estimate the ET from a short, well-watered grass surface.
    Experimental results from several sites worldwide resulted in an average value
    of α=1.26. We use this value in this research. Pereira (2004) states that 1.26
    is a good estimate for α in Davis, California. Eq. 6 depicts how the PT method
    calculates ETO: (6) Where is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve
    ( ℃ ), is the psychrometric constant ( ℃ ), is the latent heat of vaporization
    (2.45 ), is the net radiation ( ), and is the soil heat flux ( ). The Δ over Δ+γ
    represents the fraction of diabatic energy (Rn - G) contributing to ET from the
    grass surface, and the adiabatic contribution to ET is approximately 26% of the
    diabatic contribution. The daily ground heat flux is assumed to be G=0. 3.4.2.
    Hargreaves-Samani Hargreaves-Samani (HS) is an input-limited empirical equation
    to estimate ETO using air temperature and extraterrestrial radiation (Hargreaves
    and Samani, 1985). This equation is based on the Hargreaves original equation,
    approximating solar radiation with extraterrestrial radiation and maximum minus
    minimum air temperature. Since the HS equation is developed with daily lysimeter
    data from Davis, California, it is well-suited for and highly used in California,
    which makes it a good benchmark for validating our approach. The HS equation is
    as follows: (7) Where is reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), is the extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm/day, for equivalent evaporated water depth), , , and are the mean,
    maximum, and minimum daily air temperature (ºC), respectively. Since data from
    Davis, California, is used to calibrate the constant value of 0.0023, we use the
    same value in this research. 3.4.3. Romanenko Romanenko equation is a mass transfer-based
    empirical equation that uses air temperature and relative humidity to estimate
    ETO. The mass transfer-based methods are essentially based on Dalton''s gas law
    and employ the concept of eddy transfer of water vapor from an evaporating surface
    to the atmosphere (Mehdizadeh et al., 2017). Romanenko equation estimates daily
    ETO as follows: (8) Where RH is the relative humidity (%). 3.5. Performance measures
    In this study, two deterministic performance measures are employed to investigate
    the accuracy of ETO estimation models: root mean square error (RMSE) and mean
    absolute error (MAE) (Moriasi et al., 2015): (9) (10) Where N is the number of
    samples, and and are observed and predicted ETO values at ith sample, respectively.
    Lower RMSE and MAE values indicate higher accuracies and better performance. Although
    both RMSE and MAE indicate average model prediction error in units of the variable
    of interest, they have fundamental differences. Since RMSE squares the errors
    before averaging them, it gives higher weights to large errors. Consequently,
    RMSE tends to penalize large errors more severely than MAE. According to Chai
    and Draxler (2014), each of these metrics has its own merits in explaining the
    model performance; therefore, in this research, we use them in tandem. 4. Results
    and discussion 4.1. Data investigation Fig. 2 shows the number of data samples
    and the training data distribution for each climatic zone. This figure shows that
    zones 14, 6, and 12 have the highest number of stations and input data samples
    in the training set. On the other hand, there is no data from zone 4 in the training
    set, as all the samples from this zone have been eliminated in the data preprocessing.
    However, zone 4 is present in the test set. This can further evaluate the generalizability
    of the presented methodology for ETO estimation in unseen locations in California.
    Zones 12 and 14 cover a vast area of the Central Valley. The Central Valley is
    one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world, with ideal soil
    and climate for a variety of crops but limited water resources. With limited to
    no rainfall in the summer, the Central Valley''s agriculture relies on irrigation.
    About one-sixth of the US irrigated land lies in the Central Valley (Reilly et
    al., 2008). This heavy irrigation dependence explains this region''s high density
    of CIMIS stations. Download : Download high-res image (192KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Number of samples, stations, and distribution of the training
    data for each climatic zone. Fig. 2 suggests a relatively uniform distribution
    of solar radiation across California, with lower values in coastal zones (e.g.,
    zones 1 and 2) and higher values in deserts (e.g., zones 17 and 18). The lower
    RS values on the coast can be attributed to dense fog. The ETO distribution in
    California reveals more variability across different zones. The most anomalous
    zones in terms of ETO distribution are coastal zones with very low ETO and desert
    zones with very high ETO. Also, the box plots of Fig. 2 illustrate a broader ETO
    distribution for desert zones. Being abnormal regarding RS and ETO distribution
    and having fewer input data, we hypothesize that our data-driven models struggle
    with accurate ETO prediction in coastal and desert zones. 4.2. Feature selection
    The results of the feature selection methods are presented in Fig. 3, which suggests
    no sharp difference between the features'' importance, especially from Pearson
    and Spearman correlations. As expected, all feature selection methods find the
    hourly RS values from morning and around noon to be the most important features.
    Based on these results, we decided to use the six most essential features/hours
    as the input of the ML models. For example, the six most important hourly Rs values
    selected by the CatBoost feature importance method are 7, 8, 6, 9, 10, and 12,
    respectively (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The most important features (i.e., solar radiation from
    different hours of the day) selected by each feature selection method and their
    corresponding score. It should be noted that both Pearson and MI methods result
    in hours 8–13 of Rs as the six most important features, only with various orders.
    Therefore, the results for Pearson and MI methods are the same and combined hereafter.
    Because different methods suggest a uniform feature importance, we hypothesize
    that the mean substitution procedure (i.e., using all hourly RS values) might
    be superior to using only selected features as input. 4.3. Machine learning models
    The overall performance of the ML models and feature selection methods is depicted
    in Fig. 4 and Figure A1 in the appendix. As these figures show, CatBoost and RF
    have very similar performances in terms of prediction accuracy. It should be noted
    that while Optuna has automatically optimized the CatBoost model''s hyperparameters,
    RF hyperparameters are set manually. This would suggest that automatic hyperparameter
    tuning for this type of regression problem does not guarantee higher accuracy,
    and a manual hyperparameter tuning strategy can result in equally accurate models.
    Also, most of the available automatic hyperparameter tuning frameworks, including
    Optuna, are specifically designed to optimize the hyperparameters of deep learning
    architectures, where the high dimensionality of the hyperparameter space interferes
    with manual hyperparameter tuning strategies like grid or random search and might
    result in sub-efficient models (Akiba et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res

    (RMSE) values (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods
    over the whole testing set. Fig. 4 and A1 illustrate the overall superiority of
    using all the hourly RS values with the mean substitution method over selecting
    the most important hours. Among feature selection methods, ML models using CatBoost
    intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation perform better than MI and
    Pearson correlation. The quality and relevance of the selected features can influence
    the performance of ML models. In our case, the difference in performance between
    the feature selection methods can be attributed to 1) the ability to handle non-linear
    relationships: ML models can effectively capture non-linear relationships between
    features and the target variable. In this case, CatBoost''s intrinsic feature
    importance considers the inherent non-linear relationship between the input and
    output of the model and selects features that have the highest impact on the model''s
    performance. 2) Robustness to outliers and noise: These observations can also
    be attributed to CatBoost intrinsic feature importance and Spearman correlation''s
    more effective robustness to outliers than Pearson correlation and Mutual Information
    correlation. Considering the rank-based correlation in Spearman''s correlation
    or the model-specific feature importance in CatBoost, these methods may have selected
    more robust features that lead to better model performance. Using feature selection
    or mean substitution, the CatBoost model with the mean substitution method stands
    out as the most accurate hourly model. Additionally, the RF excels as the preferred
    choice between daily models. We compare these models as the best-performing frameworks
    with empirical ETO estimation models. Fig. 4 and A1 clearly show that the DNN
    model falls behind all ensemble decision tree-based algorithms (i.e., RF and gradient
    boosting-based frameworks). This finding agrees with previous studies where tree-based
    algorithms outperformed vanilla neural networks in predictive regression problems
    (Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2015, Pham et al., 2020; Jun, 2021). To better understand
    how SolarET performs in different climatic zones of California, we included one
    CIMIS station with around five years of data from each zone. These stations have
    not been used to train the model; therefore, SolarET''s performance in these locations
    can be claimed as its performance in any arbitrary location in those climatic
    zones. Fig. 5 and A2 depict the models'' accuracy for each zone in the test set.
    These results clearly show that the performance of various ML models and feature
    selection methods is similar in each climatic zone. In other words, we cannot
    claim that a specific combination of the ML model and feature selection technique
    is more suitable for a geographical location or particular climatic characteristics.
    All successful prediction frameworks (i.e., ensemble decision tree-based algorithms)
    have lower accuracies in estimating ETO in coastal (zones 1 and 2) and desert
    (zones 17 and 18) areas (Fig. 5 and A2). Download : Download high-res image (444KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values
    (mm/day) for machine learning models and feature selection methods over climatic
    zones of California. From an ML perspective, three reasons might contribute to
    the lower accuracy of SolarET in the coastal and desert regions: 1) the low number
    of training data from these zones: Fig. 2 shows limited training data in these
    zones- leading to their insufficient representation of data patterns. Other zones
    also have low numbers of training samples but high predictive accuracy (e.g.,
    zones 16, 13, and 10). Although, these zones are more similar to the majority
    of the training set in terms of ETO distribution (Fig. 2). Therefore, we hypothesize
    that the first reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in the coast and
    desert data is the low number of training samples resembling the statistical characteristics
    of the data from these zones. 2) Higher level of outlier values in both training
    and test sets: As depicted in Fig. 6, there is a higher percentage of outlier
    values in stations 17 and 18 compared to other stations, which could impact the
    performance of the ML models in these specific zones. These outliers introduce
    noise and may not follow the patterns that the ML models have learned from the
    training data, leading to less accurate predictions. 3) Lack of relevant features:
    According to Fig. 7, we hypothesize that one of the other reasons for less accurate
    predictions in zones 17 and 18 is the lower correlation between the daily RS and
    ETO in these regions. Various climatic variables, such as temperature, humidity,
    wind speed, and solar radiation influence ETO. In zones 17 and 18, hourly or daily
    solar radiation may not accurately capture all the required information to estimate
    ETO. All in all, it is worth mentioning that the combination of these reasons,
    rather than a single factor, may have led to inferior performance of the ML models
    in these zones. It is also expected that advection is a more considerable contribution
    to ETO in desert regions than in the Central Valley or along the coast, and the
    lack of information on temperature, humidity, and wind speed in the ML models
    should lead to more considerable errors in regions having large fluctuations in
    aerodynamic contributions to ETO (Berengena and Gavilán, 2005). Download : Download

    evapotranspiration prediction To evaluate our approach of using ML models with
    only pyranometer data for ETO estimation, we compared its performance against
    three empirical limited-input ETO estimation models. It should be noted that both
    approaches, ML and empirical models, were evaluated using the same test set but
    with different features. Fig. 8 and A3 depict the findings of this comparison
    over 17 climatic zones of the test set. In these figures, we displayed the results
    of only the best-performing data-driven models. In the case of hourly inputs,
    the CatBoost ML model with mean substitution is the best, and in the case of daily
    inputs, the random forest model gives the highest accuracy (Fig. 4 and A1). Download

    Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for empirical models and SolarET over climatic
    zones of California. As seen in Fig. 8 and A3, our hourly model generally works
    as well or even better than the most accurate empirical model (i.e., Priestley-Taylor).
    This is especially important as our model takes only solar radiation data as input,
    while PT takes information from minimum and maximum air temperature and elevation
    in addition to net radiation. Also, our hourly and daily models clearly beat Hargreaves-Samani
    and Romanenko in terms of prediction accuracy. Our findings suggest that SolarET
    works very well unless there are extremely high or low contributions of aerodynamics
    to the ETO (e.g., desert and coastal climates). This is not surprising, as SolarET
    can only mimic the radiation term of the P-M equation, as it takes no information
    about the aerodynamics term (Eq. 1). Still, Fig. 8 and A3 illustrate that SolarET
    works better than PT as a radiation-based ET estimation model in desert climates.
    The inferior performance of SolarET in comparison to PT in coastal regions might
    be due to the high humidity fluctuation in these regions due to variations in
    wind direction, e.g., from the land or from the ocean, which lead to significant
    variations in temperature and humidity. Moreover, the presence of intermittent
    clouds and fog in these regions might be another reason for the lower accuracy
    of our model as opposed to PT. The low accuracy of empirical models in desert
    climate might be due to two reasons: 1) these models are not calibrated for desert
    climate (Priestley and Taylor, 1972, Hargreaves and Samani, 1985, Tabari et al.,
    2013); and 2) these models do not adequately account for heat advection in hot
    desert climates (Tolk et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2023). We hypothesize that another
    reason for the inferior performance of SolarET in deserts and coast is not accounting
    for aridity. This pattern is the same for PT and HS in desert regions. This goes
    along with not considering the aerodynamics contribution to the daily ETO. We
    hypothesize that adding information about vapor pressure can solve this problem.
    Fig. 9 analyzes the performance of SolarET against available empirical alternatives
    over the entire test set in terms of prediction accuracy. RMSE and MAE measure
    the dissimilarity between input-limited alternatives and P-M equation prediction.
    We use these performance measures to assess which input-limited ETO estimation
    alternative can simulate the daily P-M equation more realistically. As Fig. 9
    demonstrates, our hourly and daily models beat all empirical alternatives in terms
    of similarity to the P-M daily ETO. Our hourly model is the winner of this comparison.
    Although the overall performance of the hourly model is close to the daily model
    according to Fig. 9, as Fig. 8 depicts, the hourly model results in identical
    or more accurate predictions for all climatic zones. Interestingly, the hourly
    model works much better than the daily model in coastal regions (zones 1, 2, and
    3 in Fig. 8). This finding suggests that the information gained from the higher
    temporal resolution input (i.e., hourly Rs) is beneficial in simulating climatically
    diverse samples and can boost generalizability. Download : Download high-res image

    and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values for empirical models and SolarET over the
    entire test set. Fig. 9 shows that the PT equation, which is a radiation-based
    model, is the most accurate empirical ETO estimation model. The superiority of
    SolarET and the high accuracy of the PT model signifies the suitability of radiation
    data for input-limited ETO estimation in California. This finding agrees with
    Ahmadi et al. (2022) findings on the high correlation between radiation and ETO
    over California. Fig. 9 illustrates that HS and Romanenko models are the least
    realistic representations of P-M ETO over California. However, it should be noted
    that since we aim to compare not only the accuracy but also the generalizability
    of models, the HS model was not calibrated in this study. We hypothesize that
    calibrating HS will improve its accuracy in ETO estimation. Analyzing the errors
    of the ML and empirical models can provide valuable insights into their performance
    and help identify areas for improvement. In this vein, we divided the ETO distribution
    into distinct ranges and compared the best-performing ML model, CatBoost, using
    hourly Rs, with the PT empirical model. Fig. 10 illustrates the percentage of
    values within each specific ETO range where the value of exceeds 0.5. In this
    equation, Refers to P-M value and is what the model predicts. This figure indicates
    the more accurate predictions of CatBoost compared to PT across various ranges
    of ETO values. Overall, CatBoost maintains its superiority not only in the whole
    distribution of ETO over the entire test set but also in cases of low or high
    values of ETO. Moreover, as Figure A4 in the appendix shows, the distribution
    of SolarET error is similar to a Gaussian distribution with a mean value close
    to zero. This distribution suggests the error is random, not a systematic over-
    or under-estimation of ETO. It is also worth mentioning that SolarET accuracy
    is comparable to the best-performing ML-based ETO estimation models available
    in the literature, while it does not use surface-related inputs such as air temperature
    (Chen et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download : Download

    5. Summary and conclusion This paper develops a generalizable data-driven approach
    to estimate ETO using only solar radiation data. Since solar radiation is the
    only driving force of ETO, whose measurement does not require a reference crop
    surface, the developed approach (i.e., SolarET) can cut the cost of land, irrigation,
    maintenance, and extra sensors while assisting irrigators and water managers with
    their farm-level and regional decisions. As incoming solar radiation is not a
    function of the surface, a simple pyranometer placed on any location can measure
    the inputs of SolarET. Using a test set from unseen arbitrary locations, we showed
    the generalizability of SolarET over California. Our findings reveal that SolarET
    beats the Hargraves-Samani and Romanenko models in terms of accuracy. SolarET
    works better than Priestley-Taylor, a well-known radiation-based ETO estimation
    method, without using any information about air temperature. Although SolarET
    works accurately in heavily irrigated regions of California and beats all empirical
    models in desert climates, it is less accurate in coastal regions. Future studies
    can include publicly available air temperature data as another input, along with
    measured solar radiation. Adding publicly available air temperature data can result
    in better performance in coastal and desert regions, where the contribution of
    the aerodynamics term of the Penman-Monteith equation is different from other
    inland regions of California. Moreover, developing models tailored to a specific
    region or climate might result in higher accuracies but at the cost of lower generalizability.
    The accuracy-generalizability trade-off of this data-driven approach is another
    area for future research. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mohammad Hossein

    1. Introduction Driven by global changes and human activities, water culture and
    water resources systems are undergoing significant and continuous transformation
    (Foley and J., 2005; Kåresdotter et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Xiong et al.,
    2022). Water culture combines the physical and cultural dimensions of material
    and immaterial aspects that interact to produce a specific form of human connection
    with water. Humans create water cultures that depend on the environmental contexts
    when they come in contact with water (Mclean, 2017). The analytical efficacy of
    water culture stems from the establishment of specific values and behaviors pertaining
    to water within the prevailing frameworks of natural resource management. This
    might have led to the marginalization of various forms of water utilization. Therefore,
    in the context of responding to global climate change and the increase in the
    number of water and drought emergencies, it is essential to consider values and
    norms as endogenous to the coupled human-water system and focus on them in terms
    of the human-water relationship (Cavus et al., 2022; Pande and Sivapalan, 2017).
    The current phase of global economic expansion has been accompanied by a significant
    increase in the demand for water resources, which can be attributed to several
    factors, including extensive resource development, rapid urbanization, and population
    growth. These factors have contributed to the persistent occurrence of water resource
    shortages, water-related calamities, contamination of water environments, and
    other associated challenges, resulting in significant concerns about water security
    (Koop et al., 2022; Paiva et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2022). Water security challenges
    can be considered deliberate or inadvertent outcomes of the gradual development
    of culture, including social norms, values, ideologies, and political institutions.
    These issues are often unforeseen or are overlooked in the context of water-related
    issues (Di Baldassarre et al., 2019). Water culture, a fundamental aspect of human
    origin, reflects of the intricate connection between individuals and water. Consequently,
    the significance of water culture in addressing water crises and guaranteeing
    water security has emerged as a prominent concern and focal point in contemporary
    global change and water science. During the nascent stages of human civilization,
    water security concerns primarily stemmed from natural occurrences, such as droughts,
    floods, and river diversions. However, in contemporary times, water security issues
    have predominantly arisen owing to factors. These issues manifest in various forms,
    including water scarcity, water pollution, aquatic environment degradation, flood
    disasters, ecological and social instability, and threats to national security
    (Shao et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Vital scientific issues for water security
    include understanding and predicting the impacts of environmental changes on water
    quantity, water quality, and aquatic ecosystems and understanding the impact of
    social values and social controls on water management (Wheater and Gober, 2015).
    Governance is the main challenge in water security (Grumbine, 2018; Lutz-Ley et
    al., 2021). Social stratification, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases strongly
    influence how different social groups can change, perceive, and adapt to hydrological
    changes. Additionally, these heterogeneous factors determine how water governance
    unfolds, and consequently, how water is managed at different scales (Di Baldassarre
    et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017). Water security management involves complex decision-making
    processes. It rarely involves multiple dimensions of environmental stressors or
    individual dimensions, and there are still no better governance ideas to date.
    The adoption of water culture as a significant approach to address current water
    security challenges, promote sustainable water resource utilization, and preserve
    a healthy water environment is imperative and time-sensitive. Water conservation
    infrastructure is a crucial component of the national economic infrastructure
    and serves a vital and irreplaceable function in flood control, water supply,
    food production, economic development, and ecological security (Dong et al., 2022;
    Li et al., 2023a, Li et al., 2023b; Xing et al., 2023). Nevertheless, in the context
    of modern society, it is insufficient to depend exclusively on technology and
    engineering to address water security issues stemming from current water crises.
    Additional strategies are essential, such as the establishment of scientific values,
    behavioral patterns, systems, and norms for human beings regarding water. This
    involves the effort and constraints imposed by human beings, coupled with cultural,
    technological, and engineering approaches, to address the growing water security
    challenges. The fundamental objective of water culture is to examine the relationship
    between people, water, and the change resulting from feedback from the human water
    system (van Emmerik et al., 2014). Research on water culture is currently mainly
    conducted through social surveys from the perspectives of risk perception (Mankad
    and Tapsuwan, 2011), social norms and values (Mankad et al., 2019), environmental
    awareness (van Emmerik et al., 2014), people''s response to drought (Lindsay et
    al., 2017), household consumption behavior (Addo et al., 2018; Eck et al., 2019;
    Koh, 2020), and attitudes towards policies (Adapa, 2018). Domestic and foreign
    scholars have endeavored to investigate the influence of water culture on human
    systems and the water cycle through quantitative analysis of its evolution (Lu
    et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2015; Werdiningtyas et al., 2020a). The above research
    suggests that social surveys, media, and policies can be used indirectly to generalize
    the relationship between changing values and norms and human behavior concerning
    the environment. This provides a new perspective for studying the changes in water
    culture. Some scholars also believe that “water” is a public service mainly provided
    by the government. Certain issues, such as the total amount of water resources,
    water resource allocation, water conservancy facility capacity, and social equity
    in water supply, are closely associated with the public service function of the
    government (Buntaine et al., 2021; Chou et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2021). Substantive
    policy instruments are vital for maintaining sustainability by establishing trade-offs
    that balance supply (biophysical systems) and demand (social systems). Policy
    instruments can evolve in response to changing conditions and issues in environments
    where stability and change are closely intertwined. Policies alone cannot solve
    many of the degradation problems. However, a combination of education, policy,
    scientific knowledge, planning, and the enforcement of relevant laws can provide
    mechanisms to delay the rate of degradation (Werdiningtyas et al., 2020b). Local
    or national water resource management decisions, regardless of whether they are
    infrastructure-related or policy-related, can have positive or negative impacts
    that often last for an extended period (van Emmerik et al., 2014). Given the growing
    demand for water resources to satisfy a growing population, there is an urgent
    need to make water resource management decisions based on long-term (decades to
    centuries) evolving characteristics. Current research has rarely explored the
    impact and relationship of water culture on ensuring water security, especially
    its significance for sustainable water resources development. Therefore, this
    study considered the evolution and mutual feedback relationship between water
    culture and water security as its research goal. China has an extensive history
    of water management and culture. The practical and far-reaching historical significance
    of strengthening the construction of water culture, vigorously promoting the development
    of water conservancy for human livelihoods, concentrating on the construction
    of modern water conservancy, actively promoting the construction of an ecological
    civilization, and comprehensively enhancing the soft power and image of water
    conservancy cannot be overstated. The objective of this study was to devise a
    method to quantitatively describe the evolution of water cultures. The policy
    documents for the Weihe River Basin (WRB) are illustrative cases in this study.
    The geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the WRB are similar to those
    of other semi-arid and sub-humid transitional zones, and water scarcity in the
    context of climate change is a significant problem (Deng et al., 2020; Zhang et
    al., 2022). This means that water is often a restrictive resource for social and
    economic development, often leading to severe human-water conflicts. The WRB offers
    insights similar to those of many places worldwide regarding overuse and abuse,
    and the transition described later in this article may be relevant to many other
    watersheds now or in the future. This article aimed to address three specific
    research questions by constructing a co-evolution framework of water security
    and culture based on a policy analysis of WRB management. 1) In the past hundred
    years, how has the development of water culture in the WRB evolved? 2) How do
    the water security issues corresponding to each evolutionary phase evolve? 3)
    Under what background does the co-evolution process occur between the two, and
    what factors may trigger this transformation? The aim of this study was to reveal
    policy-led patterns of water culture change and their mutual feedback with water
    security and to innovatively scrutinize the development of water security from
    the perspective of water culture. Therefore, we need to explore the development
    and evolution of water culture in the WRB and clarify important issues in the
    development of water culture. Exploring the mutual feedback relationship between
    water culture and water security in the WRB will provide a basis for incorporating
    water culture into watershed management in the future, which is crucial for developing
    a more sustainable watershed. Simultaneously, governments and policymakers can
    better cope with the complexities of water management and ensure a balance between
    water culture and water security, which can ultimately benefit the society. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Study area As the largest tributary of the Yellow River,
    the Weihe River is located in a transition zone between arid, continental monsoon
    climates, and humid areas. With poor vegetation coverage and severe soil erosion,
    it is the main sediment source area in this region and one of the main sediment-producing
    areas in the Yellow River Basin. The quality of the ecological environment in
    the WRB directly affects the protection of the ecological environment and high-quality
    development in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Therefore, strengthening
    the ecological protection and management of the WRB is essential. The study area
    selected in this article mainly flows through Pingliang, Qingyang, Tianshui, and
    Dingxi cities in Gansu Province and Xianyang, Baoji, Xi''an, Tongchuan, Weinan,
    and Yan''an cities in Shaanxi Province (Fig. 1). However, the demand for water
    resources remains high owing to the continuous social and economic development
    along the Weihe River. Multiple water security issues, such as water shortages,
    severe water environment pollution, fragile ecological environments, and frequent
    water disasters, are intertwined and seriously restrict the economic and social
    development of cities along river basins (Wang et al., 2021). National and local
    governments have taken some measures, such as diverting water from the Han River
    to the Weihe River, large-scale water-saving and renovation projects in irrigation
    districts, and the transfer of water rights (He et al., 2020). However, because
    of the inadequate water resources of the Weihe River and the long-term pursuit
    of rapid economic development, the scale of water use approaches or exceeds the
    carrying capacity of water resources, placing significant strain on the water
    resource system. Water scarcity continues to be the most significant impediment
    to the ecological well-being and the social economy of river basins. Download

    Overview of the study area. 2.2. Methodology 2.2.1. Water culture-water security
    co-evolution framework A co-evolution framework was used to explain how the evolution
    of water culture feeds into water security indicators (Fig. 2). The framework
    was used to identify the critical dynamics of water culture and water security.
    Because the evolution of water culture, water security indicators, and watershed
    management policies and practices co-occur and influence each other, participatory
    approaches have been used to understand recent developments in the social dimensions
    of water resource management (Wei et al., 2015). This co-evolving water culture-water
    security framework links each phase of water culture change to water security
    change to capture triggers and reveal co-evolving interactive dynamics. In this
    study, the main water policies and water security indicators used since 1949 were
    analyzed to reconstruct the co-evolution process of water culture and water security
    by categorizing water culture and water security into different phases, which
    were further qualitatively analyzed. Download : Download high-res image (454KB)

    framework. 2.2.2. Word frequency analysis Content analysis is a research method
    that objectively, systematically, and quantitatively describes communication content.
    Its essence is to analyze the information in the communication content and its
    changes, inferring an accurate meaning from the meaningful words and sentences
    represented (Cheng et al., 2022). A content analysis is a layer-by-layer reasoning
    process. Word frequency analysis is not a novel method, and the reason for choosing
    it is that this method is scientifically intuitive and can accurately capture
    the focus of a large amount of data for quantitative analysis (Wu et al., 2021a).
    Word frequency analysis analyses meaningful words and phrases by extrapolating
    them to the results of accurate meaning, which is the strength of this method.
    Combined with the policy data collected, word frequency analysis is a very applicable
    and reasonable method to count and determine the evolution stages of water culture.
    Water policies can reflect the changes in human values and norms when managing
    water crises. Water culture is often expressed through unstructured social symbols
    (such as words). Therefore, this study uses specific words in ideological policy
    documents to represent water culture. Changes in the water culture can be revealed
    through changes in vocabulary and word frequency in policy documents over time.
    In this study, we analyzed the process of water culture change in WRB from 1949
    to 2020 by collecting documents and notices issued by national, ministerial, and
    provincial units since 1949. We analyzed the “water”-related headline elements
    based on the method of content analysis to understand the characteristics of the
    evolution of water culture. The Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical
    Analysis System (ICTCLAS), a participle method, was developed by the Institute
    of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences based on years of accumulated
    research (http://ictclas.nlpir.org/). The ICTCLAS participle method has been publicly
    evaluated by national and international authorities and is characterized by an
    optimal comprehensive performance. Therefore, based on a customized professional
    domain dictionary, the policy titles in the corpus were segmented using ICT-CLAS
    5.0, to remove duplicates, memorable characters, and meaningless stop words (Wu
    et al., 2021b), yielding 4964 words. 2.2.3. Calculation of water security index
    system and comprehensive weight 1. Building a system of water security indicators
    To capture the evolving concepts of water security, it is essential to consider
    the shifting emphasis on water security. A higher emphasis on water security indicators
    suggests a lower level of safety in water security during that specific period.
    Due to the limitation of time scale, the principles of availability, scientificity
    and representativeness need to be combined in the search for indicators, and the
    time scale of some commonly used indicators is difficult to realize, so alternative
    indicators with better access are chosen. Therefore, based on the above principles,
    this study constructed a water security indicator system. Many factors are involved
    in water safety systems, and they include four first-level indicators and two
    second-level indicators with different categories and attributes. Based on existing
    studies (Shao et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), we first categorized water security
    into four dimensions: water disasters, water resources, water environment, and
    water ecological security. The indicator systems are listed in Table 1. (1) Water
    disaster security. Unprecedented economic development and urbanization since the
    establishment of the country, coupled with global climate change, have increased
    the risk of water-related disasters (Güneralp et al., 2015). Water disaster safety
    indicators were categorized into drought and flood, and drought and flood frequency
    indicators were used to characterize the degree of water crisis caused by water
    hazards at different stages. The higher the frequency of water disasters, the
    greater the government''s attention, highlighting the vulnerability of water security.
    To reduce risk, infrastructure construction must be strengthened, management standards
    must be improved, and the capacity to withstand flood disasters and post-disaster
    recovery capabilities must be significantly enhanced. (2) Water resource security.
    This involves water demand to support agricultural development. The indicators
    of water resource security examine the agricultural water demand at each water
    culture stage to determine whether it can meet the requirements of stable social
    and economic development and will not hinder or endanger its stability (Haddeland
    et al., 2014). Reservoirs are an essential means for governments to manage water
    (Kuil et al., 2016), and they are a good reflection of the relationship between
    water culture and water security. The more insecure the water resources are, the
    more reservoirs will be built. Water is more economically significant than it
    was in the past owing to the current era of accelerated development. Moreover,
    the coordination of economic style, policy regulation methods, water resource
    allocation and management, and the promotion of sustainable economic development
    are crucial to the development of WRB. (3) Water environment security. This involves
    ensuring the safety and reliability of the water system and adequately solving
    problems, such as water supply, drainage, and sewage in urban and rural areas.
    The water environment security indicator represents the degree of water security
    measured at various stages from the perspective of the physical and chemical existence
    of water resources. The factors that affect the suitability of water for various
    uses are based on the fact that water resources are in a state of sufficiency,
    cleanliness, and high capacity for self-healing, and renewal and that water quality,
    culture, and security are interlinked and critical to the survival of human beings
    and the environment (Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Yuksel et al., 2018;
    Yuksel et al., 2021). We chose the water pollution level, runoff, and sediment
    transport as indicators of water environment safety. The challenge is to strengthen
    urban and rural water management to build livable cities and maintain urban vitality.
    (4) Water ecological security. This involves the health and ecology of water environments.
    Water ecological indicators reflect the need to balance humans health and the
    ecology at various stages. Rapid economic development has triggered many aquatic
    and ecological problems in the WRB. We chose minimum ecological water demand distance
    average and wetland area as indicators of water ecological security (Salimi et
    al., 2021; Ye et al., 2020). It is important that government shifts to green economic
    growth as soon as possible. 2. AHP-EWM comprehensive weight calculation Table

    is a subjective calculation and the Entropy Weight Method (EWM) is an objective
    calculation, the principles of the two weight calculation methods are different;
    therefore, the two methods are combined to make the weight more authentic (Li
    et al., 2023a, Li et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2023). (1) In Eq. (1), Wj is the

    Calculate the composite score: (2) Pij represents the standardized value of indicator
    i in indicator stratum j, and Sj represents the composite score of the water safety
    indicators. The larger the composite score value, the more importance is attached
    to the water safety of an indicator stratum, and the more unsafe the water safety.
    2.3. Data sources Laws and regulations, notification documents, and regulations
    in Shaanxi and Gansu Province were obtained from the Shaanxi Provincial Archives,
    Beida Fabulous (https://m.pkulaw.com/). This paper is only recorded with the “water”-related
    keywords based on the title of the policy, for a total of 3194 collected (no data
    collected for 1967–1977). The water safety indicators are mainly collected from
    the local records, water conservancy records, water conservancy yearbooks, and
    water resources bulletins of Pingliang, Qingyang, Tianshui, and Dingxi in Gansu
    Province, and Xianyang, Baoji, Xi''an, Tongchuan, Weinan, and Yan''an in Shaanxi
    Province. Further details are presented in Table 1. 3. Results 3.1. Phase division
    Based on the word classification and word frequency statistics of the titles of
    “water”-related documents collected from 1949 to 2020 (no data were collected
    from 1967 to 1977), the evolution of the theme of water culture in each decade
    was determined. As shown in Fig. 3, the themes of flood control and drought resistance
    were present throughout the evolution of water culture. Before the 1970s, the
    frequency of flood-related keywords was higher than that of the other keywords.
    Throughout the evolutionary process, humans have continued to improve hydrological
    technologies to mitigate the effects of droughts and floods and to increase the
    availability of water resources through water governance activities, such as flood
    control projects and the construction of reservoirs. Water conservation and irrigation
    projects were the lifeblood of agriculture as an early agricultural area in the
    WRB. In the 1980s and 1990s, the theme of farmland water conservation accounted
    for the largest proportion. After 2000, the government paid more attention to
    water shortages, alleviating them by adjusting water prices and preventing and
    controlling pollution. Since 2010, water conservation has become a central theme,
    with a focus on the sustainable development of water resources. Along with essential
    events in China, rapid economic development, urbanization, and a significant increase
    in industrial and agricultural productivity have occurred after the implementation
    of the Reform and Opening-up (1978) policy. Therefore, the demand for water resources
    has increased, and keywords related to urban and rural water supplies have begun
    to increase. After 1998, policy documents on the sustainable use of water resources,
    such as water-saving, water resource protection, and water quality management,
    were higher than those on other topics. This may also indicate a growing emphasis
    on water resource management and protection during this period, with efforts being
    made to promote sustained improvement in the quality of the water environment
    and breakthroughs in ecological protection and restoration of rivers and lakes.
    The first two phases of the evolution of water culture change in the WRB mainly
    meet human needs, whereas the last two phases support the sustainable development
    of human and ecological needs. Therefore, combined with the analysis, the evolution
    of water culture was categorized into four phases: 1949–1967 (Disaster-resistant
    Hydraulic Phase), 1968–1998 (Irrigation Hydraulic Phase), 1999–2010 (Resources
    Hydraulic Phase), and 2011–2020 (Ecological Hydraulic Phase). Download : Download

    the water culture theme. 3.2. Evolution process of water cultural values 3.2.1.
    Disaster-resistant hydraulic phase (1949–1967) This phase is associated with the
    early days of China''s founding and the period of restoring livelihoods restoration.
    The frequency of keywords for the water disaster categories—flood, drought, and
    drought preparedness—was high. During this period, when natural floods and droughts
    are frequent, the country pays more attention to water disasters. In the early
    days of China''s founding, agricultural development was emphasized; however, flood
    disasters affected agricultural development, which, in turn, affected economic
    development. Therefore, water conservation has begun to be implemented. At this
    time, the water conservancy project began to build flood control projects through
    the construction of reservoirs to reduce the impact of floods and droughts and
    ensure sustainable agricultural production and socio-economic development. Shaanxi
    and Gansu Provinces have constructed farmland water conservancy capital, focusing
    on drought and flood control to increase agricultural productivity and promote
    agricultural production and rural economic development. Implementing the water
    conservancy policy of “preventing flooding and constructing water conservancy
    to achieve the purpose of mass production” has determined that the main focus
    is farmland irrigation projects. To the best of our knowledge, several large-
    and medium-sized irrigation projects have been constructed. Baoji Xia introduced
    the Weihe irrigation project, which was designed in 1958 to cope with agricultural
    losses caused by drought after water conservancy engineering measures. In 1960,
    the Sanmenxia Reservoir was built to cope with the dangers of Yellow River floods,
    mitigate the impact of flood disasters, and regulate the amount of water in the
    Yellow River. The Jinghui Canal farmland water conservancy project, which appeared
    more frequently in this phase, was initiated to combat severe drought and the
    massive losses it caused. During the drought, agricultural production heavily
    suffered, and the rural economy collapsed, which drew the attention of the central
    government and local authorities to the construction of farmland water conservancy
    in Shaanxi. 3.2.2. Irrigation hydraulic phase (1968–1998) Beginning in 1967, it
    was divided into two parts. The state gradually increased its investment in capital
    construction for water conservation during the first half of this phase (until
    1988). During this period, water conservation projects mainly focused on irrigation
    initiatives, involving water intake, water supply, and hydroelectric irrigation
    projects. These projects addressed the water requirements for agricultural use,
    contributing to agricultural development. Between 1989 and 1998, 1986 was the
    first year of the implementation of the “Seventh Five-Year Plan.” From that year
    onwards, the masses were mobilized and organized twice a year, in summer and winter,
    to carry out the basic construction of farmland water conservation centered on
    water treatment and soil reformation. The guideline for constructing farmland
    water conservancy was established as “small-scale oriented, complementary oriented,
    water-saving oriented, and watering expanded oriented.” In 1988, the country promulgated
    the Water Law of the People''s Republic of China, which proposed that the country
    implement water planning and practice water conservation, elevating water conservation
    to the level of national law, and that water-saving irrigation began to promote
    the implementation of the water abstraction permit system. In the 1990s, there
    was a decline in total water resources, accompanied by an increase in the energy
    industry demands and urban domestic water consumption. Consequently, the conflicts
    over water between industries and agriculture have become heightened. In addition,
    the availability of water for existing ground irrigation is not guaranteed, and
    the water projects are old and undergoing disrepair. To meet the demand for water
    for social and economic development, farmland water conservancy construction must
    focus on reducing water consumption. The keywords “irrigation project” and “water
    diversion project” appeared more frequently. The continuation of irrigation projects
    is critical for water conservancy construction at this stage, and investment in
    capital construction continues to increase. In 1991, it was proposed that the
    construction of farmland water conservancy should continue on a large scale to
    further increase the irrigated area and improve irrigation conditions. Simultaneously,
    the focus of agricultural irrigation development has shifted towards water-saving
    irrigation. In 1995, it was first proposed to “vigorously popularize water-saving
    irrigation technology.” In developing farmland irrigation, it is necessary not
    only to ensure that the construction of new water source projects is completed
    on schedule but also to develop water-saving irrigation comprehensively. 3.2.3.
    Resources hydraulic phase (1999–2010) In 2000, the central government proposed
    “building a water-saving society” for the first time in its recommendations on
    formulating the 10th 5-year plan for national economic and social development.
    At this stage, water resource problems have become prominent, and there is an
    urgent need to reduce the impact of water shortages on social development. Water
    resource management is carried out in both urban and rural areas, with urban areas
    focusing more on water supply and water pollution prevention to ensure the economic
    and social development of the city. Rural areas focus on farmland water conservation,
    reforming and developing farmland water conservation, and working together to
    build a water-saving society. Measures are implemented both quantitatively and
    qualitatively to achieve sustainable utilization of water resources. This adjustment
    in water allocation policy can be viewed as a response of the social system to
    changes in the hydrological system. The implementation of water volume dispatch
    in the Yellow River Basin rationally allocates water resources, conducts water
    resource price management, and economically restricts water use. Attention should
    also be paid to the water pollution problem in the WRB to strengthen water pollution
    prevention and control. At this stage, as the country attaches great importance
    to water conservancy construction, water conservancy investment continues to grow,
    and the water conservancy supply expands. With the implementation of national
    sustainable development strategies, the protection of water environments protection
    has received increasing attention. Owing to the shortage of water resources and
    the deterioration of water quality, the disparity between water supply and demand
    has become prominent, and the degree of constraints on water resources in the
    economy has begun to appear. The sustainable development of water resources relies
    primarily on the comprehensive implementation of water conservation and a gradual
    shift from total expansion to efficiency improvement. The country attaches great
    importance to agricultural production, which has strengthened farmland water conservation.
    Additionally, water-saving irrigation has improved and agricultural production
    has continuously increased, with farmland water conservation construction playing
    an important role. In terms of urban water supply, many cities have strengthened
    water conservation management through industrial restructuring, and per capita
    comprehensive water use has declined. The increase in urban residential water
    use has been commensurate with the decrease in urban productive water use. However,
    urban water shortages have become increasingly prominent because of water pollution
    and water shortages. Overall, the economic demand for water conservation development
    changes with shifts in the economic growth stage. 3.2.4. Ecological hydraulic
    phase (2011–2020) During this period, the country implemented the strictest water
    resource management system. In 2011, the central government made water conservation
    essential. Greater emphasis was placed on rural water reform, with comprehensive
    reforms in agricultural water pricing, promotion of water-saving technologies,
    comprehensive promotion of a water-saving society, and a growing awareness of
    water conservation. At the same time, it focuses on the development of ecological
    water conservancy and the safety of drinking water, improves the ecological environment,
    builds water conservancy scenic areas, establishes wetland ecosystems. The period
    of 2011–2020 plays a crucial role in advancing the overall development of water
    conservancy, and the planning and implementation of various types of water conservancy
    projects necessitate consistent inputs for stable growth and marked expansion.
    During this phase, water infrastructure development in the study area focused
    on livelihood projects for safe rural drinking water, rehabilitation of small
    reservoirs, and renewal of large-scale and key medium-sized irrigation districts
    with water-saving and renovation tasks. Droughts and floods have always existed,
    and there is still a need to comprehensively accelerate the construction of flood
    storage areas and complete the monitoring, early warning, crowd-surveying, and
    prevention systems. The construction of a water ecological civilization system
    is the focus of urban ecological environmental protection projects. Rational allocation
    and sustainable use of water resources, improvement of the water ecological environment,
    and awareness of the residents of water ecological civilization are essential
    guarantees for sustainable economic and social development. To verify whether
    our classification of the stages was appropriate, we counted the most representative
    and frequent keywords in the four periods. We analyzed their evolution throughout
    the stages. For example, for the Disaster-resistant hydraulic phase, we selected
    “drought prevention and control,” “flooding,” “flood control,” “drought,” or “flood
    control project”. For the Irrigation hydraulic phase, we selected “water intake
    project,” “water supply project,” “irrigation expansion project,” “irrigation”.
    For the Resources hydraulic phase, we selected “water-saving society,” “water
    pollution prevention and control,” “urban water supply,” “water dispatch,” “water
    resource fees,” “water abstraction permit,” “water diversion project”; Ecological
    hydraulic phase selects “water conservation technology,” “water-saving society,”
    “water conservation,” “water saving,” “comprehensive reform of agricultural water
    prices,” “water ecology,” “ecology,” “environment.” As shown in Fig. 4, the topic
    of disaster prevention with regard to water resources has persisted over time,
    with the highest frequency in the early stage of the country''s founding. The
    frequency decreased in the middle stage, and the frequency of the disaster topic
    increased after 2010 due to the increase in the number of extreme events caused
    by climate change after 2000. In the later stage, as the government enhances the
    awareness of environmental protection among the people, sustainable development
    of water resources is valued, and efforts are made to promote the continuous improvement
    of the quality of the water environment and the ecological protection and restoration
    of rivers and lakes. Based on the above analyses, the four stages were categorized
    in alignment with reality, rendering them applicable for future water security

    process 3.3.1. Evolution process of water security indicators Water security concerns
    include water crises, such as water disasters, shortages, pollution, and ecological
    degradation. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of water security indicators in the WRB
    at different stages of water culture evolution. Water disaster indicators show
    that droughts and floods have accompanied the evolution of water culture throughout
    this period, with droughts occurring more frequently before the 1970s. Between
    the 1970s and the 1990s, the frequency of droughts declined and then increased,
    with successive droughts occurring during this period. The frequency decreased
    after the 1990s. However, the number of floods remained high, even the 1970s.
    Water resource indicators showed that medium and large reservoirs increased faster
    during the irrigation hydraulic stage. During this period, different water conservation
    projects were developed for irrigation in WRB. The agricultural water shortage
    rate significantly decreased during this period due to the construction of water
    conservancy reservoirs. The water resource utilization rate also showed a clear
    upward trend. Water pollution indicators show that the pollution level is lower
    in the irrigation hydraulic stage than in the later stages and can be used for
    agricultural irrigation. However, in the resource hydraulic stage, the pollution
    level is higher, and the water quality is insufficient for agricultural irrigation
    and domestic water production. Simultaneously, during this stage, the sand transport
    and flow rates exhibited a clear downward trend. A reduction in sediment transport
    affects riverbank erosion and sediment distribution in waterbodies, thereby affecting
    the structure and function of the ecosystem. The water ecological indicators show
    that the annual minimum ecological water demand, compared with the average of
    the multi-year minimum ecological water demand, met the minimum ecological water
    demand before the 1970s. After the irrigation hydraulic phase, the minimum ecological
    water demand decreased. To ensure water consumption for human life and production,
    the ecological water in the river channel is overcrowded, and the ecological health
    of the basin is threatened. After 1980, the wetland area significantly decreased,
    and cities continuously occupied wetland areas. Wetland degradation and other
    problems have become severe. Download : Download high-res image (799KB) Download

    3.3.2. Water security assessment The calculation results of the AHP-EWM comprehensive
    evaluation showed that the focus on water security differed at different water
    culture stages (Fig. 6a). Water disaster safety indicators are critical during
    disaster-resistant hydraulic phases. During this phase, water culture became more
    concerned with safety issues arising from water-related disasters due to the severe
    socio-economic losses caused by droughts and floods. Therefore, different policies
    have focused on adapting to and mitigating the impacts of water hazards through
    hydraulic engineering. However, at this stage, the index at the water ecological
    indicator level was the lowest, possibly because of slower economic development
    and lower development of the ecological environment. The water shortage problem
    became prominent during the irrigation hydraulic phase. As a result of the intensive
    development of agriculture during this period, the construction of reservoirs
    not only met the demand for irrigation, but also prevented and stored floods to
    mitigate the adverse effects of droughts and floods on the development of agriculture.
    This was one of the reasons for the lowest safety index of water disasters in
    this period. Water pollution deepens during the resource hydraulic phase, leading
    to an increasingly severe shortage of water quality resources. Water environmental
    safety is more prominent than the other indicator strata, with a policy bias towards
    addressing water quality issues and a higher water environment index. In the ecological
    hydraulic phase, over-intervention and high-intensity development of the WRB have
    led to problems of imbalance in the basin ecosystem and threats to ecological
    security, with the highest index of water ecological security indicators. This
    led to a greater focus on ecologically sustainable development in the WRB and
    the adoption of measures to mitigate ecological problems and strengthen the security
    of water ecosystems. Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. (a) Water security evaluation under different water culture
    phases (b) total water security index. The results of the water security assessment
    showed that the water disaster security dimension was highest in the disaster-resistant
    hydraulic phase, lowest in the irrigation hydraulic phase, and increased in the
    latter two phases, possibly because of the increase in extreme events that led
    to an increase in the water disaster security index after 2000 (Du et al., 2023).
    The water resource security level index is declining and a continuous increase
    in reservoirs and water diversion projects can reduce the demand for irrigation
    water. Both the water environment security and the water ecological security indices
    increased. In the later stages of development, the issue of sustainable development
    of water resources is receiving increasing attention, and the disparity between
    supply and demand is constantly being highlighted. This gap has led to insufficient
    ecological water in rivers and the degradation of water ecological functions.
    However, water policies often focus on solving the immediate water security problems,
    often neglecting the comprehensive and simultaneous consideration of all existing
    water security challenges. Consequently, the total water security index decreased
    during the hydraulic irrigation phase and then increased during the resource hydraulic
    and ecological hydraulic phases (Fig. 6b). This shows that the government lacks
    comprehensive analysis and judgment of the consequences of policies, resulting
    in persistent water security problems. The governance of the WRB remains a daunting
    task. 3.4. Analysis of the co-evolution of water culture and water security Existing
    water management practices, including water supply reliability, agricultural water
    security, and water ecosystem security, do not address the impact of climate change
    on water security (Chen et al., 2016; Jiang, 2015; Lewis, 2009; Qiu et al., 2012).
    During the evolution of water culture, engineering and non-engineering measures
    have been used to mitigate water security issues in the development process. Watersheds
    effectively address and regulate water security by fostering through water culture,
    and water security issues provide valuable feedback. Reservoir engineering was
    conducted throughout the developmental stage. Reservoirs are a vital water conservancy
    engineering measure and important indicators of water cultural material forms
    and water engineering technology. With the evolution of the water culture stage,
    the disaster-resistant hydraulic phase of water security problems has been highlighted
    by losses caused by droughts and floods. To mitigate the impacts of droughts and
    floods on agricultural development, the government issued a document to initiate
    reservoir construction. At the irrigation hydraulics stage, water security problems
    are more mainly involve water shortages. Water shortages affect the development
    of agriculture and ultimately limit the development of urban, and rural, ecological,
    and economic societies. Currently, the government must implement hydraulic engineering
    measures to ease pressure on agricultural water use. Reservoir scheduling has
    gradually changed from a conventional scheduling mode focuses on pollution prevention
    and profitability objectives (flood control, power generation, water supply, and
    irrigation) to an ecological scheduling mode that considers water ecosystem downstream
    of the reservoir and in the reservoir area (Lei et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023).
    In the resource hydraulic phase, the problem of water pollution remains severe,
    affecting the water environment and the safety of the basin. At this time, the
    government issued a policy to build water conservancy projects, mainly water diversion
    projects, to protect the safety of water sources. However, during the ecological
    hydraulic phase, the deterioration of water ecosystems, threats to ecosystem health,
    and the degradation of wetlands affect the ecological security of watersheds.
    The current policies protect the safety of rural drinking water, favor water conservation,
    and maintain the sustainable development of water resources. Moreover, under the
    guidance of the government, the awareness of water conservation and water ecology
    protection among the masses is increasing, indicating a top-down governance mode.
    Policies will favor the governance of water safety problems at different stages
    of water culture, and water safety problems after governance will reflect the
    appropriateness of government policies at that time. 4. Discussion The success
    or failure of many water policies and management practices depends on their ability
    to deal with complex human-water relationships. Our study revealed the evolution
    of water culture and its valuable feedback on water security, providing a new
    perspective for combating water security challenges. The results show that the
    evolution phases of water culture changes and water security in the WRB are relatively
    consistent with existing research results (Lu et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2015).
    Although our findings were empirical, they are significant for future theoretical
    research. In addition, our co-evolutionary water culture-water security framework
    links water culture change with its water security evolution. Therefore, it can
    provide a clear roadmap for the future governance of water security issues by
    identifying the state (phase) of water culture and which policies and engineering
    should be used to manage water crises based on the water security issues that
    have emerged at each stage. In future studies, it will be possible to simulate
    and predict the evolutionary dynamics of water security under future policies
    and provide feedback on the appropriateness of policies based on their current
    state in conjunction with different water security outcomes. Our approach could
    be helpful for policy development in other watershed management systems with long
    histories of development. The evolving relationship between water culture and
    water security is reflected in the development of WRB. Early in the establishment
    of the country, the theme of water culture mainly focused on meeting human needs,
    especially for agricultural irrigation and farmland water conservancy construction.
    This phase focuses on ensuring that sufficient water resources are available to
    support livelihoods and agricultural production, and that soil and water conservation
    are integrated into farmland infrastructure and primary agricultural production,
    and human water needs are guaranteed (Ping et al., 2013). However, with the development
    of times and improvement in awareness, water resource management has gradually
    transformed from water supply management to water demand management. The government
    introduced a series of policies and regulations, including rational water allocation,
    water abstraction permit management, water pricing policies, and water pollution
    prevention to cope with new water safety requirements (Chen et al., 2020; Kim,
    2008). During this period, the theme of water culture gradually expanded from
    the single construction and management of farmland water conservancy to a more
    integrated river governance and water resource management oriented towards water
    scarcity and the ecological environment. The focus of water conservancy investment
    has gradually shifted towards water supply, and investment in water conservation
    and ecological fields has begun. The last two stages of water culture development
    focus on sustainable development that supports human and ecological needs. Since
    the Tenth Five-Year Plan period (2001–2005), policy themes have shifted to water
    resource management and the ecological environment. While investment in water
    resources is still focused on flood prevention and removal, investment in water
    supply is gradually increasing. Investments in soil and water conservation and
    ecological protection are also emerging. In 2011, the Central Government emphasized
    the most stringent water resource management system and vigorously developed water
    conservancy for livelihoods, highlighting the critical role of water conservancy
    in safeguarding the economy, ecology, and national security (Cheng et al., 2022;
    Zuo et al., 2014). The core themes of water culture are water resource management
    policies and sustainable development goals and plans. The government prioritized
    water saving in all aspects. It has implemented a comprehensive water resource
    management program that includes water disaster prevention and control, water
    resource conservation, water ecology protection and restoration, and water environment
    management. The water culture of this period focused more on conformity with and
    protection of nature, emphasizing conservation, protection, and ecological priorities.
    Policy is a tool that reflects the cultural perceptions of water. Different policies
    have evolved to reflect changes in society''s perceptions of water culture and
    water safety. This change reflects advances in technology and knowledge, growing
    awareness of water resources, and expanding understanding of water security issues
    (Bakker, 2012; Werdiningtyas et al., 2020b). Thus, policy as a tool for expressing
    social perceptions provides a window into the mutually evolutionary relationship
    between water culture and water security (Bakker, 2012). An analysis of past policies
    and practices can facilitate the understanding of current state of water culture
    and security. This understanding allows policymakers to refrain from adopting
    new policy instruments without adequate knowledge of the past and current circumstances.
    In contrast, the government can guide governance changes based on an in-depth
    analysis and provide more effective solutions. Water culture requires a comprehensive
    and systematic approach for managing water security issues. In the past, water
    security management has often focused on solving single problems, such as flood
    control, irrigation, and water supply. However, water security is often a complex
    systemic issue that must be considered holistically. The state of water culture
    and the evolving relationship with water security can provide decision-makers
    with a more comprehensive and systematic perspective, facilitating their understanding
    of the nature of the problem towards the development of improved solutions. This
    study argues that future policies should strengthen ecological restoration and
    governance, improve water and sand regulation, and flood prevention, and disaster
    mitigation systems, and build a synergistic watershed management institutional
    mechanism. At the same time, this paper argues that the research results can be
    applied to water resources management and benefit the society through the following
    points. (1) Developing an integrated water security policy: Based on the results
    of the study, it is recommended that a more integrated and systematic water security
    policy be developed. (2) Focus on long-term planning: By understanding past changes
    in water culture, it is possible to better predict possible future problems and
    take effective measures to ensure water security. (3) Strengthening social participation:
    The government can increase social participation in water resources management
    and jointly promote water security by conducting public education and collecting
    public opinions through the Internet. (4) Technological innovation and sustainable
    development: When formulating water resources management policies, new technologies
    and sustainable development strategies should be considered. (5) Periodic assessment
    and adjustment: With social, economic and environmental changes, policies need
    to be flexible and adaptable to meet new water security challenges and needs.
    In conclusion, it is also necessary to continuously explore new directions, technologies,
    and strategies to adapt to the ever-changing challenges of water culture and water
    security and achieve the goal of high-quality development. It is important to
    note that quantitative analyses of water culture change are in a static form,
    limiting the ability to unravel the dynamic structural information inherent in
    the underlying knowledge. Moreover, the completeness of data samples and the depth
    of word frequency interpretations will have different impacts on the study of
    water culture. It should be noted that the social value of water culture in terms
    of the policy identified in this study is only a rough reflection of reality.
    Only policy indicators were selected to reflect the ideology of water culture.
    The next step is to incorporate the material aspects of water culture to provide
    a more representative view of the sustainable development of water resources.
    The water safety indicators examined in this study may have led to less precise
    conclusions because of their reliance on statistical data, which can be difficult
    to gather within specific time frames and from various sources. Addressing these
    challenges require further research and exploration. It is essential to go beyond
    word frequency analysis to quantify water culture and explore more novel methods
    for improved understanding. The mechanisms through which water culture influences
    the water system should be explored to anticipate future changes, with the ultimate
    goal of defining, realizing, and maintaining a desirable or sustainable state
    of water resources. 5. Conclusions This study conducted a quantitative analysis
    of water culture changes and water security issues and found that the evolution
    of water culture is consistent with the policies, water conservancy development
    stages, and water security issues at the periods analyzed. By studying the change
    process in the ideological policies of water culture, it is possible to have a
    better understanding of the mutual feedback relationship between water culture
    and water security, which is key to ensuring the sustainable use of water resources
    in the future. Policy changes in WRB over the last hundred years were chosen as
    the research object, and the evolution of water culture was analyzed based on
    existing collected policy documents with sub-word statistical calculations. The
    mutual feedback relationship between water culture and water security is then
    explored through a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of water security indicators.
    The main findings are as follows. The development and evolution of water culture
    in the Weihe River Basin has undergone four phases: Disaster-resistant Hydraulic
    Phase, Irrigation Hydraulic Phase, Resources Hydraulic Phase, Ecological Hydraulic
    Phase. The results of the water safety evaluation show that more attention is
    paid to water disaster safety in the stage of disaster-resistant hydraulic; more
    attention is paid to water resources safety in the irrigation hydraulic phase;
    more attention is paid to water environment safety in the resources hydraulic
    phase; and more attention is paid to water ecological safety in the ecological
    hydraulic phase. However, the current water policy is biased towards solving current
    water security problems, and this single perspective may limit the breadth and
    depth of the policy. In the future, the government could examine the issue of
    water security from a more comprehensive perspective and combine it with historical
    development experiences to formulate a more comprehensive and sustainable water
    security policy. Funding This work was supported by the National Natural Science

  description: Urban wastewater reuse for agriculture provides reliable nutrient-rich
    water, reduces water stress, and strengthens food systems. However, wastewater
    reuse also presents health risks and characterizing the spatial dynamics of wastewater
    can help optimize risk mitigation. We conducted comparative risk analysis of exposure
    to wastewater in irrigation canals, where we compared those exposed to a) treated
    vs. untreated wastewater, and b) wastewater upstream vs. downstream from communities
    in the Mezquital Valley. The canal system with treated wastewater was sampled
    prior to being treated, directly after treatment, as well as before and after
    it flowed through a community. Along the canal system that carried untreated wastewater,
    we sampled before and after a community. We quantified the concentrations of bacterial,
    protozoal, and viral pathogens in the wastewater. Pathogen concentration data
    were used to calculate measures of relative risk between sampling points. Wastewater
    treatment reduced predicted bacterial pathogen infection risk in post-treatment
    locations (RR = 0.73, 95 % CI 0.61, 0.87), with no evidence of similar reductions
    in Giardia or viral pathogens (RR = 1.02, 95 % CI 0.56, 1.86 and RR = 1.18, 95
    % CI 0.70, 2.02 respectively). Although infection risk decreased further down
    the canals, infection risk increased for bacterial pathogens after our sentinel
    community (RR = 1.94, 95 % 1.34, 2.86). For Giardia and viral pathogens infection
    risk was elevated but not significantly. We found similar evidence for increases
    in risk when comparing the treated section of the canal system with a canal section
    whose wastewater was not treated, i.e., the risk benefits of wastewater treatment
    were lost after our sentinel community for bacteria (RR = 5.27 vs. 2.08 for sampling
    points before and after our sentinel community respectively) and for Giardia (RR
    = 6.98 vs. 3.35 respectively). The increase in risk after transit through communities
    could have resulted from local community recontamination of the treated wastewater
    stream.

    • Wastewater treatment reduced predicted bacterial pathogen risks in post-treatment
    locations. • Risks increased for bacterial pathogens after canal water moved through
    our sentinel community. • Increase in risk after transit through communities could
    be from local community recontamination of the wastewater stream. Abstract Urban
    wastewater reuse for agriculture provides reliable nutrient-rich water, reduces
    water stress, and strengthens food systems. However, wastewater reuse also presents

    being treated, directly after treatment, as well as before and after it flowed
    through a community. Along the canal system that carried untreated wastewater,
    we sampled before and after a community. We quantified the concentrations of bacterial,
    protozoal, and viral pathogens in the wastewater. Pathogen concentration data
    were used to calculate measures of relative risk between sampling points. Wastewater
    treatment reduced predicted bacterial pathogen infection risk in post-treatment
    locations (RR = 0.73, 95 % CI 0.61, 0.87), with no evidence of similar reductions
    in Giardia or viral pathogens (RR = 1.02, 95 % CI 0.56, 1.86 and RR = 1.18, 95
    % CI 0.70, 2.02 respectively). Although infection risk decreased further down
    the canals, infection risk increased for bacterial pathogens after our sentinel
    community (RR = 1.94, 95 % 1.34, 2.86). For Giardia and viral pathogens infection
    risk was elevated but not significantly. We found similar evidence for increases
    in risk when comparing the treated section of the canal system with a canal section
    whose wastewater was not treated, i.e., the risk benefits of wastewater treatment
    were lost after our sentinel community for bacteria (RR = 5.27 vs. 2.08 for sampling
    points before and after our sentinel community respectively) and for Giardia (RR
    = 6.98 vs. 3.35 respectively). The increase in risk after transit through communities
    could have resulted from local community recontamination of the treated wastewater
    stream. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res image (106KB) Download

    WastewaterWastewater treatmentPathogensRiskCommunities 1. Introduction Untreated
    urban wastewater reuse for agriculture is an important climate change adaptation
    strategy in areas where droughts are expected to increase in duration and intensity.
    One important adaptation is the production of reliable nutrient-rich water that
    reduces water stress and the draining of aquifers, thereby strengthening food
    systems (Keraita et al., 2003; Bradford et al., 2003; Thebo et al., 2017). However,
    untreated urban waste flows can also present health risks to farmers and their
    communities (Okoh et al., 2010; Naidoo and Olaniran, 2013; Al-Gheethi et al.,
    2018; Contreras et al., 2017; Dickin et al., 2016; Blumenthal et al., 2000; Contreras
    et al., 2020) due to both organic contaminants such as enteric pathogens and inorganic
    contaminants such as chemicals and metals (Dickin et al., 2016). Treating urban
    wastewater streams before they are used by farmers can reduce risks. Local communities
    downstream from a treatment plant, however, can recontaminate the treated wastewater,
    negating the regional effectiveness of the treatment process. This is of concern
    when a wastewater treatment plant is situated upstream from communities and agricultural
    fields. To estimate the relative risk of external and local community contamination,
    we collected and quantified pathogen concentrations at various sites along wastewater
    canals in the Mezquital Valley, in Hidalgo, Mexico, and calculated the relative
    risk of infection between sampling points based on their location relative to
    communities and the wastewater treatment plant. Our overall goal is to conduct
    a comparative risk analysis of the exposure to canal wastewater, where we compare
    those exposed to a) treated vs. untreated canal water and b) canal water upstream
    vs. downstream from communities. Secondarily we are interested in how these relative
    risks are modified by pathogen type (virus, bacteria, and protozoan). The Mezquital
    Valley is an agricultural belt that for over 100 years has received raw untreated
    wastewater from Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) through a series of uncovered
    canals (Siemens et al., 2008). This wastewater has been used for irrigation in
    the Mezquital Valley, currently one of the largest wastewater dependent agricultural
    areas in the world (Jimenez and Chavez, 2000). The World Health Organization (WHO)
    has been interested in the health consequences of this region for decades due
    to pathogen exposures either through direct contact by farmers or indirect contact
    by community members (Siemens et al., 2008). These water quality related health
    concerns prompted the construction of the Atotonilco Wastewater Treatment Plant
    (AWTP). Although the plant has been operational since 2017, only a portion of
    the wastewater from the MCMA is treated, resulting in a complex exposure profile.
    The opening of the wastewater treatment plant provided a unique opportunity to
    estimate the degree to which wastewater treatment decreased infection risk, and
    whether local community contamination might negate the benefits of wastewater
    treatment on infection risk. A drawback of many previous wastewater pathogen surveillance
    studies has been the lack of accurate pathogen concentration data (Hamadieh et
    al., 2021). Traditionally, pathogen contamination had been measured using fecal
    indicator bacteria (FIB) such as enterococcal bacteria and fecal Escherichia coli,
    which, though easy to detect, are often poorly correlated with the concentrations
    of pathogens (Lamparelli et al., 2015; Harwood et al., 2005; Ferguson et al.,
    2012; Baker et al., 2018). Despite this, pathogen concentrations have often been
    estimated using a pathogen to FIB conversion ratio (Hamadieh et al., 2021; Navab-Daneshmand
    et al., 2018; Pickering et al., 2018; Ngure et al., 2013; Ercumen et al., 2018),
    and used in risk assessments. This has been demonstrated to result in an underestimation
    of infection risk (Owusu-Ansah et al., 2017). With the advent of new technology
    platforms, such as droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), we now can accurately measure
    pathogen concentrations, negating the need to use FIB and conversion ratios. To
    assess the impact of the AWTP and the local community-released sewage, in 2019
    we collected water samples from six locations that provide measures: 1) along
    treated and untreated canals, 2) before and after the AWTP, and 3) before and
    after canals passed through downstream communities in the Mezquital Valley. From
    these water samples we quantified the concentration of a range of bacterial, protozoal,
    and viral pathogens in wastewater. We then use pathogen-specific dose-response
    functions to transform the pathogen data into epidemiological measures of relative
    infection risk (Capone et al., 2022; Brouwer et al., 2018). 2. Methods 2.1. Sampling
    locations and strategy The Mezquital Valley receives wastewater from MCMA through
    two primary canal systems. The first carries wastewater through underground tunnels
    (the Túnel Emisor Oriente, and the Emisor Central) and two above-ground canals
    (the Interceptor Poniente), which mixes with the El Salto River delivering untreated
    wastewater to the AWTP. The AWTP is located at the entrance to the Mezquital Valley.
    The second system, the Gran Canal de Desagüe, carries wastewater from MCMA without
    any treatment processing; the Gran Canal is both an above-ground canal and a subterranean
    tunnel at different points. Each canal system carries approximately half of the
    wastewater from MCMA and serves a different irrigation district. We sampled across
    both canal systems. We collected water samples from four locations along the canal
    system that is treated by the AWTP and two locations along the canal system that
    is not treated. Detailed site descriptions are provided in the Supplementary Materials
    (Table S1). Sampling points along the treated canal system: We first sampled the
    treated canal segment at a location on a river carrying influent (untreated wastewater)
    to the AWTP (labelled El Salto). The main influent stream into the wastewater
    treatment plant passes through an underground tunnel directly from MCMA and mixes
    with the influent from El Salto inside the AWTP. Since we did not have access
    to the main influent stream, we sampled the influent from El Salto, which might
    not accurately reflect the pathogen loads in the plant influent (Fig. 1). Download

    Map of our sampling points within the Mezquital Valley. Sampling points were selected
    to capture the variability in risk along two canal systems that flow from the
    MCMA; these canals are not shown on the above map. Along the first canal system
    (Canal Group A), we sampled at four locations: El Salto (N = 12), which lies along
    the river carrying influent to the AWTP; San José (N = 16), which resides just
    downstream from the AWTP; San Marcos (N = 16), which is further downstream but
    upstream from the community of El Llano; and El Llano (N = 20), which resides
    just downstream from the community of El Llano. The last three of these sampling
    sites are along a canal with treated water. The two remaining sampling points
    (Canal Group B) lie along a canal carrying untreated wastewater. Tetepango (N
    = 20) is upstream from the community of Ajacuba and the sampling point of Ajacuba
    (N = 16) is just downstream from Ajacuba. We then sampled three locations downstream
    from the AWTP. The first, San José, is located just downstream from the AWTP.
    The second, San Marcos, is located further downstream just upstream from a community
    known as El Llano. The third, El Llano, is located just downstream of the community
    of El Llano (Fig. 1). Sampling points along the untreated canal system: To capture
    community contamination of untreated wastewater we focused on two sampling locations
    along the untreated Gran Canal de Desagüe system, labelled Tetepango and Ajacuba,
    that are located upstream and downstream from the community of Ajacuba (Fig. 1).
    We ensured that each sampling location was in a public area, accessible and feasible
    for sampling. Between 12 and 20 samples were collected from each location over
    multiple days for a total of 100 samples. For any given day we aimed to collect
    eight water samples, approximately 1–2 h apart from the early morning to the early
    evening. Data collection occurred over 12 days in March 2019 during the dry season.
    Sampling sites for a particular day were selected based on logistical considerations
    and were sampled in pairs as follows: El Salto and San Jose; San Marcos and El
    Llano; and Tetepango and Ajacuba. The number of samples that we were able to obtain
    from each location depended on how early we could get to a location and if it
    was safe and feasible to sample on a particular day. Each pair of sites was sampled
    on a single day, taking three-four days to cycle through all three site pairs.
    All sites were sampled over two days, except Tetepango which was sampled over
    three days because of logistical considerations (Fig. 2). Download : Download

    sample locations in the Mezquital Valley, Hidalgo. WWTP represents the wastewater
    treatment plant. 2.2. Sample collection At each sampling point we dipped a 3-gallon
    plastic bucket attached to a rope into a canal and ensured that the bucket touched
    the bottom of the canal. The submerged bucket was then moved against the water
    stream to ensure that we sampled up and down the water column in a canal. On retrieving
    the bucket from the canal, 100 mL of water was measured out of the bucket and
    poured into sterile plastic containers. The bucket was not disinfected between
    samples. We did however ensure that there was no residual water left in the bucket
    prior to sampling other locations. All collected samples were stored in the trunk
    of the field car before transport to a field laboratory at the end of the day
    for processing after approximately 6–8 h. 2.3. DNA and RNA extraction DNA and
    RNA were extracted from the water samples using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA/RNA MiniKit
    (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). This kit was selected because the DNA/RNA Shield
    ensures the stability of samples at ambient temperatures for >30 days (Zymobiomics,
    n.d.). Prior to extraction, water samples were adjusted to 2.5 mM MgCl2 and pH
    10.0 before being vacuum filtered through 0.45 μm nitrocellulose filters, which
    were then transferred to DNA/RNA Shield Lysis tubes (Baker et al., 2018; Haramoto
    et al., 2012). On average we filtered 91.9 mL (standard deviation = 12.1 mL) of
    water through each filter. Two negative field controls were created each day,
    one by rinsing three randomly selected collection containers with 100 mL of sterile
    water and then filtering the water, and another by running 100 mL of sterile water
    through three randomly selected nitrocellulose filters. Samples were processed
    within three weeks of collection as per manufacturer''s protocol. Prior to processing,
    one third of the samples were randomly spiked with MS2 to ensure the integrity
    of both the extraction and the PCR reaction. The quality and concentration of
    the extracted nucleic acids was measured using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo
    Scientific, Waltham, MA). After quantification, sample dilutions were created
    for use in ddPCR assays. All samples were stored at −80 °C. One to two days prior
    to performing ddPCR assays, sample dilutions were moved out to −20 °C. 2.4. Droplet
    digital PCR Sample pathogen loads were quantified using the QX200™ Droplet Digital™
    PCR (ddPCR) system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). On the day of the ddPCR assay, all
    samples were diluted 1:10 to minimize the likelihood of inhibition (Baker et al.,
    2018; Espira et al., 2021). Reaction and cycling conditions are provided in Text
    S1 and Table S3 in the Supporting Information. On completion of the thermocycling,
    plates were read using the QX200™ Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and QuantaSoft™
    software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Samples were screened for four bacteria (enteroaggregative
    E. coli (EAEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC),
    and Shigella), one protozoan (Giardia lamblia), and three viruses (rotavirus,
    norovirus GI, and norovirus GII). 2.5. Sample quantification Samples were quantified
    as described previously (Pinheiro et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2015; Nshimyimana
    et al., 2018). Briefly, QuantaSoft™ software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was first
    used to exclude from analysis all samples with <10,000 accepted droplets. Partition
    volume was assumed to be as predefined by the QuantaSoft™ software (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
    CA). No template controls established by running the PCR reactions without a nucleic
    acid template were used to set thresholds for differentiating negative from positive
    droplets by defining cutoff thresholds one standard deviation above the negative
    droplets on the no template controls (Cao et al., 2015; Nshimyimana et al., 2018).
    Following the setting of the threshold, all wells were visually inspected to ensure
    that the thresholding was correct. Wells with less than three positive droplets
    were considered negative and assigned a value equal to the limit of detection
    divided by 2 (LOD/2) (Hites, 2019). All samples where one of the duplicates failed
    to generate >10,000 droplets or where duplicates had a coefficient of variation
    greater >10 % were re-run. Similarly for rotavirus, samples that were above the
    quantifiable range (i.e., all the droplets were positive) were further diluted
    accordingly and re-run. Final concentrations of gene copies per millimeter of
    water were obtained by multiplying by appropriate dilution factors. A ddPCR checklist
    based on both, the Minimum Information for Publication of Digital PCR Experiments
    (dMIQE) and the Environmental Microbiology Minimum Information (EMMI) guidelines,
    is provided along with Supporting Information (Borchardt et al., 2021; Whale et
    al., 2020). 2.6. Statistical analysis Mean gene counts and Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests
    were used to assess differences in gene counts by location. Non-detect samples
    were represented as LOD/2 in Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. We used the fitdistrplus
    (Pouillot and Delignette-Muller, 2010) package in R (R version 4.1.0, R Foundation
    for Statistical Computing, Vienna) to fit a log-normal distribution to the measured
    concentrations of each pathogen. We then used parametric bootstrapping (n = 100)
    to obtain the mean and standard deviations of the fitted distributions. The generated
    log normal distribution was then randomly sampled to generate 100 pathogen concentration
    values. These bootstrapped pathogen concentration values were then used as inputs
    into the models that estimate the risk of direct exposure to wastewater during
    farming activities. Because we do not have farmer exposure data for the Mezquital
    Valley, we looked to the literature to obtain a value for the volume of water
    ingested parameter. A prior risk assessment study by Kouamé et al. (2017) used
    a mean of 10 mL and a standard deviation of 15 mL per day (Kouamé et al., 2017).
    However, the source of this value is unclear. Given recreational exposures through
    swimming often use an ingestion rate of >30 mL of water per hour (Dufour et al.,
    2017), we decided to use a smaller value for volume ingested when farming (mean
    of 5 mL and a standard deviation of 2 mL per day with a normal distribution).
    In a subsequent sensitivity analysis, we doubled and halved this value to account
    for our uncertainty in this estimate. Given our outcome variable is relative risk,
    any error in the ingestion rate value would be attenuated if the ingestion rates
    do not differ by sampling site. Because we lacked site specific information, we
    assumed an average volume ingested and pathogen viability (i.e., the proportion
    of pathogens identified by ddPCR that were viable to obtain dose estimates). We
    then conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of these assumptions.
    Our dose response models comprised different functions depending on the pathogen
    being modeled (see Table S9). Our Supplementary Information describes model equations
    and parameters in detail. We generated 365 estimates of daily risk, which we used
    to calculate an annual infection risk estimate (See Text S4 SI) (Capone et al.,
    2022). As in Capone et al. (2022), we repeated this process 100 times. The median
    annual risk of infection linked to each pathogen measurement was used as the outcome
    variable for hypothesis testing (Capone et al., 2022). We modeled each of the
    sampling locations separately. For the estimation of relative risk between two
    sampling locations, we generated datasets consisting of 100 pairs of annual risks
    of infection and pathogen count data (Capone et al., 2022). Risk ratios (RR) comparing
    sampling sites were calculated using unadjusted Poisson models with robust standard
    errors. In all models sampling locations were defined as the independent variable,
    while the estimated annual risk of infection by pathogen was the dependent variable.
    To assess the impact of mis-specifying either the dose ingested or the percent
    pathogen viable, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by simulating our risk model
    where the number of viable pathogens were doubled and halved. Since dose is the
    product of the proportion of viable pathogens and the amount of water ingested,
    a doubling can reflect an individual ingesting twice as much water or ingesting
    the same amount of water where the proportion of viable pathogens is twice as
    many. All analysis was done using R (R version 4.1.0, R Foundation for Statistical
    Computing, Vienna). The sandwich package was used to obtain robust standard errors
    for the Poisson models (Zeileis, 2006). RRs from an analysis that did not use
    parametric bootstrapping for pathogen concentration data are also presented for
    comparison (SI Tables S10 and S11). 3. Results 3.1. Site specific pathogen loads
    In the canal that carried treated wastewater, we observed decreases in bacterial
    pathogen (EAEC, EPEC, ETEC, and Shigella) and protozoal (G. lamblia) gene counts
    following treatment (Fig. 3a–e and SI Table S6). Gene counts further declined
    with distance from the treatment plant. The lowest gene counts were recorded at
    San Marcos (Ranging from 1.22 log10 for EAEC to 2.67 log10 for ETEC). After transit
    through communities, we observed an increase in bacterial pathogen and protozoal
    gene counts, measured at El Llano (EAEC = 2.43 log10 and ETEC = 3.70 log10). Decreases
    in viral pathogen (norovirus GI, norovirus GII, and rotavirus) gene counts were
    not as pronounced following water treatment compared to the bacteria counts, and
    only modest increases in viral loads were observed after transit though communities
    (San Marcos: rotavirus =8.43 log10, norovirus GI = 2.95 log10, norovirus GII =
    2.58 log10, El Llano: rotavirus = 8.43 1og10, norovirus GI log10 = 3.02, norovirus
    GII log10 = 2.90) (Fig. 3f–h and SI Table S6). Download : Download high-res image

    the median value, the outer horizontal lines represent the 25th and 75th percentile.
    The vertical lines represent the minimum and maximum values. Unlike bacteria and
    Giardia, there were no statistically significant differences in rotavirus, norovirus
    GI, and norovirus GII gene loads before and after transit through communities
    (SI Tables S8a–S8h). In the untreated wastewater canal, bacterial pathogen, and
    G. lamblia gene counts decreased after transit through communities (3.01 log10
    vs 2.82 log10, p-value = 0.55), whereas rotavirus, norovirus GI, and norovirus
    GII gene counts increased after transit through communities (10.27 log10 vs 10.56
    log 10, p-value = 0.07, 3.33 log10 vs 3.91 log10, p-value = 0.14, and 3.24 log10
    vs 3.66 log10, p-value = 0.06, respectively) (SI Tables S7 and S8a–S8h). 3.2.
    Relative infection risk on the treated wastewater stream Relative to untreated
    plant influent (El Salto), we observed a decrease in risk at San José for pooled
    bacteria (RR = 0.73, 95 % CI 0.61, 0.81) and for EPEC (RR = 0.59, 95 % CI 0.41,
    0.84). Other measurements were not significant, though rotavirus has a strong
    point estimate with wide confidence intervals (RR = 0.55, 95 % CI 0.19, 1.44)
    (Fig. 4a). Given that we were unable to sample the main plant influent stream,
    however, the decrease in risk that we measured may not accurately reflect the
    overall effectiveness of wastewater treatment. Download : Download high-res image

    B) Risk ratios at San Marcos relative to El Salto measuring the cumulative impact

    Relative to the untreated plant influent (El Salto) infection risk was lowest
    at San Marcos (treated wastewater before transit through the communities), with
    EAEC (RR = 0.03, 95 % CI 0.01, 0.12) having the lowest risk (Fig. 4b). Relative
    to San Marcos (treated wastewater before transit through the communities), the
    sampling point after the communities (El Llano) showed an increase in risk for
    many pathogens. Rotavirus (RR = 0.99, 95 % CI 0.27, 3.60) having no elevated risk
    and EAEC having the highest risk (RR = 4.49, 95 % CI 0.95, 43.96) (Fig. 4c). The
    pooled bacteria measure showed elevated infection risk (RR = 1.94, 95 % CI 1.34,
    2.86), while the pooled virus measure did not (RR = 1.14, 95 % CI 0.58, 2.26).
    3.3. Relative infection risk on the untreated wastewater steam In untreated wastewater,
    relative to the collection point before the community (Tetepango), infection risk
    was lower after transit through the community for all bacterial pathogens (RR
    ranging from 0.43 and 0.72) except Shigella (RR = 1.15, 95 % CI 0.81, 1.64). Viral
    pathogens had elevated infection risk (RR = 1.44 95 % CI 0.99, 2.12 for the pooled
    viruses) (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (320KB) Download : Download

    canals We also compared the treated section of the canal system with a second
    nearby canal section whose wastewater was not treated. After wastewater treatment,
    we found higher infection risk along the untreated canal at Tetepango compared
    with San Marcos along the treated canal for pooled bacterial pathogens, Giardia,
    and pooled viral pathogens (5.27, 95 % CI 3.82, 7.46; RR = 6.98, 95 % CI 3.53,
    15.83; and RR = 2.82, 95 % CI 1.63, 5.15, respectively) (Fig. 6a). After transiting
    through communities, risk was still higher in the untreated wastewater stream
    (relative to reference point El Llano on the treated canal) but attenuated. Pooled
    bacteria decreased in risk from RR = 5.27 to RR = 2.08. Giardia decreased in risk
    from RR = 6.98 to RR = 3.35. Pooled viral risk was not attenuated (Fig. 6b). More

    with treated water at San Marcos (A) and untreated water after transit through
    communities at Ajacuba with treated water after transit through communities at
    El Llano (B). 3.5. Sensitivity analysis on exposure In our sensitivity analysis
    we found that doubling and halving the dose ingested (due to either mis specification
    of the volume of water ingested or the proportion of viable pathogens measured)
    has no impact on our conclusions (SI Table S12). Protective estimates remained
    protective and risk estimates remain a risk. We ran our sensitivity analysis twice
    (increasing and decreasing the ingestion parameter) across 8 pathogens and 4 paired
    sites for a total of 64 relative risk estimates. In only one case did a significant
    result become non-significant and in 3 cases a non-significant result became significant.
    4. Discussion The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) state that moving human
    waste away from its source is not an adequate or sustainable solution for waste
    management (United Nations, U, n.d.). The Mezquital Valley is an example of such
    a system where waste is moved away from its source (MCMA) and utilized downstream,
    historically without any treatment. The construction of the AWTP is therefore
    a positive step by Mexico to align with SDG goals. Our findings, however, highlight
    shortcomings inherent in constructing a wastewater treatment plant upstream of
    communities without their own treatment infrastructure and highlight the heterogeneity
    in infection risk that occurs as a result. First, we found evidence of recontamination
    of treated wastewater by local communities downstream of the AWTP (Fig. 4), partially
    negating the benefits of wastewater treatment (SI Text S5, Fig. S1). Second, we
    show that recontamination of the treated wastewater is differential by pathogen
    type, resulting in a complex risk profile in downstream communities (Fig. 4).
    The pathogen type risk differential that we observed is likely a result of both
    the wastewater treatment process and intrinsic pathogen and location specific
    environmental factors. Community recontamination was highlighted by our finding
    in the treated canals system that compared to our sampling point at San Marcos,
    upstream from El Llano, pathogen concentrations substantially increased after
    transit through the community of El Llano. We estimated that the risk of bacterial
    infection was 1.94 (95 % CI 1.34–2.86) times higher when exposed to treated canal
    water downstream compared to upstream of El Lano (Fig. 4). Site specific risk
    comparisons between the treated and untreated canals also showed the impact of
    community recontamination, where the risk differences between the treated and
    untreated water streams diminished after transit through communities with EAEC
    having a RR = 21.22 (95 % 5.75, 179.56) before transit through a community to
    having an attenuated RR = 2.15 (95 % CI 0.88, 5.84) after transit through a community
    (Fig. 6). Viral gene counts and the resulting infection risk, on the other hand,
    showed much smaller variations than what we observed with bacterial pathogens
    and G. lamblia. The decrease in bacterial risk (RR = 0.77, 95 % CI 0.63, 0.94)
    after transit through a community that we observed on the untreated wastewater
    canal reinforces that recontamination is context and pathogen dependent (Fig.
    5). This decrease in risk along the untreated canal system could be explained
    by two phenomena. First, we observed that much of the untreated sewage from MCMA
    was diverted prior to reaching Ajacuba through multiple smaller canals running
    off the main canal carrying wastewater for the irrigation of agricultural fields.
    Second, community wastewater from Ajacuba was being injected into the main canal
    as it transited under the community. If the waste stream from Ajacuba had less
    contamination than the waste stream from MCMA, these two phenomena would result
    in dilution of the contamination. Recontamination of treated wastewater has been
    documented in other locations. For example, a study from Burkina Faso found that
    although only non-viable helminthic cysts were present in the effluent of a treatment
    plant, both helminthic eggs and cysts were detected in irrigation canals fed by
    the effluent (Kpoda et al., 2016). An accompanying epidemiological study found
    that open defecation was occurring near the irrigation canals, likely recontaminating
    the treated effluent (Kpoda et al., 2016). In a study of the diversity and abundance
    of bacterial pathogens in Chinese urban rivers, Cui et al. (2019) concluded that
    the high concentrations of bacterial pathogens in the rivers are likely the result
    of human fecal pathogen contamination from sewer overflow, and sewage discharge
    both bypassing the treatment plant (Cui et al., 2019). These studies along with
    ours highlight how the placement of water treatment infrastructure is critical
    in mitigating the risk to downstream communities. Infection risk to downstream
    communities depended on the pathogen, as we found that the level of recontamination
    varied by pathogen type. In the treated wastewater, we observed significant decreases
    in bacterial pathogen and G. lamblia gene counts post-treatment, decreasing with
    distance from the wastewater treatment plant (Fig. 3). One explanation for the
    risk differential between viral and bacterial pathogens may be due to the differential
    effectiveness of wastewater treatment. The AWTP is designed to use two treatment
    lines (Acciona, n.d.): a conventional biological treatment line for treating average
    flows, as was the case during our sampling period, and a physico-chemical treatment
    line for use during the rainy season or whenever flows exceed the conventional
    biological treatment capacity of the plant. Conventional biological treatment
    at the AWTP consists of five steps; 1) a pretreatment step to remove coarse solids,
    sands, grease, and oil from the raw wastewater, 2) a primary treatment step, the
    primary decantation process, to remove organic and inorganic solids by sedimentation
    and the skimming of floating scum, 3) a secondary biological treatment process
    to further remove residual organics and suspended solids, 4) a second decantation
    process, and 5) a final disinfection step through the injection of chloride gas
    (Wastewater treatment and use in agriculture - FAO irrigation and drainage paper
    47, n.d.; Nogarin, 2014). Pathogens respond differentially to each step of the
    conventional biological treatment process, which in turn results in differential
    exposure and risk profiles for communities downstream of the treatment plant by
    pathogen type (Aw and Gin, 2010; Mcminn et al., 2018; Dias et al., 2018; Dias
    et al., 2015). The primary sedimentation step is least effective of the steps
    for pathogen removal, being only effective in partially removing helminth eggs
    (Dillon and Schrale, 1993). The secondary treatment process does not reliably
    remove protozoa and helminth eggs and without the use of a disinfection step,
    removal of bacteria and viruses is low (Dillon and Schrale, 1993). The use of
    chloride gas in the final disinfection step results in the effective removal of
    bacteria, however protozoa, helminth eggs and certain viruses are resistant to
    chlorine (Dillon and Schrale, 1993). Under optimal conditions, the last disinfection
    step should inactivate 1–3 log units of viruses, 2 log units of bacteria, only
    0–1.5 log units of protozoan cysts and almost no helminth eggs (Dillon and Schrale,
    1993). However, our use of ddPCR to quantify pathogen concentrations in the water
    may not accurately capture the efficiency of these treatment processes because
    ddPCR detects both viable and unviable pathogens. Pathogen-specific responses
    to environmental factors may also account for the observed risk differential between
    viruses, bacterial pathogens, and G. lamblia. We noted a significant decline in
    bacterial pathogen and G. lamblia gene counts between San José (directly after
    AWTP) and San Marcos (prior to transit through communities). This decline could
    be driven by sunlight enhanced inactivation of pathogens between these two points.
    The water was notably clearer at these two points, potentially enhancing pathogen
    decay, while the higher concentration of solid contamination in the untreated
    water stream served to protect pathogens from sunlight inactivation (Boehm et
    al., 2018). The modest decreases in viral gene counts are consistent with prior
    findings that viruses are resistant to sunlight inactivation (Boehm et al., 2019).
    Bacteria are more sensitive to temperature than viruses and protozoa (Jin et al.,
    2017). Unfortunately, we did not sample San José and San Marcos on the same days,
    precluding us from making direct temperature comparisons between the two points.
    Furthermore, pathogens may accumulate in canal sediments and at some sampling
    points we may have collected more sediment, which would have affected our data.
    Beyond treatment plant efficacy and environmental factors, specific exposure scenarios
    are important determinants of risk. In our analysis we assume a simple exposure
    scenario via the accidental ingestion of wastewater daily. Although exposure dynamics
    in the Mezquital Valley are complicated by the mixing of water from different
    canal systems, we have some information about exposure pathways resulting in risk.
    For example, recent work in the Mezquital Valley suggests that occupation is not
    the primary route of exposure, and that there is a spatial component to disease
    risk (Contreras et al., 2017; Contreras et al., 2020). Environmental work by Broszat
    et al. (2014) also demonstrated that there is an increase the relative abundance
    of Gammaproteobacteria, a family of bacteria that includes many important human
    pathogens, in wastewater irrigated fields in the Mezquital Valley (Broszat et
    al., 2014). Soil in the Mezquital Valley may therefore be a potential intermediate
    pathogen transmission pathway between the canals and local communities, and may
    result in a community wide pathogen pool, possibly explaining why occupation is
    not associated with disease risk. Soil is not well understood and often underappreciated
    pathogen reservoir (Capone et al., 2021; Pickering et al., 2012). 5. Conclusion
    Environmental surveillance data can be used to measure spatial variation in epidemiological
    disease risk. Our model parameters used to transform contamination data to risk
    estimates were hypothetical and therefore they do not reflect site-specific infection
    risk. Our comparative analytical approach, however, is robust to parameter misspecification
    and is therefore useful to inform mitigation measures. For example, our finding
    that infection risk between the treated and untreated wastewater streams equalize
    after the treated wastewater stream transits through communities demonstrates
    the need to implement wastewater treatment in communities downstream of the AWTP.
    Furthermore, our findings that viral risk consistently remains elevated may provide
    insight on the main drivers of diarrheal disease in the Mezquital Valley. Wastewater
    management will require the development of management models that can enhance
    the productivity and resilience of communities and food systems. Well managed
    urban wastewater can be treated as renewable resource, reducing stresses on environmental
    water resources. Part of the wastewater management equation will have to consider
    where the water treatment occurs in relation to the end users and final disposal
    location. Our findings have implications for similar projects globally and reinforce
    that treatment and mitigation measures should consider interactions with and uses
    of wastewater along the entirety of its chain, and not focus on implementing point
    mitigation measures (Association, T. I. W, 2018; UNESCO, 2017). This holistic
    approach will help countries attain the SDG goals. Funding Leon M. Espira was

    Arid to semiarid lands cover ∼50% of the Earth’s land surface (1) and irrigated
    soils are integral to global food production. (2) However, we have a limited understanding
    of geochemical dynamics in the irrigated soil of semiarid to arid systems, (3)
    which are critical for short and long-term carbon (3) and nitrogen pools (4) and
    sustainable and safe food production. Identifying geochemical transformations
    in the root-soil-porewater interface of irrigated soils is critically needed as
    this affects the cycling of nutrients, organic carbon, and trace elements and,
    in turn, crop productivity. Trace elements, essential nutrients, and organic matter
    in soil can be associated with iron (Fe) minerals. (5,6) Soil iron minerals are
    key drivers of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, organic matter, and trace
    elements. (5−7) Iron is an essential element for crop growth. (8) The occurrence
    of iron in the soil is ubiquitous; however, different iron minerals are distributed
    heterogeneously. (9) Redox events in soil, which may originate from root activity
    and soil water content, may initiate iron mineral dissolution and generate broad
    shifts in pH, colloidal, and dissolved ion concentration in soil porewater. (10)
    Among the different forms of iron present in soil, nanocrystalline and amorphous
    iron(oxy)hydroxides and oxides are considered as most reactive. (11) These reactive
    iron pools in soil are known to control the bioavailability of iron-bound contaminants,
    organic carbon, and nutrients. (11−13) Reactive iron, defined as iron extracted
    by chemical reductive dissolution of soil using sodium dithionite, is primarily
    present in the form of amorphous or nanocrystalline iron minerals such as ferrihydrite
    and goethite. (14,15) Reactive iron transformations are controlled in part by
    soil redox conditions that play a crucial role in the mobilization and availability
    of geogenic contaminants such as arsenic and uranium and essential nutrients.
    (16,17) In humid climates, reactive iron minerals inventory is highly dynamic
    due to fluctuating redox environments and has been associated with anaerobic conditions.
    (3,6,15) In semiarid to arid systems under transiently irrigated soils, it is
    assumed that soil will be aerobic; therefore, iron will be primarily present in
    the oxidized or ferric form. (18) However, crops grown in semiarid and arid regions
    require iron for optimal growth, and rhizosphere processes trigger iron dissolution
    and uptake in the aerobic root-soil-porewater interface. (19−21) These (bio)geochemical
    iron uptake processes can release iron-bound trace elements at the root zone,
    making them available for plant uptake or leaching. Understanding these rhizosphere
    dynamics in unsaturated agricultural soil under semiarid to arid conditions is
    a critical need for safe and efficient food production, which is the central aspect
    of the present study. In a three-year field study (Figure 1, and Supporting Information
    Table S1), composite soil cores from 0 to 90 cm (15 cm interval), monthly crop
    tissues post-reproductive stage, and soil porewater at 45 and 90 cm depth during
    irrigation events were sampled from preplant to harvest. We analyzed the solid
    phase by selective extractions to determine reactive iron (dithionite citrate
    bicarbonate (DCB) extractable (13)). Porewater chemical analysis identified dissolved
    iron, organic carbon, nitrate, and trace elements (arsenic, uranium) released
    from the soil into the liquid phase during irrigation events. The field study
    included two sites under maize, which differed in soil type, amount of reactive
    iron, and climatic conditions. The concentrations of nitrate, iron, arsenic, and
    uranium in soil extraction and soil porewater were correlated with their concentrations
    in the crops, which emphasized the critical role of reactive iron dynamics in
    irrigated agricultural soil of semiarid and arid systems. Figure 1 Figure 1. Field
    experiment design at two study sites in Nebraska to quantify soil reactive iron,
    arsenic, uranium, nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In west-central
    Nebraska, the semiarid region is North Platte, and in western Nebraska, the semiarid
    to arid region is Scottsbluff. The soil at North Platte is classified as Cozad
    silt loam (Fluventic Haplustolls), and in Scottsbluff is classified as Tripp,
    a very fine sandy loam soil (Aridic Haplustolls). Crops (maize) were grown under
    no-till with a maize-soybean rotation in North Platte and continuous maize in
    Scottsbluff. At North Platte, seeds (Fontanelle 6A327RBC at 84,000 seeds/ha) were
    planted in the second week of May in 2017 and 2018 and the first week of June
    in 2019, whereas in Scottsbluff, seeds (Dekalb DKC46–36RIB at 89,957 seeds/ha)
    were planted in the first week of May in 2017 to 2019. Soil solution access tubes
    (SSATs) were placed in triplicates at two depths −45 and 90 cm to collect porewater.
    Soil samples in the top 90 cm were collected using a slide hammer soil probe from
    preplant in May (n = 81 cores of 0–90 cm depth (15 cm interval) using the grid-sampling
    technique). Post emergence, monthly soil samples were collected from June until
    harvest in September (n = 24 cores of 0–90 cm (15 cm interval) within crop rows,
    close to each SSAT (4 × 6)) for three growing seasons (2017–2019). Crop samples
    were collected (n = 6) in July, August, and September after the reproductive stage.
    Fields used center pivot for irrigating with groundwater, which was carried out
    based on crop water demand. In North Platte, urea-ammonium-nitrate 32% (UAN32)
    was used as nitrogen fertilizer. In Scottsbluff, UAN32 was used in 2017 and 2018,
    whereas urea was applied in 2019. Detailed field irrigation, precipitation, and
    fertilization information are available in the Materials and Methods section and
    Supplementary Table S1. Materials and Methods ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Study Sites
    and Experiment Design Soil, crop, and porewater samples were collected for three
    years (2017–2019) between May and September from two study sites located at the
    research and extension centers of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (Figure 1).
    The site at the West Central Research, Extension, and Education Center at North
    Platte (41.09005, −100.76808) is classified as semiarid, (22) whereas the site
    at the Panhandle Research, Extension, and Education Center, Scottsbluff, Nebraska
    (41.89532, −103.68106) is classified as semiarid to arid. (22) The sites vary
    in soil type, amount of dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB) extractable iron,
    and weather conditions. The soil at North Platte is classified as Cozad silt loam
    (Fluventic Haplustolls). (23) The precipitation at North Platte during the growing
    season (May 1st to September 30th) varied yearly. It was 28.4, 20.8, and 10.2
    cm in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. During the growing season, the average
    maximum and minimum temperature was 36.0 and 4.8 °C, respectively. Fontanelle
    6A327RBC (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) was planted in the second week of May in
    2017 and 2018, and the first week of June 2019, in 0.76 m rows at a seeding rate
    of 84,000 seeds ha–1 under a no-till system following soybean in rotation (Table
    S1). Nitrogen (N) fertilizer in the form of urea-ammonium-nitrate (UAN 32%) was
    scheduled using active crop canopy sensors. (24) Irrigation was scheduled to meet
    crop water demand using a locally calibrated soil water balance model (25) (Table
    S1). The soil in Scottsbluff is classified as Tripp, which is a very fine sandy
    loam soil (Aridic Haplustolls). (26) The field had been planted to maize in the
    previous growing season. The precipitation at Scottsbluff during the growing season
    was 27.9, 38.1, and 30.4 cm in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. In the growing
    seasons, the average maximum and minimum temperatures were 36.6 and 5.1 °C, respectively.
    Dekalb DKC46–36RIB (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) was planted in the first week
    of May each year, in 0.76 m rows at a seeding rate of 88,957 seeds ha–1 under
    a no-till system following maize on maize. Nitrogen (N) fertilizer in the form
    of urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN 32%) was applied as a single application on June
    8th of 2017 and 2018. In 2019, urea was the primary fertilizer, which was applied
    on June 13th. Irrigation was scheduled to meet the crop water demand (Table S1).
    At both locations, soil core samples from 0 to 90 cm were collected in 1.9 cm
    (0.75 in) by 30.4 cm (12 in) plastic liners with endcaps using an AMS 2.2 cm (0.875
    in) outer diameter stainless steel soil probe with slide hammer (AMS Inc., USA).
    The 81 preplant soil samples (0–90 cm) were collected in early May at each site.
    After preplant soil sampling, which provided the baseline, monthly soil samples
    were collected until September within crop rows and within a 30 cm radius of soil
    porewater sampling locations (n = 24 soil samples of 0–90 cm, four soil samples
    close to each porewater location (4 × 6), GPS location are at Table S1). Soil
    porewater samples were collected using soil solution access tubes (SSATs), which
    were 90 cm in length and 2.2 cm in diameter (SSAT-A36C Tubes, Irrometer Inc.,
    USA). The outer diameter of the soil probe and SSATs matched, ensuring soil contact
    for porewater collection. The SSATs were placed at 45 cm (n = 3) and 90 cm (n
    = 3) depths (Figure 1) in the crop row. Porewater (n = 24 at each location per
    year) was collected following midseason irrigation events only (not during fertigation
    events at North Platte), along with irrigation water, and soil samples. Starting
    from July (i.e., reproductive period), entire plant samples (n = 6) were collected
    along with porewater (if irrigated) and soil samples. Soil and Plant Tissue Analyses
    Soil oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) (Extech RE300 ExStik ORP meter) was measured
    in the field. (27) Soil core liners were divided at 15 cm intervals, each sample
    was composited (0–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–45 cm, 45–60 cm, 60–75 cm, and 75–90 cm),
    and each composite was analyzed for soil chemical properties. Soil pH (Oakton
    PHTestrs 30) was measured by a 1:1 soil:water solution. (18) Nitrate and ammonium
    in these intervals were measured by KCl (ACS Certified, Fisher Chemicals, USA)
    extraction method and analyzed on a channel Lachat Quikchem 8500 (Hach, USA) flow
    injection analyzer using Cd-reduction and salicylate methods for nitrate and ammonium,
    respectively. (28) Air-dried ground soil samples were used to quantify arsenic
    and uranium by microwave digestion. (29) Dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB)
    extraction provided extractable iron in the soil. (13,30) The extractions were
    analyzed in inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (Thermo Dionex iCAP RQ
    ICP MS) for iron after 100× dilution using matrix match standards. (13,18) Soil
    Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) were periodically extracted and analyzed,
    and results were within ±5%. Plant tissues were cleaned, separated into root,
    shoot, and grains, oven-dried at 65 °C, and ground to fine powder for hot nitric
    acid digestion analysis for trace elements with ICP-MS. (18,29) Porewater Analyses
    Porewater samples were collected after 12 ± 2 h of applying vacuum (70–80 kPa)
    in the SSATs. Porewater samples were immediately filtered using a 0.45 μm syringe
    filter and subsampled for different analyses. Porewater pH was measured in the
    field. Reduced iron was also measured in the field using the colorimetric method;
    (13) however, reduced iron was not detected in any porewater samples, which may
    be due to ∼a 12 h gap between porewater collection in SSATs and subsequent sampling
    and analysis in the field. A sub sample was acidified with trace-certified hydrochloric
    acid for arsenic, uranium, and total iron quantification in ICP-MS. There is a
    possibility of introducing colloidal iron in porewater samples at 0.45 μm; however,
    it is termed as dissolved iron. (13) A subsample was acidified with sulfuric acid
    for colorimetric (Seal AQ2 Autoanalyzer) analyses of nitrate and ammonia. Dissolved
    organic carbon (DOC) measurement by persulfate oxidation method (Ol Model 1010
    Carbon Analyzer) was done on unpreserved porewater samples within 48 h of collection.
    In years 2 and 3, a part of unpreserved samples was analyzed for reduced (As3+)
    and oxidized (As5+) inorganic arsenic species by ion chromatographic separation
    achieved via an IonPac AS7 Analytical Column (2 × 250 mm) in IC-ICP-MS and using
    gradient elution utilizing 20 to 200 mM ammonium carbonate solution. (31,32) Statistical
    Analyses Statistical analysis was carried out in Origin Pro 2020b software (Northampton,
    MA, USA). All data presented here are in mean ± standard deviation across three
    years of data collected in each month, as represented in the text or figures.
    Prior to each statistical analysis, the normal distribution was confirmed in the
    data set. The Pearson correlation coefficient on selected parameters, two-sample
    t-test between two locations (which had varying degrees of extractable iron),
    and one-way repeated measures ANOVA analyses with post hoc Tukey test between
    months were carried out to confirm significant differences. Result and Discussion
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Systematic Seasonal Changes in Levels of Reactive Iron
    and Trace Elements in Soil Preplant soil samples (n = 81) in each year from 2017
    to 2019 were collected in the month of May to determine the baseline concentration
    of reactive (i.e., DCB extractable) iron, total arsenic, and uranium in the soil.
    Soil for each composite (of 15 cm length) collected throughout the study was averaged
    (presented as mean ± standard deviation) to reflect concentration for the entire
    0–90 cm depth profile for individual months (Figure 2a,b). Reactive iron in the
    preplant soil for the 0–90 cm depth was significantly (p < 0.01) higher at North
    Platte (553.0 ± 52.0 μg g–1) compared to Scottsbluff (438.0 ± 39.0 μg g–1). Arsenic
    and uranium in baseline soil samples 0–90 cm depth were 3.2 ± 0.3 and 1.7 ± 0.2
    μg g–1, respectively, at North Platte (Figure 2a, b) and 3.7 ± 0.4 and 1.8 ± 0.4
    μg g–1, respectively, at Scottsbluff (Figure 2b). Soil pH for the entire 90 cm
    depth profile ranged from 7.5 to 7.9 at North Platte and 7.5 to 7.7 at Scottsbluff
    through the months of May to September in three years. Soil oxidation–reduction
    potential (ORP) at both locations ranged from 0.40 to 0.62 V, and based on the
    pH range, it indicated primarily oxic to slightly suboxic conditions. (4) Figure
    2 Figure 2. Soil reactive iron (dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate extractable), arsenic,
    and uranium (in μg g–1) concentration in each month from May to September for
    three years along with the spread of the data covering 78% of data points (mean
    ± standard deviation) at (a) North Platte and (b) Scottsbluff. Reactive iron distribution
    in the top 90 cm of the soil at 15 cm intervals from May to September across three
    years at (c) North Platte and (d) Scottsbluff. Prior to each statistical analysis,
    normal distribution was confirmed in the data set, two-sample t test confirmed
    differences between two locations (which had varying degrees of reactive iron).
    One-way repeated measures ANOVA analyses with post hoc Tukey test between months
    were carried out to confirm significant differences. Second soil sampling (n =
    24) was done post-plant emergence during SSAT installation in June and continued
    until September, prior to crop harvest. The reactive iron concentration (0–90
    cm) in June and July was 1808.0 ± 260.1 and 1898.2 ± 201.2 μg g–1, respectively,
    at North Platte and 1589.0 ± 172.3 μg g–1 and 1614.2 ± 123.0 μg g–1, respectively
    at Scottsbluff (Figure 2a,b). This trend in elevated reactive iron changed in
    August and reached a close to baseline soil concentration in September. In August
    and September, reactive iron in the 0–90 cm depth was 664.5 ± 82.2 and 572.0 ±
    68.4 μg g–1, respectively, at North Platte. At Scottsbluff, reactive iron for
    the same 0–90 cm depth was at 540.7 ± 42.8 and 478.6 ± 52.8 μg g–1 in August and
    September, respectively. A similar trend of increasing soil reactive iron concentration
    as the growing season progressed and in line with irrigation water application
    was observed when monthly depth profiles of 0–90 cm are compared (Figure 2c,d)
    for the two sites. The soil in North Platte (Figure 2c) showed significantly (p
    < 0.01) higher reactive iron concentration in June (1996.7 ± 416.2 μg g–1) and
    July (2030.4 ± 228.5 μg g–1) in 0–15 cm depth as compared with levels in May (614
    ± 4 μg g–1), August (747.3 ± 72.5 μg g–1), and September (554.6 ± 55.2 μg g–1).
    For the same depth, the soil in Scottsbluff (Figure 2d), showed significantly
    (p < 0.01) higher reactive iron concentration in June (1722.4 ± 358.3 μg g–1)
    and July (1813.0 ± 90.1 μg g–1) as compared to May (448.4 ± 6.0 μg g–1), August
    (529.4 ± 44.5 μg g–1), and September (508.4 ± 124.8 μg g–1). The field data collected
    over a period of three years show a significant increase in soil reactive iron
    concentrations from May to June and July, which is followed by a significant decrease
    in August and September independent of site and soil depth in 0–90 cm. This indicates
    a systematic shift in the (bio)geochemical iron cycle in the soil during the growing
    season, which should affect coupled cycles of trace elements, carbon, and nutrients.
    At both study locations, soil arsenic and uranium in the 0–90 cm depth profile
    (Figures S1–S4) followed an opposite trend compared to reactive iron. Soil arsenic
    concentrations in June (2.4 ± 0.6 μg g–1) and July (2.2 ± 0.4 μg g–1) were significantly
    (p < 0.01) lower than in May (3.2 ± 0.2 μg g–1) and were close to or surpassed
    baseline values in August (3.0 ± 0.4 μg g–1) and September (3.8 ± 1.2 μg g–1)
    at North Platte. A similar trend in arsenic was observed at Scottsbluff: in June
    (2.8 ± 1.0 μg g–1) and July (2.4 ± 0.6 μg g–1) significantly (p < 0.01) lower
    concentrations were detected as compared to May (3.7 ± 0.4 μg g–1), August (3.1
    ± 0.4 μg g–1), and September (4.0 ± 0.8 μg g–1). Soil uranium at the 0–90 cm depth
    profile followed a pattern similar to arsenic. The North Platte soil uranium concentration
    in May (1.7 ± 0.2 μg g–1) was significantly higher than in June (0.8 ± 0.3 μg
    g–1) and July (0.9 ± 0.4 μg g–1) followed by a decrease as observed for arsenic.
    Uranium concentration returned close to the baseline value in August (1.1 ± 0.4
    μg g–1) and September (1.3 ± 0.3 μg g–1). Scottsbluff soil uranium dynamics presented
    a similar trend across all three years. Soil uranium concentration in May (1.8
    ± 0.3 μg g–1) was significantly higher than in June (1.1 ± 0.5 μg g–1) and July
    (1.0 ± 0.4 μg g–1). Soil uranium concentration in Scottsbluff returned to baseline
    value in August (1.4 ± 0.3 μg g–1) and was higher than baseline in September (1.6
    ± 0.4 μg g–1). Combined data for all three years at all depths of reactive iron
    in soil showed a strong negative correlation to soil arsenic (r = −0.86, p < 0.01)
    and uranium (r = −0.84, p < 0.01). Soil arsenic and uranium also correlated (r
    = 0.81, p < 0.01) strongly at the study sites over three years, suggesting the
    co-occurrence of arsenic and uranium in soil based on the periodicity of reactive
    iron in soil. Iron oxide minerals host arsenic and uranium in soils (13,18) and
    are strongly associated with poorly crystalline to amorphous iron oxides. (33)
    Periodic iron oxide transformations have been observed when switching between
    reduced and oxidized conditions under laboratory conditions in 1:10 soil: water
    systems. (12) However, periodic shifts in reactive iron levels and total soil
    arsenic and uranium levels across a soil depth of 0–90 cm during the irrigation
    period of two field sites located in semiarid to arid regions with primarily oxic
    conditions have not been reported so far to the best of our knowledge. Such shifts
    in soil reactive iron concentrations might be linked to concentration changes
    of iron, arsenic, uranium, nitrate, and carbon in soil porewater, with unforeseen
    consequences for their bioavailability. Mobilization of Trace Elements, Iron,
    Nitrate, and Dissolved Organic Carbon Soil porewater samples, used to measure
    the mobilization potential of trace elements and nutrients, were only collected
    following irrigation events as at other times porewater cannot be easily sampled
    due to low soil water content. Irrigation at both locations started around mid
    to late June (but depending on the weather, irrigation in late May was observed)
    and ended in late August to early September. Irrigation water from center pivot
    spray nozzles was collected during water application prior to the porewater sampling
    events. Irrigation water contained 10.7 ± 8.2 μg L–1 iron, 3.6 ± 0.8 μg L–1 arsenic
    (8 ± 1% As(III)), 10.4 ± 4.4 μg L–1 uranium, 0.4 ± 0.1 mg-N L–1 nitrate, and 4.4
    ± 4.0 mg-C L–1 DOC at North Platte and 13.8 ± 1.7 μg L–1 iron, 4.3 ± 0.3 μg L–1
    arsenic (11 ± 2% As(III)), 20.6 ± 8.3 μg L–1 uranium, 7.2 ± 2.2 mg-N L–1 nitrate,
    and 1.6 ± 1.2 mg-C L–1 DOC at Scottsbluff. Porewater pH was measured in the field
    and at North Platte were 7.9 ± 0.4 and 7.8 ± 0.1 at 45 and 90 cm, respectively.
    At both depths, porewater pH in Scottsbluff was 7.8 ± 0.2. Iron in porewater samples
    increased as the growing season progressed. At North Platte (Figure 3a), the highest
    iron concentration was recorded in July at 45 cm (582.0 ± 110.5 μg L–1) and that
    at 90 cm was 466.3 ± 236.8 μg L–1. At 90 cm, the highest concentration was in
    August (756.4 ± 100.3 μg L–1), with a concentration of 270.5 ± 61.9 μg L–1 at
    45 cm. The values significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in September at both depths.
    At Scottsbluff (Figure 3b), the highest concentration at 45 cm depth was recorded
    in August (802.9 ± 82.4 μg L–1). The highest porewater iron concentration at 90
    cm was in July (618.7 ± 142.3 μg L–1), which was slightly higher than in August
    (580.6 ± 113.4 μg L–1) at the same depth. August porewater iron concentration
    at 45 cm depth was significantly (p < 0.01) higher compared to other months. Figure
    3 Figure 3. Soil porewater collected at two depths (45 cm, which was close to
    primary root activity and 90 cm, close to the end of root zone) was quantified
    for porewater iron, arsenic, and uranium concentration in μg L–1 at (a) North
    Platte and (b) Scottsbluff. Porewater extracted from these two depths were also
    measured for porewater nitrate, ammonium (mg-N L–1), and dissolved organic carbon
    (DOC) (mg-C L–1) at (c) North Platte and (d) Scottsbluff. The soil porewater provided
    evidence of mobilizations of metals at the root-soil-porewater system and the
    influence of the iron mobilization on porewater nitrate, ammonium, and DOC during
    irrigation events in semiarid to arid soil conditions. The spread of the data
    covers 78% of data points (mean ± standard deviation) measured in three years.
    Prior to each statistical analysis, normal distribution was confirmed in the data
    set, two-sample t test confirmed differences between two locations. One-way repeated
    measures ANOVA analyses with post hoc Tukey test between months were carried out
    to confirm significant differences. At North Platte, porewater iron concentration
    followed a trend similar to that of soil reactive iron concentration at 45 cm
    depth. At the 90 cm depth, the peak iron concentration lagged by a month, which
    may be due to transport time through the soil or different geochemical activities
    at the depths. This trend in soil and porewater indicates the direct influence
    of soil reactive iron dynamics to the occurrence of iron in porewater. At both
    sampling depths, the peak iron concentration in porewater seems to lag compared
    to the peak soil reactive iron concentration at Scottsbluff, which may be linked
    to the porewater transport time and depth-specific localized (bio)geochemical
    activities promoting iron in porewater. Similar contrasting depth-specific geochemical
    activity has been shown to mobilize manganese and phosphorus in unsaturated agricultural
    soil. (34) The occurrence of iron in porewater can have a cascading effect on
    trace element mobility and nutrient availability. (35,36) At both study sites,
    the level of porewater arsenic was highest in August: North Platte (70.6 ± 13.8
    μg L–1 (45 cm), 37.0 ± 21.9 μg L–1 (90 cm)) and Scottsbluff (122.4 ± 12.0 μg L–1
    (45 cm), 106.0 ± 43.8 μg L–1 (90 cm)). Porewater arsenic concentration gradually
    increased as the growing season progressed at both depths and correlated to porewater
    iron concentration (r = 0.38 at North Platte; r = 0.60 at Scottsbluff, p < 0.01).
    The correlation between porewater arsenic and iron indicates the mobility of arsenic
    is potentially associated with iron dissolution, either via complexation or reduction.
    However, reduced iron was not detected in porewater due to its transient nature
    and rapid oxidation to Fe(III). (37) The long retrieval time (∼12 h) of porewater
    samples from soil solution access tubes (SSATs) may have provided ample time for
    reduced iron to oxidize. However, when inorganic arsenic species in porewater
    were quantified in years 2 and 3, reduced arsenic was observed in porewater. The
    observation of reduced arsenic may indicate a reduction-initiated pathway for
    arsenic mobilization. Reduced arsenic concentration (As(III)) was higher in Scottsbluff
    porewater samples than in the porewater samples at North Platte. North Platte
    porewater contained 15% ± 2% As(III) throughout the experiment period. In July,
    Scottsbluff samples contained ∼90% As(III), which decreased to ∼40% in August
    and ∼15% in September. The toxicity of As(III) is 25–60 times higher compared
    to oxidized inorganic arsenic species and is more mobile and bioavailable. Mobile
    arsenic in porewater can be taken up by crops, (38) which can be detrimental to
    crops and human health. In contrast to arsenic, porewater uranium was generally
    higher at the beginning or end of the experiment, when low As(III) concentrations
    were also observed. At North Platte, the highest porewater uranium concentration
    at 45 cm depth was observed in June (15.6 ± 2.8 μg L–1) and at 90 cm depth in
    August (23.7 ± 7.4 μg L–1). At Scottsbluff, the highest porewater concentration
    at both depths was observed in June, 17.0 ± 6.8 μg L–1 (45 cm) and 46.8 ± 11.8
    μg L–1 (90 cm). Uranium is more mobile in the oxidized form, (39) so occurrence
    in June and later in the growing season analogous to higher amount of oxidized
    arsenic in porewater may suggest the recrystallization of iron reduces uranium
    concentration. (40) The occurrence of uranium in porewater at the beginning and
    later stage of the growing season confirms the critical role of redox processes
    initiated by transient wetting within the depth gradient (Figures S5 and S6) of
    the unsaturated soil in semiarid to arid systems. (41) High nitrate concentrations
    in the porewater samples at both sites were primarily observed at 45 cm depth
    and at the beginning of the irrigation period (Figure 3c, d). Porewater nitrate
    concentration decreased as the experiment progressed, which can be due to the
    uptake of nitrate by growing crops or loss to subsurface and atmosphere. (42)
    At both locations, the highest nitrate concentration was observed in June: 72.0
    ± 19.8 mg-N L–1 (45 cm) and 25.8 ± 2.4 mg-N L–1 (45 cm) at North Platte and Scottsbluff,
    respectively. The majority of fertilizer applications (application dates are available
    in Supporting Information Table S1) at both locations happened before June sampling,
    and subsequently, high nitrate and ammonium were also observed in the soil (Figures
    S7–S10). The nitrate leaching loss was similar to observed losses beneath row
    crop systems in the Midwest. (43) The DOC concentration in the porewater at both
    locations varied across June to September (Figure 3c, d) and the highest DOC was
    measured in September (89.5 ± 27.6 mg-C L–1 (90 cm)) at North Platte and in July
    (108.4 ± 15.4 mg-C L–1 (45 cm)) at Scottsbluff. Soil water fluctuations can elevate
    organic carbon dissolved in porewater, which is mediated by iron reduction and
    the release of iron-mineral-associated organic matter. (41) Our data indicate
    similar processes to be present in transiently irrigated soils in semiarid to
    arid systems. Overall, porewater iron positively correlated to porewater arsenic
    (r = 0.74, p < 0.05) and uranium (r = 0.42, p < 0.05), highlighting the relevance
    of iron (bio)geochemistry in the occurrence of trace elements (44−46) in the analyzed
    systems. Porewater pH showed a negative correlation to porewater ammonium (r =
    −0.35, p < 0.05), iron (r = −0.40, p < 0.05), arsenic (r = −0.48, p < 0.05), and
    uranium (r = −0.34, p < 0.05) and a positive correlation with nitrate (r = 0.70,
    p < 0.05). At North Platte, porewater nitrate was negatively correlated to arsenic
    (r = −0.50, p < 0.05) and positively to uranium (r = 0.48, p < 0.05). A similar
    correlation of porewater nitrate with arsenic (r = −0.52, p < 0.05) and uranium
    (r = 0.65, p < 0.05) was observed at Scottsbluff. Porewater nitrate from the fertilizer
    coupled with wide shifts in iron concentrations may influence uranium mobility
    at the initial growing stage, which may lead to higher uranium mobility, (47)
    whereas the input of oxidizing nitrate limits arsenic redox transformation and
    lowers mobility. (48) The availability of these trace contaminants in the porewater
    may influence its uptake in maize with the progressing growing season. Understanding
    and managing redox changes in response to soil moisture fluctuations (49) can
    be integral for optimizing agricultural practices and securing long-term sustainability
    in arid and semiarid regions. Influence of Soil Geochemical Changes on Crop Uptake
    of Trace Elements Beginning with the month of July, when maize cob was visible,
    maize samples were collected at both study sites simultaneously with soil and
    porewater samples. The crop tissue was divided into root, shoot, and grains/kernels,
    which were quantified for arsenic and uranium (Figure 4). Root tissues contained
    the highest concentration of trace elements, followed by the shoot and grains.
    The concentration of arsenic and uranium in root tissue was significantly (p <
    0.05) higher in Scottsbluff samples than in North Platte samples. At North Platte,
    root tissue contained the highest arsenic and uranium in August: 0.66 ± 0.01 μg
    g–1 and 0.28 ± 0.08 μg g–1, respectively. Maize roots at Scottsbluff contained
    the highest arsenic in August: 1.02 ± 0.20 μg g–1, and uranium in September 0.58
    ± 0.03 μg g–1. Figure 4 Figure 4. Crops collected in three years at both study
    sites were divided into root, shoot, and grain to quantify arsenic and uranium
    uptake, bioaccumulation, and translocation at both study sites – North Platte
    and Scottsbluff. The highest concentration of arsenic in shoot tissue was in August
    corresponding to root concentration, which was 0.22 ± 0.03 and 0.46 ± 0.08 μg
    g–1 at North Platte and Scottsbluff, respectively. The highest concentration of
    uranium in shoot tissue was in August at North Platte, which was 0.10 ± 0.002
    μg g–1 and in September at Scottsbluff was 0.16 ± 0.02 μg g–1. The highest arsenic
    and uranium translocation in the crop grain was observed in September, which was
    0.03 ± 0.006 and 0.008 ± 0.002 μg g–1, respectively, at North Platte, and was
    0.05 ± 0.02 and 0.01 ± 0.003 μg g–1, respectively, at Scottsbluff. The bioaccumulation
    factor (BAF) is the ratio between the net uptake of trace elements in crops and
    soil concentration. For arsenic, at harvest, the BAF was 0.15 at North Platte
    and 0.28 at Scottsbluff. Uranium BAF at harvest was 0.27 at North Platte and 0.48
    at Scottsbluff. At North Platte, the translocation factor (TF) (defined as the
    concentration ratio between two crop tissues as water is translocated such as
    root to shoot) from root to shoot for arsenic remained similar (0.31 (July), 0.33
    (August), 0.33 (September)), and the TF from shoot to grain was 0.26 (July), 0.14
    (August), and 0.22 (September). At Scottsbluff, the TF from root to shoot for
    arsenic decreased as the experiment progressed (0.60 (July), 0.48 (August) to
    0.27 (September)), whereas the TF from shoot to grain increased (0.09 (July),
    0.18 (August) to 0.26 (September)). The observed arsenic TF (both root to shoot
    and shoot to grain) in maize was higher than in rice, which is known for high
    arsenic uptake, during the growing season samples but was comparable to rice TF
    at harvest. (50) At North Platte, the TF of uranium from root to shoot was 0.10
    in July and increased to 0.36 in August and 0.40 in September, and shoot to grain
    TF was 0.02 (July), 0.05 (August), and 0.08 (September). At Scottsbluff, the TF
    of uranium from root to shoot was 0.20 in July, 0.18 in August, and 0.30 in September,
    and shoot to grain TF was 0.06 (July), 0.05 (August), and 0.10 (September). The
    observed TF and BAF can be used as indicators of crop health and safety in semiarid
    regions, and similar to rice, (51) there may be critical thresholds that should
    be considered before consumption of edible parts of crops. Clearly, higher concentrations
    of reactive iron and lower reduced arsenic in porewater reduced BAF and TF in
    North Platte crops compared to Scottsbluff crops, which was observed in a previous
    greenhouse study. (18) The observed crop uptake in the maize kernels may also
    differ in other common crops grown in semiarid to arid conditions, such as soybeans
    or other crops, where iron uptake may be initiated by iron reduction in the rootzone,
    (13,52) which may mobilize more trace elements making them available for uptake.
    Soil Water Content Triggered Reactive Iron Cycling in the Root-Soil-Porewater
    Systems Transient water application driven by irrigation demand led to localized
    reducing conditions and an increased abundance of dissolved iron and trace elements.
    The reactive iron generated during irrigation events favored mineral dissolution
    and drove availability of trace elements, essential nutrients, and organic carbon
    in the rhizosphere. Redox-active iron transformation under unsaturated soil conditions
    in maize at temporal anoxic microsites created due to periodic irrigation and
    root exudates have been observed before in greenhouse systems. (13,18) Furthermore,
    reactive iron can be strongly associated with organic carbon, and mobilization
    of iron from higher-order oxides via dissimilatory reduction of iron oxy-hydroxide
    has been reported under different anoxic conditions. (53) At the observed pH in
    our study (∼7.5–7.9), the mobilized iron observed in porewater, which can be formed
    due to biotic and abiotic activities at the rhizosphere, can produce amorphous
    to low crystalline iron minerals, (54) increasing soil reactive iron levels during
    transient wet periods (Figures S5 and S6) and influencing carbon, nutrient, and
    trace element dynamics. (41,55) However, the freshly formed reactive iron most
    likely disintegrated after the growing season due to drier conditions and can
    have potential implications for carbon and nitrogen pools in semiarid to arid
    soil systems. Iron mineral phases, particularly highly reactive minerals of iron,
    are crucial in maintaining soil carbon. (56) Under aerobic conditions prevalent
    in unsaturated soils ∼40% of total soil organic carbon can be complexed with iron
    minerals. (57) Reactive iron phases are known to stabilize soil macro and micronutrients,
    organic carbon, and trace elements via inner-sphere or outer-sphere complexation.
    (58) Reactive iron mineral phase dissolution either by reductive pathway or complexation
    can be initiated by fluctuation in soil moisture, (41) by crop iron demand, (59,60)
    or microbial respiration. (61,62) As observed in our study, the soil water content
    in the 0 to 90 cm depth profile significantly elevated (Figure S11) during the
    irrigation period is most likely the primary driver of redox dynamics in the unsaturated
    soil. The redox change can weaken the association of organic carbon and iron minerals,
    (10) leading to increased DOC, and impact soil nutrient and trace element cycles.
    The oxic conditions prevalent in pre and post-irrigation periods can transform
    short-range order reactive iron minerals to higher order of iron oxides and may
    not be extractable by DCB. (63) Further, as the experiment progressed, iron mineral
    transformation to higher order may bind mobilized arsenic and uranium within the
    soil (64,65) and make them less available to the crops or reduce occurrence in
    porewater. Our three-year field study across two sites extends the widely accepted
    relationship between soil water content and soil mineralization changes (66) to
    semiarid to arid unsaturated agricultural soils. From the field study at two locations
    with varying soil types and climatic conditions, it is evident that reactive iron
    dynamics and periodicity are critical (bio)geochemical drivers prevalent in semiarid
    to arid soil systems. Long-term agricultural sustainability in semiarid and arid
    regions presents unique challenges due to limited water availability and harsh
    environmental conditions. Reactive iron in soils of semiarid and arid regions
    can aid in soil fertility and water retention, enhancing agricultural sustainability.
    Its presence improves moisture absorption and retention, vital in regions with
    limited rainfall. Reactive iron is found to facilitate nutrient availability to
    crops, promoting their growth and resilience under challenging environmental conditions.
    Iron levels in the cropland soil contribute to sustainable agricultural practices
    by optimizing water use and supporting long-term productivity in these regions.
    The iron cycle is essential to ensure crop growth and likely plays a vital role
    in carbon and nitrogen geochemistry in the root zone. More work is necessary to
    interpret reactive iron’s biological and chemical nature and establish its liability.
    Our data suggest that iron dynamics in the soil of semiarid to arid systems play
    a crucial role in maintaining carbon, nitrogen, and trace element soil pools.
    The potential long-term consequences of elevated arsenic and uranium levels in
    crops can result in adverse health effects to humans or livestock. Regular monitoring
    of trace contaminant levels in semiarid to arid agricultural soils, specifically
    areas where irrigation water may contain high concentrations of trace elements,
    can be useful to understand the potential crop uptake of these harmful contaminants.
    Growers can emulate rice production, where trace element uptake is a major challenge,
    to ensure lower uptake of trace contaminants in crops grown under semiarid to
    arid conditions, such as adjusting irrigation practices, (67) selecting suitable
    crop varieties, (68) and considering soil amendments (18,69,70) to mitigate trace
    element dynamics. In order to better maintain safe and sufficient crop productivity
    in semiarid to arid regions, it is, therefore, crucial to further determine the
    reactive iron’s role in maintaining soil fertility and identify associated microbial
    processes that may affect and manage or get affected by the observed reactive
    iron dynamics. The critical processes controlled by reactive iron under unsaturated
    conditions must be further quantified as nutrients and contaminants lost from
    the root zone can infiltrate to subsurface and potentially degrade groundwater
    quality. The role of naturally occurring reactive iron in soils of semiarid to
    arid conditions appears to be critical for enhancing water and food safety and
    security. The soil mineral geochemical activities under intermittently irrigated
    systems in arid to semiarid conditions are vital for sustainable food and fiber
    production. Supporting Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The Supporting Information

    the sidebar. Abstract Figure 1 Figure 1. Field experiment design at two study
    sites in Nebraska to quantify soil reactive iron, arsenic, uranium, nitrate, ammonium,
    and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In west-central Nebraska, the semiarid region
    is North Platte, and in western Nebraska, the semiarid to arid region is Scottsbluff.
    The soil at North Platte is classified as Cozad silt loam (Fluventic Haplustolls),
    and in Scottsbluff is classified as Tripp, a very fine sandy loam soil (Aridic
    Haplustolls). Crops (maize) were grown under no-till with a maize-soybean rotation
    in North Platte and continuous maize in Scottsbluff. At North Platte, seeds (Fontanelle
    6A327RBC at 84,000 seeds/ha) were planted in the second week of May in 2017 and
    2018 and the first week of June in 2019, whereas in Scottsbluff, seeds (Dekalb
    DKC46–36RIB at 89,957 seeds/ha) were planted in the first week of May in 2017
    to 2019. Soil solution access tubes (SSATs) were placed in triplicates at two
    depths −45 and 90 cm to collect porewater. Soil samples in the top 90 cm were
    collected using a slide hammer soil probe from preplant in May (n = 81 cores of
    0–90 cm depth (15 cm interval) using the grid-sampling technique). Post emergence,
    monthly soil samples were collected from June until harvest in September (n =
    24 cores of 0–90 cm (15 cm interval) within crop rows, close to each SSAT (4 ×
    6)) for three growing seasons (2017–2019). Crop samples were collected (n = 6)
    in July, August, and September after the reproductive stage. Fields used center
    pivot for irrigating with groundwater, which was carried out based on crop water
    demand. In North Platte, urea-ammonium-nitrate 32% (UAN32) was used as nitrogen
    fertilizer. In Scottsbluff, UAN32 was used in 2017 and 2018, whereas urea was
    applied in 2019. Detailed field irrigation, precipitation, and fertilization information
    are available in the Materials and Methods section and Supplementary Table S1.
    Figure 2 Figure 2. Soil reactive iron (dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate extractable),
    arsenic, and uranium (in μg g–1) concentration in each month from May to September
    for three years along with the spread of the data covering 78% of data points
    (mean ± standard deviation) at (a) North Platte and (b) Scottsbluff. Reactive
    iron distribution in the top 90 cm of the soil at 15 cm intervals from May to
    September across three years at (c) North Platte and (d) Scottsbluff. Prior to
    each statistical analysis, normal distribution was confirmed in the data set,
    two-sample t test confirmed differences between two locations (which had varying
    degrees of reactive iron). One-way repeated measures ANOVA analyses with post
    hoc Tukey test between months were carried out to confirm significant differences.
    Figure 3 Figure 3. Soil porewater collected at two depths (45 cm, which was close
    to primary root activity and 90 cm, close to the end of root zone) was quantified
    for porewater iron, arsenic, and uranium concentration in μg L–1 at (a) North
    Platte and (b) Scottsbluff. Porewater extracted from these two depths were also
    measured for porewater nitrate, ammonium (mg-N L–1), and dissolved organic carbon
    (DOC) (mg-C L–1) at (c) North Platte and (d) Scottsbluff. The soil porewater provided
    evidence of mobilizations of metals at the root-soil-porewater system and the
    influence of the iron mobilization on porewater nitrate, ammonium, and DOC during
    irrigation events in semiarid to arid soil conditions. The spread of the data
    covers 78% of data points (mean ± standard deviation) measured in three years.
    Prior to each statistical analysis, normal distribution was confirmed in the data
    set, two-sample t test confirmed differences between two locations. One-way repeated
    measures ANOVA analyses with post hoc Tukey test between months were carried out
    to confirm significant differences. Figure 4 Figure 4. Crops collected in three
    years at both study sites were divided into root, shoot, and grain to quantify

    1. Introduction Cryptosporidium is a known causative agent of infectious diarrhoea,
    affecting human and animal populations worldwide (Gururajan et al., 2021; Ryan
    et al., 2014). It has been documented as the primary etiological agent of 63 %
    of 239 waterborne outbreaks reported in 2017 (Efstratiou et al., 2017). It is
    considered a significant concern in the food production industry worldwide as
    it is associated with over eight million annual cases of foodborne diseases (Ahmed
    and Karanis, 2018; Ryan et al., 2018). Diarrhoeal diseases were the cause of mortality
    in nearly 1.5 million cases in 2019, of which half were children (Dattani et al.,
    2023). Of the 44 species and over 120 valid genotypes of Cryptosporidium reported
    globally, 21 species and genotypes have been documented in humans, with C. hominis
    and C. parvum being the most frequent species, accounting for over 90 % of the
    infection cases (Li et al., 2020; Ryan et al., 2021). C. andersoni, C. ubiquitum,
    C. meleagridis, C. muris, and C. cuniculus are among the other pathogenic species
    in humans, and they are responsible for the sporadic emergence of zoonotic outbreaks,
    mainly due to direct contact with infected animals (Ahmed and Karanis, 2020).
    Cryptosporidium oocysts can be transmitted directly or indirectly via contact
    with infected hosts or contaminated sources, typically through the faecal-oral
    route (Putignani and Menichella, 2010). Notably, ingestion of a single oocyst
    can potentially cause infection (Carmena, 2010; Messner and Berger, 2016). The
    faecal-oral transmission modes of Cryptosporidium include the following: • Person-to-person
    contact. • Contact with infected animals. • Consumption of contaminated food.
    • Consumption of contaminated water (e.g., drinking, and recreational water).
    Cryptosporidium infection leads to mild and severe diarrhoea and several gastrointestinal
    symptoms by interfering with barrier function and absorption capability. The disease
    is mild and self-limiting in immunocompetent adults (Marcos and Gotuzzo, 2013).
    Cryptosporidium spp. have been frequently found in water environments throughout
    Latin America since 2000 (Rosado-García et al., 2017). Different water sources
    in African countries are also contaminated with oocysts of Cryptosporidium parasites,
    with a significant incidence in nearly 50 % of the reports. Based on these reports,
    the multiple risk factors contributing to the promotion of waterborne protozoan
    parasites (e.g., Cryptosporidium) and other microbial pathogens linked to diarrhoea
    include poor institutional infrastructure, insufficient water supplies, insecure
    drinking water, poor sanitary facilities, water crises, global warming, lack of
    development, political and social conflicts, poverty, increased level of malnutrition,
    high population density, and illiteracy (Aldeyarbi et al., 2016). Developing countries
    are predominantly affected by Cryptosporidium-attributable diarrhoeal diseases
    (Ahmed et al., 2018; Aldeyarbi et al., 2016; Kotloff et al., 2013; Kotloff, 2017;
    Mahmoudi et al., 2017; Rosado-García et al., 2017). According to the Global Enteric
    Multicenter Study (GEMS), Cryptosporidium has been indicated as one of the four
    most typical causes of diarrhoeal disorders occurring over the first two years
    of life in seven regions in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with approximately
    202,000 deaths caused by cryptosporidiosis annually (Liu et al., 2016; Sow et
    al., 2016; Kotloff et al., 2013). Insufficient official reports on the occurrence
    of Cryptosporidium in human populations, food, water resources, and the environment
    have resulted in the underestimation of significant numbers of waterborne disease
    reports and associated outbreaks in various developing countries (Ahmed and Karanis,
    2020). Cryptosporidiosis has become a severe public health issue in developed
    countries. For instance, the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) estimate indicated
    that the burden of Cryptosporidium in the Netherlands, a country with proper sanitary
    standards, has increased since the prior forecast. In addition, cryptosporidiosis
    cost 19.2 million euros and led to 137 DALYs in 2017, while long-term clinical
    symptoms such as persistent diarrhoea and joint discomfort caused 9 % of all DALYs
    in this country. Many cryptosporidiosis cases have been documented in the US,
    which has the largest economy in the world. According to the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC), a four-fold increase was observed in the rate of
    outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium reported in the US between 2014 and 2016.
    Foodborne cryptosporidiosis is a disease of public health importance in both developing
    and developed countries. However, epidemiological surveys have shown that the
    prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in developing nations (5 % to >10 %) is higher
    than that in developed nations (<1–3 %), primarily due to poor water quality and
    food sanitation (DuPont, 2016; Karanis, 2018). Thus, it is essential to establish
    specific public health surveillance to prioritize concerns associated with Cryptosporidium
    infection in these regions. In developed countries, the primary sources of Cryptosporidium
    are contaminated water resources and food products. The surveillance and monitoring
    programs in these countries primarily concerned bacterial and viral infections,
    and only included small numbers of protozoan parasites in their public health
    systems. In high-income countries, these parasitic infections are frequently disregarded
    as the leading causative agents of diarrhoea due to overconfidence in municipal
    sanitization facilities, hygiene monitoring systems, livestock and agricultural
    practices (Bouzid et al., 2018; Putignani and Menichella, 2010). Livestock is
    an agriculture sector that is crucial to providing food security on a worldwide
    scale (Hollas et al., 2022). However, the expansion of the agricultural and livestock
    sectors has affected the environment, contributing to natural resource loss, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and pollution (Yitbarek, 2019). Cryptosporidiosis has been documented
    in a variety of livestock animals, including cattle, buffaloes, pigs, goats, sheep,
    horses, camels, donkeys, and poultry such as chickens and ducks (Ryan et al.,
    2014; Robertson et al., 2014). Cattle, and quite possibly wild ruminants, play
    a significant role in releasing Cryptosporidium oocysts into the environment,
    which are responsible for foodborne and waterborne diarrhoea outbreaks in humans
    worldwide. The ability of cattle to carry different species of Cryptosporidium,
    including C. hominis, highlights a significant public health risk related to this
    potential association (Hatam-Nahavandi et al., 2019). Animal manure is a valuable
    source of organic materials and nutrients, including phosphorus, potassium, and
    nitrogen, thus stimulating the search for alternatives for managing this waste.
    Global efforts toward environmentally friendly practices have led to the worldwide
    promotion of methods that enhance the sustainability of production processes.
    As a result, governmental organizations have focused on adopting strategies to
    promote a less polluting and low-carbon economy (Bluemling and Wang, 2018). One
    of the current major concerns in waste management is the shift from linear to
    cyclical thinking, with the application of circular economy (CE) concepts as one
    of the primary solutions for these modifications (Širá et al., 2022). The vision
    of the circular economy must be applied to managing waste, particularly agricultural
    waste, to enable these activities to maintain their operations in the future.
    The finalization of the material cycle depends on the recovery of energy, by-products,
    nutrients, and water reuse (Bonciu et al., 2021). The present article critically
    reviews scientific research on Cryptosporidium species in the agricultural sector.
    It summarizes the knowledge regarding the risks of cryptosporidiosis in agricultural
    production, emphasizing the sources of contamination, the importance of animal
    production in transmitting the parasite, and the role of farmed animals as hosts.
    The zoonotic potential and risk to farmers and household members are also highlighted.
    In contrast, the need for a training strategy for farmers and the One Health approach
    are advocated for controlling and preventing zoonotic cryptosporidiosis. 2. Literature
    search A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar
    databases to find relevant papers without time limitation until 2022 using the
    following criteria and keywords; “Cryptosporidium” and “cryptosporidiosis” and
    sector of interest “agriculture” in combination with terms including “surface
    water”, “groundwater”, “irrigation water”, “vegetables”, “fruits”, “livestock”,
    “transmission”, “zoonosis”, “farmers” and “measures”. Documents related to Cryptosporidium
    in agriculture are included in the list of references. In total, 409 papers were
    found to be relevant to the subject of the current study, which were checked,
    and valuable scientific knowledge was summarized. 3. Water pollution from agricultural
    contamination sources: impact on Cryptosporidium transmission The impact of agricultural
    practices on the pollution and degradation of inland and coastal water bodies
    in most high-income countries is more significant than that on settlements and
    industries (Evans et al., 2019). Agriculture accounts for 70 % of the world''s
    water resources; therefore, agricultural pollutants lead to the pollution or deterioration
    of the environment and nearby ecosystems (Díaz et al., 2012; Mateo-Sagasta et
    al., 2017; Wato et al., 2020). This contamination occurs through runoff, soil
    erosion, livestock farming, aquaculture, chemical inputs, and overuse of water
    resources (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017; Önder et al., 2011). In the USA, agricultural
    land is a substantial source of pollution for rivers and streams, and it is considered
    the second and third potential source of contamination for wetlands and lakes,
    respectively (US EPA, 2016). Furthermore, as demonstrated by the National Water
    Quality Inventory in the USA, pollutants and pathogens from agriculture and agricultural
    production are responsible for almost 50 % of contaminated water bodies in this
    country (Díaz et al., 2012). In European countries, 38 % of the water bodies are
    threatened by agricultural pollutants (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017). In addition,
    agricultural activities are responsible for significant surface water and groundwater
    nitrogen pollution in China (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2013). In low-income countries,
    agricultural-based pollutants have also become a concern due to increased sediment
    runoff (Evans et al., 2019). At the global level, the FAO indicated that factors
    associated with agriculture, such as the production of waste from livestock and
    aquaculture, manure application, misuse of fertilizers, unsustainable cropping,
    non-standard grazing systems, surface runoff, and microbial and antimicrobial
    residues via leaching, potentially lead to pollutants reaching water resources
    (FAO, 2020). The increasing trend of water scarcity worldwide has raised attention
    to the use of alternative water sources for agricultural purposes, emphasizing
    the need for improved management of the microbial safety of water used for irrigation
    (Alegbeleye and Sant''Ana, 2021). Therefore, wastewater reuse is a helpful solution
    despite potential risks to public health and the ecosystem (Abeledo-Lameiro et
    al., 2018; Liao et al., 2021), as worldwide wastewater production is estimated
    to be 330 km3 per year (Tripathi et al., 2019). Regardless of the risks of emerging
    contaminants and subsequent health issues, wastewater reuse for irrigation remains
    common in different regions of the world (Jaramillo and Restrepo, 2017; Tripathi
    et al., 2019). Its reuse in agriculture is classified into direct and indirect
    utilization, with the last being the prevailing practice in agricultural settings
    as approximately 35.9 Mha of agrarian fields are exposed to the indirect use of
    wastewater (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017). In this process, the treated effluent
    is diluted with fresh water, from reservoirs or streams after discharge from wastewater
    treatment plants (Jeong et al., 2016). However, there are concerns regarding the
    massive disposal of untreated wastewater on land and surface waters to cover irrigation
    water demand, particularly in arid areas, as it can be involved in epidemics of
    foodborne diseases (Tripathi et al., 2019). Previous studies have reported a strong
    correlation between intestinal parasites and the application of wastewater and
    animal/human excreta in agricultural production, especially in Africa, South and
    Southeast Asia, and China, all regions with intense water shortages (Duc et al.,
    2011). Agricultural water, which is source of water used in agricultural practices
    (e.g., irrigation, livestock watering, and various other farming activities),
    plays a prominent role in the transmission of Cryptosporidium, mainly attributable
    to the presence of livestock (as a reservoir) and crops exposed to contaminated
    irrigation water, manure, and agricultural workers (Spanakos et al., 2015). Manure-based
    pathogens are possible causative agents of large waterborne and foodborne outbreaks
    (Venglovsky et al., 2006). Manure-borne contaminants originating from non-point
    sources (pastured and stray animals and leaching/runoff from agricultural fields)
    and point sources (manure storage lagoons, animal housing facilities, and animal
    feedstuffs) can result in water and soil contamination (Venglovsky et al., 2006).
    Manure application on agricultural lands is associated with the transmission of
    Cryptosporidium parasites to humans (Boxall et al., 2009). Manure-contaminated
    runoff water from farms and animal waste utilization in agricultural fields can
    release significant quantities of oocysts into the environment (Schijven et al.,
    2004). The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in manure can differ among livestock
    species and age categories. Recent research estimating global Cryptosporidium
    loads in livestock manure revealed that cattle predominantly contribute to approximately
    3.2 × 1023 oocysts per year. Asian countries exhibit the highest loads of livestock-derived
    oocysts from waste, followed by European, South American, and African countries
    (Vermeulen et al., 2017). According to a global review, it is estimated that Cryptosporidium
    spp., with an overall prevalence of 11 %, is the most prevalent protozoa in vegetables
    (Badri et al., 2022) because of the use of new or insufficiently composted animal
    and human faeces as fertilizer in agricultural lands. Many recent studies have
    revealed Cryptosporidium contamination in wastewater and recycled water used for
    agricultural irrigation, urban reuse, and recreational purposes (Spanakos et al.,
    2015; Zhu et al., 2022), and the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. In
    wastewater, surface water and groundwater resources are estimated to be 46.9 %,
    45.3 %, and 18.8–19.9 %, respectively (Daraei et al., 2021). A quantitative risk
    assessment calculated the probability of contamination with Cryptosporidium originating
    from the use of surface waters and effluents in septic tanks on agricultural land
    in China. According to this evaluation, the total disease burden due to Cryptosporidium
    infection was 9.68 × 10−6 disability-adjusted life years per person per year (DALYs
    pppy) and 3.14 × 10−5 DALYs pppy for immunocompetent patients and cancer patients,
    respectively (Huang et al., 2023). Furthermore, the extensive effects of agricultutal
    water pollution significantly affect the quality of water bodies. It is conceivable
    that drinking water derived from groundwater contributes more significantly than
    expected to the worldwide burden of cryptosporidiosis (Chique et al., 2020). Surface
    water, the primary source of drinking water supply, is widely used for recreational
    activities, such as swimming, boating, and fishing (Shortle et al., 2001; Horman
    et al., 2004). These water resources are at risk of contamination by surface runoff
    from agricultural lands, which has a substantial role in water impairment, degradation
    of drinking water supplies, and hazards to aquatic and wildlife ecosystems (Bashir
    et al., 2020). The consumption of contaminated surface water and groundwater is
    strongly linked to waterborne outbreaks, especially those related to Cryptosporidium
    species (Karanis et al., 2007; Baldursson and Karanis, 2011; Chique et al., 2020;
    Efstratiou et al., 2017; Bourli et al., 2023). Table 1 shows the surface water
    and groundwater contamination of Cryptosporidium species. Table 1. Surface waters

    climatic patterns on the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. Weather patterns
    and climatic factors have an essential effect on the transmission of Cryptosporidium
    spp. (Boxall et al., 2009). Climate conditions can play a significant role in
    the possibility of resuspended oocysts in water, contamination of water sources
    by effluents, and crop contamination (Lal et al., 2013). The effects of rainfall
    pattern and temperature on cryptosporidiosis incidence may be either direct (supporting
    the survival and dissemination of oocysts) or indirect (improving factors that
    enhance the chances of transmission). Warmer temperatures increase recreational
    activities in surface waters (e.g., bathing and swimming) and alter consumption
    habits, facilitating the unintended ingestion of oocysts (Ikiroma and Pollock,
    2021). During extreme weather incidents (e.g., heavy rainfall, floods, sea-level
    rise) and following the entrance of faecal and manure particles into water, drinking
    water resources can be contaminated with infectious pathogens (Bashir et al.,
    2020; Betancourt and Rose, 2004; Levy et al., 2016). The faecal contamination
    of drinking water sources and food products is reportedly concomitant with heavy
    rainfall events (Kostyla et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2016). The transfer of pathogens
    from agricultural animal waste to surface waters due to runoff during rainfall
    events is a national concern for water quality in the USA (Fayer, 2004). Research
    has revealed a substantial increase in the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts
    in both drinking water and surface water sources during wet seasons and the runoff
    from rainfall (Britton et al., 2010; Daraei et al., 2021; Jagai et al., 2009;
    Young et al., 2015). Moreover, heavy rainfall and river flooding may contribute
    to epidemics of waterborne gastrointestinal infections (Gertler et al., 2015).
    There is strong evidence regarding the wide range of seasonal peaks of cryptosporidiosis,
    primarily associated with geographic location, precipitation, temperature, climate
    patterns (e.g., heavy rainfall), and agricultural/human waste production (Levy
    et al., 2016; Chique et al., 2020). The seasonal fluctuation in the occurrence
    and concentration of Cryptosporidium in different water bodies depends on water
    temperature, parasite species and source dispersal, type of water use (agriculture,
    waste, household), and runoff water (Koompapong and Sukthana, 2012). A possible
    reason for seasonal variations in the incidence of intestinal pathogens in surface
    water depends on the contamination source and the factors letting the contaminants
    reach the surface water bodies. For instance, zoonotic enteric pathogens are frequently
    detected in high numbers during floods, extreme rainfall, and pasture seasons
    after snowmelt when related to agricultural runoff (Horman et al., 2004). The
    frequency of Cryptosporidium contamination in aquatic environments has different
    seasonal patterns and is most dominant in summer, autumn, and winter when the
    highest rate of occurrence and concentrations of oocysts are observed (Bodley-Tickell
    et al., 2002; Lapen et al., 2016; Nasser, 2016; Strathmann et al., 2016). The
    autumn/winter peak of oocysts can be attributed to autumn application of manure
    in agricultural fields, agricultural discharges caused by heavy rains, the presence
    of migrating birds in cold seasons, and the incidence of hydrological processes
    that mobilize contaminants in faeces which accumulate during summer (Bodley-Tickell
    et al., 2002; Koompapong and Sukthana, 2012; Lapen et al., 2016). Nevertheless,
    some monitoring studies have observed spring/summer peaks in the concentrations
    of oocysts. In the US, most waterborne outbreaks are associated with failure in
    water treatment plants after spring runoff events (Levy et al., 2016). However,
    in some cases, the low concentration in spring may be related to the effects of
    dilution and flushing coupled with spring freshets and the seasonal features of
    faecal contaminants entering surface waters (Lapen et al., 2016). Furthermore,
    seasonal patterns may correlate with the parasite species (genotypes), as it has
    shown that C. parvum peaks arise in late spring, whereas C. hominis peaks occur
    in autumn (Gallas-Lindemann et al., 2013). Long-term climate change also affects
    the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases and extends transmission cycles (Jagai
    et al., 2009). Climate change intensifies the transport of pathogens to surface
    waters through being involved in sewer overflow, increased runoff, and resuspension
    of contaminants from sediments due to extreme precipitation, increased winter
    precipitation, and changes in evapotranspiration (Islam et al., 2021; Sterk et
    al., 2016). Increased runoff and frequent leaching of animal faeces from agricultural
    farms have resulted in many waterborne disease outbreaks, exacerbated during high
    precipitation periods (Ananna et al., 2021; Levy et al., 2016). Precipitation
    can affect the movement and distribution of disease-causing agents, mainly through
    water sources. In addition, temperature determines the growth and survival of
    waste-derived pathogens in the soil and their subsequent transport via overland
    flow after applying faecal waste on land (Cissé, 2019; Sterk et al., 2016). Temperature
    and precipitation are two substantial predictors of Cryptosporidium contamination,
    particularly in regions with tropical climates (Jagai et al., 2009). 5. Cryptosporidium
    spp. in fresh fruits, vegetables, and related food products Unsafe food accounts
    for nearly 600 million foodborne diseases and approximately 420,000 annual deaths
    (Eslahi et al., 2023). It is estimated that 30 % of total foodborne deaths occur
    in children under five. According to WHO reports, the consumption of unsafe food
    results in the loss of 33 million years of healthy life worldwide each year, and
    this rate is probably underestimated (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011). The increased
    incidence of foodborne parasitic diseases has been revealed to be a consequence
    of old-fashioned agricultural practices, wild animals, poor sanitary facilities,
    disregard for sanitation rules by food service staff, globalization of the food
    industry, growth in worldwide food trade, convenient travel, the rise in the number
    of vulnerable individuals (e.g. aging, severely malnourished, and HIV-infected),
    changes in lifestyle and food habits, modified cooking practices, and advanced
    diagnostic techniques (Stryiński et al., 2020). The European Food Safety Authority
    reported 4005 foodborne outbreaks in the European Union (EU) in 2021, a 29.8 %
    increase compared to 2020. Furthermore, foodborne parasitic infections account
    for >1000 human cases reported annually in the EU (www.efsa.europa.eu). Although
    the European Union has implemented regulations for some foodborne parasites, there
    are still no published standards for protozoan parasites in food products (Stryiński
    et al., 2020). Cryptosporidium is among the most prominent foodborne parasites
    documented as the etiological agent in both waterborne and foodborne outbreaks
    reports (Karanis, 2018). Food-borne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis have been recorded
    since the beginning of the 1980s, and have been associated with an increase in
    reports of this infection in human populations (Ortega and Cama, 2008). Table
    2 shows the reports of Cryptosporidium spp. on vegetables, fruits and other other
    food products. However, the most well-known foodborne outbreak of Cryptosporidium
    infection was reported in October 1993 in central Maine, caused by drinking fresh
    pressed apple cider. The report indicated that Cryptosporidium oocysts in apple
    cider were also found on the cider press and in the faecal samples of a calf from
    the same farm where the apples were provided (Millard et al., 1994). Based on
    the current joint risk ranking of foodborne parasites by the WHO and FAO, Cryptosporidium
    is regarded as a significant foodborne pathogen, rated fifth among 24 potentially
    foodborne parasites (Ryan et al., 2018). Furthermore, Cryptosporidium is estimated
    to be among the top-five parasites out of 24 prioritized foodborne parasites in

    Italy Barlaam et al., 2022 Given the growing number of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks,
    the food industry has paid great attention to Cryptosporidium spp. (McKerr et
    al., 2015, McKerr et al., 2018). However, most attacks caused by foodborne infections
    have been poorly examined, never recognized, or unreported. In the last 30 years,
    26 outbreaks related to food-transmitted Cryptosporidium have been documented
    in countries in northern Europe, the UK, and the USA (Karanis, 2018). The few
    reports of foodborne outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium may be attributable to
    underreporting and underestimation (Gopfert et al., 2022). The lack of information
    on foodborne cryptosporidiosis may be attributed to several factors, including
    inadequate epidemiological research, the unavailability of outbreak specimens,
    the absence of a reliable diagnostic method for detecting low concentrations of
    Cryptosporidium oocysts in suspected samples, and the prolonged incubation period
    of the parasite (Budu-Amoako et al., 2011). Regardless of their potential health
    advantages, the consumption of fresh or undercooked vegetables has increasingly
    been identified as a source of foodborne infections resulting from different microbial
    pathogens (Li et al., 2020). In many countries, the demand for raw fruits and
    vegetables out of the season leads to the transportation of thousands of miles
    from growing areas to suppliers in various regions. This trend can result in foodborne
    disease outbreaks in several places simultaneously (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011).
    In recent years, a substantial increase in the incidence of foodborne diseases
    has been linked to the consumption of fresh vegetables (Ryan et al., 2018). Furthermore,
    foodborne disease outbreaks associated with contaminated fruits and vegetables
    are increasing globally (Tripathi et al., 2014). Enteric pathogens on vegetables
    and fruits may originate from irrigation water and/or soil contaminated with livestock
    manure, human faeces, raw sewage, or directly via animals during growth and irrigation,
    or even following unsafe storage and processing (Badri et al., 2022; Nasser, 2022).
    Moreover, vegetable and fruit risk contamination is caused by improper sanitary
    conditions during harvest and transport, marketing, and preparation by an infected
    consumer or food handler (Eraky et al., 2014). Foodborne infections are often
    associated with the consumption of raw produce contaminated by infected food handlers
    or sewage water (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011). Oocyst shedding may last >60 days
    after the termination of symptoms, concluding that infected food handlers can
    be a potential contamination source for foodstuffs even a long time after the
    diarrhoea subsides (Ryan et al., 2018). Other risk factors for contamination of
    vegetables and fruits include the application of inappropriately prepared composts
    and animal manure in agricultural fields, using night soils (faecal sludge), and
    irrigation with inadequately treated wastewater (Eslahi et al., 2022). A worldwide
    meta-analysis indicated that vegetable and fruit samples obtained from regions
    with lower economic status displayed the most significant incidence of protozoan
    parasite contamination. Consequently, Southeast Asia has the highest contamination
    rate (Badri et al., 2022). Fresh produce could be a potential vehicle for transmitting
    Cryptosporidium parasites if consumed under inappropriate conditions (Karanis,
    2018). In North America, Cryptosporidium spp. was the cause of critical outbreak
    cases due to contaminated fruits and vegetables imported from tropical areas,
    where pickers'' sanitary settings and personal hygiene are poor and untreated
    wastewater is used for irrigation purposes (Pozio, 2020). Moreover, contamination
    of fresh produce has been implicated in several large outbreaks of Cryptosporidium
    in European countries (Åberg et al., 2015; Ethelberg et al., 2009; McKerr et al.,
    2015; Pönka et al., 2009). The CDC''s surveillance system recorded that 120 multi-state
    foodborne outbreaks occurred in the US between 2010 and 2014, of which 17 cases
    were related to fruits, 15 cases involved vegetables (row crops), 10 instances
    included sprouts, and nine were related to seeded vegetables (such as cucumbers
    and mini peppers) (Riggio et al., 2019). Cryptosporidium spp. are widespread throughout
    the American continent and are a major cause of outbreaks of diarrhoea associated
    with water, ranking as the third leading cause of diarrhoea linked to animal contact
    in the United States. Between 2009 and 2017, 7465 cases were reported by 40 states
    and Puerto Rico. Over this period, the reported outbreaks showed an average annual
    increase of approximately 13 %. The primary contributors to these outbreaks include
    the ingestion of contaminated water in pools, direct contact with infected cattle,
    and exposure to infected individuals in childcare settings (Gharpure et al., 2019).
    Cryptosporidium oocysts are highly stable and capable of remaining viable in aquatic
    environments (e.g. surface waters) and soil for two years. In addition to their
    resistance to unfavourable environmental conditions, disinfectants and their ability
    to penetrate drinking water filters facilitate human exposure to contaminated
    water and food (Li et al., 2020). Low temperatures do not affect the survival
    of oocysts on fruits and vegetables, allowing them to remain potentially infectious
    in household refrigerators for several days to weeks. Oocysts, typically sticky
    on the surface, can persist and survive on the leaves of plants during growth,
    but they are resistant to intense washing and the use of disinfectants (Hohweyer
    et al., 2016; Kubina et al., 2023). In addition, the stomata of fresh leafy vegetables
    and fruits may enable oocysts to survive and be protected (Ryan et al., 2018).
    The most probable cause of the higher prevalence of parasitic contamination in
    vegetables is the large contact surface area of leafy vegetables, which increases
    the chances of exposure to parasitic agents (Karshima, 2018). Although there is
    a potential for infection by consuming contaminated food, the methods used to
    recover and detect Cryptosporidium oocysts from fruits and vegetables are often
    insufficient due to inconsistent recovery rates and high expenses. Among the various
    types of leafy greens, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is frequently contaminated
    and has been linked to C. parvum outbreaks. The recovery of Cryptosporidium oocysts
    from challenging samples, such as spinach with saponin-rich leaves, has been improved
    by the refinement of existing protocols using an alkaline 1 M glycine buffer (Razakandrainibe
    et al., 2020). Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a suitable technique for detecting parasitic
    oocysts in contaminated plant products with low concentrations of oocysts (Ahmed
    and Karanis, 2018). An accurate method that integrates cell culture and quantitative
    PCR (CC-qPCR) has been developed to detect infective C. parvum oocysts recovered
    from lamb''s lettuce, capable of detecting even a single infective oocyst (Kubina
    et al., 2021). Furthermore, nested multiplex PCR (mPCR) offers a fast, easy, and
    cost-effective approach for identifying protozoan pathogens in fresh produce (Shapiro
    et al., 2019). The cultivation of vegetables using non-polluting agricultural
    practices, organic farming techniques, and manure-based fertilizers has gained
    considerable attention. However, the source of the collected manure (farm animal
    faeces) may contain oocysts or may be indirectly contaminated with human waste.
    Flood irrigation methods for growing vegetables, primarily used in rural regions,
    can contaminate vegetables sold in markets and could be responsible for outbreaks
    (Li et al., 2020). Farm-to-fork is a concept for ensuring food safety, and it
    concentrates on all food production levels with control measures from farmland
    to consumers'' forks or drinking cups (Boyer and Kuczynska, 2010). According to
    FAO guidelines, the surveillance of foodborne diseases is a high priority for
    the development of food safety infrastructure. A global approach should be coordinated
    in order to support and strengthen national, regional, and international monitoring.
    As suggested by the FAO, critical strategies for advanced management of international
    foodborne diseases include establishing consistent laboratory training and related
    techniques, training for emergency preparedness, strengthened communication networks,
    and database development. In conclusion, agricultural producers should take appropriate
    measures to prevent foodstuffs from being contaminated by infectious pathogens
    in the farm environment (Millard et al., 1994). Properly washing raw vegetables
    and different chemical or radiation procedures are highly recommended for disinfection
    or sterilization of vegetables and fruits. The public health sector should raise
    awareness of the risk factors for transmitting foodborne parasites that contaminate
    fruits and vegetables. Foodborne outbreak investigations and monitoring of food-transmitted
    pathogens are fundamental concerns in food safety systems (FAO, 2020; Stryiński
    et al., 2020). Validated methodologies are required to accurately detect foodborne
    parasites (Chalmers et al., 2020). 6. Cryptosporidium spp. in animals 6.1. Cryptosporidium
    infection in cattle Cryptosporidiosis has serious animal health and economic implications
    for livestock production (de Graaf et al., 1999). Bovines are the most critical
    animal group infected with Cryptosporidium, probably due to their economic importance
    (Oliveira et al., 2021; Santín, 2013; Thomson et al., 2017). Cattle production
    is one of the most important agricultural industries worldwide. There are various
    species of farmed bovines, including cattle (Bos taurus), zebu (Bos taurus indicus),
    and water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). Bovine cryptosporidiosis has been reported
    worldwide (Robertson et al., 2014; Santín et al., 2008), and Cryptosporidium infections
    in bovines give rise to clinical manifestations including diarrhoea, abdominal
    discomfort, nausea, emesis, and reduced body mass. Nonetheless, cattle conditions
    are generally non-fatal (Santín, 2013). Cryptosporidium induces diarrhoea, particularly
    in young specimens, notably in neonatal dairy calves aged 1–3 weeks, due to low
    immunity (Doungmala et al., 2019; Nydam and Mohammed, 2005). In neonatal dairy
    calves, the clinical indications for cryptosporidiosis may range from mild to
    severe diarrhoea, accompanied by manifestations such as lethargy, loss of appetite,
    pyrexia, and profound dehydration (Castro-Hermida et al., 2002). Calves can recover
    4–6 weeks after infection with Cryptosporidium (Olson et al., 2004). A mortality
    rate of 35.5 % has been reported in animals younger than 30 days (Singh et al.,
    2006). The initial documentation of bovine cryptosporidiosis dates back to 1971,
    when it was reported that an eight-month-old-heifer experienced persistent diarrhoea
    (Panciera et al., 1971). Subsequently, Cryptosporidium spp. have become a frequent
    discovery on farms, occurring in cattle herds with calf diarrhoea issues and those
    without such problems. Recent studies have suggested that the most frequently
    encountered Cryptosporidium spp. in cattle are C. bovis, C. parvum, C. andersoni,
    and C. ryanae (Fayer et al., 2005; Fayer et al., 2008, Fayer et al., 2009; Lindsay
    et al., 2000). Of the four species mentioned, C. parvum and C. bovis were the
    most commonly identified in calves. The oocysts of C. andersoni were comparatively
    prominent, whereas those of C. parvum, C. bovis, and C. ryanae were similar in
    size and shape. Molecular methods have been used for species identification (Fayer
    et al., 2005, Fayer et al., 2008). In numerous studies conducted worldwide, C.
    parvum has been consistently found to be the predominant species infecting pre-weaned
    calves (Fayer et al., 2007; Santín et al., 2004; Santín, 2013). C. bovis and C.
    ryanae are primarily found in post-weaned calves (Fayer et al., 2010a), and C.
    andersoni infects the abomasum of juvenile and adult animals and occasionally
    young calves (Kváč et al., 2008; Lindsay et al., 2000; Olson et al., 2004; Santín,
    2013). Age-related patterns of Cryptosporidium species have been extensively documented
    in the scientific literature (Fayer et al., 2006, Fayer et al., 2007). C. bovis
    and C. ryanae do not cause clinical diarrhoea in cattle (Fayer et al., 2005; Santín,
    2013). Although C. parvum is often considered a primary pathogen in cryptosporidiosis
    cases in calves, reports suggest that C. bovis may also possess pathogenic potential.
    A study conducted in Sweden reported the presence of C. bovis as a single pathogen
    in diarrheal samples from calves aged >21 days (Silverlås et al., 2013). This
    indicates that C. bovis may cause disease and contribute to the clinical symptoms
    in older calves. C. bovis was first described in cattle in 2002 as a new genotype
    (Cryptosporidium genotype bovine B) (Xiao et al., 2002). Three years later, this
    species was officially recognized by the scientific community (Fayer et al., 2005).
    C. bovis οocysts measures are 4.76–5.35 × 4.17–4.76 μm, with a mean size of 4.89
    × 4.63 μm. After the experimental infection, the prepatent period of C. bovis
    was determined to be ten days (Fayer et al., 2005). C. bovis develops in the small
    intestine. It is often found in older animals and has uncertain clinical significance.
    Cattle are the most common hosts for C. bovis (Åberg et al., 2019; Firoozi et
    al., 2019; Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020; Ryan and Power, 2012; Yildirim et al.,
    2020), whereas human infection with C. bovis has been reported in a few cases
    (Khan et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2014; Ryan and Hijjawi, 2015). In 2004, C. ryanae
    was first described in the USA, as the Cryptosporidium deer-like genotype (Santín
    et al., 2004). C. ryanae, although never detected in deer, was named because of
    its 99.5 % similarity to previously reported deer genotype in the 18S rRNA gene
    locus (Xiao et al., 2002). Four years later, it was officially recognized as a
    species and designated C. ryanae (Fayer et al., 2008). With dimensions of 2.94–4.41
    μm × 2.94–3.68 μm and an average size of 3.16 × 3.73 μm, C. ryanae is one of the
    smallest known Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2008). Notably, C. ryanae
    has been identified worldwide (Åberg et al., 2019; Fayer et al., 2008; Feng et
    al., 2012; Jang et al., 2023; Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020;
    Yildirim et al., 2020). In addition to domestic cattle, C. ryanae has been detected
    in zebu cattle and buffalos (Feng et al., 2012). It is essential to mention that
    C. ryanae does not possess zoonotic potential, meaning that it is not known to
    be transmissible to humans (Khan et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2014). On the other
    hand, C. andersoni was first identified in cattle in 2000 (Lindsay et al., 2000).
    Oocysts are similar to those of C. muris described in mice, but larger than those
    of C. parvum. The size of C. andersoni oocysts is 6.0–8.1 × 5.0–6.5 μm, with a
    mean of 7.4 × 5.5 μm. It is notable that it is perceptibly more substantial than
    the other three species commonly found in cattle. This distinctive characteristic
    makes it easier to identify C. andersoni than other Cryptosporidium species through
    microscopy. Its large size aids in visual distinction, facilitating its recognition
    during microscopic examination (Lindsay et al., 2000). C. andersoni has been reported
    worldwide (Enemark et al., 2002; Firoozi et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2023; Mirzai
    et al., 2014; Ralston et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2013), and it is predominantly
    observed in young stock and adult animals, as reported in studies (Santín et al.,
    2004). In some countries, C. andersoni has been detected in pre-weaned calves
    (Jang et al., 2023; Kváč et al., 2011). Interestingly, infections caused by this
    parasite are frequently asymptomatic and post-mortem changes are not commonly
    observed (Kvác and Vítovec, 2003; Ralston et al., 2010). However, clinical signs
    of infection with C. andersoni in adult cows are characterized by weight gain
    and milk yield reduction, as documented in previous studies (Ralston et al., 2010).
    These clinical manifestations indicate the presence of C. andersoni in the adult
    cattle. C. andersoni has also been isolated from humans (Jiang et al., 2014; Leoni
    et al., 2006; Morse et al., 2007). C. parvum oocysts were first described in mice
    in 1912 (Tyzzer, 1912). Mature oocysts were ovoidal or spheroidal with a mean
    size of 5.41 μm × 4.93 μm (Fayer et al., 2008; Upton and Current, 1985). C. parvum
    is very common in young calves and it is the most frequently encountered species
    in diarrhoeic calves. However, it is often considered less severe and is associated
    with lower mortality rates than other Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2009).
    Cryptosporidium species are commonly associated with diarrhoea in young bovine
    calves and are the most critical Cryptosporidium species, causing economic losses
    (Santín et al., 2008). C. parvum can cause diarrhoea in calves, but may not always
    lead to severe clinical signs and adverse outcomes (Geurden et al., 2007; Silverlås
    et al., 2013). Clinical symptoms, such as watery diarrhoea, anorexia, fever, depression,
    and, in severe cases, even death, are primarily observed in calves up to six weeks
    of age (Robertson et al., 2014). C. parvum inhabits the small intestine, is the
    most common species in young calves, and is the cause of significant disease in
    this age group. The higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections among the
    younger age groups of livestock animals, including farm animals, can be attributed
    to the susceptibility of newborns. Cryptosporidium is a significant concern in
    newborn farm animals, primarily because it possesses an undeveloped immune system
    during the early stages of life (Danladi and Ugbomoiko, 2015; Santín, 2013). Calves
    are particularly susceptible to C. parvum infection because of their ability to
    acquire oocysts directly after birth. Early exposure to Cryptosporidium oocysts
    makes them highly vulnerable to infection, and clinical symptoms can manifest
    as early as three days post-infection (Santín et al., 2008). Notably, C. parvum
    is not limited to bovines; it is pathogenic to a wide range of animal species,
    including humans (Ryan et al., 2014; Ryan and Hijjawi, 2015). On the other hand,
    C. bovis, C. andersoni, and C. ryanae have a more restricted host range and are
    primarily found in cattle. Cattle are the primary reservoir for C. parvum, and
    the infection is common among calves worldwide (Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020;
    Ryan and Power, 2012; Yildirim et al., 2020). This widespread presence in cattle
    has significant implications for the epidemiology and transmission of C. parvum
    to various susceptible hosts including humans. It has zoonotic potential and can
    be transmitted to humans through the faecal-oral route, primarily during direct
    or indirect contact with infected animals (Ryan et al., 2014). Table 3 shows the
    cases of Cryptosporidium spp. infection in cattle. Table 3. Cryptosporidium spp.

    et al., 1996 Apart from the four widespread species previously mentioned, sporadic
    natural infections with various Cryptosporidium species and genotypes have been
    detected in cattle (Robertson et al., 2014). These include C. felis, C. hominis,
    C. scrofarum, C. serpentis, C. suis, and C. suis-like genotypes. Interestingly,
    C. felis and C. hominis have also been reported in cows (Bornay-Llinares et al.,
    1999; Smith et al., 2005). In France, Cryptosporidium infections have been detected
    in calves ranging from 3 to 7 weeks of age. However, it is noteworthy that no
    clinical disease was observed in calves infected with C. hominis (Razakandrainibe
    et al., 2018). Furthermore, experimental infections have shown that C. canis,
    typically associated with dogs, can infect cattle (Fayer et al., 2001). In addition
    C. ubiquitum has been experimentally transmitted to cattle and it was rarely found
    in people in England and Wales (Fayer et al., 2010b). 6.2. Cryptosporidium infection
    in small ruminants The economic significance of sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra
    aegagrus hircus) in the global agricultural industry cannot be overstated as they
    play a crucial role in providing meat, milk, and wool. However, Cryptosporidium
    infection poses a significant challenge for small domestic ruminants, such as
    sheep and goats, especially during the neonatal stages. These infections are the
    primary cause of neonatal diarrhoea, resulting in high morbidity and mortality
    rates in lambs. Neonatal diarrhoea is one of the most prevalent and costly diseases
    affecting small ruminants. Cryptosporidium is a significant enteropathogen, and
    its association with this enteric condition has been well documented in scientific
    literature (Angus et al., 1982; Sari et al., 2009). Controlling and managing Cryptosporidium
    infection in sheep and goats is of the utmost importance to ensure the health
    and productivity of these valuable animals in the agricultural sector. The primary
    clinical sign of cryptosporidiosis in sheep and goats is diarrhoea, although anorexia,
    depression, and abdominal pain may also be present (Paul et al., 2014). Cryptosporidium
    infection in sheep was first described in 1974 in Australia in 1- to 3-week-old
    lambs with diarrhoea (Barker and Carbonell, 1974). In goats, infection by this
    agent was first reported six years later, also in Australia, in a 2-week-old child
    with diarrhoea (Mason et al., 1981). Ovine cryptosporidiosis has been reported
    worldwide (Dessì et al., 2020; Kaupke et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2023; Paraud
    and Chartier, 2012; Santín et al., 2007). In sheep, the identification of several
    Cryptosporidium species and genotypes varies across studies and is influenced
    by the age of the animals. Among the dominant Cryptosporidium species found in
    sheep and goats C. parvum, C. ubiquitum, and C. xiaoi are known to cause mild
    to severe diarrhoea and even mortality in these animals (Díaz et al., 2010a; Díaz
    et al., 2010b; Imre et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2021). C. xiaoi was initially characterized
    in sheep in 2009 (Fayer and Santín, 2009). Its oocysts resemble those of C. bovis
    but are slightly smaller, measuring 2.94–4.41 μm × 2.94–4.41 μm (mean = 3.94 μm
    × 3.44 μm), with a length/width shape index of 1.15 (Fayer and Santín, 2009).
    Sporadic infections with C. bovis (sheep), C. hominis (goats), C. suis, C. andersoni
    (sheep and goats), C. fayeri, and C. scrofarum have been reported (Karanis et
    al., 2007; Koinari et al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2005; Santín, 2013; Yang et al.,
    2014). Cryptosporidium oocysts are predominantly observed in very young lambs,
    typically between one and three weeks of age, with a lower incidence in older
    animals (Causapé et al., 2002; Majewska et al., 2000; Sari et al., 2009). In lambs
    older than one month, Cryptosporidium infections are generally subclinical, meaning
    that they do not exhibit overt clinical symptoms. However, subclinical infections
    can occur even in younger animals, which means they are infected but do not show
    apparent signs of illness. Despite the lack of noticeable clinical symptoms, Cryptosporidium
    infections can affect animals. Infected lambs may experience a reduced body condition
    score, potentially affecting their overall productivity (Sweeny et al., 2011,
    Sweeny et al., 2012). Cryptosporidium infection was detected in all age groups
    of goats. However, the prevalence of infection and illness is notably higher in
    kids (Paraud and Chartier, 2012). Caprine cryptosporidiosis primarily affects
    young goats aged 0–2 months. The prepatent period, which is the time between infection
    and the appearance of oocysts in faeces, was approximately four days. Clinical
    symptoms are more pronounced in young children, indicating that the disease manifests
    more severely in this age group (Paul et al., 2014). Generally, the prevalence
    increased until sheep and goats were 5–6 weeks of age and then gradually declined.
    Sheep cryptosporidiosis poses a significant risk to public health. Small ruminants,
    including sheep, can serve as potential reservoirs of Cryptosporidium, contributing
    to the transmission of this parasite to humans (Koinari et al., 2014). Sheep and
    goats are reservoirs of C. hominis and C. parvum (Imre et al., 2013; Lange et
    al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2005). Outbreaks of Cryptosporidium infection in schoolchildren
    have been linked to contact with lambs and goats (Lange et al., 2014). This highlights
    the zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium, in which the parasite can be transmitted
    from animals to humans, causing infections in susceptible individuals. Californian
    scientists have proposed several measures to reduce the shedding of zoonotic Cryptosporidium
    in sheep and minimize the risk of transmission. These measures effectively manage
    lamb health, prevent contact between sheep and cattle, and ensure the utilization
    of safe drinking water sources for sheep (Li et al., 2022). By implementing these
    preventive strategies, a significant contribution can be made to protect the health
    of animals and humans. Table 4 shows the cases of Cryptosporidium spp. infection
    in sheep and goats. Table 4. Cryptosporidium spp. detection in faecal samples

    Cryptosporidium reservoir, and Cryptosporidium affects pigs of all ages (Chen
    et al., 2023). Cryptosporidium infections in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus)
    have been extensively documented globally (Budu-Amoako et al., 2012; Chen et al.,
    2023; Farzan et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2008; Kváč et al., 2009a, Kváč et al.,
    2009b; Li et al., 2022; Petersen et al., 2015). Initial reports of Cryptosporidium
    infections in domestic pigs were reported by Berglund in the USA (Bergeland, 1977;
    Kennedy et al., 1977). C. suis, C. parvum, C. muris, C. andersoni, C. scrofarum
    (previously known as Cryptosporidium pig genotype II), and C. tyzzeri (previously
    known as Cryptosporidium mouse genotype I) have been isolated from pigs (Zheng
    et al., 2019). Recent research has shown that C. suis and C. scrofarum display
    host specificity, indicating that they are more specifically adapted to infect
    pigs. Additionally, C. scrofarum exhibits age-specific patterns of infection (Jeníková
    et al., 2011; Kváč et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2004a). The oocysts of C. scrofarum
    have dimensions measuring 4.81–5.96 μm (with a mean of 5.16 μm) in length and
    4.23–5.29 μm (with a mean of 4.83 μm) in width, resulting in a length-to-width
    ratio of 1.07 ± 0.06. These specific morphological characteristics help to differentiate
    C. scrofarum from other Cryptosporidium species in pigs. Oocysts of C. suis have
    dimensions measuring 4.9–4.4 μm (with a mean of 4.6 μm) in length and 4.0–4.3
    μm (with a mean of 4.2 μm) in width, resulting in a length-to-width ratio of 1.1
    (Kváč et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2004a). C. suis exhibits a higher frequency of
    infection in pre-weaned pigs, whereas C. scrofarum is typically detected in older
    animals (Johnson et al., 2008; Kváč et al., 2009a; Langkjaer et al., 2007). Most
    Cryptosporidium-infected pigs were between 2 and 3 months of age, followed by
    animals aged 1–2 months, 3–5 months, and those <1 month. Various Cryptosporidium
    species have been detected in farm pigs, including C. parvum, C. muris, and C.
    tyzzeri, which are commonly associated with mice (Kváč et al., 2013). The sporadic
    occurrence of C. parvum in pigs offers evidence to support the potential role
    of pigs in the transmission of Cryptosporidium from animals to humans. Pigs serve
    as reservoir hosts for C. scrofarum and C. suis, which can induce cryptosporidiosis
    in human (Li et al., 2022). Table 5 presents the cases of Cryptosporidium spp.
    infection in pigs. Table 5. Cryptosporidium spp. detection in faecal samples of

    in most areas of the world suggest that livestock farms must be considered a public
    health threat, and proper control measures should be introduced. Variations in
    the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections in pigs can be attributed to many
    factors. These factors include the size of the sample population, geographical
    region or location of the study, prevailing climatic conditions, age of the animals
    under investigation, specific diagnostic methods employed, pig breed, hygiene
    conditions maintained, and the overall management practices implemented (Santin,
    2020). 6.4. Cryptosporidium infection in fish Cryptosporidium species have been
    identified in various types of fish found in marine and freshwater environments,
    as well as in fish raised on farms, kept in captivity, and used as ornamental
    pets worldwide (Certad et al., 2020; Golomazou and Karanis, 2020). Consequently,
    aquatic environments are susceptible to contamination by agricultural runoff,
    rainwater, bathing activities, and sewage discharge (Ryan et al., 2014). The presence
    of parasites in marine habitats facilitates its distribution and transmission,
    whereas environmental aquatic substrate-associated biofilms serve as reservoirs,
    protecting the parasite within its matrices and surfaces (Masangkay et al., 2020).
    Direct transmission of the parasite has been confirmed in fish species such as
    the gilthead seabream and seabass, primarily through ingestion of mature oocysts
    released in faeces. Additionally, cannibalism and predation among infected and
    uninfected fish can also contribute to the spread of infection (Alvarez-Pellitero
    and Sitjà-Bobadilla, 2002; Sitjà-Bobadilla and Alvarez-Pellitero, 2003). Other
    aquatic organisms, such as eukaryotic organisms and macro-invertebrates, as well
    as live food such as Artemia and rotifers which are supplied to farmed fish, may
    act as reservoirs for Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2000b; Gómez-Couso
    et al., 2003; Méndez-Hermida et al., 2007; Reboredo-Fernández et al., 2014). Fish
    can host 11 known species of Cryptosporidium along with 29 additional genotypes
    specific to fish hosts. In contrast, other species and genotypes are specific
    to fish hosts, while others that are typically found in non-fish hosts, such as
    C. parvum, C. hominis, C. ubiquitum, C. scrofarum, C. xiaoi, and the rat genotype
    III, have also been detected in fish. The occurrence of non-fish-specific Cryptosporidium
    species in fish is likely attributed to the pollution of the aquatic ecosystem
    with disease-causing Cryptosporidium species originating from agricultural runoff
    and sewage discharge (Couso-Pérez et al., 2022; Golomazou et al., 2021; Moratal
    et al., 2022). Cryptosporidium infections have been documented in various farmed
    fish species in different regions. These include gilthead seabream and European
    seabass in Spain, turbot and rainbow trout in Spain, Murray cod in Australia,
    Asian seabass in Vietnam, Nile tilapia in Papua New Guinea, cichlids in Israel,
    and red drum in Louisiana, USA (Golomazou et al., 2021; Moratal et al., 2022;
    Reghaissia et al., 2022). When fish in aquaculture settings are exposed to Cryptosporidium,
    particularly under conditions of high stocking densities, temporarily unfavourable
    environmental factors, and specific farming practices, the prevalence of infection
    and mortality rates can be significantly elevated. This poses a notable concern
    for the global aquaculture industry, because Cryptosporidium can threaten aquatic
    hosts and humans, leading to negative economic consequences. Cryptosporidium infections
    in fish can trigger a robust stress response, compromising animal welfare and
    resulting in severe infections due to decreased immune competence. Harsh conditions
    are associated with impaired fish growth, pronounced pathological consequences,
    and elevated mortality rates (Alvarez-Pellitero et al., 2004; Sitjà-Bobadilla
    et al., 2005). Clinical and pathological signs of Cryptosporidium infection include
    listlessness, retarded growth, anorexia, and increased mortality, particularly
    in cases of heavy infections (Baragahare et al., 2011). Additionally, observations
    revealed muscle wasting, tissue atrophy, severe weight loss, enlargement of the
    coelomic cavities, and abdominal swelling (ascites). Necropsy indicates indigestion,
    intestinal distension due to the accumulation of mucus and gas in the intestines,
    and the presence of whitish faeces (Alvarez-Pellitero et al., 2004; Murphy et
    al., 2009; Zanguee et al., 2010). The histopathological effects of Cryptosporidium
    infection in fish tissues include necrosis, vacuolization, degradation, disaggregation,
    and shedding of epithelial cells (Baragahare et al., 2011). Severe inflammation,
    gastric mucosal epithelial cell necrosis, atrophy in the mucosal glandular, and
    reduction in glandular tissue may also be present (Ryan et al., 2004b). In severely
    infected fish, clusters of oocysts can be found in broad vacuolated areas within
    the lumen surrounded by enlarged macrophages (Alvarez-Pellitero and Sitjà-Bobadilla,
    2002). Massive infections can lead to severe intestinal lesions, and oocysts can
    cover the epithelial surface, distorting the tissue architecture. The presence
    of Cryptosporidium in aquatic environments and its potential transmission through
    fish consumption are notable fish-borne risk factors (Moratal et al., 2020). The
    inclusion of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in fish is a public
    health concern, emphasizing the association between fishborne cryptosporidiosis
    and the handling and consumption of infected fish (Certad et al., 2015; Couso-Pérez
    et al., 2018; Koinari et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2010; Ziarati et al., 2022).
    Among the zoonotic subtypes, C. parvum is the most identified source of zoonotic
    infections, and has been detected in numerous fish species and geographical regions,
    including wild and farmed edible fish. Although the prevalence of infections and
    diseases is generally low, trout species have exhibited the highest prevalence
    (Couso-Pérez et al., 2018, Couso-Pérez et al., 2019). Cryptosporidium in cultured
    trout is significant, mainly due to the stressful conditions associated with farming,
    such as increased fish density, which facilitates pathogen transmission (Alvarez-Pellitero
    et al., 2004). This is further compounded by the increased prevalence observed
    during the early growing stages, as fish have an undeveloped and immature immune
    system (Sitjà-Bobadilla et al., 2005). Moreover, the recent identification of
    C. ubiquitum, which is responsible for human infections, in the European sea bass
    in Spain shows an additional risk for consumers (Moratal et al., 2022). The detection
    of parasites in fish fillets is likely attributable to the fish preparation process,
    including potential contamination during evisceration and cleaning processes (Certad
    et al., 2015). This underscores the possibility of contamination of the edible
    parts of the fish from the digestive tract. Zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in
    edible fish broaden the spectrum of emerging foods responsible for cryptosporidiosis,
    emphasizing their potential threat to public health. Table 6 provides an overview

    Reghaissia et al., 2022 7. Zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. - risk
    to farmers People in contact with wastewater have a heightened risk of gastrointestinal
    infection. Surprisingly, relatively less attention has been directed toward comprehending
    the threat faced by farmers routinely exposed to wastewater, particularly in the
    urban and peri-urban irrigation hubs used for food production. The absence of
    well-structured on-farm practices and utilization of suitable irrigation techniques,
    coupled with the lack of on-farm wastewater treatment, elevates the annual risk
    of infection to a tolerable threshold. There is a notable direct correlation between
    the calculated likelihood of farmers'' exposure and certain vital factors, such
    as the concentration of pathogens in irrigation water, the method employed for
    on-farm water treatment, the frequency of accidental wastewater ingestion, and
    the frequency of exposure to Cryptosporidium spp., as detailed by Sampson et al.
    (2017). It is essential to recognize that the infective dose remains a critical
    parameter, signifying a substantial risk, as it is challenging to precisely predict
    the quantity of Cryptosporidium spp. that may be ingested daily through unintentional
    wastewater consumption. Domestic animals infected with Cryptosporidium can serve
    as reservoirs for transmitting the infection to susceptible individuals, including
    humans. People working closely with farmed animals, such as farmers and vets,
    are at an increased risk of contracting infection. Individuals who handle animals
    on calf farms, such as calf handlers, face an increased risk of contracting diarrhoea
    due to cryptosporidiosis transmitted from infected calves. Cattle are considered
    a substantial reservoir and source of zoonotic infection because C. parvum subtypes
    that infect humans have been found in cattle (Xiao and Fayer, 2008). This highlights
    the potential for the transmission of Cryptosporidium from cattle to humans, posing
    a significant public health concern. C. parvum is an important zoonotic pathogen
    that can cause severe outbreaks of diarrhoea in industrialized countries, particularly
    in vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV patients),
    children, and the elderly (Xiao and Feng, 2008). These groups are more susceptible
    to severe symptoms and complications following infection with Cryptosporidium.
    For immunocompromised individuals, additional precautions are necessary to prevent
    exposure to Cryptosporidium spp. It is advisable to restrict access to young animals
    and potentially even restrict their access to farms to minimize the risk of infection
    (Fayer et al., 2000a; Karanis et al., 2007). Applying a quantitative microbial
    risk assessment approach revealed a notable incidence of waterborne pathogens
    affecting urban farmers use wastewater for agricultural and aquaculture purposes.
    In Africa, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium among farmers exhibits a spectrum
    that aligns with the expected range derived from previous prevalence reports on
    Cryptosporidium infections in children and adults (Squire et al., 2017). In specific
    instances, dairy farm labourers have exhibited a significant parasite prevalence,
    as documented by Siwila et al. (2007). Notably, within these farm environments,
    C. parvum was identified in 75 % of the individuals who tested positive among
    farm workers and 60 % of household members. This observation points to the possibility
    of zoonotic transmission on these farms, stemming from infected animals. In Pakistan,
    individuals cohabiting with domestic animals such as cows, sheep, buffaloes, and
    goats appear to be at a heightened risk of infection. The highest prevalence rates
    have been observed among individuals close to domestic animals and those with
    suspected human interactions, particularly in areas where cows, buffalos, and
    other domesticated animals frequently access and utilize surface water sources,
    including rivers, streams, and canals (Khan et al., 2019). In Vietnam, the prevalence
    of gastrointestinal infections has led to a significant disease burden, which
    is notably higher among farmers than in the general population. This disparity
    exceeds the revised WHO tolerable threshold by more than a hundredfold, as described
    by Fuhrimann et al. (2017). This divergence is expected given that farmers in
    developing nations engage in non-mechanized farming practices and frequently come
    into contact with infected animals. In contrast, in the United Kingdom, other
    European countries, New Zealand, and China, where intensive dairy farming practices
    are prevalent, the elevated prevalence of the disease is likely attributable to
    transmission via livestock, and C. parvum has assumed a more prominent role in
    causing cryptosporidiosis than C. hominis (Lebbad et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2021).
    Moreover, a potential risk is associated with handling fish that carry zoonotic
    Cryptosporidium species. This risk becomes more pronounced during the preparation
    and handling of fish as it facilitates parasite transmission. An evaluation of
    probabilistic risk, encompassing both fish and hand wash samples, indicated that
    fishermen are vulnerable to infection after fishing activities and the consumption
    of captured fish, a risk scenario substantiated by Roberts et al. (2007). This
    risk is further corroborated by C. parvum transmission, which was confirmed when
    handling blue crabs (Graczyk et al., 2007). 8. Prevention and mitigation strategies
    in primary production The One Health concept provides several prospects for preventing
    cryptosporidiosis, particularly regarding the infection caused by C. parvum and
    other zoonotic species that affect animal and human health (Innes et al., 2020).
    This approach can be primarily practical via: 1. Manure treatment to reduce oocyst
    viability. 2. Protection of water catchments from contamination with livestock
    faeces. 3. Prevention and control of infection in livestock. Effective reduction
    of oocyst viability can be achieved through practices such as slurry storage,
    precise composting of manure (where oocysts become inactive at temperatures exceeding
    60 °C), low pH and ammonia levels, and mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion
    processes (Vermeulen et al., 2017). Therefore, managing manure and slurry on farmlands
    can diminish the viability of Cryptosporidium oocysts and subsequently minimize
    the potential for infection in the environment, particularly in water catchments
    (Kay et al., 2012). Implementing comprehensive preventive and regulatory strategies
    aimed at mitigating cryptosporidiosis in livestock and adopting farm management
    practices to minimize environmental contamination with infectious oocysts yields
    significant positive outcomes in terms of animal health, welfare, and productivity.
    These measures provide economic benefits for livestock farmers on a global scale
    and mitigate parasite transmission by safeguarding the environment and water catchments
    (Innes et al., 2020). Effective management of surface runoff, excluding grazing
    animals from these areas, is essential in curbing the potential dissemination
    of oocysts into surface streams, employing management strategies that maintain
    high vegetation that allows heating and UV radiation penetration in the soil surface,
    leading to the inactivation of oocysts. Considering that a substantial portion
    of oocysts resides in the lower layers of forage, transitioning livestock to pastures
    with taller vegetation can reduce their exposure to oocysts and subsequently decrease
    infection rates and environmental contamination. Potential approaches to mitigate
    the substantial contamination risks posed to water resources, include canopy management
    techniques, wildlife management practices, and the implementation of short-cycle
    rotational grazing strategies to prevent infection and subsequent environmental
    pollution (Boyer and Kuczynska, 2010; Innes et al., 2020). Given the absence of
    an effective vaccine against cryptosporidiosis in livestock, disease prevention
    can be achieved by providing ample quantities of high-quality colostrum to newborn
    calves within the first few hours of life. Particular attention should be paid
    to segregating younger calves into age-specific groups, as they are particularly
    susceptible to infection by older calves. Infected calves should be isolated from
    healthy animals for at least one week after the cessation of diarrhoea to minimize
    transmission (Innes et al., 2020). Moreover, implementing measures such as regular
    sanitation of pens, ensuring deep and clean straw bedding, maintaining appropriate
    housing with elevated feeding and water troughs, and employing steam cleaning
    techniques are strongly recommended to minimize exposure of calves to faecal matter
    within the surrounding environment (Meganck et al., 2014). Disinfection with hydrogen
    peroxide can further reduce the proliferation of contaminated faeces on farms.
    At the same time, hydrated lime is indicated as an efficient disinfectant to reduce
    contamination in calf pens (Björkman et al., 2018; Innes et al., 2020). In addition,
    implementing vegetative surface treatments on livestock farms is an effective
    measure to provide soil stabilization during storm events. Straw mulch has emerged
    as a widely adopted technique for mitigating soil erosion resulting from soil
    particle entrainment and raindrop impact on bare soil surfaces (Miller et al.,
    2008). Implementing good agricultural practices and meticulous handling protocols,
    robust risk prevention measures, and adopting alternative decontamination methods
    are paramount to effectively prevent and mitigate outbreaks stemming from contaminated
    fresh produce. Furthermore, incorporating vegetative filter strips has consistently
    demonstrated their merit in reducing runoff and impeding pathogen transport of
    pathogens (Innes et al., 2020). In addition to the implementation of vegetated
    and riparian buffer strips, the strategic fencing of livestock to restrict their
    access to streams and other water bodies serves as a valuable measure to disrupt
    the Cryptosporidium oocysts in water resources (Kay et al., 2012). 9. Conclusion
    Agricultural settings can serve as a potential source of Cryptosporidium species
    contamination due to faecal matter from both humans and animals. Contamination
    from agricultural sources can lead to water pollution, affecting the water used
    for drinking, recreational activities, and irrigation. Cryptosporidium infections
    are of significant concern in farming practices, as they are closely linked to
    the production of fresh fruits, vegetables, terrestrial and aquatic animals, and
    public health. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a novel conceptual framework
    for the agricultural sector. Farmers are frequently exposed to wastewater, rendering
    them susceptible to an elevated risk of Cryptosporidium infections. It is imperative
    to establish an active policy framework that incorporates a multi-barrier strategy
    aimed at reducing farmer-wastewater interactions and mitigating disease risks.
    Implementing enhanced wastewater management regulations specifically designed
    to safeguard farmers and diminish their exposure to oocysts, is a vital requirement.
    The adoption of a proactive management approach is indispensable for effectively
    reducing the risks associated with such directions. The guidelines provided by
    the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding wastewater reuse present a comprehensive
    framework suitable for developing nations. These guidelines encompass a range
    of approaches that can be customized for local policies and cultural contexts.
    They were given priority in a multi-barrier strategy that focused on the mitigation
    of Cryptosporidium spp. The presence of accidental infection in farmers through
    the incorporation of appropriate measures to minimize direct sewage exposure is
    of utmost importance. Local policy directives play a vital role in successfully
    implementing this approach to effectively reduce infection risk among farmers.
    Farmers are pivotal in the agricultural sector, and implementing on-farm management
    measures can significantly mitigate the risk of Cryptosporidium spp. exposure,
    contingent upon providing comprehensive training to farmers. Research has consistently
    shown that well-informed farmers possess heightened awareness of the health hazards
    associated with urban farming and proactively adopt practices to diminish these
    risks, underscoring their enhanced proficiency in risk management. CRediT authorship

    Notes Abstract Remote sensing technology is an essential tool for tracking human-induced
    alterations on the water cycle, among which irrigation prevails. The possibility
    of obtaining detailed and accurate information on the actual irrigation extent
    through remote-sensing-based approaches is of paramount importance for water resources
    management. In this study, an update of the TSIMAP (Temporal-Stability-derived
    Irrigation MAPping) method, originally developed with satellite soil moisture
    as an input, is proposed. To demonstrate that the flexibility of the approach
    does not affect its main strength point (i.e., good accuracy in the face of high
    simplicity for users), a dual analysis relying on 1 km NDVI (Normalised Difference
    Vegetation Index) instead of soil moisture is carried out over the Ebro basin
    (Spain); data delivered by the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) are used.
    First, results of this work are compared with outcomes from the method’s original
    implementation obtained over a focus area (denominated “Ebro_CATAR”) through satellite
    soil moisture. In the proposed configuration relying on NDVI, an overall accuracy
    (OA) up to 93% is found. Results highlight an increase in OA ranging from +2%
    to +6% depending on the validation strategy with respect to the TSIMAP implementation
    relying on soil moisture. Then, a basin-scale application is performed, providing
    performances still satisfactory (OA = 75%) notwithstanding a higher degree of
    heterogeneity. Keywords: irrigation mapping; remote sensing; TSIMAP; temporal
    stability; K-means algorithm 1. Introduction Irrigation is the prevalent source
    of anthropogenic water consumption. Its effects have repercussions on multiple
    dynamics affecting human beings and Earth’s surface [1], such as food production
    [2,3,4], spread of diseases [5,6], freshwater availability [7,8,9] and climate
    [10,11,12]. Notwithstanding this, irrigation is still often not considered a hydrological
    variable in its own right, and data on irrigation dynamics are often missing [13,14,15]
    or not scientifically organised [16]. The detailed knowledge of actual irrigation
    extents is crucial for many hydrological and water resource management applications
    [17,18,19]. Starting from the early 2000s, several irrigation mapping techniques
    relying on satellite information have been developed. As pointed out by the comprehensive
    review by Massari et al. [20], various types of satellite retrievals from optical
    [21,22,23,24], to cite a few, and microwave, see, e.g., [25,26,27,28], sensors
    can be successfully exploited for mapping irrigated areas at different spatial
    scales. Methods relying on multi-source input data also exist [29,30,31,32,33,34].
    Most of the approaches available in the scientific literature rely on supervised
    machine learning models requiring training; hence, ancillary ground-truth information
    is required for their implementation. By contrast, Dari et al. [27] proposed a
    novel approach for speedy irrigation mapping relying on a combination of statistical
    features derived from the temporal stability theory [35] and the unsupervised
    k-means clustering algorithm [36], henceforth defined as TSIMAP (Temporal-Stability-derived
    Irrigation MAPping) approach. The method does not require any training procedure
    and, as recently pointed out in a comparative analysis by Bazzi et al. [37], ensures
    satisfactory performances in face of its simplicity. So far, the method has been
    developed and implemented with satellite soil moisture at different spatial resolutions
    as input [27,28]. Nevertheless, it is supposed to work with any kind of input
    information that is a proxy for irrigation occurrence. The aim of this work is
    to actually demonstrate the flexibility of the TSIMAP method, whose applicability
    is not limited by a single type of input data. In order to achieve this, a twofold
    analysis carried out over the Ebro basin (Spain) by exploiting 1 km NDVI (Normalised
    Difference Vegetation Index) from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) is
    proposed. First, a comparative analysis with outcomes from the method’s implementation
    relying on satellite soil moisture by Dari et al. [27] is carried out. The comparison
    is focused over the same period (2016–2017) and the same portion of the Ebro basin
    considered in a previous study by the authors. As a second step, a basin-scale
    application considering the irrigation seasons in the time span of 2015–2020is
    performed. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The study is focused over
    the Ebro basin (Spain), a site that has attracted, in recent years, the interest
    of many researchers working on the topic of irrigation monitoring through satellite
    data [26,34,38,39,40,41]. This is because the Ebro catchment is an area rich in
    irrigation data, a rather rare feature worldwide. With a total drainage area of
    about 86,000 km2, the Ebro basin is the largest Mediterranean catchment of Spain;
    it is prevalently characterised by a cold semi-arid climate with an oceanic climate
    area in its Northern portion [42], where several reservoirs store water from the
    Pyrenees to be delivered to the crops located downstream in the central valley
    through a complex network of irrigation canals [39]. The analysis presented in
    this study is carried out on the basin’s flat agricultural portions only, which
    are shown in Figure 1. Such a domain includes both irrigated and non-irrigated
    areas; it is outlined through the 100 m resolution Corine Land Cover data set
    referring to the year 2018 (CLC 2018), distributed by the Copernicus Land Monitoring
    Service (https://doi.org/10.2909/960998c1-1870-4e82-8051-6485205ebbac (accessed
    on 13 November 2019). The land cover types that are considered are listed in the
    figure’s legend. It is important to specify that the information from the CLC
    2018 is only used to delineate the spatial domain of agricultural areas (rainfed
    and irrigated) to be considered; as a benchmark for the actual extent of irrigated
    areas, we use more site-specific and accurate data sets as described in Section
    2.3. Moreover, a double-scale analysis is carried out. First, the area enclosed
    by the red box of Figure 1 is considered in order to compare results with outcomes
    of Dari et al. [27]; such portion, whose extension is 10,000 km2, encloses a wide
    irrigated area shared between the Catalonia and Aragon regions and is henceforth
    denominated “Ebro_CATAR”. Then, a basin-scale application is performed (see Section
    2.3 for further details). Figure 1. Land cover classes according to the Corine
    Land Cover 2018 (CLC 2018) data set that are enclosed in the portion of the Ebro
    basin considered in this study. The comparison with results from Dari et al. [27]
    is carried out over the portion delimited by the red box, the Ebro_CATAR area.

    The TSIMAP Method: Theory and Input Data The TSIMAP method was first proposed
    by Dari et al. [27]. It relies on the temporal stability concept originally formulated
    by Vachaud et al. [35] for optimising soil moisture measurement networks [43,44,45,46].
    Morbidelli et al. [47] also explored the possibility of adapting the concept to
    raingauge network design. The theory relies on statistical features able to describe
    the spatiotemporal dynamics of the input data set. Hence, if applied to an irrigation
    proxy variable, it is possible to use the temporal stability theory to detect
    where irrigation actually occurs. With this intuition, the approach was originally
    proposed by exploiting satellite soil moisture as an input [27]. In this study,
    the method is implemented using NDVI data from the CGLS (https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/ndvi
    (accessed on 29 November 2023)), retrieved through the VEGETATION sensor aboard
    the SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) platform, subsequently substituted,
    from 2013 onwards, by PROBA-V (PRoject for On-Board Autonomy-VEGETATION) [48].
    Specifically, product version 2.2 characterised by a spatial resolution of 1 km
    and sampled at a temporal frequency of 10 days is used [49]. Data from 2015 to
    2020 are considered. Considering the NDVI value observed at the pixel 𝑥 and time

             (2) If averaged in time during the highest intensity irrigation
    season, which for the study area coincides with the period spanning from May to
    September [27], the relative differences and the temporal anomalies can be used
    as diagnostic indices for detecting where irrigation occurs. In fact, during the
    irrigation seasons, irrigated crops are expected to show well-developed vegetation
    conditions, which can be translated into higher values of relative differences
    and of temporal anomalies with respect to rainfed areas. On the basis of such
    an assumption, the temporal-stability-derived indices can be used as input features
    for the k-means clustering method [36]. It allows to group 𝑛 data points into
    𝑘 clusters on the basis of their similarity, expressed by the minimum Euclidian
    distance with each cluster’s centroid. The k-means is an unsupervised clustering
    algorithm; hence, it does not require any training, but the user is asked to interpret
    the clusters’ meaning. Further details can be found in Dari et al. [27,28]. In
    this work, the mean relative differences (RD) and the mean temporal anomalies
    (TA) during the highest intensity irrigation seasons are used as input data points
    for k-means clustering. The final output consists in binary maps of rainfed and
    irrigated areas at 1 km spatial resolution. 2.3. Work Logic and Ground Truth Data
    Sets A twofold analysis is carried out. First, a comparison between results obtained
    by forcing the TSIMAP approach with NDVI data and outcomes of the method’s first
    implementation relying on soil moisture [27] is performed. The analysis iscarried
    out over the same basin’s portion considered in Dari et al. [27], the Ebro_CATAR
    domain (10,000 km2), enclosing the largest irrigated portion of the entire basin.
    In this first analysis, the same validation strategy proposed in the previous
    work by the authors is implemented to ensure that the comparison is as fair as
    possible. The crop maps produced over the domain of the Geographic Information
    System for Agricultural Parcels (SIGPAC) and distributed by the Department d’Agricultura,
    Ramaderia, Pesca i Alimentació are used. This data set, henceforth referred to
    as SIGPAC data, is available at the plot scale and for each year at http://agricultura.gencat.cat/ca/serveis/cartografia-sig/aplicatius-tematics-geoinformacio/sigpac/mapa-cultius/
    (accessed on 9 October 2019). It is noteworthy that the data set is available
    for the Catalonia region only. The pre-processing chain to aggregate SIGPAC data
    from the original resolution to 1 km is fully described in Dari et al. [27]; the
    only difference adopted in this work is that natural or forested areas are not
    considered, so, this kind of pixels are masked out. Two types of information contained
    in the SIGPAC data set are exploited, resulting in an equal number of validation
    assessments. First, the irrigated/non-irrigated attribute is exploited (first
    validation). Even though the irrigated areas of the Ebro basin are quite static
    in time, as thoroughly explained in Dari et al. [27], the irrigation attribute
    in the SIGPAC data set means that the irrigation network can reach a specific
    field, but it does not necessarily imply that irrigation actually occurs there.
    Hence, the information referring to summer crops only, which are very likely irrigated
    during the irrigation season, is considered in the second validation, in which
    all the other crops are considered as rainfed. Similarly to what was performed
    in Dari et al. [27], this first analysis covers the 2-year period of 2016–2017.
    It is important to mention that in the previous work by the authors, experiments
    considering three clusters (rainfed, natural/forested and irrigated areas) were
    carried out. To ensure a consistent comparison with the authors’ previous study,
    the best performing classification in reproducing irrigated areas resulting in
    that work is re-implemented here by considering only two clusters, i.e., rainfed
    and irrigated areas. In this way, results obtained in Dari et al. [27] and in
    this work are fully comparable. As a second step, a basin-scale application is
    proposed. Hence, the method is applied over the whole domain of agricultural areas
    (see Figure 1). In this case, as a ground truth information, the map of the basin’s
    irrigated areas according to the Hydrological Plan of the Ebro basin is used.
    The map, produced by the Ebro Hydrological Confederation (CHEBRO, https://www.chebro.es/
    (accessed on 15 April 2020)), is dated 2004; hence, it could miss some irrigation
    portions recently developed. Nevertheless, the main irrigation districts were
    already developed at that time. Such information, henceforth defined as the CHEBRO
    map, is used to validate a static map obtained by applying the TSIMAP method to
    all the irrigation seasons of the considered period, i.e., from 2015 to 2020.
    This choice is led by the reasonable assumption of irrigation extents quite static
    in time at the basin scale and also by the nature of the available ground truth
    information. For validating the basin-scale irrigation map, all the pixels of
    the CHEBRO map are considered as irrigated (since the map only provides the edges
    of irrigated areas), while the other pixels of the agricultural areas within the
    Ebro basin are considered as rainfed. Figure 2 provides a scheme summarising the
    main features of the analyses carried out. Figure 2. Overview of the analyses
    carried out: (1) comparison of results obtained in this study through NDVI against
    outcomes of method’s first implementation through remotely sensed soil moisture
    [27] and (2) basin-scale application. 3. Results 3.1. Comparison with Original
    Implementation Relying on Soil Moisture In this section, results obtained over
    the smaller domain considered in Dari et al. [27] and validated with detailed
    ground truth information from the SIGPAC data set are presented. Outcomes referring
    to the irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017 are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4,
    respectively. Both figures are organised in six panels: Figure 3a and Figure 4a
    show the location of the Ebro_CATAR area with respect to the basin extension,
    Figure 3b, Figure 4b and Figure 3c, Figure 4c show the mean RD and the mean TA,
    respectively, during the highest-intensity irrigation season (May–September),
    Figure 3d, Figure 4d and Figure 3e, Figure 4e provide the SIGPAC ground truth
    maps according to the two validation strategies, and Figure 3f and Figure 4f show
    the rainfed/irrigated map resulting from the TSIMAP method, respectively. In Figures
    from Figure 3d and Figure 4d to Figure 3f and Figure 4f, light brown and blue
    green are used to indicate rainfed and irrigated areas, respectively. We note
    that for Figures from Figure 3b and Figure 4b to Figure 3f and Figure 4f, data
    are shown over the portion falling into the Catalonia region only, as this is
    the domain where benchmark information from the SIGPAC data set is available,
    respectively. Even with different magnitudes, for both irrigation seasons of 2016
    and 2017, the mean RD and TA of NDVI prove themselves to be promising diagnostic
    indices for detecting irrigated areas. In fact, the maps of Figure 3b, Figure
    3c and Figure 4b and Figure 4c show consistent spatial patterns with higher (mostly
    positive) values over areas where irrigation is expected to occur and lower (mostly
    negative) values over the surrounding dryland area extending to the east, respectively.
    Figure 3. Results obtained in this study over the Ebro_CATAR domain and referring
    to the irrigation season of 2016: panel (a) provides the location of the Ebro_CATAR
    area, panels (b,c) show the mean relative differences (RD) and the mean temporal
    anomalies (TA), respectively, during the highest-intensity irrigation season (May–September),
    panels (d,e) show the SIGPAC ground truth maps according to Validations 1 and
    2, and panel (f) shows the resulting rainfed/irrigated (R/I) map. We note that
    in panels (d–f), light brown and blue green are used to indicate rainfed and irrigated
    areas, respectively. Figure 4. Same as Figure 3 but referring to the irrigation
    season of 2017. For both irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017, the mean RD and
    TA are used as input data points to perform the k-means classification and produce
    the 1 km maps of rainfed and irrigated areas shown in Figure 3f and Figure 4f,
    respectively. Figure 5a provides the confusion matrices synthesising the accuracy
    of the resulting maps according to the two validation approaches, i.e., comparing
    maps in Figure 3f, Figure 4f with those shown in Figure 3d, Figure 4d and Figure
    3e, Figure 4e. Overall, a satisfying accuracy in properly reproducing rainfed
    and irrigated portions is obtained in both irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017.
    According to Validation 1, 88% and 87% of irrigated areas are properly reproduced
    by the TSIMAP method in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Almost all the rainfed areas
    are properly classified, since in both irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017 an
    accuracy of 97% is reached. According to Validation 2, the same results are obtained
    for both irrigation seasons considered. The accuracy in properly classifying irrigated
    areas rises to 98%, but this happens at the expense of the accuracy in reproducing
    rainfed areas, which drops to 84%. Figure 5. Panel (a): Confusion matrices synthesising
    the accuracy of the classifications into rainfed (R) and irrigated (I) areas according
    to the two validation approaches implemented. Panel (b): same but referring to
    the classifications proposed in Dari et al. [27] modified considering rainfed
    (R) and irrigated (I) areas only. For both panels, the first row refers to 2016,
    while the second one refers to 2017; ground truth classes are represented on the
    y-axis, while the classes obtained through the TSIMAP method are shown on the
    x-axis. Dari et al. [27] explored different combinations of input parameters derived
    from satellite soil moisture to map irrigation. The authors found that the standard
    deviation of RD and mean TA calculated for the 1 km DISPATCH (Disaggregation based
    on Physical and Theoretical scale Change) downscaled SMAP (Soil Moisture Active
    Passive) product [50] were the best diagnostic indices for reproducing irrigated
    areas, reporting a maximum accuracy of 78% reached according to Validation 2 considering
    the irrigation season of 2017. However, as explained in Section 2.3, such a result
    refers to the capability in reproducing three different clusters, and not in discerning
    between rainfed and irrigated areas only as in this case. For this reason, the
    experiment offering the best accuracy according to Dari et al. [27] is repeated
    here by considering two clusters only and results are summarised by the confusion
    matrices of Figure 5b. The differences with the implementation relying on NDVI
    proposed here thin out, especially in the capability of the method in reproducing
    actual irrigated areas; accuracies differ by 1–2%, still in favour of the new
    implementation. Higher differences are found with respect to the capability of
    recognising rainfed areas. The classification based on satellite soil moisture
    provides accuracies lower than those relying on NDVI by 10% and 8% (and by 3%)
    for both the validation experiments in 2016 (2017). 3.2. Basin-Scale Application
    The TSIMAP method is then applied at the basin scale to produce a static map of
    rainfed and irrigated agricultural areas across the years of 2015–2020. The k-means
    classification is carried out by using as input data points the mean RD and TA
    during the irrigation seasons (May–September) of the period of 2015–2020. The
    resulting maps are shown in Figure 6; consistent spatial patterns of higher average
    RD and TA values are found over areas known to be irrigated, such as agricultural
    lands within the Ebro_CATAR domain, the narrow area in the basin central valley
    running along the main reach of the Ebro and the river delta [39]. Figure 6. Mean
    relative differences (RD) and temporal anomalies (TA) during the highest-intensity
    irrigation seasons (May–September) of the period of 2015–2020. The accuracy of
    the map of rainfed/irrigated areas derived from the input indices shown in Figure
    6 is assessed through comparison with the CHEBRO map. Results are summarised in
    Figure 7. Figure 7a shows the map produced by the TSIMAP method, Figure 7b provides
    the ground truth map and Figure 7c contains the confusion matrix. As can be depicted
    by visual inspection of maps in Figure 7a and Figure 7b and by accuracies reported
    in Figure 7c, irrigated areas are satisfactorily reproduced at the basin scale
    also, which is characterised by higher heterogeneity. The percentage of irrigated
    areas properly classified is equal to 81% of the total. Higher uncertainty exists
    in properly classifying rainfed areas, for which the accuracy drops to 72%. Figure
    7. Assessment of results of the basin-scale application: panel (a) shows the map
    of rainfed (R, indicated in light brown) irrigated (I, indicated in green blue)
    areas produced through the TSIMAP method and panel (b) provides the CHEBRO ground
    truth map. Panel (c) shows the corresponding confusion matrix, with ground truth
    classes on the Y-axis and predicted ones on the X-axis. 4. Discussion The aim
    of this work is to showcase the flexibility of the TSIMAP method originally proposed
    in a previous work by the authors with satellite soil moisture data as an input.
    However, the method is expected to provide satisfactory results with any input
    observation that can be an irrigation proxy and for which the temporal stability
    concept applies, without losing its characteristic of ease of use that distinguishes
    it from other methods available in the literature [37]. For this reason, the approach
    is implemented with 1 km NDVI data from the CGLS, as several studies linking irrigation
    dynamics with NDVI are available in the literature [23,51,52,53]. The comparison
    against outcomes from the method’s first implementation reveal a slight increase
    in the capability of properly classifying irrigated areas and more substantial
    improvements in detecting rainfed areas when forcing the approach with NDVI observations.
    In terms of overall accuracy (OA), a value of 93% and 92% is reached according
    to Validation 1 for the irrigation seasons of 2016 and 2017, respectively. For
    Validation 2, the OA is 88% for both years. Over the same area, Elwan et al. [34]
    reported an accuracy on the order of 87% through a supporting vector machine classification
    fed with statistical features from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 as an input. Gao
    et al. [26] reached an accuracy of 81% using Sentinel-1-derived features over
    the same domain, but three classes (irrigated crops, irrigated trees, and non-irrigated
    fields) were considered in that work. In both works by Gao et al. [26] and Elwan
    et al. [34], methods requiring training were adopted, while the TSIMAP approach
    did not require this step. It is important to point out that results from Gao
    et al. [26] and Elwan et al. [34] refer to a finer spatial scale (at the field
    level) with respect to the 1 km scale adopted in this work. In the basin-scale
    application, an OA equal to 75% is reached. Even though a decreasing accuracy
    can be encountered when enlarging the considered domain and thus facing higher
    heterogeneity, it is important to point out that results of the two analyses carried
    out are not directly comparable since different ground truth data sets are used.
    A closer look at NDVI dynamics can help in assessing results. Figure 8 shows the
    rainfed and irrigated areas properly classified (true rainfed and true irrigated,
    respectively), the irrigated areas erroneously classified as rainfed (false rainfed)
    and the rainfed areas wrongly classified as irrigated (false irrigated). The 14-day
    aggregated time series of NDVI averaged over each one of the domains above are
    also shown in Figure 8b, where the main watering seasons (May–September) are highlighted
    in light grey. False rainfed areas are scattered and often located adjacent to
    the edges of irrigated areas; hence, it is possible that the 1 km sampling adopted
    here is not fine enough to properly detect complex patterns. However, the NDVI
    signal over those areas is similar to the one detected over true rainfed portions
    (see light brown and pink lines in Figure 8b). The green blue line referring to
    true irrigated areas clearly shows a second NDVI peak during the period May–September
    attributable to irrigation occurrence. False irrigated areas (mostly located in
    the northwestern side) represent the highest source of uncertainties. For those
    areas, the NDVI time series (black line in Figure 8b) do not show a clear peak
    during the irrigation season, but values are comparable to those detected over
    true irrigated areas. This can be an index of areas where NDVI is systematically
    higher than the basin average (see also Figure 6), thus leading to wrong classification.
    Nevertheless, uncertainties could come from the ground truth data set as well.
    As explained in Section 2.3, the CHEBRO map dates back to 2004; hence, it is possible
    that recently developed irrigated areas are detected by satellite NDVI but are
    still classified as rainfed in the benchmark data set. Figure 8. Panel (a) shows
    the map of true irrigated, false rainfed, false irrigated, and true rainfed areas.
    Panel (b) provides the 14-day aggregated NDVI time series averaged over each domain.
    5. Conclusions The analyses carried out in this work demonstrate the flexibility
    of the TSIMAP method, able to provide optimal performances in face of its simplicity
    for end-users [37]. The approach’s applicability is not limited to the use of
    satellite soil moisture as an input, as the method can be fed with any irrigation-proxy
    data (e.g., vegetation indices, evapotranspiration estimates, land surface temperature
    records). To showcase this, an implementation relying on 1 km NDVI is proposed.
    Results outperform the method’s first implementation by Dari et al. [27], with
    increases of OA equal to +6% in the irrigation season of 2016 according to both
    validation procedures implemented and to +2% and +3% according to Validations
    1 and 2, respectively, considering 2017. A basin-scale application is performed
    as well, producing a static map across irrigation seasons within the period of
    2015–2020 providing satisfactory results despite a higher heterogeneity. The method’s
    flexibility allows potential operational applications at different spatial resolutions
    [28]. For instance, the TSIMAP approach represents a useful tool to refine irrigation
    water use estimates from satellite data, as hinted by Kragh et al. [54] and Dari
    et al. [39]. Further assessments of the performances of the proposed approach
    with different types of input (e.g., merging soil moisture and vegetation indices)
    data with respect to varying climatic contexts are the foreseen next steps of
    this research. Author Contributions Conceptualisation, J.D.; methodology, J.D.,

  description: Sensor data and agro-hydrological modeling have been combined to improve
    irrigation management. Crop water models simulating crop growth and production
    in response to the soil-water environment need to be parsimonious in terms of
    structure, inputs and parameters to be applied in data scarce regions. Irrigation
    management using soil moisture sensors requires them to be site-calibrated, low-cost,
    and maintainable. Therefore, there is a need for parsimonious crop modeling combined
    with low-cost soil moisture sensing without losing predictive capability. This
    study calibrated the low-cost capacitance-based Spectrum Inc. SM100 soil moisture
    sensor using multiple least squares and machine learning models, with both laboratory
    and field data. The best calibration technique, field-based piece-wise linear
    regression (calibration r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 3.13 %, validation r2 = 0.67, RMSE =
    4.57 %), was used to study the effect of sensor calibration on the performance
    of the FAO AquaCrop Open Source (AquaCrop-OS) model by calibrating its soil hydraulic
    parameters. This approach was tested during the wheat cropping season in 2018,
    in Kanpur (India), in the Indo-Gangetic plains, resulting in some best practices
    regarding sensor calibration being recommended. The soil moisture sensor was calibrated
    best in field conditions against a secondary standard sensor (UGT GmbH. SMT100)
    taken as a reference (r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 %), followed by laboratory calibration
    against gravimetric soil moisture using the dry-down (r2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 %)
    and wet-up curves respectively (r2 = 0.62, RMSE = 6.29 %). Moreover, model overfitting
    with machine learning algorithms led to poor field validation performance. The
    soil moisture simulation of AquaCrop-OS improved significantly by incorporating
    raw reference sensor and calibrated low-cost sensor data. There were non-significant
    impacts on biomass simulation, but water productivity improved significantly.
    Notably, using raw low-cost sensor data to calibrate AquaCrop led to poorer performances
    than using the literature. Hence using literature values could save sensor costs
    without compromising model performance if sensor calibration was not possible.
    The results suggest the essentiality of calibrating low-cost soil moisture sensors
    for crop modeling calibration to improve crop water productivity.

    technology in agriculture needs to be parsimonious and cost effective. • Calibrate
    soil moisture sensors in the field, or using a dry-down curve in the lab. • Use
    calibrated soil moisture data to calibrate crop model soil hydraulic properties.
    • Using uncalibrated low-cost soil moisture data for crop model calibration is
    futile. Abstract Sensor data and agro-hydrological modeling have been combined
    to improve irrigation management. Crop water models simulating crop growth and
    production in response to the soil-water environment need to be parsimonious in
    terms of structure, inputs and parameters to be applied in data scarce regions.
    Irrigation management using soil moisture sensors requires them to be site-calibrated,
    low-cost, and maintainable. Therefore, there is a need for parsimonious crop modeling
    combined with low-cost soil moisture sensing without losing predictive capability.
    This study calibrated the low-cost capacitance-based Spectrum Inc. SM100 soil
    moisture sensor using multiple least squares and machine learning models, with
    both laboratory and field data. The best calibration technique, field-based piece-wise
    linear regression (calibration r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 3.13 %, validation r2 = 0.67,
    RMSE = 4.57 %), was used to study the effect of sensor calibration on the performance
    of the FAO AquaCrop Open Source (AquaCrop-OS) model by calibrating its soil hydraulic
    parameters. This approach was tested during the wheat cropping season in 2018,
    in Kanpur (India), in the Indo-Gangetic plains, resulting in some best practices
    regarding sensor calibration being recommended. The soil moisture sensor was calibrated
    best in field conditions against a secondary standard sensor (UGT GmbH. SMT100)
    taken as a reference (r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 %), followed by laboratory calibration
    against gravimetric soil moisture using the dry-down (r2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 %)
    and wet-up curves respectively (r2 = 0.62, RMSE = 6.29 %). Moreover, model overfitting
    with machine learning algorithms led to poor field validation performance. The
    soil moisture simulation of AquaCrop-OS improved significantly by incorporating
    raw reference sensor and calibrated low-cost sensor data. There were non-significant
    impacts on biomass simulation, but water productivity improved significantly.
    Notably, using raw low-cost sensor data to calibrate AquaCrop led to poorer performances
    than using the literature. Hence using literature values could save sensor costs
    without compromising model performance if sensor calibration was not possible.
    The results suggest the essentiality of calibrating low-cost soil moisture sensors
    for crop modeling calibration to improve crop water productivity. Graphical abstract

    Surface irrigation, like other traditional irrigation methods, is inefficient
    due to deep percolation and non-uniform distribution of water (Pramanik et al.,
    2022). However, it may continue to remain the most extensively used irrigation
    method (Raine, 2006) due to its low-cost and energy requirements (Bjorneberg,
    2013). Hence, technological improvements to improve irrigation management need
    to be relevant and correspondingly cost-effective, particularly when they are
    designed for smallholder farmers, who tend to be more economical in technology
    adoption (Singh et al., 2009). Irrigation management techniques have combined
    either data from satellites (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000) or ground sensor networks
    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015) with agro-hydrological modeling (Chiara and Marco,
    2022). Precise irrigation water management requires accurate measurements as well
    as a comprehensive biophysical process understanding of crop response to water
    at different crop growth stages (Kisekka et al., 2022). Crop water simulation
    models describe the crop growth and production responses to the soil-water environment
    (C. Zhang et al., 2022). Such models are often data intensive, requiring numerous
    input variables and parameter values, which may not be available for different
    crops and environments (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014). Similarly, though commercial
    sensors, processors and communication components may be available, they need to
    be cost-effective, easy to access and maintainable for effective agricultural
    applications (Pramanik et al., 2022; Rodríguez-Robles et al., 2020). Soil moisture
    (or volumetric water content, VWC) is a key variable involved in precision agriculture
    and agricultural sustainability (Kisekka et al., 2022), which can be an input
    to crop growth models. Soil moisture sensing technologies can have low-utilization
    due to farmers'' economic limitations and reluctance towards such investment (Srbinovska
    et al., 2015). Further, soil moisture sensors need to be calibrated at each site
    because of the effects of the variability in soil properties on the sensor outputs
    (Peddinti et al., 2020). Researchers have highlighted the importance of field
    calibration as undisturbed soil samples are representative of field conditions
    where the sensors might be used (Robinson et al., 2003). However, soil moisture
    sensing is sensitive to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, bulk
    density, organic matter and clay content (Kargas and Soulis, 2012; Matula et al.,
    2016). Hence, manufacturers generally perform indoor calibration with sieved,
    uniformly packed soils at regulated VWCs and temperature conditions, particularly
    in homogeneous coarse soils like some sands and loams (Feng and Sui, 2020). Studies
    have used irrigation scheduling with calibrated low-cost capacitance sensors to
    detect crop water stress (Thompson et al., 2007a) and irrigation thresholds computed
    using measured VWC-based indices(Thompson et al., 2007b). Other studies have used
    expensive sensors in combination with crop modeling (Lu et al., 2021). The challenge
    is to combine accurate (calibrated) soil moisture sensing at low costs and parsimonious
    crop models without losing predictive power (Landau et al., 2000). This paper
    addresses this using four research questions. RQ1 pertains to LC soil moisture
    sensor performance on the field, and RQs 2 to 4 pertain to using LC soil moisture
    data for parsimonious crop model calibration: 1. Can low-cost (LC) soil moisture
    sensors be calibrated using more sophisticated techniques such as machine learning
    algorithms to improve their field performance? 2. Do raw data from LC soil moisture
    sensors have any advantage over literature values for parsimonious crop model
    calibration? 3. What is the difference in performance when such a model is calibrated
    using raw data from a LC vis-à-vis a reference soil moisture sensor? 4. What is
    the effect of calibrating the LC soil moisture data against a reference sensor
    on crop model performance? The novelty of this study lies in combining data from
    LC soil moisture sensors with parsimonious crop modeling to evaluate crop model
    performance in simulating canopy cover, VWC and water productivity (WP) using
    a two-step calibration process. Firstly, low-cost (capacitance based) soil moisture
    sensors were calibrated against uncalibrated reference (TDR-FDR) sensors via multiple
    models (least squares and machine learning algorithms). Consequently, these calibrated
    VWC data were used for calibrating the soil hydraulic parameters of a parsimonious
    crop model to assess improvements in WP. Such a laboratory-field-simulation study
    based on a food critical region in the Majority World, which combines low-cost
    soil moisture sensor calibration (using multiple models) with parsimonious crop
    modeling, has not been undertaken yet, to the best of the authors'' knowledge.
    2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area and wheat cropping season 2.1.1. Experimental
    site The study was conducted during the wheat cropping season of 2018 in Kanpur,
    which is representative of an intensively managed rural landscape in the Indo-Gangetic
    plains (Gupta et al., 2019). Measurements were collected in a 20 m × 30 m experimental
    field (Fig. 1) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India (26°30′56.8″N,
    80°13′47.3″E and altitude of about 126 m above mean sea level). The experimental
    site falls within the sub-tropical climate zone with an average annual rainfall
    of 833.5 mm, 92.5 % of which falls within the monsoon season (June to September);
    the other two seasons are the cold season from November–February and the hot season
    from March–June (Sankararamakrishnan et al., 2008). Download : Download high-res

    with check-basins (plots) irrigated using flood irrigation. Six plots with soil
    moisture monitoring using both Ref. and LC sensors were chosen for the study.
    2.1.2. Description of the wheat cropping season The Indian spring wheat variety
    K7903 (improved Halna) (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2012) was sown in
    check basins (or ‘plots’, each 3 m × 3 m) on January 5, 2018. The seeds were sown
    with a row-spacing, depth and planting density of 10 cm, 5 cm and 363 plants/sq.m
    respectively. Halna is a very late sown, short duration, drought tolerant variety
    of wheat (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2017). Agricultural management was
    performed based on local farming practices, that included fertilizer (urea) application
    during tillering (27 days after sowing, or DAS) and 4 irrigation applications
    (25 DAS, 45 DAS, 59 DAS and 74 DAS, given in Table A1) totaling 220.2 mm, to supplement
    the 50.4 mm rainfall during the cropping season. There was a flooding event which
    occurred just following the final irrigation, totaling 262.5 mm of water. Hence,
    the total water input was 533.1 mm. The crop was harvested on April 15, 2018 (101
    DAS). 2.2. Soil moisture sensing methods 2.2.1. Selecting appropriate soil moisture
    sensing techniques The various techniques for soil moisture sensing include neutron
    thermalization (Chanasyk and Naeth, 1996), water content reflectometer (Chandler
    et al., 2004; Kargas and Soulis, 2019), time domain reflectometry (TDR) (Robinson
    et al., 2003; Topp et al., 1980), time domain transition (TDT) (Blonquist et al.,
    2005), electrical impedance (Cosh et al., 2005; Gaskin and Miller, 1996), frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR) (Ojo et al., 2015), electrical capacitance (Zotarelli
    et al., 2011), and sensing using electrical resistance blocks (Cummings and Chandler
    Jr, 1941) or tensiometers (Muñoz-Carpena et al., 2005). Capacitance-type soil
    moisture sensors are more widely used for decision support systems in irrigated
    agriculture (Fares and Alva, 2000; Gallardo et al., 2020) due to their lower cost,
    robustness, precision, and low power and maintenance requirements (Jones et al.,
    2005; Rosenbaum et al., 2011; Spelman et al., 2013; Visconti et al., 2014). However,
    despite performing well in laboratory conditions, they may exhibit sensor-to-sensor
    variability in field conditions (Bogena et al., 2017; Rosenbaum et al., 2010;
    Spelman et al., 2013), and consequently require site-specific calibration to be
    able to provide reliable VWC measurements (Kisekka et al., 2022; Peddinti et al.,
    2020). The. The WaterScout SM100 soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies,
    Inc., Plainfield, IL, USA) was chosen as the capacitance based ‘low-cost (LC)’
    soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies, 2014) investigated in the study.
    The accuracy and operating range of SM100 are 3 % (for EC < 800 mS m−1) and 0.5
    °C–80 °C respectively (Spectrum Technologies, 2014). Laboratory calibration (with
    repacked sands and silty loams) has improved its VWC accuracy (RMSE, Raes et al.,
    2018) to between 1.63 % and 2.97 % (Adla et al., 2020). The manufacturer''s calibration
    equation (D. Kieffer, personal communication, September 5, 2018) is given below:
    (1a) (1b) where VWC is measured in %, and VR is the voltage ratio of the output
    and input voltages (Vout/Vin). The SMT100 sensor (manufactured by Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, Müncheberg, Germany) was chosen as the secondary standard soil moisture
    sensor (Nakra and Chaudhry, 2006) to calibrate the LC SM100 sensor (see Section
    2.4.1.2.). It is henceforth called the ''reference (Ref)'' sensor due to its superior
    sensing technology which combines the higher accuracy of a TDR system with the
    cost effectiveness of FDR sensing with an oscillating frequency of 340 Hz in air
    and 150 MHz in water (Bogena et al., 2017; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, 2017).
    Its accuracy for VWC and temperature are 3 % and ±0.2 °C respectively, and it
    operates within the temperature range of −40 °C–80 °C (Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH,
    2017). Sensor specific laboratory calibration with (non-soil) materials of known
    apparent dielectric permittivity can improve the VWC accuracy (RMSE) to range
    between 0.21 % and 1.30 % (Bogena et al., 2017). The manufacturer''s calibration
    equation is identical to the one proposed by (Topp et al., 1980): (2) where ɛr
    is the sensed dielectric constant. Since the only common output across both SM100
    and SMT100 sensors was VWC, the uncalibrated SM100 VWC values were calibrated
    on the SMT100 sensor''s output VWC values. Details of sensor outputs are mentioned
    in the Appendix. A short description of the sensors (along with their costs) is
    given in Table 1, with more details available in the Appendix. Table 1. Details

    for the LC capacitance sensor 2.2.2.1. Least squares estimate based regression
    Studies have calibrated capacitance-based soil moisture sensors to improve performance,
    both in laboratories (Adla et al., 2020; Bello et al., 2019; Nagahage et al.,
    2019; Placidi et al., 2021) and in the field (Rudnick et al., 2015; Singh et al.,
    2018). Most of the calibration equations reported in the literature for low-cost
    sensors are least-squares estimates (e.g., linear, logistic, hyperbolic, logarithmic,
    exponential, or polynomial). Based on a visual inspection of the data, piecewise
    linear regression, power law regression and polynomial regressions (degree 2 and
    3) were used to calibrate the LC capacitance based SM100 sensor. 2.2.2.2. Machine
    learning based regression Diverse machine learning algorithms were also applied,
    including standard algorithms for regression applications: linear regression (LR),
    support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR) and multilayer
    perceptron neural networks (MLP). LR models have been applied extensively in soil
    moisture applications (Qiu et al., 2003; Teng et al., 1993); and are still relevant
    due to their simplicity and easy interpretation (García et al., 2016; Lee et al.,
    2019). The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm defines optimal hyperplanes
    in a high or infinite dimensional space which can be used for classification or
    regression (Vapnik et al., 1996). SVR has been applied in soil moisture related
    studies (Gill et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2012). The RFR algorithm
    (Breiman, 2001) is based on averaging non-correlated decision trees for variance
    reduction and avoidance of overfitting. Its simplicity in training and tuning
    has made it popular in current regression applications of soil moisture (Carranza
    et al., 2021; Qingling et al., 2019; Srivastava et al., 2021; H. Zhang et al.,
    2022). However, calibration hyperparameters can be computationally expensive due
    to its many possibilities. The MLP is an algorithm based on the typical architecture
    of a neural network, hence it is a nonlinear statistical model which has unknown
    parameters (weights) meant to be tuned to make the model fit well to training
    data using back-propagation equations in multiple hidden layers. It has also been
    applied in soil moisture applications extensively (Chai et al., 2009; Gu et al.,
    2021; Yan et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2012, p. 20). All the algorithms were applied
    using the Scikit-learn tool library (v.10.2) (Pedregosa et al., 2011) in Python
    (v.3.8.5). Hyperparameters of each algorithm were calibrated with default values
    available in Scikit-learn and evaluated with a 10-fold cross validation (CV, k
    = 10), and are listed in Table A3. This process avoided skewing results in validation
    due to random sampling in the training process. The controlling metrics were the
    coefficient of determination (R2, Raes et al., 2018) and the root mean squared
    error (RMSE). Hastie et al. (2009) and Arias-Rodriguez et al. (2021) provide detailed
    definitions and an application of all these machine learning models, respectively.
    2.3. Parsimonious crop modeling 2.3.1. Selecting a parsimonious crop model Crop
    growth models can simulate physiological processes (Chenu et al., 2009; Yin et
    al., 2003), and crop growth behavior in the field (Keating et al., 2003; Robinson
    et al., 2003; Steduto et al., 2009). Consequently, they can inform management
    decisions regarding water and nutrients and explore the feasibility of new cropping
    systems (Asseng et al., 2014; Silva et al., 2017). The more popular models used
    for simulating crop growth and yield production of wheat under different soil
    water conditions and irrigation scenarios are: APSIM (Ahmed et al., 2016; Chen
    et al., 2010), DSSAT-CERES-Wheat (Attia et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018), FAO
    AquaCrop (Iqbal et al., 2014; Toumi et al., 2016), RZWQM2 (Saseendran et al.,
    2015; Zheng et al., 2020), and SWAP (Eitzinger et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2021).
    Crop modeling environments like DSSAT and APSIM can require 211 and 292 parameter
    inputs respectively (Soltani and Sinclair, 2015). This increased complexity enables
    such models to address complex research questions (Todorovic et al., 2009), but
    also amplifies errors and uncertainties (Silva and Giller, 2020). Further, data
    intensive models with numerous inputs and parameter requirements may not be practical
    in data-scarce regions (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014; Varella et al., 2010) like the
    Majority World (Graves et al., 2002; Jones et al., 2012). The water-driven FAO
    AquaCrop model has been envisioned to balance simplicity, accuracy and robustness
    (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014). Consequently, it relies on considerably fewer and
    relatively easier to measure inputs (about 19, according to FAO, 2016; Raes, 2017).
    Nevertheless, FAO AquaCrop''s performance is comparable to data-intensive models
    (Babel et al., 2019; Quintero and Díaz, 2020; Todorovic et al., 2009). Moderate
    to good simulation results have also been reported for wheat and regions of water
    scarcity (Andarzian et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al., 2018; Singh
    et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). 2.3.2. Description of the crop-water model
    FAO AquaCrop FAO AquaCrop simulates daily yield loss in response to soil water
    depletion in the root zone, based on the approach of Doorenbos and Kassam (1979).
    Four main variables are calculated consecutively and on a daily basis through
    individual equations; i.e., accumulated canopy cover (CC), daily plant transpiration,
    accumulated aboveground biomass, and accumulated final dry yield. These model
    variables are mainly interconnected by empirical factors, such as the water productivity
    (WP) and harvest index (HI), which convert transpiration to biomass and biomass
    to yield, respectively. Water productivity only incorporates plant transpiration
    to account for the confounding effect of the nonproductive consumptive water use
    (Steduto et al., 2009). Moreover, WP is normalized for atmospheric CO2 concentration
    and climate (Raes et al., 2018), and hence makes the model more robust and generalizable
    (Steduto et al., 2009). Model set-up requires user input for climate parameters,
    ''non-conservative'' (i.e., spatio-temporally variable) model parameters, and,
    where applicable, an irrigation schedule and the groundwater water table. The
    model also needs daily data on precipitation, reference evapotranspiration, and
    minimum and maximum temperature. Non-conservative model parameters relate to crop
    phenology, soil conditions, and field management practices (Raes et al., 2018;
    Steduto et al., 2012). This study used the MATLAB-based AquaCrop OpenSource (AquaCrop-OS)
    v.6.1 tool (Foster et al., 2017). 2.4. Measurement methodology An automatic weather
    station at the experimental field measured precipitation, barometric pressure,
    global solar radiation, wind speed and direction. It also recorded air temperature
    and relative humidity at two different heights (2 m and 3 m above the ground).
    These data were measured at 15-min intervals and aggregated to daily values. During
    the cropping season, the average daily temperature and relative humidity (both
    at 2 m) ranged from 9.3 °C to 30.7 °C and from 35.3 % to 93.9 %, respectively.
    Soil texture classification was conducted by the UGT Sedimat 4–12 instrument,
    which determines the particle size distribution in mineral soils based on the
    Köhn method (König et al., 2005). The observed crop growth parameters included
    phenological parameters like days to emergence, start of flowering, start of senescence
    and maturity, length of flowering (days). The observed soil related parameter
    was maximum rooting depth. The observed crop management parameter was plant population
    density. The observations used for calibrating model parameters were leaf area
    index, VWC and above ground biomass. Leaf Area Index (LAI) was measured eight
    times during the season (36, 44, 55, 59, 68, 83, 90 and 101 DAS) using the LAI-2200C
    plant canopy analyzer manufactured by LI-COR Biosciences. It was converted into
    Canopy Cover values using an empirical equation for wheat (Nielsen et al., 2012).
    Surface soil moisture was determined at the center of each plot at 15-min intervals
    by Ref. SMT100 and LC SM100 sensors installed at a depth of 5 cm below the soil
    surface (Section 2.2.1). Both datasets were aggregated to the daily time-step.
    Above ground dry biomass was measured using crop cutting experiments (Singh, 2014)
    from a representative 1 sq. m section for each plot. Additionally, water productivity
    (WPET), introduced in Section 2.5.2, was calculated using actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa) measured using microlysimeters (Kumar, 2019). Six plots were used for all
    the analyses, as they had both Ref. and LC soil moisture data, as well as the
    observations required for crop modeling. VWC measurements for both the sensors
    were available on average for 61.2 days (s = 3.0 days) out of the 100-day cropping
    season across the six plots. 2.5. Calibration methodology of low-cost soil moisture
    sensors 2.5.1. Strategy to calibrate-validate soil moisture data Capacitance based
    soil-moisture sensors have been calibrated both with repacked (Adla et al., 2020;
    Nagahage et al., 2019; Placidi et al., 2020) or undisturbed (Bello et al., 2019)
    soil samples inside the laboratory, as well as in the field (Rudnick et al., 2015;
    Singh et al., 2018). In the laboratory, calibration of soil moisture sensors is
    generally carried out either using the substantially faster ''wet-up'' or wetting
    (downward or upward infiltration, taking <1 day) or slower ''dry-down'' or drying
    (taking a few weeks) processes (Burns et al., 2014). Fig. 2 describes the overall
    study workflow, contextualizing each research question. The sensors used are displayed
    at the top-left corner of the figure. Throughout the study, the data corresponding
    to the LC SM100 and Ref. SMT100 sensors are represented in blue and green colors
    respectively. The simulations corresponding to the calibrated LC soil moisture
    sensor data are represented in a deeper blue compared to the lighter blue representing
    raw LC sensor data. The workflow related to the LC soil moisture sensor (SM100)
    calibration is illustrated in the inset \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\",
    in Fig. 2. To address RQ1, the LC sensor data were calibrated against either a
    primary standard (gravimetric water content, Section 2.4.1.1.) or a secondary
    standard (the Ref. SMT100 data, Section 2.4.1.2.) - this is mentioned in the respective
    bubbles, \"Lab Cal.\" (laboratory calibration) and \"Field Cal.\" (field calibration).
    The number of paired data points (sensor and primary/secondary standard) used
    in both calibration approaches were n = 100 and n = 65 for laboratory and field
    calibration, respectively. The following process resulted in selecting the \"best\"
    LC calibration model to be used for crop modeling (Section 2.5.2.). Download :

    of the study methodology, contextualizing the four research questions (RQs). Sensor
    details are given at the top-left corner. The \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\"
    of the LC SM100 sensor was conducted in the laboratory (\"Lab Cal.\") using gravimetrically
    determined VWC, and in the field (\"Field Cal.\") using the Ref. SMT100 sensor.
    All the developed models were then validated in the field (\"Field Val.\") to
    select the most suitable model, \"Best LCcal model\". The \"Crop model calibration\"
    either used the literature (\"Default\"), raw VWC values from both Ref. and LC
    sensors (\"RawRef\" and \"RawLC\"), or the Best LCcal model (\"Calibrated\") to
    calibrate the soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs) of the AquaCrop model. The Best
    LCcal rhombus in \"Soil moisture sensor calibration\" is a flowchart decision,
    and the \"Calibrated\" diamond in \"Crop model calibration\" is a representation
    followed in Fig. 5. 2.5.1.1. Laboratory calibration of LC SM100 sensor A previous
    study calibrating the LC SM100 sensor (Adla et al., 2020) used piece-wise linear
    regression functions (PWLFs) (Jekel, 2017, p. 20) against gravimetric VWC (primary
    standard), for four soils (number of data points, n = 400). The study calibrated
    five sensors in controlled laboratory conditions with the wet-up curve (similar
    to (Matula et al., 2016)) to account for sensor-to-sensor-variability and improve
    cost-effectiveness in terms of saved time and energy resources (Burns et al.,
    2014). This study used a subset (n = 100) of the data from Adla et al. (2020)
    which represented the soil sampled from the current study site. LC sensor values
    were calibrated against gravimetric VWC using the different algorithms described
    in Section 2.2.2. R2 and RMSE were used to quantify the calibration performance
    in all cases. 2.5.1.2. Field calibration of LC SM100 sensor Out of the six plots
    used for the study, the plot with the highest (significant) linear correlation
    between the aggregated daily values of Ref. SMT100 and LC SM100 sensor (n = 65,
    R2 = 0.76) was selected for calibration. Due to the impracticality of frequent
    gravimetric measurements and its superior sensing technology, the Ref. SMT100
    sensor was selected as a secondary standard (Section 2.2.1.). Consequently, the
    daily aggregated LC SM100 data were calibrated using the daily aggregated Ref.
    SMT100 data, using the algorithms listed in Section 2.2.2. Calibration performance
    in each case was quantified by R2 and RMSE indices. 2.5.1.3. Field validation
    of laboratory and field calibrations Each calibration algorithm developed using
    both laboratory and field data were validated on independent data from the five
    remaining plots (n = 302). The Ref. SMT100 data measurements were taken as the
    secondary standard used for validating the field data. R2 and RMSE were used as
    the performance indicators for the validation process. 2.6. Crop model calibration
    scenarios 2.6.1. AquaCrop calibration method AquaCrop guidelines recommend calibrating
    all non-conservative and non-observed model parameters sequentially, with appropriate
    objective functions (AquaCrop. Tutorials., 2016; Raes et al., 2018; Steduto et
    al., 2012). Accordingly, model simulation is sequentially improved using intermediately
    computed model variables like canopy cover (CC), volumetric water content (VWC)
    and biomass (BM) by adjusting different sets of model parameters, until the simulation
    of the harvested yield agrees, visually and statistically, with observations within
    an acceptable error range (Raes et al., 2018). In this study, eight (non-conservative)
    crop growth parameters of the AquaCrop-OS model were calibrated: phenological
    parameters (initial canopy size of the emergent seedling CCo, maximum canopy cover
    CCx, and canopy growth coefficient CGC) and soil hydraulic parameters (readily
    available water REW, saturated soil hydraulic conductivity Ksat, VWC at permanent
    wilting point θPWP, field capacity θFC and saturation θs). 2.6.2. Different calibration
    scenarios used in the study (default, raw and calibrated) The inset \"Crop model
    calibration\" in Fig. 2 illustrates the FAO AquaCrop modeling scenarios used to
    address RQs 2 to 4. Crop growth parameters (CCo, CCx, CGC) were calibrated using
    a trial-and-error method (Liang et al., 2017, Ma et al., 2020) to maximize the
    Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and minimize the RMSE between the measured
    and simulated CC values for each plot (Raes et al., 2018). The soil hydraulic
    parameters (SHPs), θWP (%), θFC (%), θs (%), Ksat (mm/day), and REW (mm), were
    also calibrated to respectively maximize and minimize r and RMSE between simulated
    and observed (Ref. SMT100) soil moisture data. Soil Hydraulic Parameter (SHP)
    calibration was conducted under the following scenarios: ● The \"Default\" scenario:
    SHPs were calibrated based on average values from the literature (Rawls and Brakensiek,
    1989; Gupta et al., 2021), corresponding to the classified soil texture (silty-loam).
    ● The \"Raw\" scenarios (for both Ref. and LC sensor): SHPs were calibrated with
    the raw (uncalibrated) LC and Ref. soil moisture sensor data using a trial-and-error
    method (Liang et al., 2017, Ma et al., 2020). ● The \"Calibrated\" scenario (only
    for LC sensor): SHPs were calibrated using the \"best\" LCcal model. The difference
    in AquaCrop model performance between the Default and RawLC scenarios would illustrate
    the advantage of using raw LC data over literature values (RQ2). The difference
    between the performance of the models calibrated in the RawLC and RawRef scenarios
    would address RQ3, indicating the relative loss in crop model performance when
    LC sensor data is used for calibration vis-à-vis reference soil moisture sensor
    data. The difference between the \"Calibrated\" (CalLC) and \"Raw\" (RawLC) model
    performances would quantify the additional impact (on crop model performance)
    of using calibrated vis-à-vis raw LC soil moisture data (RQ4). Above ground dry
    biomass (BM) simulated by AquaCrop was compared with the observed biomass, using
    the mean absolute error (MAE, Witten et al., 2011), RMSE, NRMSE (normalized RMSE,
    Raes et al., 2018), and percentage bias (PBIAS, Sorooshian et al., 1993) indicators.
    Additionally, Water Productivity (WP) was simulated for each scenario to understand
    the \"efficacy of the crop production processes in relation to their required
    water consumption\" (Van Halsema and Vincent, 2012). This study used ET Water
    Productivity or WPET, defined as the following (Van Halsema and Vincent, 2012):
    (3) where Yield is the final (simulated or observed) crop yield (kg/m2) and ETa
    (m) is the cumulative actual evapotranspiration during the cropping season. The
    simulated WPET was computed by extracting the yield and seasonal evapotranspiration
    values simulated by AquaCrop. Observed WPET was computed using the observed biomass,
    the default harvest index for wheat, and ETa estimated on the field using microlysimeters
    (Kumar, 2019). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Description of the cropping season
    Fig. 3 illustrates the seasonal evolution of the daily water demand (depicted
    by the FAO-56 reference ETo, from (Allen et al., 1998)), water supply (depicted
    by rainfall and applied irrigation during the season), and soil moisture (VWC)
    monitoring by both low-cost (LC) SM100 and reference (Ref.) SMT100 soil moisture
    sensors. The soil texture, with 15.4 % sand and 66.3 % silt, was determined to
    have silty-loam texture (USDA classification). Moreover, the soil was relatively
    homogenous in depth and the groundwater table was deep enough to prevent capillary
    rise from influencing soil moisture measurements. Download : Download high-res

    equations developed using (a) lab and (b) field data. The index numbers correspond
    to Table 2. In both cases, the data used for calibration are given as points,
    and the \"Best\" model (in blue) is PWLF. During both laboratory and field calibrations,
    the performance of the machine learning algorithm Random Forest Regression (RFR)
    was quantitatively the best among all the algorithms included in the study (R2
    = 0.98 and RMSE = 1.26 % for laboratory calibration; R2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 1.67
    % for field calibration). However, overfitting was observed (index 6 in Fig. 4),
    likely due to the limited tuning of the hyperparameters due to limited computational
    resources. Though RFR avoids overfitting from original decision trees (Hastie
    et al., 2009), generalization error variance decreases as more trees are added
    to the algorithm, without a change in the generalization bias. Though this study
    used the default n_estimators = 100 (Pedregosa et al., 2011), different options
    of decision trees should be examined, particularly searching for lower n_estimators
    using a GridSearch. As a consequence, the RFR-laboratory model had inadequate
    validation performance (R2 = 0.20, RMSE = 8.88 %). Moreover, the RFR-field and
    RFR-laboratory models were respectively non-monotonic and monotonically non-decreasing
    functions, implying that the calibrated LC VWC values could also decrease (or
    not increase, respectively) with increasing Ref. VWC. Both the model behaviors
    were not realistic. Consequently, the RFR algorithm was excluded from further
    analyses. The piece-wise linear regression function (PWLF) had the next best performance
    during calibration: laboratory R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.96 %; and field R2 = 0.76,
    RMSE = 3.13 %. Further, during both the respective validation cases, the PWLF
    performed adequately well when compared to the relative performances of the RFR
    models (PWLF-laboratory: R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 7.98 %, PWLF-field: R2 = 0.67, RMSE
    = 4.57 %). This piece-wise (segmented) behavior is also a feature of the manufacturer''s
    calibration equation which has linear and quadratic segments (Kieffer, personal
    communication, September 5, 2018). Fig. 5 shows scatter plots between measured/calibrated
    LC SM100 values and the measured Ref. SMT100 values for (a) laboratory calibration,
    (b) validation of the laboratory-calibrated PWLF model, (c) field calibration,
    and (d) validation of the field-calibrated PWLF model. Raw and calibrated data
    are represented by cyan bubbles and deep blue diamonds respectively. Some best
    practices for soil moisture sensor calibration were derived from this comparative
    analysis of calibration models, which can be more specific to capacitance-based
    sensors used in silty-loam agricultural soils: ● Field calibration of fewer sensors
    may be more robust than laboratory calibration of multiple sensors: Field calibrations
    with undisturbed soils may be more robust for field applications. The field validation
    performance (both R2 and RMSE) of laboratory-calibrated models was significantly
    poorer than field-calibrated models, supporting previous recommendations of on-site
    calibration using undisturbed soil samples (Feng and Sui, 2020). ● If field calibration
    is not possible, calibration should be done using the dry-down curve: Calibrating
    LC sensors in the laboratory using the dry-down curve rather than the wet-up curve
    leads to superior performance for field applications. The laboratory validation
    results corroborated with previous literature which claimed superior laboratory
    calibration accuracy using dry-down curves, particularly for finer textured soils
    (Burns et al., 2014). An earlier study which calibrated 3 LC SM100 sensors with
    a similar soil using the dry-down curve in the laboratory was found to have the
    best validation performance (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 %) among all laboratory calibrated
    models (Rai, 2012). Similarly, a linear dry-down calibration equation developed
    in the laboratory by Gedilu (2020) using only one LC SM100 sensor using repacked
    soil from the experimental field, also performed well (R2 = 0.61 and RMSE = 6.06
    %). These models performed better than all the laboratory models in this study
    (models 0 to 7), which were developed using the wet-up curve with five LC sensors.
    This suggests that capturing dry-down dynamics can compensate for the sensor-to-sensor
    variability even for repacked soils inside the laboratory. Further, the dry-down
    curve is more representative of the soil water dynamics during the dry non-monsoonal
    rabi cropping season in northern India, where rainfall majorly occurs during the
    monsoon kharif season (Sankararamakrishnan et al., 2008). ● Overfitting during
    calibration can lead to loss in robust application: Overfitting was observed in
    both laboratory and field RFR models, both of which performed poorly during validation.
    Machine learning models, applied to non-linear hydrological processes have had
    limitations of overfitting and reasonable justification of results (Elshorbagy
    et al., 2010). The data in this study suggest that monotonic (preferably \"gently
    sloped\") curves are more robust for soil moisture calibration. Overfitting using
    ML techniques is possibly also due to the relatively lower number of samples that
    exemplify soil moisture sensor calibration. This supports previous studies which
    mainly report linear and polynomial calibration curves (Bello et al., 2019; Deng
    et al., 2020; Gedilu, 2020; Nagahage et al., 2019; Placidi et al., 2020; Rudnick
    et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2018; Thompson et al., 2007b, 2007a). With respect
    to research question 1 (RQ1), the PWLF model calibrated using field data was chosen
    as the \"best\" LCcal model due to the flexibility of multiple segments without
    compromising the positive correlation expected between data from two electromagnetic
    sensors in the same soil. This suggests that simpler models such as PWLF are more
    robust in calibrating LC soil moisture sensors than more sophisticated ML techniques,
    in such conditions, addressing RQ1. 3.3. Crop model calibration scenarios 3.3.1.

    model performance of the crop model shows that calibrated LC sensor data (\"CalLC\"

    DAS implies days after sowing. In the Default scenario, only crop growth parameters
    (i.e., CCo, CCx and CGC) were altered to improve the fit of the simulated CC curve
    with the observations. The SHPs which would impact the VWC curve fitting were
    chosen from (the average of) default values from literature (Table A2). CC was
    predicted very well as compared to the previous literature on AquaCrop wheat growth
    simulation, with r = 0.98 and RMSE = 5.71 % (Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al.,
    2018). These calibrated canopy growth parameters values were hence used in the
    RawRef., RawLC and CalLC scenarios, leading to nearly identical r and RMSE indicators.
    In all scenarios, the VWC simulations are compared against the observed soil moisture
    data from the reference sensor (Ref.). For the VWC simulations, the Pearson r
    values did not show significant differences across the scenarios. However, when
    the SHPs were modified based on the raw Ref. and LC sensor values, the RawRef.
    (RMSE = 5.69 %) showed a significant improvement, and RawLC (RMSE = 8.58 %) showed
    a significant deterioration, both compared to the Default scenario (RMSE = 7.76
    %). The worsening of the VWC simulation performance in the RawLC scenario in Fig.
    6 (g), which overestimated the VWCobs with a PBIAS = 46.19 %, resulted majorly
    from respectively higher VWCsim values during the drying periods leading up to
    each of the irrigation days, when compared with the Default scenario in Fig. 6
    (e), with a PBIAS = 27.74 %. This implies that the SHPs calibrated using raw LC
    soil moisture data were significantly poorer than those derived from the literature
    (Gupta et al., 2021; Rawls and Brakensiek, 1989), addressing research question
    (RQ) 2. For the VWC simulations, the Pearson r values did not show significant
    differences across the scenarios. However, when the SHPs were modified based on
    the raw Ref. and LC sensor values, the RawRef. (RMSE = 5.69 %) showed a significant
    improvement, and RawLC (RMSE = 8.58 %) showed a significant deterioration, both
    compared to the Default scenario (RMSE = 7.76 %). To answer research question
    (RQ) 2, the performances of the RAWLC and Default scenarios were compared. The
    worsening of the VWC simulation performance in the RawLC scenario in Fig. 6 (g),
    which overestimated the VWCobs with a PBIAS = 46.19 %, resulted majorly from respectively
    higher VWCsim values during the drying periods leading up to each of the irrigation
    days, when compared with the Default scenario in Fig. 6 (e), with a PBIAS = 27.74
    %. Hence, the SHPs calibrated using raw LC soil moisture data were significantly
    poorer than those derived from the literature (Gupta et al., 2021; Rawls and Brakensiek,
    1989), implying the AquaCrop models calibrated with raw data from LC soil moisture
    performed relatively poorly compared to those calibrated using the literature,
    addressing RQ2. The answer to RQ3 is that there was a significant difference between
    the VWCsim performances of the SHPs calibrated using the RawRef (RMSE = 5.7 %,
    PBIAS = 3.99 %) and RawLC (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %) data. This implies
    that the RawRef derived SHPs led to significantly superior VWCsim performances
    than that of the RawLC both in terms of accuracy and bias. To answer RQ4, the
    SHPs were modified using the calibrated LC soil moisture data (in the CalLC scenario).
    The CalLC scenario (RMSE = 5.9 %, PBIAS = 5.22 %) in Fig. 6 (h) significantly
    outperformed the RawLC (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %), nearly attaining the
    performance of RawRef (RMSE = 5.7 %, RMSE = 3.99 %). The SHPs calibrated in CalLC
    reduced the VWCsim overestimation seen in the RawLC scenario. This was corroborated
    by the seasonal water balance computations, which showed that the SHPs interacted
    to reduce the final root zone soil water storage in the CalLC scenario to 19.85
    % lower than the RAWLC scenario (but still not as low as the RawRef. scenario).
    This implies that there were significant advantages of using LC soil moisture
    data calibrated using the Ref. sensor data, to calibrate the crop model SHPs,
    which addressed RQ4. These results indicated the utility of calibrating LC sensors
    using Ref. sensors in terms of improving VWC simulation performance of AquaCrop,
    and that using raw LC sensor data would lead to poorer results than using the
    literature to calibrate SHPs. However, the overall VWC simulation performance
    was not as good as previous studies which used either cumbersome gravimetric VWC
    measurements or costly neutron probes, both of which are highly accurate in VWC
    measurement (Huang et al., 2022; Kale et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2013). Nevertheless,
    it was promising to note that significant improvements were obtained in the VWC
    simulations by calibrating the LC capacitance-based sensor even against an uncalibrated,
    reference (TDR-FDR) sensor. 3.3.2. Final crop model outputs: crop model yield
    and water productivity Fig. 7 illustrates the simulated aboveground crop Water
    Productivity (WPET) for all the scenarios, as averages and standard error of the
    mean (SEM) for all the plots taken together. Table 3 also lists the MAE, RMSE
    and PBIAS for the respective biomass values. AquaCrop-OS overestimated the observed
    biomass by an average of 0.11 kg/m2, and an average RMSE of 0.145 kg/m2, and NRMSE
    of 13.41 %, which is considered to be a ''good'' simulation performance (Jamieson
    et al., 1991; Raes et al., 2018). There were no significant differences in the
    simulated BM across the five scenarios irrespective of the strength of VWC simulation,
    indicating that the FAO AquaCrop simulation of biomass relied primarily on the
    canopy curve development. Download : Download high-res image (183KB) Download

    scenarios (RawRef., RawLC and CalibratedLC). Error bars in all figures represent
    the SEM. However, the simulated water productivity (WPET) varied across the different
    scenarios. There was an improvement in WPET when the SHPs were calibrated using
    the raw Ref. sensor data as compared to the default literature (WPET for Def =
    1.566 ± 0.009 kg/m3, WPET for RawRef. = 1.629 ± 0.006 kg/m3), due to significantly
    lower ET in RAWRef. compared to Def. There was a non-significant change in WPET
    when raw LC sensor data were used to calibrate the SHPs: (WPET for Def = 1.566
    ± 0.009 kg/m3, WPET for RawLC = 1.564 ± 0.011 kg/m3), which corresponded to the
    non-significant differences in simulated ET (and yield) between the two scenarios.
    This implies that incorporating the raw LC SM100 sensor data to calibrate the
    SHPs was not significantly more useful compared to using the literature values,
    and did not address any water saving objectives, further highlighting the ineffectiveness
    of using raw LC soil moisture data shown in Section 3.2.1. However, when the LC
    sensors were calibrated using the Ref. sensors, there was a significant improvement
    in WPET (WPET for RawLC = 1.564 ± 0.011 kg/m3, WPET for CalLC = 1.601 ± 0.010
    kg/m3), due to the significant differences between simulated ET between both the
    scenarios. This difference of 0.037 ± 0.021 kg/m3 corresponds to water savings
    between 17,241 L and 62,500 L per kg of wheat yield produced. 3.4. Summary of
    results This section summarizes the conclusions regarding each research question.
    ● The answer to RQ1 was that simpler models are more effective than sophisticated
    machine learning (ML) algorithms in calibrating LC soil moisture against data
    from a reference soil moisture sensor, since ML techniques can lead to model overfitting
    and overall less robust results. This was based on the discussion surrounding
    Table 2, and Fig. 4, Fig. 5. ● The answer to RQ2 was that raw LC sensor data performed
    significantly poorly than literature values for parsimonious crop model calibration.
    There was no significant improvement in WPET compared to the default calibration
    case. These results were based on Fig. 6 in Section 3.3.1. However, sensor calibration
    may be difficult to implement due to the corresponding resource requirements (e.g.,
    scientific, logistical, financial, human). If the LC sensors cannot be calibrated,
    using default values from the literature for SHP calibration can save sensor costs
    without compromising crop model performance. ● The answer to RQ3 was that the
    simulated AquaCrop VWCsim output and WPET were poorer and significantly lower,
    respectively, when the raw LC soil moisture data was used to calibrate the SHPs
    (RMSE = 9.55 %, PBIAS = 46.19 %), compared to when the Reference soil moisture
    data were used (RMSE = 5.7 %, PBIAS = 3.99 %). These results were based on the
    discussion surrounding Fig. 6 in Section 3.3.1., and Section 3.3.2. ● The answer
    to RQ4 was that the effect of calibrating the raw LC soil moisture on the Reference
    sensor data significantly improved the VWCsim output of the AquaCrop model compared
    to the respective output from the raw LC data, nearly attaining the performance
    based on the Reference sensor data. Additionally, this calibration led to significant
    improvements in simulated WPET. These results are based on the discussions in
    Section 3.3.1. (Figs. 6) and 3.3.2. (Fig. 7). 3.5. Further discussion Capacitance
    based sensing is affected by environmental factors such as salinity and clay content,
    which can be measured and compensated for, to improve performance at lower frequencies
    of soil moisture sensing (Adla et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020). The SM100 sensor
    has been shown to have low sensitivity to salinity by Adla et al. (2020), and
    their recommendations of soil specific calibrations have been followed in this
    study to account for soil textural variability. Similarly, the UGT manual (Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, 2017) mentions that the SMT100 sensor can operate well in clayey soils,
    and has low salinity sensitivity. Hence, this study implicitly accounts for these
    environmental factors. The presence of a distinct wetting-front may also affect
    the calibration curves (Kargas et al., 2013; Young et al., 1997). While not capturing
    this phenomena is a limitation of the study, its impact on this particular application
    may have been relatively minor. The time for a wetting-front to pass the order
    of the sensor depth (∼10 cm) (Chu et al., 2018) was much smaller than the time-resolution
    of the crop model (daily) for which soil moisture measurements were used. Also,
    the horizontal placement of the sensors was more likely to ensure uniform VWC
    within the sensing volume (Kargas et al., 2013). Machine learning algorithms may
    have performed better by incorporating more data and variables (e.g., weather),
    but this was also not done to ensure comparability between the least squares and
    machine learning algorithms. The validations of the different soil moisture calibration
    models performed poorly than the recommended 3 % sensor accuracy for soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling systems (Soulis et al., 2015). However, since
    this study was aimed at analyzing the effect of sensor calibration on relevant
    crop model outputs, this was not a valid concern within this context, and would
    need further investigation. 4. Conclusions A set of best practices of calibrating
    capacitance based low-cost (LC) Spectrum SM100 soil moisture sensors was developed
    using two calibration approaches: calibrating against gravimetric water content
    in the using wet-up curve laboratory conditions, and calibrating against a TDR-FDR
    reference (Ref.) soil moisture sensor (UGT SMT100) in the field. Different least
    squares and machine learning approaches were used to calibrate the LC sensor.
    Field calibration was observed to be more robust than calibration in the laboratory.
    Calibration of the dry-down curve was found to be more accurate, and even calibrations
    using the dry-down curve in the laboratory were robust enough to perform similarly
    well as the superior field calibrations. Overfitting during calibration can lead
    to loss in robustness in the field, and hence, should be avoided. The best calibration
    model (LCcal), considering the above issues, was the field calibrated piece-wise
    linear regression function (PWLF-field). The soil hydraulic parameters (SHPs)
    of the FAO AquaCrop model were calibrated under different calibration schemes
    to understand the effect of using raw soil moisture sensor data, and the additional
    effect of calibrating the capacitance LC sensor, on model outputs. VWC estimation
    respectively improved and worsened on incorporating the Ref. and LC sensor data
    to calibrate SHPs, when compared with literature derived SHPs. However, LC data
    calibrated using the PWLF-field model resulted in nearly the same VWC simulation
    performance as the Ref. sensor. The water productivity (WPET) improved significantly
    when incorporating raw Ref. sensor data to calibrate SHPs. This was not seen when
    incorporating raw LC data, but on transforming the data using the best LCcal model,
    a significant improvement was seen in the WPET compared to both the raw and default
    scenarios. These experiments and modeling reveal that if calibration of LC sensors
    is not possible, it is preferable to use the literature to calibrate crop model
    SHPs without compromising overall model performance. However, calibrating the
    LC sensors using a higher-quality secondary standard sensor in the field may give
    rise to not only better VWC simulations by the crop model, but also significant
    improvements in water productivity and corresponding water savings at the same
    level of yield. CRediT authorship contribution statement Soham Adla: Conceptualization,

    (LfL), Germany. Appendix. Details on the low-cost SM100 sensor The capacitance-based
    Water Scout SM100 soil moisture sensor (Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield,
    IL, USA) operates with a pair of electrodes behaving as a capacitor and the soil
    surrounding the sensor behaving as the charge storing dielectric medium (Spectrum
    Technologies, 2014). An oscillator operating at 80 MHz drives the capacitor, and
    generates an output (voltage ratio) which is proportional to the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil-water system. The sensor output (voltage ratio/raw value) is then
    converted to a VWC value using the factory calibration equation - Equation (1a),
    (1b) in the manuscript (Kieffer, 2018). The outputs of the SM100 sensor are \"Raw
    value\" (which is related to the voltage ratio of the output to the input voltage)
    and \"VWC\". Details on the reference SMT100 sensor The sensor head of the UGT
    SMT100 soil moisture sensor (manufactured by Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, Müncheberg,
    Germany) contains the sensor electronics which emit a steep pulse traveling along
    a closed transmission line buried in the soil. However, instead of directly measuring
    the time for the pulse to return (e.g., in TDT or TDR), the pulse is inverted
    and fed back into the line driver input, resulting in an \"oscillation\" frequency
    which is a function of the soil dielectric permittivity (Bogena et al., 2017).
    Also, unlike the FDR which is based on a capacitor, the SMT100 uses a ring oscillator
    to generate the pulse and transform the travel time to frequency (Bogena et al.,
    2017; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik GmbH, 2017). The oscillation frequency is around 340
    MHz in air and 150 MHz in water (Bogena et al., 2017). This resultant frequency
    is high enough to not be influenced by the high clay content, electrical conductivity
    or imaginary dielectric permittivity of the soil (Blonquist et al., 2005; Umwelt-Geräte-Technik
    GmbH, 2017). The outputs of SMT100 are \"Supply Voltage\", \"Count\" (which can
    be linked to apparent dielectric permittivity through an empirical model, Bogena
    et al., 2017), \"relative permittivity\", \"volumetric water content\" (computed
    using the relative permittivity, Topp et al., 1980) and \"soil temperature\".

    The humid subtropical climate of Louisiana, USA, typically gets ample rainfall,
    and water availability has not historically been a major concern. Groundwater
    is the primary source of irrigation water in the state. Some aquifers in the state
    are showing signs of stress due to over-extraction as evidenced by the presence
    of cones of depression (examples include the Sparta Aquifer, Mississippi River
    Alluvial Aquifer (MRAA), and Chicot Aquifer) [1,2,3]. A report produced by Sargent
    [4] in cooperation with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) indicates that
    the groundwater withdrawals for general irrigation increased in 37 of the 64 parishes
    (Parish is a geographical unit similar to county in other U.S. states) in Louisiana
    by 58% from 2005 to 2010. As of 2018, 71.8% of the total Louisiana corn area and
    42.8% of the total soybean area were irrigated. At the same time, the state had
    55.8% of total agricultural land in the farm under irrigation [5]. Irrigation
    has been increasingly used by farmers as a risk management strategy in crop production
    in Louisiana. The continuous over-extraction of groundwater has two implications.
    The first is that the energy cost required for groundwater pumping increases as
    groundwater levels decline. The second implication is that a reduced water table,
    in the long run, may cause saltwater intrusion in some aquifers, as has been observed
    in some cells of two major aquifers (Chicot and MRAA). To avoid such risk becoming
    widespread and catastrophic, a serious effort is required to maintain a water
    table balance to ensure sustainable groundwater use. Producers’ irrigation behavior
    and their irrigation technology adoption decisions are determined by many factors,
    such as land characteristics, weather factors, crop selection, farm operation
    cost, water availability, energy cost, and perception about sustainability. On
    the one hand, producers are more concerned about the present level of productivity
    and net on-farm profitability. On the other hand, the resource sustainability
    perspective aims to minimize water use while maintaining the required level of
    moisture for crop growth. Farm irrigation practices among the farmers seem analogous
    to these two contrasting perspectives. For instance, center-pivot irrigation technology
    is more efficient in water application than the commonly used furrow irrigation
    system [6]. However, farmers can be reluctant to switch to a more efficient irrigation
    technology when initial investment costs are high, especially when there are no
    restrictions on groundwater withdrawal amounts. Many studies have been conducted
    regarding the evaluation of determinants of irrigation technology adoption in
    different parts of the world. In most cases, water availability, extension services,
    cropping patterns, and educational levels were important variables affecting irrigation
    technology adoption. He et al. [7] find that farmers’ educational backgrounds,
    farm labor availability, the extension service, and positive attitudes towards
    irrigation technology adoption are the major variables determining the adoption
    of rainwater harvesting and supplementary irrigation technology. Namara et al.
    [8] find that groundwater availability, cropping patterns, credit access, the
    level of education, and financial status are the most influential factors for
    adopting the micro-irrigation method. Feike et al. [9] indicate that farm size,
    crop types, and cropping intensity were the major determinants of drip irrigation
    technology adoption for cotton farming in the arid area of China. Dai et al. [10]
    determine that the reliability of the water source, government promotional activities,
    the level of education, soil texture, energy price, and the availability of farm
    labor were positively associated with the adoption of irrigation technology in
    the Heilongjiang province of China. In another context, Song et al. [11] and Li
    and Zhao [12] note that the adoption of a more efficient irrigation technology
    led to rebound effects (the expansion of irrigated areas previously not under
    irrigation). Information channeling and social capital are important factors in
    explaining technology adoption decisions by farmers. Information dissemination
    concerning new studies and findings through effective and reliable sources can
    optimize its implementation probability and thus be productive in achieving the
    goal of resource management. Hunecke et al. [13] demonstrate that trust in the
    institution (Note that formal networks represent the farmers’ participation in
    associations and meetings with professionals and experts; informal networks represent
    networks of close neighbors, family, and friends; general trust refers to trust
    in the surrounding society, such has family, friends and colleagues; and two types
    of irrigation technologies are drip or sprinkler with/without scheduling adoption)
    and formal and informal networks positively influence irrigation technology adoption
    in Central Chile. (In specific term, it refers to water board that controls the
    irrigation water use in a specific geographic region of many countries in the
    world. In broader context, the term represents governmental regulatory and research
    entities involved in water resource monitoring, evaluation, and regulation as
    well in many counties depending on the water resource availability) A study conducted
    by Krishnan and Patnam [14] in Ethiopia reveals that the extension service was
    more effective during the initial phase of new production technology adoption.
    However, social learning is far more persistent and impactful throughout the adoption
    process than the extension service alone. While the extension service and social
    learning have individually been shown to be influential in irrigation technology
    adoption, their influence is increased when these mechanisms for information dissemination
    are combined [15]. Using efficient irrigation technology is generally viewed as
    feasible to reduce consumptive water for agricultural production. However, it
    is shown that the conversion to a more efficient irrigation technology increased
    groundwater extraction in western Kansas [16]. These findings, which other studies
    have supported, imply that adopting an efficient irrigation technology is a necessary
    but not sufficient condition for water conservation. For instance, Segarra and
    Feng [17] observe that declines in irrigated acres in the Texas High Plains were
    due to low-efficiency irrigation technologies combined with low crop prices resulting
    in low farm profitability. In the context of the U.S. Pacific West, producers’
    irrigation decisions are determined by economic and physical water scarcity, climate,
    and extreme weather such as severe drought, frost, and extreme heat [18]. Additionally,
    in regions where groundwater supply is significantly low, converting from an inefficient
    gravity irrigation system to an efficient drip irrigation system offsets many
    of the negative impacts of drought on farm income, as explained by Ward [19] in
    the context of the Rio Grande River Basin of New Mexico. Many studies [20,21,22,23]
    have evaluated the determinants of irrigation technology adoption for different
    crops in different geographic locations in the U.S. Producers intend to adopt
    new technologies to hedge against yield uncertainty caused by frequent drought
    periods, in which the farmer’s human capital plays a significant role in the decision
    to adopt modern and more efficient irrigation equipment [24]. Bryant et al. [25]
    determine the effect of integrating irrigation water management practices on irrigation
    water use, soybean yield, irrigation efficiency, and net returns in the prairie
    region of Arkansas and the delta region of Arkansas and Mississippi. They find
    that, compared to conventional irrigation practices, irrigation water management
    practices reduced total water use by 21% and increased water use efficiency by
    36%, and sensor-based scheduling reduced the number of irrigations by 50%. But
    in the context of Arkansas, Huang et al. [26] find that producers are more likely
    to rely on water management practices (moisture sensors, flow meters, etc.) instead
    of more efficient irrigation technologies. From the literature we reviewed, we
    note that limited studies have been carried out concerning the determinants of
    irrigation technology adoption and acreage allocation in regions similar to Louisiana.
    This study contributes to the literature by filling this research gap. The main
    objectives of this study are to determine the factors affecting irrigation technology
    adoption and acreage allocation for different irrigation technologies among soybean
    producers in Louisiana. For this purpose, we conducted a farm-level survey to
    collect information regarding irrigation practices and concerns. The instrumental
    variable probit (IV-probit) model is used to estimate the determinants of irrigation
    technology adoption for soybean irrigation. A multivariate fractional regression
    method was used to estimate the determinants of acreage allocation. To the best
    of our understanding, except for Huang et al. [26] in Arkansas, this issue has
    not been evaluated in the context of the southeastern region of the U.S. (as defined
    by the USGS) using farm-level survey data. Our study area could be a representative
    region for many parts of the world that have characteristics similar to the southeastern
    region of the U.S. The findings of this study should be beneficial to those concerned
    about water productivity, water resource conservation, and sustainable farming.
    The results can help formulate policies to promote efficient irrigation technology
    adoption. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides
    details on the survey used and data description. Section 3 describes the model
    specification and estimation methods, including probit and IV-probit models for
    the adoption of irrigation technology and a multivariate fractional regression
    method for acreage allocation. Section 4 presents empirical results, policy implications,
    and discussion. Section 5 provides concluding remarks and future directions. 2.
    Survey and Data Description We conducted a survey to understand irrigation practices
    and the concerns of Louisiana soybean farmers for the 2015 crop year following
    Dillman’s [27] tailored design method. Considering the sampling adjustment in
    the 2015 crop year survey, 158 responses were received from a total survey sample
    of 2432, for a response rate of 6.5 percent. However, given the low number of
    respondents who provided complete information in that initial survey, the survey
    was redesigned without changing the central theme and was sent out again in the
    2016 crop year. In this second round of the survey, we sent out a pre-notification
    letter (postcard) to 1680 Louisiana soybean producers (Figure 1). Out of the total
    questionnaires sent out, 451 envelopes were returned because of address errors
    or because some of the farmers had retired. From the total sample of 1229, considering
    the sampling adjustment, we obtained 123 responses. The response rate for the
    second round of the survey was 10 percent, 3.5 percent more than the first round
    of the survey conducted for the crop year 2015. We did not send questionnaires
    in 2016 to those farmers who responded in the 2015 survey to avoid the possibility
    of repetition. Figure 1. Respondents’ farm locations in Louisiana (the green color
    indicates where respondents are located). Survey questions were related to irrigation
    water quality, technology adoption, water availability, future concerns about
    crop irrigation, and the sociodemographic characteristics of farm producers. Table
    1 presents the variables used, variable definition, and descriptive statistics
    used in different regression models. Table 1. Descriptive Statistics. The dependent
    variables are arranged to make it appropriate for two different models. In irrigation
    technology adoption estimation, the dependent variable is a dummy variable that
    represents furrow and other irrigation (1 for furrow including flood irrigation
    and 0 for other irrigation technology as a dependent variable) in soybean production.
    The main reason for considering a binary form of irrigation technologies is the
    limited number of samples and a higher percentage of furrow irrigation users in
    soybean and corn production. It is well accepted that the furrow irrigation technology
    is less efficient than the center-pivot irrigation technology. However, furrow
    irrigation with submersible electric well and poly-pipe has expanded extensively
    over the past 10 to 15 years in the state’s major corn and soybean growing areas
    in the Mississippi River Alluvial Aquifer in North Louisiana. As a result, the
    state has seen a steady decline in the aquifer level in this area. Table 1 shows
    that, on average, 45% of respondents had adopted furrow irrigation in soybean
    production. The dependent variables for the multivariate fractional regression
    model are fractions of irrigated acres under different irrigation technologies.
    Indeed, furrow and flood irrigation are almost the same. However, due to the response
    obtained from farmers, we grouped them into two categories. The primary consideration
    here is determined by the use of poly-pipe. Furrow irrigation refers to one that
    uses poly-pipe and flood irrigation refers to gravity irrigation without using
    poly-pipe. The four categories of fractions included flood-irrigated (9% of total
    acres), furrow-irrigated (39% of total acres), center-pivot-irrigated (6.6% of
    total acres), and non-irrigated acres (45% of total acres). These values consider
    all irrigated and non-irrigated acres under operation across all commodities (corn,
    soybeans, cotton, and rice). The educational background of the principal farm
    operators was found to be 32% with a high school degree, 23% with some college,
    30% with a bachelor’s degree, and 9% with a graduate or professional degree. These
    were then regrouped into two categories (some college or less and a 4-year degree
    or more) representing the “EDU” variable. Survey results indicated that 51% of
    the operations had a total farm income during the crop year of below USD 100,000,
    while 26% had a total income between USD 100,000 and USD 500,000, and 23% had
    annual total farm income of above USD 500,000. The risk variable represents the
    farmer’s attitude towards an investment decision. The risk aversion, risk-neutral,
    and risk-loving information was elicited by asking whether the producers tend
    to avoid risks whenever possible in their investment decision. As shown, 39% of
    respondents were identified as risk-averse, 37% as risk-neutral, and 24% as risk
    lovers. Extension and neighbors are dummy variables representing the sources of
    information that farmers rely on for water conservation or irrigation cost reduction
    information. As seen from Table 1, roughly 45% of the respondents rely on the
    extension service, while 24% rely on neighbors for the farm information source.
    We can also observe that around 58% of respondents are farming rented farmland
    (leasing in). Other variables used in this study are the distance to the nearest
    market or town, distance to the nearest equipment dealer, energy cost, and spousal
    educational attainment. 3. Method 3.1. Irrigation Technology Adoption In our survey,
    most farmers indicated that they use furrow and center-pivot irrigation technologies
    in soybean and corn production. Since the outcome variables are binary, a probit
    regression approach is utilized to estimate the determinants of irrigation technology
    adoption. The probit regression is based on the random utility model in which
    an individual farmer’s decision depends on the difference in the marginal benefit
    of choosing an alternative irrigation technology. This difference in marginal
    benefit, denoted by 𝑦 * , is not observable. However, the final outcome is observed,
    as the individual would choose a particular option if it provided higher utility,
    that is 𝑦=1 if 𝑦 * >0 and 𝑦=0 otherwise [28]. Here, 𝑦=1 refers to the outcome
    when an individual farmer adopts the furrow irrigation technology. Many factors
    determine this selection of irrigation technologies. The model can be expressed
    as: 𝑃𝑟(𝑦=1|𝑋)=𝐹( 𝛽 0 +𝛽 𝑋 𝑖 ) (1) where, 𝑃𝑟 is the probability of adoption, F
    is the cumulative distribution function assumed to be normally distributed, 𝑋
    is the vector of explanatory variables, and 𝛽 is the parameter to be estimated.
    An endogeneity problem arises when one or more explanatory variables are correlated
    with the error term. We can use an instrumental variable probit model that fits
    with dichotomous dependent variables and endogenous regressors to correct that
    problem. The general specification of the model can be expressed as: 𝑦 1𝑖 = 𝑥
    2𝑖 𝛼+ 𝑥 1𝑖 𝛽+ 𝑒 𝑖 (2) 𝑥 2𝑖 = 𝑥 1𝑖 ℧ 1 + z 2i ℧ 2 + 𝜀 𝑖 (3) In Equations (2) and
    (3), 𝑥 2𝑖 is the 1𝑥𝑚 vector of the endogenous variable, 𝑥 1𝑖 is a vector of exogenous
    variables, and 𝑧 2𝑖 is a vector of instrumental variables. It is assumed that
    ( 𝑒 𝑖 , 𝜀 𝑖 ) ~𝑁(0,∑ ). Here, “∑” stands for covariance matrix given by ( 𝜎 11
    𝜎 21 𝜎 12 𝜎 22 ), in which 𝜎 𝑖𝑗 represents covariance components and 𝜎 11 is normalized
    to one for the model identification. Additionally, 𝛼 and 𝛽  are structural parameters,
    and ℧ 1 and ℧ 2 are matrices of reduced-form parameters. The order condition for
    the identification of the structural parameters requires that the column of 𝑥
    2𝑖 should be greater than or equal to the column of 𝑦 2𝑖 . In our estimation,
    we suspected laser leveling (LASER) as an endogenous variable causing an endogeneity
    problem. We identified distance to equipment dealers (DSTED) as an instrumental
    variable and used it in the estimation process. This instrumental variable passed
    the relevancy and exclusion criteria. 3.2. Determinants of Acreage Allocation
    Producers can use one or more available irrigation methods to irrigate their crops.
    𝑌 𝑚 = (𝑦 1 , 𝑦 2 ,…, 𝑦 𝑀 ) is the fraction of irrigated area using 𝑀 different
    irrigation methods. The value associated with each variable should be within the
    interval [0, 1]. Here the dependent variables associated with areas under a particular
    irrigation technology are the fraction of the whole farmland area. We cannot use
    a probit or logit model as it does not allow a fractional value as a dependent
    variable. To deal with this type of problem, we use a nonlinear function that
    satisfies 0≤𝑔(.)≤1 , in which 𝑔(.) is a nonlinear model proposed by Papke and
    Wooldridge [29]. The conditional mean of the univariate dependent variable is
    given by 𝐸(𝑦|𝑥)=𝑔(𝑥𝛽) , where 𝑥 and 𝛽 are the vectors of explanatory variables
    and parameters, respectively. A fractional model with Bernoulli distribution can
    be specified with the logistic link, and parameters can be estimated by maximizing
    the Bernoulli log-likelihood function. Recent papers by Mullahy [30], Murteira
    and Ramalho [31], and Paudel et al. [32] have discussed fractional multivariate
    estimation procedures. For the estimation process, we adopt a multivariate fractional
    regression method in which logit specification can be expressed as:  𝐺 𝑚 = exp(
    𝑥 ′ 𝑚 𝛽) ∑ 𝑀 𝑖=1 exp( 𝑥 ′ 𝑙 𝛽) , with  m=1……M. (4) where 𝑥 and β are independent
    variables and parameters, respectively, 𝐺 𝑚 =  𝐺 𝑚 (𝑋,β) , conditional mean 0
    < 𝐺 𝑚 <1  for all m, and ∑ 𝑀 𝑚 𝐺 𝑚 = 1. Each crop producer 𝑣 may irrigate using
    one or more available irrigation technologies. The contribution of each crop producer
    𝑣 to the log-likelihood can be expressed as: 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝐿 𝑣 (𝛽)= ∑ 𝑀 𝑚=1 𝑌 𝑣𝑚 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐺 𝑣𝑚
    = ∑ 𝑀−1 𝑚=1 𝑌 𝑣𝑚 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝐺 𝑣𝑚 𝐺 𝑣𝑀 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐺 𝑣𝑀 . (5) where 𝑌 𝑖𝑚 is the fraction of irrigated
    acreage under the 𝑚 𝑡ℎ irrigation method and 𝐺 𝑣𝑀 =1− ∑ 𝑀−1 𝑚=1 𝐺 𝑣𝑚 . Then, the
    quasi-maximum likelihood estimator is estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood
    of all crop producers 𝑁 using the expression: 𝐿𝐿(𝛽)= ∑ 𝑁 𝑣=1 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝐿 𝑣  (𝛽) (6) where
    the estimated parameter 𝛽 is consistent and asymptotically normal regardless of
    the true conditional distribution y, provided that 𝐺 is correctly specified. Employing
    the multivariate fractional regression method, our model estimation focused on
    fractions of acres devoted to flood, furrow, and center-pivot irrigation systems,
    alongside non-irrigated cropland acreage. The independent variables encompassed
    various facets, including sociodemographic data, input costs, risk attitudes,
    extension services utilization, and sources of information for production. This
    comprehensive approach enables a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing
    irrigation system choices and non-irrigated cropland acreage in our analysis.
    4. Results and Discussion 4.1. Determinants of Irrigation Technology Adoption
    Initially, we use a probit model to estimate the determinants of irrigation technology
    adoption in soybean and corn production. Estimated coefficients and marginal effects
    are presented in Appendix A, Table A1. Laser leveling is directly related to furrow
    irrigation, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides financial
    support for laser leveling. We suspect that this variable could be endogenous.
    To address this potential problem, the variable representing the distance to equipment
    dealer (DISTEQP) is used as an instrumental variable. Farmers physically close
    to the equipment dealer receive more information regarding laser leveling and
    are thus more likely to implement laser leveling. The distance to equipment dealer
    has nothing to do with the adoption of furrow irrigation. Its direct effect comes
    only through laser leveling. It is widely accepted that the exclusion restriction
    needs to be satisfied for an instrument to be valid. However, we do not have a
    formal statistical test of the exclusion restriction. Stock et al. [33] suggest
    that the F statistic should exceed 10 in the first-stage regression to be reliable
    for one endogenous regressor. We test whether we could treat laser leveling as
    an exogenous variable using the “estat endogenous” code in Stata 15 software.
    It provides Durbin and Wu–Hausman test statistics. The null hypothesis of the
    Durbin and Wu–Hausman tests is that the variable under consideration can be treated
    as exogenous. We find both test statistics highly significant, so we reject the
    null of exogeneity. Furthermore, Table A2 displays the estimated results of the
    first stage regression that justify the appropriateness of the instrumental variable.
    The first-stage results show that the instrumental variable is highly significant,
    the F-value is above 10, and the t-value is above 4. We also regress laser leveling
    directly to the dependent variable and find it nonsignificant. Furthermore, the
    Wald test for exogeneity of the instrumental variables has a chi-square value
    of 5.6 with a p-value of 0.01. All these statistics indicate that the instrument
    is not weak, and thus the distance to equipment dealer is a reasonable instrumental
    variable in this case. Estimated coefficients using the IV-probit method are presented
    in Table 2. These coefficients are useful in explaining the impact direction of
    explanatory variables related to irrigation technology adoption (positive or negative
    impact). For example, the education of the farmer (EDU), his risk aversion attitude
    (RISKD2), and extension services as a source of information (EXT) are negatively
    associated with furrow irrigation technology adoption in soybean production. On
    the other hand, energy cost (ENGC), neighbor as a source of information (NBR),
    laser leveling (LASER), landholding (ACRE), and rental status (RENT) are positively
    associated with furrow irrigation adoption. Marginal effect values have better
    explanatory power than the estimated coefficients in a discrete choice model.
    We use marginal values presented in Table 2 (column 2) for a better explanation.
    Table 2. Estimated results obtained from using an IV-probit model (irrigation
    technology adoption). From Table 2, furrow irrigation adoption is significantly
    affected by educational attainment, laser leveling, and landholding. Marginal
    effect values obtained from the IV-probit method are higher than those obtained
    from the probit method. On average, the expected probability of furrow irrigation
    adoption by farmers with a college degree or higher is 45% lower than farmers
    with education below the college degree. The potential reason could be that educated
    farmers might have evaluated the long-run benefit of water-conserving irrigation
    technologies with lower operational costs. Indeed, furrow irrigation systems might
    be expensive due to the higher costs of laser leveling. Our findings are similar
    to those of Toma et al. [34]. They state that education influences both behavior
    and intentions indirectly through profit orientation and the perceived usefulness
    of the information source. Education and information access were among the factors
    influencing multiple technology adoption. Educated farmers are more likely to
    access useful information to adopt a new technology in their farming practices.
    An increase in one acre of landholding increases the expected probability of furrow
    irrigation adoption by less than 1%. Compared to farms without laser leveling,
    furrow irrigation adoption is significantly affected by laser leveling. However,
    the impact of laser leveling on furrow irrigation adoption is higher than that
    found in the probit estimation. The estimated coefficients of other variables
    are not significant but are correctly signed. For example, the marginal effect
    of extension is −0.16, which indicates that the farmers who have access to extension
    services are 16% less likely to adopt furrow irrigation than farmers who do not
    have access to an extension service. This implies that strengthening extension
    services could have effective policy implications for water conservation efforts,
    irrigation productivity, and sustainability. Laser leveling makes the furrow irrigation
    system costly, but it also increases irrigation efficiency. Furrow irrigation
    is also a labor-intensive system. 4.2. Acreage Allocation In this estimation,
    the dependent variables are the fractions of acres of cropland under flood, furrow,
    center-pivot irrigation systems, and the non-irrigated cropland. We suspected
    an endogeneity problem caused by the laser leveling variable in the technology
    adoption estimation and used an IV-probit method to estimate the impact. However,
    in multivariate fractional regression, we do not have a built-in option to use
    IV regression. To address the problem, the predicted value is obtained by regressing
    laser leveling on the distance to equipment dealer variable and then using the
    predicted value “ELASER” as an explanatory variable that acts as an instrumental
    variable in the multivariate fractional regression. The standard error may not
    be correct; however, regression results with an instrumental variable provide
    efficient estimates [35]. Table 3 displays the estimated marginal effect, considering
    a fraction of the non-irrigated farm as the base category. Marginal effect values
    have a better explanatory power than model coefficients in the fractional regression
    case. Table 3. Marginal effects for acreage allocation as obtained from using
    a multivariate fractional regression model. Table 3 shows that the marginal effect
    of education for center-pivot acreage allocation is negative 0.079, which indicates
    that farmers with some college education allocate 7% less land to center-pivot-irrigated
    acreage than farmers having education below some college. The possible reason
    might be that more highly educated farmers may seek technologies different from
    the center-pivot method. Additionally, they might be interested in adopting surge
    valves, flow meters, or moisture/soil sensors to increase irrigation efficiency
    in their current irrigation systems. In particular, valve meters are devices that
    measure and regulate water flow; surge flows refer to sudden and temporary increases
    or fluctuations in water flow within a pipeline; and a sensor meter is an instrument
    equipped with sensors to measure specific physical or environmental parameters,
    providing data for monitoring moisture level in the farm. They may also seek information
    from the NRCS or other federal and state agencies. Higher education reduces furrow-irrigated
    acreage allocation as it is negatively signed, but it is not significant. Risk-averse
    farmers tend to allocate 29% less land to furrow-irrigated acreage, 4% less to
    center-pivot-irrigated acreage, and 26% more to non-irrigated acreage than risk-loving
    farmers. Risk-neutral farmers tend to allocate 28% less land to furrow-irrigated
    acreage, 6% less to center-pivot-irrigated acreage, and 28% more to non-irrigated
    acreage than risk-loving farmers. Regarding irrigation information, farmers utilizing
    extension services tend to allocate 19% less land to non-irrigated acreage than
    farmers utilizing no extension services. A reduced land allocation to non-irrigation
    shows the importance of extension services in irrigation efficiency, water productivity,
    and farm yield issues. Regarding farming experience, one more year of farm experience
    tends to reduce the flood-irrigated acreage by less than 1%, implying that farming
    experience tends to favor an efficient irrigation technology over an inefficient
    furrow irrigation system. Landholding tends to reduce furrow irrigated acreage
    and increases the use of center-pivot acreage. Farmers with more land receive
    higher incomes and invest in an efficient irrigation technology. Similarly, farmers
    using rented land tend to allocate 20% more furrow irrigated land than producers
    farming their owned land. However, rental farm operators tend to allocate less
    acreage to center-pivot irrigation. The marginal effect value of “ELASER” is significant
    at 1%, 10%, and 5% for furrow acreage, center-pivot acreage, and non-irrigated
    acreage, respectively. The predicted value of laser leveling tends to increase
    the furrow-irrigated acreage significantly while reducing the center-pivot acreage
    and non-irrigated acreage. This finding is consistent with the values obtained
    in determinants of irrigation technology adoption estimation. Our sample response
    indicates that furrow irrigation is Louisiana’s commonly practiced irrigation
    method. We noted that many farmers have not used valve meters, surge flows, and
    sensor meters. in their current irrigation systems Even with furrow irrigation,
    it has been shown that the adoption of irrigation practices can help to minimize
    total water use per acre while still meeting crop moisture requirements [25].
    In general, implementing valve meters, surge flows, and sensor meters within existing
    irrigation systems can optimize water use efficiency, contributing to water conservation.
    In this context, raising educational awareness specifically encouraging producers
    to adopt these tools would be relevant in sustainable water use. In both estimations
    (irrigation technology adoption and acreage allocation), education, risk attitude,
    land holding, and laser leveling seem to be the most influential factors. More
    highly educated farmers tend to adopt a center-pivot or an even more efficient
    irrigation system and minimize the use of an inefficient furrow irrigation system.
    Highly educated farmers are innovative and willing to find better production methods.
    Here, education reflects formal educational attainment in a direct sense. The
    policy implication arising from this study on the adoption of water-conserving
    irrigation technology suggests that producers with higher educational attainment
    are inclined to adopt more efficient irrigation technologies. Regardless of the
    insignificant impact of extension service and neighbor on irrigation technology
    adoption and acreage allocation, we tried to estimate the models adding an interaction
    term consisting of the extension and neighbor variables, but the results were
    not significantly different. The climatic factor could have been an important
    determinant of irrigation technology adoption and acreage allocation under various
    irrigation technologies. However, this study did not consider this variable to
    be an influential determinant because the data collected are from almost similar
    climatic characteristics. Since this study has utilized pooled data from 2015
    and 2016, year-specific characteristics could impact our results differently.
    We used a year dummy variable to determine such an impact. The estimated results
    using the year dummy did not produce significantly different values than those
    obtained without the year dummy, except for the minimal change in the intercept
    coefficient. Additionally, no producer responded in both years. Water availability
    for irrigation has not been a significant concern in Louisiana until recently.
    The heightened urgency results from reduced groundwater levels, the presence of
    a cone of depression, and saltwater intrusion in some of the major aquifers in
    the state. As of 2018, 71.8 percent of the total Louisiana corn area and 42.8
    percent of the entire soybean area were irrigated [36]. Farmers increasingly use
    irrigation as a risk management strategy in crop production in the state. Concerns
    related to aquifer health have motivated farmers and policymakers to adopt, suggest,
    and, in some cases, incentivize efficient irrigation technology adoption along
    with irrigation water management practices. The imperative for sustainable groundwater
    usage is underscored by numerous studies highlighting a significant decline in
    groundwater levels in the southeastern regions. For instance, we observed a noteworthy
    expansion in irrigated soybeans and corn acreage in Arkansas since 1985, adjacent
    to Louisiana, coupled with a substantial decline in groundwater levels [37]. 5.
    Conclusions The primary objective of this study was to determine the factors affecting
    irrigation technology adoption and acreage allocation for different irrigation
    technologies in Louisiana crop production. For this purpose, we conducted a statewide
    mail survey in 2015 and 2016 to collect information regarding irrigation practices
    and concerns among the producers in the state [38]. We used an IV-probit model
    to estimate the determinants of irrigation technology adoption. Our findings indicate
    that higher educational attainment tends to significantly diminish the adoption
    of the furrow irrigation system. Additionally, a multivariate fractional regression
    model was used to identify and evaluate the determinants of acreage allocation
    under various irrigation technologies in crop production. The results indicated
    that risk aversion and total land holdings negatively impacted acreage allocation
    to furrow irrigation. In contrast, farm revenue, rent status, and laser leveling
    positively impacted acreage allocation to furrow irrigation. Similarly, farm revenue,
    rent status, and extension services are likely to increase center-pivot acreage
    allocation. The findings of this study should be beneficial to those who are concerned
    about water productivity and water resource conservation. The results could help
    formulate effective tools to promote the adoption of efficient irrigation technology
    in crop production. Farmers with higher levels of education are innovative in
    farming and willing to find better production methods. Here, education reflects
    formal educational attainment in a direct sense. Making farmers more educated
    (with a formal degree) is not under our control. Educating farmers about the application
    of various modern technologies needs to be emphasized. The implementation of the
    farmer field school program along with a reliable extension service could help
    in this direction as the combined approach is an innovative, participatory, and
    interactive model approach to educating farmers about various farm practices,
    crop management strategies, and the upscaling of new technologies. Other effective
    approaches are attracting more educated people to farming, making farming an agribusiness
    operation, and training farmers on better farming technology and marketing practices.
    The land grant university extension system is poised to consistently deliver impactful
    training initiatives, ensuring the dissemination of knowledge and expertise in
    efficient and advantageous irrigation practices, as well as fostering the awareness
    and adoption of appropriate and innovative production technologies. Many studies
    [13,14] have demonstrated the importance of extension services in technology adoption.
    It is also evident that trust in the institution, networking, and social capital
    influence technology adoption. Extension services can play a substantial role
    in building up social capital and networking—incentive payments for adopting efficient
    irrigation technology and allocating more crop acreage for water-efficient irrigation
    technology as it is observed that producers in Louisiana seem to be applying irrigation
    water excessively in agricultural production [39]. Our study has some limitations,
    including the small sample size and the lack of additional information on soil
    and topographical characteristics. Irrigation technology adoption decisions depend
    on many factors, such as soil characteristics and land slope, which are lacking
    in this study. Including these variables in the regression model would help to
    avoid omitted variable bias. Author Contributions Conceptualization, T.K.G., K.P.P.

  description: Plant viruses pose a significant threat to agriculture. Several are
    stable outside their hosts, can enter water bodies and remain infective for prolonged
    periods of time. Even though the quality of irrigation water is of increasing
    importance in the context of plant health, the presence of plant viruses in irrigation
    waters is understudied. In this study, we conducted a large-scale high-throughput
    sequencing (HTS)-based virome analysis of irrigation and surface water sources
    to obtain complete information about the abundance and diversity of plant viruses
    in such waters. We detected nucleic acids of plant viruses from 20 families, discovered
    several novel plant viruses from economically important taxa, like Tobamovirus
    and observed the influence of the water source on the present virome. By comparing
    viromes of water and surrounding plants, we observed presence of plant viruses
    in both compartments, especially in cases of large-scale outbreaks, such as that
    of tomato mosaic virus. Moreover, we demonstrated that water virome data can extensively
    inform us about the distribution and diversity of plant viruses for which only
    limited information is available from plants. Overall, the results of the study
    provided extensive insights into the virome of irrigation waters from the perspective
    of plant health. It also suggested that an HTS-based water virome surveillance
    system could be used to detect potential plant disease outbreaks and to survey
    the distribution and diversity of plant viruses in the ecosystem.

    RNA polymerase 1. Introduction Plant viruses are a well-known risk factor in crop
    production, resulting in at least $30 billion in yield losses annually (Sastry
    and Zitter, 2014). The presence of plant viruses in the aqueous environment has
    been known for nearly four decades (Koenig, 1986). They have been detected in
    a variety of water bodies including rivers, lakes, ice, and tap water (Mehle and
    Ravnikar, 2012), and in wastewaters (Bačnik et al., 2020; Rosario et al., 2009;
    Chopyk et al., 2020; Rothman and Whiteson, 2022). For some of them, stability
    in water for prolonged periods of time and the subsequent ability to infect plants
    were demonstrated (Mehle et al., 2023). Although research of plant viruses in
    environmental waters has been gradually developing, there are still relatively
    few studies focusing on this topic. There are even fewer studies that focus on
    irrigation water and/or surface water near farms (Lopez-Roblero et al., 2020;
    Vani and Varma, 1993; Boben et al., 2007). In one study, researchers from China
    have confirmed the presence and infectivity of eight selected tobamoviruses (Zhang
    et al., 2023). These findings put forward possible risks associated with the use
    of water containing plant viruses for irrigation of plants, which need to be further
    investigated. This is especially important since currently, 70 % of the freshwater
    withdrawals are used for irrigation and general agricultural needs and this trend
    is expected to increase (Rossi, 2019). For example, in the European Union, the
    main irrigation water resource is on-farm underground water or surface supply
    networks in more arid areas like Greece (Rossi, 2019). In addition to these two
    sources, on-farm surface water (e.g., rivers, streams, ponds) is also often used
    (Rossi, 2019). In the last decade, virome studies, based on high-throughput sequencing
    (HTS), enabled high resolution genetic studies of virus diversitys in environmental
    water samples (Rusiñol et al., 2020). Many studies have addressed the diversity
    of viruses in oceans, however, less attention has been given to freshwater bodies
    (Lu et al., 2022). Virome studies of freshwater bodies, specifically focusing
    on plant viruses are sparse (Lopez-Roblero et al., 2020; Mehle et al., 2018),
    even though this aspect is important in the view of the possible detrimental effects
    of plant viruses in agriculture, if such waters are used for irrigation of plants
    (Mehle and Ravnikar, 2012; Mehle et al., 2023). To better understand the potential
    risks associated with the presence of plant viruses in irrigation waters, baseline
    virome studies are first needed to provide information about the presence of viruses
    in such samples. So far, few studies have addressed this topic in different ways,
    e.g., by exploring a virome of irrigation water samples (Rusiñol et al., 2020),
    virome of irrigated crop plants (Aw et al., 2016) or virome of plant communities
    growing next to the water canal (Yang et al., 2022). Moreover, large sequence
    datasets obtained by HTS-based analysis of environmental water samples can bring
    additional information, reaching beyond the presence/absence data for different
    viruses. This was most significantly demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic
    where wastewater monitoring has been used for tracking virus variants in populations
    across numerous countries (Shah et al., 2022). Extending such framework to other
    water types could bring extensive information about different aspects of epidemiology
    of other viruses. For example, environmental monitoring of water used in, and
    around agricultural sites could be used to detect and anticipate the entry and
    spread of plant viruses in the given area and to better understand their epidemiology.
    In this study, we investigated the virome of diverse types of irrigation water
    and nearby environmental surface water samples, collected in several agroecosystems
    (tomato farms) in Slovenia. Focusing on plant viruses, we aimed to (1) provide
    baseline virome data for plant virus presence in sampled waters, (2) compare viromes
    of different irrigation water types, (3) use water virome data to discover novel
    plant viruses, and (4) obtain information about plant virus diversity and distribution
    in the wider environment. Moreover, these results were associated and compared
    with results from a previous study (Rivarez et al., 2023) that looked at the virome
    of tomato and surrounding weed plants at the same tomato farms. This enabled us
    to obtain unique and unprecedented comparative insight into the virome compositions
    of two different but connected agroecosystem components: plants and water. By
    elucidating the presence, diversity, and distribution of plant viruses in irrigation
    water, we can better understand their potential impact on agricultural systems
    and to develop strategies for their early detection and management. The applicability
    of water analysis for detection of new and/or emergent viruses is also discussed
    herewith, following its usability as an early warning system for viruses just
    entering the environment. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge
    on plant viruses in environmental waters and highlights the need for further studies
    in this area that would improve our understanding of the ecological dynamics of
    plant viruses in agroecosystems. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Samples and sampling
    locations Water samples (5 L) were collected in the summer of 2019 and 2020 at
    different locations in Slovenia (Fig. 1, Supplementary Information 1, S1). Selected
    locations were farms with tomato as the main growing crop. The sampled water from
    different sources was used for irrigation on the farm. In addition, several water
    samples of surface water that is not directly used for irrigation were taken in
    close proximity to the farm. Water was collected in autoclaved glass bottles and
    transported back to the laboratory in cooler boxes. Before further processing,
    samples were stored at 4 ℃ for up to 48 h. Different types of samples are labelled
    further in the text as: (T) - tap water from municipal water system; (U) - underground
    water originating from any underground source; (P) - pond or any standing freshwater
    body, and (R) - rivers or any type of surface watercourse, including canals and
    streams. The sample nomenclature shows the type of water, year of sampling, and
    site number (e.g., U-19–01 represents underground water sampled in 2019, at location
    1). Download : Download high-res image (277KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Sampling locations and their geographical distribution. Dots represent
    sampling location (if locations were very close together, they are designated
    with the same dot). Lines separate different statistical regions. Greyed-out regions
    contain sampling locations. Grey shaded numbers represent locations where surface
    water not directly used for irrigation was sampled. For exact longitude and latitude
    information refer to Supplementary Information 1, S1. 2.2. Concentration of water
    samples and nucleic acids extraction All samples (5 L) were concentrated using
    convective interaction media (CIM) monolithic chromatography, with a CIM quaternary
    amine (QA) 8 mL column (Sartorius BIA separations, Slovenia), and with step gradient
    elution to a final elution volume of 25 mL. The collected fractions (one before
    concentration (raw) and one after concentration (elution) for each sample) were
    stored at -80 °C until nucleic acids extraction. Assuming viral recoveries of
    50 % reported previously for PMMoV using CIM (QA) 8 ml columns (Bačnik et al.,
    2020), the expected concentration factors would be close to 100x. The applicability
    of this concentration approach for investigating of plant virus diversity in environmental
    waters has been confirmed recently (Bačnik et al., 2020). RNA from elution fraction
    of each sample was extracted using two different protocols (QIAmp Viral RNA Mini
    kit (Qiagen, USA) and TRIzol LS (Invitrogen, USA)), and RNA from raw fraction
    only with QIAmp Viral RNA kit, with each batch accompanied by negative control
    of isolation (NCI, nuclease-free water used instead of sample). The detailed protocol
    is available in a previous published study (Bačnik et al., 2020). RNA extractions
    were done from 140 µL (for QIAmp Viral RNA kit) or from 250 µL (TRIzol LS protocol)
    of elution fraction, with final elution/resuspension of extracted RNA in 45 µL
    of nuclease free water. Before extraction using the QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit,
    samples, including NCI, were spiked with 2 ng of Luciferase Control RNA (LUC)
    (Promega, USA). These extracts were used for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
    analysis. TRIzol LS extracts were used for sequencing, wherein only the NCI was
    spiked with LUC RNA serving as negative control. The RNA extracts were stored
    at -80 °C until analysis. 2.3. RT-qPCR RNA extracted using QIAamp Viral RNA kit
    from raw and elution fraction were analysed using RT-qPCR for the targeted detection
    of three selected tobamoviruses, namely, pepper mild mottle virus (Tobamovirus,
    Virgaviridae, PMMoV), tomato mosaic virus (Tobamovirus, Virgaviridae, ToMV), and
    cucumber green mild mottle virus (Tobamovirus, Virgaviridae, CGMMV). For PMMoV
    and ToMV, both raw and elution fraction were tested, and for CGMMV, only the elution
    fraction was tested by RT-qPCR. In addition, an RT-qPCR assay specific for luciferase
    RNA was used to quantify LUC RNA that was spiked during the nucleic acid extraction
    step. Published primer/probe sets were used for all targets (PMMoV (Haramoto et
    al., 2013), ToMV (Boben et al., 2007), CGMMV (Zhao et al., 2015) and LUC (Toplak
    et al., 2004)). Each RT-qPCR reaction was performed with 2 µL of extracted RNA
    per reaction in a total reaction volume of 10 µL. RT-qPCR was performed using
    the AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Life Technologies, USA) on a 7900HT Fast
    Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA), using cycling parameters as recommended
    by the mastermix manufacturer. Samples were tested in duplicates and prepared
    as undiluted and 10-fold dilutions. A negative template control (nuclease-free
    water instead of the RNA) and a positive control (with known presence of the corresponding
    target virus) were included for each assay in each RT-qPCR analysis. Data were
    analysed in standalone software (SDS v4.0) with automatic setting of the baseline
    and threshold set up to a value of intersection between amplification curves at
    the exponential phase of the amplification, namely, 0.065 for PMMoV, 0.02 for
    ToMV, 0.15 for CGMMV and 0.15 for LUC assays. For the purpose of this study, we
    considered the qPCR result for a water sample as positive and, thus, detectable,
    if it resulted in at least one replicate with a positive amplification curve that
    was distinguishable from all replicates from all included negative controls (NTC
    and negative controls of extraction) and allowed calculation of Cq values. Cq
    values for LUC RNA were monitored in a control chart and extraction was considered
    successful if obtained Cq was within ± 3 standard deviations from the mean Cq
    value (data not showed). 2.4. Shotgun high-throughput sequencing (HTS) RNA isolates
    of each sample, along with 3 spiked NCIs (spiked with LUC RNA), all obtained by
    the TRIzol LS extraction protocol, were randomly pre-amplified according to the
    protocols described previously (Bačnik et al., 2020). The pre-amplification products
    were sent to SeqMatic LLC (Fremont, USA) for library preparation and sequencing.
    Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, USA) was used to prepare the sequencing
    libraries, which were shotgun-sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina,
    USA) in a 2 × 250 bp mode. 2.5. Analysis of HTS data 2.5.1. Data preparation After
    obtaining the raw sequencing data, sequencing reads were trimmed-off of sequencing
    adaptors and primer sequences from the pre-amplification step and filtered with
    a quality filter (Supplementary Information 1, S3) in CLC Genomics Workbench (CLC-GWB)
    (v. 20–22). Datasets were then normalized by random subsampling of each sample
    with the subsampling size equivalent to the lowest number of reads observed amongst
    the samples within the same year (Supplementary Information 1, S1). 2.5.2. Virome
    analysis focusing on plant viruses A general overview of metagenome and detection
    of known viruses was done by first exporting normalized reads subsets from CLC-GWB
    (v. 20–22) and comparing them for similarity to the entire NCBI nr database (v.
    237) using DIAMOND (v. 9.34) blastx (Buchfink et al., 2014) with default parameters.
    The results of the DIAMOND similarity searches were used as input for the taxonomic
    classification of reads using MEGAN (Metagenome analyzer, v. 6.20.16, May 2020
    database) (Huson et al., 2016) with the LCA algorithm (Supplementary Information
    1, S3). The obtained MEGAN outputs in the form of summarized reads were used to
    provide an overview of the taxonomic classification of the sequencing reads (Supplementary
    Information 1, S4). Additionally, viral reads binned on the level of order were
    used to determine the genome organisation (as denoted by International Committee
    on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) for each order (ICTV Report Chapters) and viral
    reads binned on the level of family were used to determine the expected host (as
    denoted by ICTV for each family (ICTV Report Chapters), data in Supplementary
    Information 1, S5, S6. Read classifications on different levels were visualized
    as bar plots using RStudio (v. 2021.09.0) and edited in Inkscape (v. 0.92). Information
    on classification of reads for each plant virus genus was exported from MEGAN
    as a BLAST table (Export→Matches). The table was further curated using a custom
    script (Supplementary Information 2) which classified reads that were assigned
    to a specific species up to the level of genus. For each genus, a specific identity
    cut-off value was used, employing the ICTV''s (ICTV Report Chapters) species demarcation
    criteria for that genus (Supplementary Information 1, S9). Data generated in this
    manner for each genus is summarized in Supplementary Information 1, S7. This way,
    we obtained the number of reads assigned per virus species and genera for each
    sample. Reads classifications for plant virus families, genera and species were
    visualized as bubble charts in RStudio (v. 2021.09.0) and edited in Inkscape (v.
    0.92). 2.5.3. Assembly of genomic sequences for new plant viruses Performed read
    classifications showed the possible presence of new plant virus species (e.g.,
    reads classified only at the genus level). Thus, we aimed to assemble genomic
    sequences of new viruses using two different approaches. In the first approach,
    all reads, assigned to the genus level for plant virus genera, which had over
    100 reads assigned in MEGAN, were de novo assembled in CLC-GWB (v. 20–22) (parameters
    in Supplementary Information 1, S3). After assembly, any contig longer than 500
    bp was checked using BLASTx against an entire NCBI nr database (v. 248). Contigs
    that did not match to a known virus and with percent identity above the species
    demarcation criterium (as listed by the ICTV (ICTV Report Chapters) for that genus
    were kept for further analysis. Such contigs were extended in Geneious Prime (v.
    2022.2) by iterative mapping of reads from the corresponding sample back to the
    contig until there was no more extension (parameters in Supplementary Information
    1, S3). Finally, all relevant contigs were checked for open reading frames (ORFs)
    in CLC-GWB (v. 20–22) to confirm the genome structure of complete or near-complete
    genomes of novel viruses. In the second approach, all reads (after normalisation)
    per sample were de novo assembled using SPAdes (v. 3.14) (Bankevich et al., 2012),
    and compared for similarity to an entire NCBI nr database (v. 237) using DIAMOND
    (v. 9.34) blastx (Buchfink et al., 2014) with default parameters. The results
    of the DIAMOND alignment were used as an input for the taxonomic classification
    of reads using MEGAN (v. 6.20.16, May 2020 database) (Huson et al., 2016). Contigs
    were manually inspected, and those matching plant viruses on the level of genus,
    but not matching a known virus on the level of species (based on the percent identity
    species demarcation) were extended in Geneious Prime (v. 2022.2) and checked for
    ORFs as described above. 2.5.4. Pairwise identity comparisons and phylogenetic
    analyses for putative new plant virus species For each genus that contained a
    putative novel virus, complete genome sequences or protein sequence of a specific
    gene (choice made based on the species demarcation criteria published by ICTV
    (ICTV Report Chapters) from selected members of the genus from the NCBI GenBank
    database and the sequences of the potential new viruses from this study were aligned
    in MEGA X (v. 10.0.5) (Kumar et al., 2018) using ClustalW with default parameters.
    These alignments were used in SDT (v. 1.2) (Muhire et al., 2014) to calculate
    pairwise identities using the software''s MUSCLE algorithm and were visualized
    in RStudio. Sequences of potentially novel viruses for which pairwise identities
    were below the species demarcation criteria for a corresponding genus (ICTV (ICTV
    Report Chapters) were further analysed. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using
    the amino acid sequence of RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene for selected
    known member species of that genus, new virus species discovered in this study,
    and an outgroup virus. The only exception is for Sobemovirus genus, where the
    complete genome nucleotide sequences were used instead. Outgroup viruses were
    selected from a different genus of the same virus family, following ICTV (ICTV
    Report Chapters) recommendations, where possible. The selected sequences were
    aligned in CLC-GWB (v. 20–22, Supplementary Information 1, S3), and the most conserved
    region was selected for phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Information 1, S8).
    This alignment was further trimmed using the ‘automated1’ method in trimAl (v.
    1.3) (Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using
    IQtree (v. 1.6.12) using the maximum-likelihood approach, with the selection of
    the most appropriate substitution models performed in the same software (Trifinopoulos
    et al., 2016) (Supplementary Information 1, S9). The phylogenetic trees were visualised
    in iTOL (v. 6.7) (Letunic and Bork, 2021). 2.5.5. Comparison of water viromes
    and viromes of surrounding plants In a parallel study (Rivarez et al., 2023) samples
    from tomatoes and surrounding weed plants, that were sampled simultaneously with
    water samples (same time, same location), were analysed for the presence of plant
    viruses. In order to compare viruses that were found in these plants to the viruses
    found in water samples, reads from each water sample were mapped using CLC-GWB
    (v. 20–22, parameters in Supplementary Information 1, S3) to a user-defined database
    consisting of all viral sequences detected in the analysed plants (a complete
    list of viruses detected in plants can be found in (Rivarez et al., 2023)). Occurrence
    of viruses detected both in water and plants, and abundance of reads corresponding
    to selected viruses found in water, were plotted on the map of the sampling locations
    using RStudio (v. 2021.09.0) and edited in Inkscape (v. 0.92). 2.5.6. Analysis
    of the genomic diversity of plantago tobamovirus 1 in water and plant samples
    Plantago tobamovirus 1 (Tobamovirus, Virgaviridae) (PTV1) was detected in Plantago
    major for the first time in a plant (Rivarez et al., 2023) at one of the sampled
    locations. Subsequent analysis showed its presence in water samples in various
    other locations covered in the study. To explore the variability of PTV1, contigs
    (generated using the second assembly approach, Section 2.5.3) from all samples
    that had > 90 % identity with PTV1 in BLASTn analysis against an entire NCBI nr
    database (v. 248) were aligned in CLC-GWB (V. 20–22, parameters in Supplementary
    Information 1, S3). Two longer genome parts in which several contigs overlapped,
    were used for further analysis (Supplementary Information 1, S9). Pairwise identities
    based on those two alignments were calculated using SDT (v. 1.2) (Muhire et al.,
    2014). In the next step, the two selected alignments were additionally aligned
    using the same algorithm to include ribgrass mosaic virus (Tobamovirus, Virgaviridae)
    as an outgroup. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from those assemblies using
    neighbour joining method in CLC-GWB (v.20–22, parameters in Supplementary Information
    S3, S9) and the leaves representing different consensus virus genomes were connected
    to corresponding locations on the map, using Inkscape (v. 0.92). 3. Results 3.1.
    Targeted detection confirms the efficiency of concentration approach and shows
    the presence of nucleic acids of pathogenic plant viruses in analysed water samples
    Each water sample was concentrated using the method described to increase the
    relative abundance of present viruses. The efficiency of concentration was tested
    by targeted qPCR for two selected viruses expected to be present in many samples.
    The method performed efficiently as seen from the reduction of Cq values from
    raw to elution fraction for PMMoV and ToMV (Supplementary Information 3, Fig.
    9). In the cases where Cq reduction could be calculated, it ranged from 1.8 to
    8.6. In addition, CGMMV was tested only in the elution fraction (Supplementary
    Information 1, S2). The Cq values obtained for the detected viruses (elution fraction)
    varied between Cq 36 and 20. ToMV was most abundantly present and detected in
    21 out of 22 samples, followed by CGMMV (18/22) and PMMoV (15/21). 3.2. The metagenome
    overview and the effect of the water source on the amount and diversity of detected
    plant virus sequences Taxonomic classification of reads was performed, to obtain
    a general overview of the metagenome of the concentrated water. A considerable
    proportion of reads (37.6–80.5 %, depending on the sample) did not provide matches
    in the used database. Bacteria accounted for the second largest proportion (5.9–58.8
    %), followed by eukaryotes (1.3–44.5 %). As for viral reads, they account for
    0.01 to 7.7 % reads per sample (Fig. 2a). Across the samples, we detected reads
    corresponding to all the genome organization types for viruses, with (-) ssRNA
    and dsRNA viruses being the least abundant (< 1 % of all viral reads for samples
    in which they were detected). We further focused on ssRNA viruses, since 75 %
    of known plant viruses have this genome organization (Bustamante and Hull, 1998).
    Per sample, between 0.6 and 95.6 % of reads assigned to viruses were indeed classified
    as ssRNA viruses. In addition, unclassified RNA viruses (which can have any variation
    of RNA genome organization) were the second most abundant group, accounting for
    0.3–60.4 % of viral reads per sample (Fig. 2b). High abundance of plant virus
    sequences was confirmed by looking at the number of viral reads binned by the
    expected host organism. In this analysis, in almost all samples, the majority
    of viral reads were assigned to viruses infecting bacteria and archaea (when excluding
    the wide host range/unclear category), followed by viruses infecting plants, fungi
    and protists. In the case of samples P-19–03, U-19–01 and R-19–13, plant/fungi/protist
    viruses are the most abundant subset (Fig. 2c). Download : Download high-res image

    viruses from a total of 20 families were detected across samples (Fig. 3). The
    most abundant viruses belonged to the Virgaviridae and Tombusviridae families,
    for which reads were detected in 19 out of 22 analysed samples (Fig. 3). We can
    observe a difference between surface water and underground water samples subgroups
    at this taxonomic level. For the surface water samples, the plant virus family
    richness (number of families detected per sample) ranged from 2 to 17, with the
    average number being 10. On the other hand, for the underground samples, the average
    number of detected families is 5 and in none of the samples we detected more than
    9 families (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (568KB) Download : Download

    for each sample is shown at the top of each panel. Similar trends can also be
    corroborated by the results of the targeted qPCR tests for three selected tobamoviruses
    (ToMV, PMMoV, CGMMV). A difference in both the number and signal strength for
    tested viruses was present between the two main water subtypes (surface water
    and underground water). In eight out of 13 surface water samples, all 3 targets
    were detected with the strongest signal recorded for ToMV in sample P-20–14 (Cq
    20). On the other hand, we did not detect all 3 viruses in any of the underground
    water samples and Cq values in these samples were above 25 (Supplementary Information
    1, S2). 3.3. Many known plant viruses were detected in analysed water samples
    We next looked further into the classification of the viral reads on the genus
    and species level to search for presence of known plant viruses in irrigation
    and other surface water samples. Reads corresponding to plant viruses from 18
    different genera were detected. All of the genera were found in the surface water
    samples, while only 12 of them were detected in underground water (Fig. 4, 5,
    Supplementary Information 1, S8). Reads assigned to Tobamovirus, Tombusvirus,
    and Sobemovirus genera were most abundant across samples. Download : Download

    that could not be classified to the level of species (because they were too divergent)

    sampling year: (a) 2019 and (b) 2020, due to the different subsampling size (listed
    next to the year designation). Overall, reads of 73 different plant virus species
    were detected (Supplementary Information 1, S8). Thirty-seven percent of detected
    viruses were present only in individual samples and 10 viruses had more than 100
    associated reads in an individual sample (Figs. 4 and 5, Supplementary Information
    1, S8). These viruses belong to the genus Aureusvirus (1 species), Tombusvirus
    (3 species) and Tobamovirus (6 species). Some of the species, detected in both
    surface and underground samples, include ToMV (detected in 14 out of 22 samples),
    Moroccan pepper virus (Tombusvirus, Tombusviridae) (11/22), tobacco mosaic virus
    (Tobamovirus, Virgaviridae) (11/10) and pelargonium leaf curl virus (Tombusvirus,
    Tombusviridae) (10/22). Although nearly all viruses were present in surface and
    underground water sources, exceptions exist, such as the case of rice yellow mottle
    virus (Sobemovirus, Solemoviridae) that was detected only in surface water, and
    the Rehmannia mosaic virus (Tobamovirus, Virgaviridae), detected only in underground
    water. 3.4. Virome analysis of water samples revealed new plant viruses present
    in the environment We assembled complete coding or near-complete genomes of seven
    new viruses spanning five different genera, obtained from five different water
    samples (Supplementary Information 1, S11). Complete coding genome sequences were
    reconstructed for three new viruses, and partial genome sequences, lacking one
    or more ORFs, were reconstructed for four new viruses. Partial genomes of three
    novel viruses from three different genera were obtained: Novo mesto aureusvirus
    1 (Aureusvirus, Tombusviridae), Gorica betanecrovirus 1 (Betanecrovirus, Tombusviridae),
    and Bericevo sobemovirus 1 (Sobemovirus, Solemoviridae) (Supplementary Information
    3, Figs. 1–3). Percent pairwise identities comparisons showed that each virus
    was below the species demarcation criteria for the corresponding genus (Supplementary
    Information 3, Figs. 4–6). Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we provided details
    on how the new viruses clustered within their genus in Supplementary Information
    3, Figs. 10–12. Besides the location from which original genomic sequences were
    reconstructed, all three viruses were detected also at some other locations by
    reads mapping with variable genome coverages (12–98 %) and coverage depth (0.1–13.51x)
    (Supplementary Information 1, S11). 3.5. Tombusvirus Partial genome sequence of
    Gorica tombusvirus 1 (Tombusvirus, Tombusviridae) (location 3, year 2019), lacking
    the movement protein and silencing suppressor ORFs, and complete genome sequence
    of Krkavce tombusvirus 1 (Tombusvirus, Tombusviridae) (location 13, year 2019)
    were reconstructed (Fig. 6). Percent pairwise identities for the amino acid sequence
    of coat protein (CP) showed that both new viruses have 80 % or less identity with
    other viruses in the genus, which is below the current species demarcation criteria
    (Fig. 6). Phylogenetic analysis including tombusviruses revealed that Gorica tombusvirus
    1 is not closely related to other tombusviruses, although its assignment to the
    genus is well supporter with bootstrap analysis, and that Krkavce tombusvirus
    1 is clustering with cucumber necrosis virus (Fig. 6). Besides the location from
    which original genomic sequences were reconstructed, the viruses were detected
    in 10 (Gorica tombusvirus 1) or 9 (Krkavce tombusvirus 1) other samples. The genome
    coverage in other samples varied from 16 to 94 % for Gorica tombusvirus 1 and
    5 to 91 % for Krkavce tombusvirus 1 (Supplementary Information 1, S11). Download

    structure of the two new tombusviruses with annotated predicted ORFs. 3.6. Tobamovirus
    Two complete novel tobamovirus genome sequences were reconstructed, Gorica tobamovirus
    1 (Tobamovirus, Virgaviridae) (location 4, year 2019) and Bertoki tobamovirus
    1 (Tobamovirus, Virgaviridae) (location 17, year 2020). Both viruses show genome
    composition and organisation typical of tobamoviruses (Fig. 7a). Percentage pairwise
    identity comparisons based on complete genome nucleotide sequence revealed that
    both viruses have pairwise percent identities with other tobamoviruses lower than
    the species demarcation criteria (Supplementary Information 3, Fig. 7). Phylogenetic
    analysis showed that Bertoki mosaic virus 1 is clustered (with high bootstrap
    support) in the subclade containing ribgrass mosaic virus and related viruses.
    Consistent with the results of the pairwise identity comparisons, Bertoki tobamovirus
    1 is most closely related to PTV1. Gorica tobamovirus 1 represents more divergent
    branch on the tree, which still clusters with the same bigger subclade within
    the genus (Fig. 7b). Besides the location from which original genomic sequences
    were reconstructed, the viruses were detected in 9 (Gorica tobamovirus 1) or 6
    (Bertoki tobamovirus 1) other samples. The genome coverage in other samples varied
    from 6 to 85 % for Gorica tobamovirus 1 and from 8 to 99 % for Bertoki tobamovirus
    1 (Supplementary Information 1, S11). Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    a recently published parallel study, we analysed samples of tomato and weed plants
    from the same locations as the water samples used in this study, to detect plant
    viruses (Rivarez et al., 2023). Here, we now compared viruses found in plants
    and in water to see if there were any overlaps in detection (e.g., year, location,
    region). A total of 14 viruses and 2 satellite viruses were detected in both plant
    and water samples, disregarding the location and sampling year (Supplementary
    Information 1, S10). Out of those 16, four are not associated with plants as hosts,
    another four are new viruses detected for the first time in the previously mentioned
    plant virome study and the remaining 6 viruses and 2 satellite viruses are previously
    known to infect plants. Five plant viruses, (olive latent virus 1 (Alphanecrovirus,
    Tombusviridae), white clover mosaic virus (Potexvirus, Alphaflexiviridae), ToMV,
    and tomato bushy stunt virus (Tombusvirus, Tombusviridae), with tomato bushy stunt
    virus satellite RNA B10), were detected in both plant and water samples at the
    same location, at the same sampling time (Fig. 8a). Instances of plant virus detection
    in both water and plant samples were observed in 3 out of 4 regions. However,
    the regional distribution of viruses detected in plants that were also detected
    in water varied, from detection in water in all 4 regions (i.e., ToMV), to detection
    in only one (i.e., olive latent virus), (Fig. 8b). Additionally, the 4 new plant
    viruses, which we detected and reconstructed from water for the first time in
    this study, were not found only in single samples; we were able to detect their
    nucleic acids in several different samples across the sampled sites (Supplementary
    Information 1, S11). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    of water samples informs us about the diversity of a recently discovered virus
    To further explore the potential of the obtained water virome data we performed
    a more in-depth genomic analysis of a selected plant virus, a recently discovered
    PTV1, which was detected in several analysed water samples. A total of eight partial
    consensus genomic sequences with highest similarity to this virus from seven different
    water sampling locations, collected across two years, were reconstructed and compared
    against each other and with the original virus genomic sequence reported from
    a plant (Rivarez et al., 2023). Four of them covered the partial genomic sequence
    including ORF coding for RdRp and six partial genomic sequence including ORF coding
    for CP. Pairwise identities of sequences ranged from 89 to 99 % (Supplementary
    Information 3) and phylogenetic analysis revealed clustering of isolates in subgroups
    (Fig. 9) for both alignments. Sequence obtained from the plant clustered together
    with a sequence obtained from the water in the same region, in both analyses (Fig.
    9). Phylogenetic analysis for partial RdRp included four water-derived sequences,
    all from the western region of the country, and revealed two subclusters amongst
    them. Phylogenetic analysis for partial CP included six water-derived sequences
    and revealed several subclusters corresponding with geographic location of samples:
    sequences from the western part of the country clustered together and sequences
    from central and eastern part of the country formed a separated divergent cluster.

    The quality of irrigation water can play a vital role in the health and productivity
    of agricultural crops. The Presence of plant viruses in water has been known for
    a long time (Koenig, 1986), and interest in their presence in irrigation water
    is slowly increasing. This study described a comprehensive virome analysis that
    explored the diversity of plant viruses in irrigation water. Shotgun HTS analysis,
    that was applied to water samples, shed light on the viral abundance and diversity
    within the samples. Viral reads accounted for around 1 % of all reads, comparable
    to previously reported results (Bačnik et al., 2020; Lopez-Roblero et al., 2020).
    Although the sample preparation used here aimed at concentrating RNA sequences,
    we observed all possible variations of viral genome types within each sample.
    With this amount of data, we were able to detect members of 20 viral families
    infecting plants. There is a notable difference in both abundance and richness
    of detected viral families between surface and underground water sources, which
    can implicate diverse water quality for irrigation purposes. Two most abundantly
    present plant virus families in our samples, Virgaviridae and Tombusviridae, are
    frequently detected in aqueous environments (Bačnik et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,
    2023; Duarte et al., 2023). Member species of both families have experimentally
    been shown to retain infectivity in extreme conditions, such as the human gastrointestinal
    tract (Zhang et al., 2005). Therefore, their abundant presence in water in comparison
    to less stable viruses is consistent with previous results. Individual species
    from these families are considered an economical threat to various agriculturally
    important plant species, mainly from Solanaceae family (e.g., ToMV in tomato).
    Out of 73 plant viruses detected in this study, ToMV was the most frequently and
    abundantly detected virus throughout the samples. Using HTS-based water virome
    analysis we were able not only to detect a wide variety of known plant viruses
    that circulate in the environment, but also discover new plant viruses. Few instances
    of the discovery of novel plant viruses in water samples exist prior the use of
    HTS. For example, Sikte waterborne virus, was first detected by inoculation of
    test plants with water from Sikte river in Germany (Uehara-Ichiki et al., 2021).
    However, it took another 15 years for its detection in plants outside the laboratory
    and a few more years to obtain its complete genome (Uehara-Ichiki et al., 2021).
    By analysing the sequence data obtained from water samples in this study we were
    able to discover seven new virus species from five different plant virus genera,
    reconstruct their complete or near-complete genomes, and show their presence in
    several water samples, often in different regions. Within this study we were able
    to leverage previously available information on plant viromes from the same sampling
    locations (Rivarez et al., 2023). This enabled us to conduct a pioneering approach
    to compare the presence and abundance of plant viruses both in water and in plants
    within same agroecosystems. For example, by comparing the detection instances
    in water with detection in tomatoes (Rivarez et al., 2023), we observed a simultaneous
    detection of ToMV in both sample types for location 1 (Fig. 8b). At the time of
    sampling, a large-scale outbreak of ToMV in tomato was observed in one of the
    greenhouses at the tomato farm that comprises this location. This implies the
    possible use of water testing for the surveillance of plant virus outbreaks, since
    the viruses can be released from the plants into the environment. Proposed routes
    of virus transmission from infected plants to the environment can include release
    of infective virions from roots of plants growing near a water body, injured or
    decaying plant material or any kind of surface wash-off able to bring contaminated
    plants, but also nematodes or fungal spores into the waterways and wider environment
    (Mehle and Ravnikar, 2012). This concept was to some extent already explored in
    our previous research, where we showed that tomato brown rugose fruit virus (Tobamovirus,
    Virgaviridae), a damaging tomato pathogen, can be detected in water in experimental
    hydroponics system and in drain water from commercial greenhouses, when plants
    are infected (Mehle et al., 2023). As we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic,
    wastewater monitoring schemes proved their applicability as an early warning system
    (Shah et al., 2022). It is likely that a well-positioned (irrigation) water monitoring
    scheme can provide similar benefits in the context of managing plant health. The
    detection of ToMV and only few other viruses in both plants and water samples
    from the same location and year (Fig. 8a) might indicate that this pattern can
    be observed only if there is a high virus infection burden in the planted crops,
    however, additional studies are needed to discern directionality of virus flow
    between plants and water environments. In total, we detected 16 viruses that were
    previously found in plants at sampled locations (Rivarez et al., 2023), and also
    in water. However, most often they were not found in water at the same location
    or at the same sampling time as in plants. In many water samples, where virus
    reads counts were low and same viruses were not detected in nearby plants, deducing
    the connection between the plants and water was not possible. Nevertheless, detection
    of plant viruses in water can have several important implications. For example,
    the detection of an important plant pathogen (e.g., a virus on quarantine list
    for a region) in water samples can motivate increased survey for the virus in
    nearby host plants or intensified research on the characteristics of such viruses
    in the environment (Mehle et al., 2023). Moreover, as we have demonstrated in
    this study, water virome data can rapidly provide a wealth of information about
    possible distribution of known and newly discovered viruses in the environment.
    For example, white clover mosaic virus was detected in plant virome analysis in
    a single plant sample on studied locations, however, addition of data from water
    analysis indicated much wider distribution of virus in the environment, since
    it was detected in nearly all water samples, covering all analysed regions (Fig.
    8c). However, this study also highlights the limitations of using water samples
    as a proxy for distribution of plant viruses, as the lack of detection in water
    does not guarantee lack of detection in plants, as in the example of olive latent
    virus 1, which was detected at seven different locations in plants, but at only
    one in water (Fig. 8a). These discrepancies can be expected, due to difference
    in recovery of viruses when isolating viruses from different matrices, and also
    due to many other factors, such as virus titre in plants, abundance and distributions
    of host plants, and virus stability in the environment, which would all affect
    the possible presence, abundance and spread of different viruses in environment.
    HTS-based virome studies result in large sequence datasets that can be further
    exploited to study not only presence, but also diversity of viruses in a region
    under study. In this study, we demonstrated that water virome data can bring extensive
    additional insights into diversity of recently discovered viruses, for which limited
    information is available. Plantago tobamovirus 1 was recently discovered in a
    single plant sample (Rivarez et al., 2023) at one of our sampling locations. Here,
    we detected it in multiple water samples, covering all regions under study. We
    reconstructed partial consensus genome sequences of this virus from several water
    samples and confirmed notable genetic diversity within the species. Moreover,
    clustering of isolates derived from water virome data largely matched the geographic
    distribution of sampled waters. Thus, having only a single occurrence and genomic
    information about the virus from its plant host, using water virome data, we discovered
    that virus is widespread and genetically diversified in the studied ecosystems.
    Interestingly, closely related tobamovirus from the ribgrass mosaic virus subgroup
    was isolated from river water from Hungary in 1986 (Juretic et al., 1986). Together
    with results from this study, this opens interesting questions about the wide
    presence and survival of these viruses and abundance of their hosts in ecosystems,
    likely close to the surface water bodies. Within the irrigation water virome study
    presented here, we obtained rich information about the presence of plant viruses
    in the region (also for some that were previously not reported in the country).
    We demonstrated usability of environmental water virome analysis as a tool for
    studying the diversity and ecology of plant viruses, as well as for the discovery
    of novel virus species. In contrast to more traditional plant virus surveillance
    targeting host plants, water virome analysis allows monitoring of a larger area
    with a single sample and might provide early warning prior to large outbreaks
    in agroecosystems. Additional research should be focused on assessing the biological
    relevance of new viruses found in environmental irrigation waters and to study
    the directionality of spread between viruses found in water and plant components
    of the ecosystem. Moreover, HTS-based analysis of irrigation waters can be employed
    to study within-species diversity of plant viruses and detect potentially emergent
    virus variants that could represent threat for global plant health. 5. Conclusions
    • HTS-based virome analysis of irrigation and other surface water sources demonstrated
    the presence of a wide range of plant viruses in the regions under study, with
    environmentally stable viruses, such as tobamoviruses and tombusviruses, being
    the most abundantly detected in the analysed water sources. • Notable differences
    in both abundance and richness of plant virus nucleic acids were observed between
    different water types, where surface water samples in general had higher count
    of plant viruses present in higher abundance, which might imply different quality
    of investigated water types. • The information obtained from water virome analysis
    allowed us to detect both known viruses previously not found in an area and new
    virus species, which overall provided us with a clearer understanding of environmental
    presence of a given virus and its diversity in the agroecosystem. • Understanding
    the presence and diversity of plant viruses in irrigation water might be an contributing
    factor in ensuring effective management of plant health in future. Water virome
    analysis was shown here to be a important tool for the surveillance and discovery
    of known and new plant viruses in a wider environment. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: 'Objectives: This study was conducted to identify the mosquito species
    and the physicochemical characteristics of their breeding sites in six districts
    in El-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt, during October and November 2020. Methods: Using
    the dipping method, mosquito larvae were collected from forty-two different breeding
    sites, including irrigation channels, canals, agricultural puddles, sewage tanks,
    stagnant water puddles, and swamps. Water temperature, pH, alkalinity, nitrite,
    chloride, electrical conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) were
    measured for all the studied breeding sites. Results: The survey revealed the
    presence of nine mosquito species: Culex perexiguus (Theobald, 1901), Culex pipiens
    (Linnaeus, 1758), Culex antennatus (Becker, 1903), Culex theileri (Theobald, 1903),
    Anopheles multicolor (Cambouliu, 1902), Anopheles sergentii (Theobald, 1907),
    Ochlerotatus caspius (Pallas, 1771), Culiseta longiareolata (Macquart, 1838),
    and Uranotaenia ungiculata (Edwards, 1913), representing five genera. Out of these
    species, Cx. pipiens is the most abundant. Oc. caspius and Cx. antennatus revealed
    significant positive correlations with chloride, TDS, and EC. Cx. perexiguus only
    showed significant positive correlations with chloride. Conclusion: Most of the
    recorded mosquito species are found to be able to tolerate different degrees of
    pollution in their breeding water. These data may contribute to establishing a
    database on mosquito vectors and their habitats and, hence, assist in planning
    and implementing the appropriate control measures in this region.'

    channels, canals, agricultural puddles, sewage tanks, stagnant water puddles,
    and swamps. Water temperature, pH, alkalinity, nitrite, chloride, electrical conductivity
    (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured for all the studied breeding
    sites. Results The survey revealed the presence of nine mosquito species: Culex
    perexiguus (Theobald, 1901), Culex pipiens (Linnaeus, 1758), Culex antennatus
    (Becker, 1903), Culex theileri (Theobald, 1903), Anopheles multicolor (Cambouliu,
    1902), Anopheles sergentii (Theobald, 1907), Ochlerotatus caspius (Pallas, 1771),
    Culiseta longiareolata (Macquart, 1838), and Uranotaenia ungiculata (Edwards,
    1913), representing five genera. Out of these species, Cx. pipiens is the most
    abundant. Oc. caspius and Cx. antennatus revealed significant positive correlations
    with chloride, TDS, and EC. Cx. perexiguus only showed significant positive correlations
    with chloride. Conclusion Most of the recorded mosquito species are found to be
    able to tolerate different degrees of pollution in their breeding water. These
    data may contribute to establishing a database on mosquito vectors and their habitats
    and, hence, assist in planning and implementing the appropriate control measures
    in this region. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords MosquitoesBreeding

    dissolved solids 1. Introduction Mosquitoes are globally undesirable arthropods
    as they are known vectors of many parasitic diseases like malaria and filaria,
    and viral diseases like Rift Valley fever, dengue fever, and yellow fever (Wilkerson
    et al., 2021). Mosquito vectors transmit more than 17.0 percent of mosquito-borne
    diseases globally and kill more than 700,000 people annually (WHO, 2020). In Egypt,
    the most common mosquito-borne diseases include dengue fever, Rift Valley fever,
    West Nile fever, and Filariasis, which have been transmitted by Cx. pipiens and
    Cx. perexiguus for decades (Meegan et al., 1980, Darwish and Hoogstraal, 1981,
    Weil et al., 1999). Moreover, An. sergentii and Anopheles pharoensis are considered
    malaria vectors, while An. multicolor is suspected as a possible vector (Kenawy,
    1988). El-Fayoum governorate is distinct from the Oasis, the Delta, and Upper
    Egypt. It is distinguished by gradually decreasing elevation and being lower than
    sea level. There are 1.2 million people are living there, the majority of whom
    work in agriculture and allied businesses. The season for the spread of diseases
    has been extended to eight months a year, from the end of March to the end of
    November, due to the ideal temperature and relative humidity. (Bassiouny, 2001,
    Bassiouny, 1996). In the period from 1971 to 2001 and 2004 to 2010, imported cases
    of malaria (from Sudan and other African nations) were reported (Dahesh and Mostafa,
    2015). Therefore, continuous monitoring of mosquito populations is important for
    figuring out their biodiversity as well as for predicting and preventing mosquito-borne
    diseases (van der Beek et al., 2020). Breeding habitats can be either artificial
    or natural, and they can also be categorized based on their stability as temporary,
    permanent, or semi-permanent (Hassan et al., 2020). Locations with stagnant water
    are favorable for mosquito reproduction and the development of their larvae (Ibrahim
    et al., 2011). Moreover, breeding habitats usually contain different types of
    vegetation, whether they are natural or cultivated, dense or sparse, and submerged
    or merged (Sowilem et al., 2017). It is proven that mosquitoes prefer habitats
    with short vegetation over those with tall vegetation (Chirebvu and Chimbari,
    2015). The physicochemical parameters have a significant impact on the species,
    density, and development of mosquito larvae and vary between the breeding sites
    (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2013, Nikookar et al., 2017). These parameters include
    temperature, pH, dissolved organic and inorganic materials, salinity, turbidity,
    and electrical conductivity (EC) (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2013, Kenawy et al.,
    2013, Elhawary et al., 2020). In this regard, the temperature should not exceed
    30 °C for ideal larval development (Ibrahim et al., 2011). Many studies were conducted
    to determine the alkaline tendency (pH) of mosquito larvae (Abdel-Hamid et al.,
    2011a, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011b, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011c, Hassan et al., 2020,
    Ukubuiwe et al., 2020), and An. culicifacies larval abundance was found to have
    a negative correlation with pH in the range of 6 to 7 (Varun et al., 2013). Cx.
    modestus prefers habitats with higher salinity levels compared to An. maculipennis
    (Golding et al., 2015), while Cx. pusillus, Oc. caspius, and Oc. detritus prefer
    habitats with high levels of salinity (El-Hefni et al., 2020a, El-Hefni et al.,
    2020b). Moreover, Nagy et al., (2021) reported a connection between the abundance
    of Cx. pusillus and Cx. theileri and the salinity of their habitats. Nitrite levels
    are usually high in seepage, agricultural drains (Nagy et al., 2021), and irrigation
    ditches (Elhawary et al., 2020). Cx. pipiens, Oc. caspius, and Cs. longiareolata
    larvae favor habitats with low levels of nitrite (about 0.6 mg/l); however, Cx.
    perexiguus and Cx. pusillus tolerate higher levels (up to 25 mg/l) (Kenawy et
    al., 2013). Seepage habitats display the highest values of TDS and EC (El-Hefni
    et al., 2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b). Armigeres and Culex larvae were collected
    from breeding sites with EC values greater than 10 µs/cm, while for Aedes larvae,
    the value ranged from 5 to 10 µs/cm. Culex spp. larval abundance increased as
    water EC increased. For example, Armigeres subalbatus and Cx. quinquefasciatus
    were found in water with a broad range of TDS (Amarasing and Dalpadado, 2014).
    In addition, Cx. pipiens larval abundance was linked with the EC, TDS, alkalinity,
    and chloride content of its habitat (Nikookar et al., 2017). Understanding the
    environmental characteristics of mosquito breeding sites as well as their prevalence
    has been demonstrated to be a successful strategy in reducing mosquito-borne diseases
    (Knudsen and Slooff, 1992, Killeen et al., 2002, El-Hefni et al., 2020a, El-Hefni
    et al., 2020b). Therefore, the association between mosquito prevalence and the
    physicochemical parameters of their breeding sites would help in predicting mosquito
    distribution and abundance. Fayoum governorate has unique topographic and climatic
    characteristics that encourage the proliferation of mosquitoes, which raises the
    likelihood of transmitting mosquito-borne disease. In the current study, mosquito
    diversity and prevalence in correlation with the physicochemical characteristics
    of their breeding sites were investigated in six administrative districts in Fayoum
    governorate. This may contribute to implementing appropriate mosquito vector control
    protocols as well as enriching the database of the mosquito community in this
    region. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sites of study This study was conducted
    during October and November 2020 in El-Fayoum Governorate (30° 23′, 31° 05′, E,
    29° 02′, 29° 35′, N) (Fig. 1). This Egyptian governorate has a total area of 6,068.7
    km2 and a population of 3,983,912 (Egypt-statistics, 2023). The governorate is
    a depression in the western desert of Egypt, about 90 km southwest of Cairo. It
    is considered a large agricultural oasis as it is fed by the River Nile through
    the Baher Youssef stream, which penetrates the governorate from the eastern side
    and then divides into several estuaries before flowing into Qaroun Lake on the
    northwest side of it. The governorate is composed of six administrative districts:
    Sinnoris, Tamia, El-Fayoum, Atssa, Ebshawai, and Youssef El-Sedik (Abd-Elmabod
    et al., 2012). Download : Download high-res image (312KB) Download : Download

    districts (A) and its location in Egypt (B). 2.2. Larval collection Forty-two
    breeding sites, including canals, sewage tanks, agricultural puddles, stagnant
    water puddles, and swamps, were used to gather larvae (Fig. 2). Larvae were collected
    by the dipping method according to (Ahmed et al., 2011) using suitable larval
    nets of a 20 cm in diameter iron ring attached to a 30 cm long muslin sleeve.
    Several varied dips (based on the width and depth of the breeding site) were gently
    taken from the surface. Larvae from each site were collected and transported alive
    to the laboratory in 500 ml plastic cups filled with the breeding site water.

    and F): sewage tank. 2.3. Physicochemical analysis In each site, the pH and temperature
    were determined on-site using the HANNA HI 8314 portable device (HANNA Instruments,
    USA) according to the manufacturer’s manual. A sample of 500 ml of water was collected
    from each breeding site and sent to the laboratory to be tested for total dissolved
    solids (TDS) (mg/L), alkalinity (mg/L), chloride (Cl‾) (mg/L), electrical conductivity
    (EC) (µS/cm), and nitrite (NO2) (mg/l). Alkalinity and chloride concentrations
    were measured using the titration technique, TDS and EC were determined using
    a conductivity/TDS meter (HACH, HQ440d multi) (HACH Company, Europe), and nitrite
    was detected using a spectrophotometer (analytic Jena, SPECORD*50 PLUS) (Analytic
    Jena AG, Germany). All analyses were conducted according to Eaton et al., (2014).
    2.4. Larval identification Collected larvae were prepared for identification,
    according to Ahmed et al., (2011). The fourth larval instars were preserved in
    70 % alcohol until primarily examined and identified using the keys developed
    by (Abdel-Maleck, 1956, Mattingly and Knight, 1956, Harbach, 1988). In addition,
    larval density in each breeding site was calculated by dividing the number of
    collected larvae by the number of dips (number of larvae per dip). 2.5. Analysis
    of data Data were processed for statistical analysis using SPSS (version 26) and
    Microsoft Excel worksheets (Microsoft Office 2010) for Windows. Descriptive statistics
    were used to calculate the abundance percentage of each mosquito species collected
    from each district in the study area. Line charts were drawn to depict the physicochemical
    parameters. The mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated to show ranges
    within all sites. The connection between the density of larvae and the physicochemical
    parameters of their habitats was determined by using Pearson correlation analysis
    (significant at P ≤ 0.05). 3. Results The 2559 collected larvae were classified
    into nine species belonging to five genera. These larvae were collected from 42
    breeding sites in Fayoum governorate. As shown in Fig. 3, the overall relative
    distribution of each mosquito species varies among the studied breeding sites.
    The current study found that Culex is the most prevalent genus in the studied
    area, constituting 72.6 % (1858 larvae) of the total collected samples. Cx. pipiens
    is the most abundant species, accounting for 51.2 % (1311 larvae), followed by
    Cx. antennatus, 15.1 % (386 larvae), Cx. perexiguus, 5.3 % (135 larvae), and Cx.
    theileri, 1 % (of 26 larvae). Oc. caspius comes next and accounts for 24.8 % (635
    larvae), followed by Anopheles multicolor, which accounts for 1.5 % (38 larvae),
    and An. sergentii, which accounts for 0.3 % (8 larvae), while Ur. unguiculata
    accounts for only 0.7 % (17 larvae). Cu. longiareolata was the scarcest species,
    with only 3 larvae encountered, which constitute 0.1 % of the total collected

    was also the most abundant species in the irrigation canals, and additionally,
    it was the only species collected from sewage tanks. Results also revealed that
    Oc. caspius was the most abundant in stagnant water puddles and swamps. On the
    other hand, other species were less abundant and varied among the different types
    of habitats. Download : Download high-res image (177KB) Download : Download full-size

    variations in species distribution in the studied districts (Table 1). Within
    the breeding habitats, canals were the most frequent type, followed by stagnant
    water puddles, which were noticeably found within residential areas. Generally,
    the current study observed that breeding sites with higher larval densities were
    near houses and sheds. Most of the breeding habitats were not or partially shaded,
    with varied depth and size. Grasses, as well as small to medium plants, were observed
    growing in water bodies, while a few of the breeding sites that contained large
    plants had very low larval densities. It was also noticeable that residential
    garbage was spreading in stagnant water puddles and canals. Table 1. Mosquito

    variation amongst the breeding sites (Table 2 and Fig. 5). Results revealed variation
    in temperature from 19 °C to 29.8 °C, and the pH varied from acidic to alkaline
    (5.5 to 9.2), with a mean value of 7.97 (alkaline tendency) (Table 2). Oc. caspius
    and Cx. pipiens were the only two species recorded in the breeding sites at pH
    5.5 (acidic medium). It was also noticeable that the TDS and EC were high in the
    habitats that contained seepage water. Moreover, data showed a link between larval
    relative abundance and physicochemical parameters in the governorate. As shown
    in Table 3, mosquito larvae tolerated a wide range of temperatures in different
    habitats. Additionally, all larval species showed an alkaline tendency. The larvae
    of An. sergentii showed the highest intolerance to nitrite concentrations, while
    Oc. caspius showed the highest tolerance to the higher values of TDS and EC concentrations.

    positive correlation between the prevalence of both Oc. caspius and Cx. antennatus
    and EC, Cl‾, and TDS (P < 0.05) as tabulated in Table 4 using Pearson correlation,
    while data revealed a negative correlation between the same species and pH and
    NO2 (P > 0.05). In the same regard, Cx. pipiens showed negative correlations with
    pH, EC, Cl‾, and TDS (P > 0.05). The occurrences of Cx. perexiguus showed a positive
    correlation with Cl‾ only (P < 0.05). Other than that, the correlations between
    other species and those parameters can’t be established since they were encountered
    in small numbers at limited sites. Table 4. Pearson Correlation* between larval

    mosquito relative abundance and their habitats’ physicochemical parameters as
    well as to update the database of mosquito prevalence in El-Fayoum Governorate,
    Egypt. This governorate is unique in that its geography is distinct in nature
    from Upper Egypt and the Oasis. In addition to its relatively lower altitude near
    sea level and the gradual inclination of its topography from southeast to northwest,
    it also has a population of about 1.20 million people, most of whom work in farming
    fields and agriculture (Bassiouny, 1996). In this area, the transmission season
    of mosquito-borne diseases is extended to 8 months every year (from March to November);
    this is unfortunately due to the moderate climate and higher relative humidity
    (CLIMATE DATA, 2023). These constitute very convenient conditions to encourage
    mosquito breeding and prevalence (El-Hefni et al., 2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b).
    As a result, the governorate has been designated as a dangerous area for mosquito-borne
    diseases such as malaria, filaria, Rift Valley, and dengue fevers (Meegan et al.,
    1980, Darwish and Hoogstraal, 1981, Bassiouny, 2001, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011a,
    Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011b, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011c, Dahesh and Mostafa, 2015,
    El-Hefni et al., 2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b, Gaber et al., 2022), compared
    to the rest of the governorates in Egypt. Nine larval species were identified
    in the forty-two breeding sites of the targeted six administrative districts:
    An. multicolor, An. sergentii, Oc. caspius, Cx. pipiens, Cx. antennatus, Cx. theileri,
    Cx. perexiguus, Cu. longiareolata, and Ur. ungiculata. These mosquito species
    belong to five genera: Culex, Anopheles, Culiseta, Aedes, and Uranotaenia. These
    genera are the most common in Egypt, and the majority of them are important vectors
    for both human and animal diseases (Harbach et al., 1988, Dahesh and Mostafa,
    2015, El-Hefni et al., 2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b). This study recorded more
    than one species that had not been recorded in this governorate during the last
    20 years. For example, Mostafa et al., (2002) surveyed the Sinnuris district but
    didn’t record Cx. theileri, Cx. perexiguus, Oc. caspius, or Ur. ungiculata. Selim
    and Hammad (2019) surveyed the Wadi Al-Rian national reserve but didn’t detect
    Cx. theileri, Oc. caspius, Cu. longiareolata, or Ur. ungiculata. El-Hefni et al.,
    2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b surveyed the six districts of the governorate but
    didn’t detect Cx. antennatus, Cx. theileri, Cu. longiareolata, or Ur. ungiculata.
    Eltaly et al., (2022) surveyed the four sites belonging to three districts (Tamiya,
    Youssef El-Sedik, and Abshway) but didn’t detect Cx. theileri, Cx. perexiguus,
    An. multicolor, Ur. ungiculata, or Cu. longiareolata. This study provides evidence
    that Cx. pipiens is the most abundant species throughout the governorate, especially
    in Abshway district. It is also abundant in many other Egyptian governorates,
    such as El-Sharqiya (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2009), El-Gharbia (Abdel-Hamid et al.,
    2011a, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011b, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011c), El-Menoufia (Abdel-Hamid
    et al., 2011a, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011b, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011c), Qalyubiya
    (Ibrahim et al., 2011), Ismailia (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011a, Abdel-Hamid et al.,
    2011b, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011c), Cairo (Kenawy et al., 2013), Suez Canal zone
    (Sowilem et al., 2017, El-Hefni et al., 2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b), and Giza
    (Nagy et al., 2021). Similar observations were recorded in El-Fayoum governorate
    (Selim; Hammad 2019, El-Hefni et al., 2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b, Eltaly et
    al., 2022). We may attribute this high prevalence of Cx. pipiens to its ability
    to tolerate extreme water conditions, such as wide ranges of temperature, alkalinity,
    nitrite, and pH prevailing in their breeding habitats. This maximizes the risk
    of frequent incidences of dangerous epidemics of mosquito-borne diseases in Egypt,
    like lymphatic filariasis (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011a, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011b,
    Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011c), West Nile virus, Sindbis viruses, Rift Valley fever,
    and St. Louis encephalitis (Turell, 2012). Our data also showed that Oc. caspius
    and Cx. antennatus are the 2nd and 3rd most abundant species throughout El-Fayoum
    governorate, respectively, especially in Tamiya and Atssa districts, respectively.
    They were also recorded in other districts in the governorate (El-Hefni et al.,
    2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b, Eltaly et al., 2022) and throughout several other
    Egyptian governorates (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011a, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011b, Abdel-Hamid
    et al., 2011c, Ibrahim et al., 2011, Ibrahim et al., 2011, Kenawy et al., 2013,
    Ibrahim et al., 2011, Sowilem et al., 2017, Selim; Hammad 2019, El-Hefni et al.,
    2020a, El-Hefni et al., 2020b). Cx. perexiguus, An. multicolor, Cx. theileri,
    Ur. unguiculata, An. sergentii, and Cu. longiareolata, were the least abundant
    in the six targeted districts. These mosquito species were also recorded in other
    governorates in Egypt (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2009, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011a, Abdel-Hamid
    et al., 2011b, Abdel-Hamid et al., 2011c, Ibrahim et al., 2011, Elhawary et al.,
    2020). Urbanization is one of the major factors that greatly affects mosquito
    breeding in their natural habitats (Knudsen and Slooff, 1992). In this context,
    most of the collected specimens were encountered in canals and stagnant water
    puddles that were found next to residential areas. These breeding habitats were
    filled with water associated with human activities and garbage. This leads us
    to conclude with confidence that the presence of bad sanitation practices in many
    of the residential areas in the region and the lack of social awareness among
    locals appear to be responsible for mosquito reproduction and prevalence. Furthermore,
    in agreement with Chirebvu and Chimbari (2015), the current study proved that
    mosquitoes in general prefer breeding sites with vegetation consisting of small
    to medium plants and grasses compared to sites that contained heavy and tall plants.
    The physicochemical characteristics of mosquito breeding habitats also greatly
    affect mosquito breeding in their sites (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2013, Alkhayat
    et al., 2020, Elhawary et al., 2020). The results of the current study showed
    a range of the breeding sites’ temperatures from 19.0 °C to 29.8 °C, with a mean
    of 23.92 °C, which is favorable for mosquito development (Loetti et al., 2011,
    Mamai et al., 2018). Similar to Salit et al., (1996), our data showed a pH range
    from 5.5 to 9.2, and only one site displayed acidic habitat (pH 5.5) which contained
    Culex pipiens and O. caspius larvae. Ukubuiwe et al., (2020) proved that mosquito
    larval development is faster at pH 7, but slower at acidic (pH 4) or extreme alkaline
    (pH 10). High contents of nitrite and nitrate also greatly affect mosquito breeding
    in their habitats (Laird, 1988), and similar to Salit et al., (1996) we recorded
    mosquitoes in sites with a wide range of nitrite concentrations. Data also showed
    a high concentration of TDS and EC in the types of habitats that contained seepage
    water, and that Oc. caspius and the majority of culicine larvae were recorded
    in these habitats. Most of these sites were puddles next to houses that contained
    seepage and sewage water, which, in fact, may indicate that these species prefer
    this type of habitat. Thus, we could conclude that mosquito larvae can tolerate
    different degrees of pollution, as reported by several studies (Salit et al.,
    1996, Ibrahim et al., 2011, Nagy et al., 2021). On the other hand, Anopheline
    species could not tolerate these polluted habitats, as shown in our results and
    by Oringanje et al., (2011). 5. Conclusion This study investigated 42 breeding
    sites for mosquitoes in Fayoum governorate and reported nine mosquito species.
    Out of them, C. pipiens was the most abundant species. Cx. theileri, Cu. longiareolata,
    and Ur. ungiculata were recorded in El-Fayoum Governorate for the first time during
    the last 30 years. The water temperature at all breeding sites ranged from 19.0
    to 29.8 °C. The concentrations of NO2 (mg/L), Cl- (mg/L), alkalinity (mg/L), TDS
    (mg/L), and EC varied between the different habitats. The TDS and EC values were
    high in habitats that contained seepage water. Oc. caspius and Cx. antennatus
    had significant positive correlations with EC, Cl- and TDS, while Cx. perexiguus
    showed only a positive correlation with Cl-. Finally, all recorded mosquito larvae
    preferred alkaline habitats. Further studies will focus on the correlation between
    mosquito abundance and other vital factors like environmental, meteorological,
    and biological factors, as well as vegetation cover and aquatic bodies. This could
    be useful in creating a precise disruption map for mosquito vectors and, consequently,
    in putting into appropriate efficient mosquito control strategies in Egypt. Disclosure

  description: 'Groundwater potential delineation is essential for efficient water
    resource utilization and long-term development. The scarcity of potable and irrigation
    water has become a critical issue due to natural and anthropogenic activities
    in meeting the demands of human survival and productivity. With these constraints,
    groundwater resource is now being used extensively in Ethiopia. Therefore, an
    innovative convolutional neural network (CNN) is successfully applied in the Gunabay
    watershed to delineate groundwater potential based on the selected major influencing
    factors. Groundwater recharge, lithology, drainage density, lineament density,
    transmissivity, and geomorphology were selected as major influencing factors during
    the groundwater potential of the study area. For dataset training, 70% of samples
    were selected and 30% were used for serving out of the total 128 samples. The
    spatial distribution of groundwater potential has been classified into five groups:
    very low (10.72%), low (25.67%), moderate (31.62%), high (19.93%), and very high

    Groundwater potential delineation is essential for efficient water resource utilization
    and long-term development. The scarcity of potable and irrigation water has become
    a critical issue due to natural and anthropogenic activities in meeting the demands
    of human survival and productivity. With these constraints, groundwater resource
    is now being used extensively in Ethiopia. Therefore, an innovative convolutional
    neural network (CNN) is successfully applied in the Gunabay watershed to delineate
    groundwater potential based on the selected major influencing factors. Groundwater
    recharge, lithology, drainage density, lineament density, transmissivity, and
    geomorphology were selected as major influencing factors during the groundwater
    potential of the study area. For dataset training, 70% of samples were selected
    and 30% were used for serving out of the total 128 samples. The spatial distribution
    of groundwater potential has been classified into five groups: very low (10.72%),
    low (25.67%), moderate (31.62%), high (19.93%), and very high (12.06%). The area
    obtains high rainfall but has a very low amount of recharge due to lack of proper
    soil and water conservation structures. The major outcome of the study showed
    that moderate and low potential is dominant. Geodetoctor results revealed that
    the magnitude influences on groundwater potential have been ranked as transmissivity
    (0.48), recharge (0.26), lineament density (0.26), lithology (0.13), drainage
    density (0.12), and geomorphology (0.06). The model results showed that using
    a convolutional neural network (CNN), groundwater potentiality can be delineated
    with higher predictive capability and accuracy. CNN based AUC validation platform
    showed that, 81.58% and 86.84% were accrued from the accuracy of training and
    testing values, respectively. Based on the findings, the local government can
    receive technical assistance for groundwater exploration, and sustainable water
    resource development in the Gunabay watershed. Finally, the use of a detector-based
    deep learning algorithm can provide a new platform for industrial sectors, groundwater
    experts, scholars, and decision-makers. Previous article in issue Next article

    Gunabay watershed 1. Introduction Surface water is extremely scarce in semi-arid
    and arid regions (Shao et al., 2020). Groundwater is more widespread and abundant
    to tackle water scarcity problem in arid regions compared with surface water (Jaafarzadeh
    et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2023). Groundwater reservoirs provide water for domestic,
    irrigation, industry, and many other activities (Adimalla et al., 2020; Verma
    et al., 2021; Tegegne et al., 2023a) to sustain life, particularly for drought
    regions (Moodley et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). Nearly 33.3% of the population
    of the universe is reliant on groundwater (Chen et al., 2022). However, increasing
    the water demand for drinking, agricultural, and industrial sectors have put pressure/depleting
    on this resource (Dar et al., 2021). Furthermore, due to less rainfall, increasing
    anthropogenic activities and climate change (Gautam et al., 2023) insufficient
    water availability is the main constraint in the globe (Yan et al., 2021) including
    Ethiopia. Around 3.5 billion people do not have access to safe household water
    consumption and hygiene (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). World Health Organization (WHO,
    2017) proposed that accessible, safe, and satisfactory water must be available
    to sustain human life. As a result, identifying groundwater potentiality is the
    most pressing issue (Shi et al., 2021) to be addressed for current utilization
    and future sustainable development preservation (Panahi et al., 2020; Moharir
    et al., 2023). Groundwater potentiality is also known as groundwater occurrence
    or water availability in groundwater reservoirs (Khosravi et al., 2018; Obeidavi
    et al., 2021). Though, the probability of groundwater occurrence varies by area
    and time (Chen et al., 2019; Shao et al., 2020). Groundwater recharge in aquifer
    zones may increase groundwater availability, but groundwater recharge is little
    known for increasing groundwater storage (Souza et al., 2018) in the watershed.
    Recharge of groundwater is termed as the downward movement of water, which reaches
    the water table increasing the storage of reservoir (Dadgar et al., 2020; Hall
    et al., 2020). It is also essential parameter to connect surface water with groundwater
    in the aquifers (Jaafarzadeh et al., 2021). However, the movement of recharge
    is always influenced by changes in such parameters as land cover, geologic conditions,
    hydrology, soil types, climate, slope, and other factors (Pourghasemi et al.,
    2020; Doke et al., 2021; Karki et al., 2021). For example, slope is a critical
    factor that directly affects percolation system, infiltration rate, and runoff
    (Das, 2021). Groundwater storage is governed by the aquifer capabilities such
    as specific capacity, transmissivity, drawdown, pumping rate, static groundwater
    level, storativity, and morphological parameters (Sikakwe, 2018; Rizeei et al.,
    2019). As a result, groundwater potential will be defined by the combined accessibility
    of groundwater recharge and storage. Several traditional and field survey approaches
    have been integrated into spatial modeling to evaluate groundwater resource. But
    they are expensive, challenging, and time-consuming. Recently, groundwater resource
    studies have been integrated with Remote Sensing (RS), and Geographic Information
    System (GIS) techniques (Panahi et al., 2020). RS and GIS provide economic datasets
    that cover entire areas without wastage of time. To recognize the probability
    of spatial groundwater potentiality, several statistical approaches have been
    integrated into GIS: Analytic hierarchy process (Arabameri et al., 2019a,b; Kaur
    et al., 2020; Berhanu and Hatiye, 2020; Shao et al., 2020; Doke et al., 2021;
    Moodley et al., 2022), Catastrophe theory (Kaur et al., 2020), Evidential belief
    function, Frequency ratio (Kim et al., 2018), Index of entropy (Kordestani et
    al., 2019), Logistic regression (Yousefi et al., 2020), Weight of evidence (Kordestani
    et al., 2019; Panahi et al., 2020), Multi-criteria decision making (Arabameri
    et al., 2019a; Yousefi et al., 2020), Shannon''s entropy (Panahi et al., 2020),
    and Dempster Shafer Model (Jaafarzadeh et al., 2021) are some of the terms to
    mention. Superior capability of deep learning algorithms (DLAs) over machine learning
    algorithms (MLAs) and statistical methods integrated within the ArcGIS tool (Saha
    et al., 2022) have been initiated by many scholars. Some researchers have investigated
    the competence of CNN under DLAs in the spatial prediction of groundwater mapping
    (Chen et al., 2019) and determined its superiority over other approaches. Particularly,
    the application of deep learning approach is more acceptable to predict the potential
    of groundwater zone in the mountainous landscape (Pradhan et al., 2021). CNN is
    recently been applied effectively in many groundwater resource, and related studies,
    such as groundwater potentiality (Nguyen et al., 2020; Panahi et al., 2020; Xu
    et al., 2020, 2022; Pradhan et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022;
    Hakim et al., 2022; Tegegne, 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Moughani et al., 2023; Ouali
    et al., 2023), landslide susceptibility detection (Fang et al., 2020; Ngo et al.,
    2021; Sameen et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Nikoobakht et al., 2022; Xiong et
    al., 2022; Aslam et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Lin et al.,
    2023; Sreelakshmi and Vinod Chandra, 2023; Zhao and Chen, 2023), land use/cover
    classification (Yang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Carranza-García et al.,
    2019; Jozdani et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2019; Wambugu et al., 2021; Yu et al.,
    2022), geological properties detection (de Lima et al., 2019; Geng et al., 2019;
    Mohd Razak and Jafarpour, 2020; Li et al., 2020, 2021a; Ren et al., 2021; Di et
    al., 2022; Qin et al., 2023) and prediction of soil properties (Ng et al., 2019;
    Hao et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2020; Padarian et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020; Ronaldo
    et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2021; Lanjewar and Gurav, 2022). Several scientists
    are working to simplify problems using various modeling approaches that have more
    approximations. However, in groundwater studies, there is no universal maximal
    prediction control that works perfectly (Chen et al., 2019). There are, however,
    always optimal and superior predictor techniques. The capability of the spatial
    modeling (machine, deep learning, statistical and correlation coefficients) output
    can be measured using standard approaches (i.e., SVR, Kappa, CNN, ROC and RMSE)
    (Mandal et al., 2021). Many rural towns have been expanding rapidly over Blue
    Nile Basin, and it may increase water demand. Because most river are drying up
    due to anthropogenic activities, and natural phenomenon. Hence groundwater is
    the only critical water supply resource in this situation. Subsurface water is
    drought resistant, less contaminated, and responds slowly to climate change. However,
    the high potential for agricultural land is primarily rain-fed agriculture (Yimere
    and Assefa, 2022). Sustainable crop production does not support by rainfall-dependent
    agriculture due to erratic rainfall, resulting in food insecurity (Duguma and
    Duguma, 2022; Mengistu et al., 2022). Steeper gradient, high relief ratio, and
    ruggedness index, which indicated higher erosion potential (Das, 2021). As a result,
    identifying groundwater potentiality regions is required for selection of productive
    wells, and long-term groundwater management. The application of GeoDetector-based
    CNN models is the innovation point in this study, and filling the research gap
    is the target of this research with significant major influencing factors. For
    example, recharge has been ignored in many research tasks (Pradhan et al., 2021;
    Bai et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022). However, few studies have begun with recharge
    (Niway et al., 2022; Gautam et al., 2023) and transmissivity (Dimple et al., 2023;
    Gautam et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023) as major influencing factors for groundwater
    potential prediction. As a result, groundwater recharge and transmissivity have
    been identified as major influencing factors in the Gunabay watershed for mapping
    groundwater potentiality zones. Furthermore, in the previous work, the interaction
    of groundwater potential influencing factors have given little attention. Therefore,
    this study will initiate to improve groundwater potentiality evaluation performance
    by integrating GeoDetector and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The more accurate
    mapping supports deciding the exact location of productive wells for intensive
    uses. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to make more accurate groundwater
    potential map using innovative GeoDetector-based CNN models approach with an effective
    validation for Gunabay watershed, in the data scarce area of upper Blue Nile Basin,
    Ethiopia. Furthermore, this research will serve as important reference line evidence
    to improve groundwater management, and some engineering decisions. It is indispensable
    for local governments, policymakers, decision-makers, human health protection
    agency (i.e., trachoma disease due to lack of water hygiene), and farmers to possibilities
    of groundwater development in the area. 2. Materials and methods In the present
    study, concise procedures and innovative methods have been conducted successfully.
    Fourteen (14) groundwater influencing factors were selected for spatial delineation
    and framed in to six steps (Fig. 3): (i) preparation of groundwater recharge influencing
    factor datasets in the study area, (ii) development of a recharge potential map,
    (iii) preparation of groundwater influencing factor datasets, (v) development
    of a deep learning model, and (vi) mapping groundwater potential. The GIS created
    the factors database. MATLAB programming was used to implement model training
    and validation. Geodetector software was used to quantifying groundwater driving
    forces (i.e., detector of factor and interaction). 2.1. Description of the study
    area The research was carried out in Gunabay watershed of upper part of Blue Nile
    Basin, located in the northwest of Ethiopia. It is located between the latitudes
    of 11°00′20″ N and 11°45′46″ N, and longitudes of 37°23′06″ E and 38°28′24″ E,
    with a total area of 3920.25 km2 (Fig. 1a–c) bounded by Guna Mountain in the north,
    northwest by Tana sub-basin, northeast by the Bashilo watershed, and to the south
    by the Blue Nile gorges. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    watershed. 2.2. Development of datasets for groundwater inventory map The potential
    groundwater inventory map was generated from existing productive wells, and spring
    datasets in this study. Springs are parts of groundwater that emerge from underground
    due to faults (unconfined aquifers) breaking through streams (Manga, 2001; Moughani
    et al., 2023). They are continuous source of flowing water discharged from subsurface
    zone emitting to ground surface in the form of current (Hu et al., 2007) and strong
    sources of groundwater potential (GWP). As a result, a spring inventory and high
    productive wells (>5Lit/s) was created using historical data archived by Anbesame
    water supply district offices, and some of the locations were cross-checked using
    GPS during the field visits. Non groundwater points were extracted and split into
    training and validation datasets using ArcGIS (v10.8) for modeling GWP. 7:3 In
    spatial groundwater prediction, datasets for training and testing are commonly
    used (Wang et al., 2022). 128 wells and springs were identified and classified
    into two types; 70% (90) were chosen at random for model training, while 30% (38)
    were chosen at random for validation (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image

    2.3. Groundwater influencing factor dataset preparations Identifying the most
    important factors is essential for improving model accuracy in mapping groundwater
    potential (Bai et al., 2022). Based on literature review, dataset availability
    and the model criteria, the following fourteen major influencing factors have
    been identified and applied in this study, land cover, temperature, wind speed,
    soil, elevation, slope, evapotranspiration (PET), groundwater depth, rainfall,
    groundwater recharge, lithology, transmissivity, drainage density, lineament density,
    and geomorphology. However, the first nine factors (land cover, temperature, wind
    speed, soil, elevation, slope, evapotranspiration (PET), groundwater depth, rainfall)
    have been used as input datasets to mapping the spatial prediction of groundwater
    recharge zones. Then, six comprehensive groundwater influencing factors (lithology,
    transmissivity, drainage density, lineament density, groundwater recharge, and
    geomorphology) have been prepared depend upon, the literatures review, watershed
    characteristics, and datasets availability. Six methodological steps/procedures
    have been carried out in Fig. 3 to meet the research objectives. Download : Download
    high-res image (896KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Methodological
    framework. 2.3.1. Lithology Lithology has the potential influences directly on
    permeability and porosity of aquifer rocks (groundwater reservoir); thus, the
    condition and origin of groundwater occurrence, and it requires a carefully investigation
    (Doke et al., 2021). The geological survey map of Ethiopia with a scale of 1:500,000
    provided the lithology of the Gunabay. Groundwater conduits supported by faults
    and joints serve as the recharge aquifers. The area dominated by sedimentary rocks
    is a better source of groundwater occurrence due to their high porosity and high
    permeability characteristics in comparison to metamorphic and igneous rocks (Moughani
    et al., 2023) (Fig. 4). Three major geological rocks are presented in the study
    area such as; Qb (quaternary basalts), Qv (quaternary volcanic), and TV (tertiary
    volcanic). This district contains eight different lithological units: Plateau
    basalts, Quaternary volcanics, Ashange, Aiba, Alajie, Guna trachyte, Tuff, and
    Trachyte plug. Download : Download high-res image (662KB) Download : Download

    basalts), Qv1 (Quaternary volcanics), TV1 (Ashange), TV2 (Aiba), TV4 (Alajie),
    TV6 (Tuff), TV7 (Guna trachyte), and TV8 (Trachyte plug). 2.3.2. Lineament density
    Lineament is the curvilinear or linear geological features and it can be identified
    on satellite image (Das et al., 2018). Groundwater movement and occurrence through
    joints and fractures is controlled by lineament density, because rock fractures
    and joints have a greater capacity to hold water resulting to higher potentiality
    of groundwater due to higher lineament density (Ajay Kumar et al., 2020). Therefore,
    the lineament has a potential to facilitate the rate of infiltration into the
    groundwater reservoir which plays a great role in the storage of groundwater (Uc
    Castillo et al., 2022). Among extraction approaches, manual extraction is more
    common rather than automatic extraction of lineament using software to trace only
    geological features when the objective is limited (Das et al., 2018) (Fig. 5 and
    Eq. (1)). In this study, manual extraction lineament was applied carefully. (1)
    where, Li = total length of lineaments (km), LD = lineament density (km/km2),
    A = unit area (km2) (Eq. (1)). Lineament density of the area has been prepared
    from Landsat (Band-5) dataset using Arc GIS tool. Download : Download high-res

    the Gunabay watershed. 2.3.3. Transmissivity It is essential for the water transmission
    property of the groundwater reservoir zone. A higher transmissivity value implies
    high potentiality zones in the given watershed (Opara et al., 2021; Dimple et
    al., 2023). Therefore, mapping transmissivity is one of the critical input parameters
    for overlaying groundwater zones. Transmissivity datasets from Anbesame water
    supply district, Amhara Water Well Drilling Enterprise and Ethiopian geological
    survey map were collected for data processing. A standard kriging approach was
    used to create a map. Higher numeral value indicates a greater occurrence of groundwater
    in the Gunabay watershed''s western portion, while lower potentiality is expected
    in the Southeast and Northeast (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image (578KB)

    2.3.4. Drainage density The drainage density defined as the ratio of total length
    by area (the total length of streams/rivers in a basin divided by the drainage
    basin''s total area (km/km2) is proportional to soil permeability (low drainage
    density leads to high infiltration) (Eq. (2)). Rivers are the main essential sources
    of recharge (Trabelsi et al., 2023). The distance from the rivers affects groundwater
    table and the higher water table near the rivers rather than the areas located
    far (Doke et al., 2021). High runoff and low infiltration are caused by high drainage
    density resulting to low groundwater availability (Pinto et al., 2017; Das and
    Pardeshi, 2018; Ajay Kumar et al., 2020; Das, 2021). It is one of the most important
    parameters in determining potentiality of groundwater zones (Fig. 7). The drainage
    density map was prepared using GIS environment and reclassified accordingly. (2)
    where, Di is the total length of the stream (km), and A is the watershed unit
    area (km2). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Drainage density in the Gunabay watershed. 2.3.5. Geomorphological
    units Geomorphology is one the most important parameters for evaluating the spatial
    potential of groundwater districts (Doke et al., 2021). They are topographical
    features of the earth''s surface that regulate groundwater flow. The major geomorphological
    landforms are plains, platforms, hills, and mountains (Weiming et al., 2011).
    Through recharge systems, flat regions and valleys can provide a better groundwater
    potential (Ajay Kumar et al., 2020; Berhanu and Hatiye, 2020). Therefore, geomorphological
    units generated from DEM datasets using the SAGA GIS tool have been used to prepare
    the map (Fig. 8). The study area contains ten geomorphological units (streams,
    midslope drainages, upland drainages, valley, plains, open slopes, upper slopes,
    local ridges, midslope ridges, and high ridges). Download : Download high-res

    watershed. 2.3.6. Groundwater recharge Groundwater recharge is the primary source
    of groundwater that increases the groundwater storage in the groundwater reservoir
    (Dadgar et al., 2020). Furthermore, it is a completely necessary water component
    of the hydrological cycle (Yeh et al., 2009). It was recently estimated using
    WetSpass-M effectively in the data scarcity area (Nannawo et al., 2021; Gelebo
    et al., 2022; Tegegne et al., 2023b) of Ethiopia. Groundwater recharge was evaluated
    in this study using the WetSpass-M model with the following nine major influencing
    factors as model inputs such as; elevation, land cover (crops (57.04%), shrub
    land (36.16%), settlement (4.73%), mixed forests (1.65%), open water (0.39%),
    grassland (0.02%), bare land (0.01%)), groundwater depth, rainfall, evapotranspiration
    (PET), slope, temperature, wind speed, and soil (Tegegne et al., 2023b) and their
    influences have been presented in Table 1. Table 1. Summery of groundwater recharge
    influencing factors. Recharge factors The potential importance of groundwater
    recharge influencing factors Rainfall It has a potential to controls the infiltration
    and percolation of surface water directly to enhancing groundwater recharge (Doke
    et al., 2021). Soil It has a potential influence to determine the capacity of
    water holding through infiltration process (Mehra et al., 2016; Doke et al., 2021).
    Land cover Directly controls the permeability and infiltration process (Doke et
    al., 2021). Elevation It is indicating the terrain ruggedness, and the lower the
    elevation implies the higher the infiltration rate, less runoff generation and
    more rechargeable (Chen et al., 2022). Slope It has a potential directly influences
    on percolation rate, soil infiltration rate, and rainfall runoff (Das, 2021).
    Evapotranspiration It is one of the most important parameters for recharge estimation
    in the water balance components (Kisiki et al., 2023). Groundwater depth It indicates
    the presence of higher groundwater recharge (nearest to the ground surface) (Tegegne
    et al., 2023b). Temperature It has influence on the variability of groundwater
    recharge potential (Hakim et al., 2022; Tegegne et al., 2023b). Wind speed It
    is one of the most important parameters for recharge estimation in the water balance
    components (Kisiki et al., 2023). 2.4. Methodology 2.4.1. GeoDetector model Wang
    et al. (2010) proposed a newly GeoDetector model, which is widely used in many
    fields to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of variables. It comprises four specialized
    detectors: ecological detector, interaction detector, factor detector, and risk
    detector. The general framework of geographical detectors can be proposed to answers
    four specifics research questions (Fig. 10). However, in this study, factor and
    interaction detectors were applied to determine the significance of major groundwater
    potential influencing factors and the interaction between each parameter. Because,
    the majority of groundwater potential studies ignore the examination of predicted
    maps and can be estimated using Eq. (3) (Wang et al., 2022). (3) Where, 2 = the
    target variable''s variance used to measure its dispersion; N = the total number
    of samples and n = the types for the relevant variables. q = the rate of the influencing
    factors, and subscript h = the hth zone (Shrestha and Luo, 2017). 2.4.2. Convolutional
    neural networks (CNN) CNN is one of the well-known deep learning, which was introduced
    by (LeCun et al., 1998). It is specialized in image recognition, efforts as human
    brain patterns (Panahi et al., 2020). There are many deep learning algorithms
    available but CNN is one of the most important deep learning algorithms to estimate
    the regression, prediction, and classification of complex tasks (Nikoobakht et
    al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023; Moughani et al., 2023). Due to its better performance
    abilities, CNN is used for a variety of tasks (Youssef et al., 2022). It is composed
    of five imperative layers; input layers (contain input variables), convolutional
    layers (contain a filter to extract features from input variables), pooling layers
    (reduce the size of feature output from convolutional variables to avoid overfitting
    problem), fully connected layers (which help to integrate the datasets and produces
    the final output in the neural network) (Hakim et al., 2022), and output layers
    (Baghdadi et al., 2022; Zhao and Chen, 2023). Batch normalization layer is essential
    layer, which helps to normalize in to the mean activation values of 0 and 1 (Tegegne,
    2022). A model activated by ReLU has better stability during dataset training
    and testing (Li et al., 2021b). The two-dimensional convolutional neural network
    was developed based on the data features and related literature (Khosravi et al.,
    2018; Panahi et al., 2020; Youssef et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2023) (Fig. 11 and
    Table 2). In the process of CNN, the input (primary) datasets must be converted
    into images (Khosravi et al., 2018). The point datasets (128) were extracted from
    the factors and converted into image datasets for CNN process. Table 2. Optimal

    of input variables (influencing factors) and dataset quality may affect the models
    output significantly (Chen et al., 2019; Ngo et al., 2021). Every modeling approach,
    including optimal models, requires precision evaluation. Generally, ROC (receiver
    operating characteristic) curve, AUC (under area curve) is widely utilized to
    predict model accuracy. The higher value indicates better prediction model accuracy.
    It was constructed by plotting on the X axis the values of specificity and Y axis
    is the values of sensitivity, using the following equations (Arabameri et al.,
    2019b; Chen et al., 2019) (Eqs. (4), (5))). (4) (5) (6) where TP (true positive),
    TN (true negative), FP (false positive), FN (false negative). TP and TN refer
    to the proportion of positive and negative pixels correctly classified into the
    positive and negative classification, while FP and FN are pixels that were incorrectly
    classified in to the negative and positive classification. The accuracy of most
    deep and machine learning algorithms has ranged from excellent (0.9–1.0) to very
    high (0.8–0.9), high (0.7–0.8), moderate (0.6–0.7), and low (0.5–0.6) (Arabameri
    et al., 2019b; Miraki et al., 2019; Khosravi et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2022).
    Therefore, the novel CNN approach has been conducted and has been validated with
    30% of the datasets (which had not been used for training) in this study. The
    validation of CNN was constructed by plotting on the X axis the values of accuracy
    (%) and Y axis is the values of number of iterations (Eq. (6)). 3. Results and
    discussions 3.1. Major influencing factors The prediction of the spatial potentiality
    of groundwater can be improved utilizing the novel approaches and selection of
    their potential influencing factors. Therefore, this study has been performed
    with GeoDetector based convolutional neural network (CNN). The major groundwater
    potential influencing factors (lithology, lineament density, transmissivity, drainage
    density, geomorphology, and groundwater recharge) were selected to identify and
    mapping the spatial groundwater potential zones in the upper part of Blue Nile
    Basin, Ethiopia. Geology (lithology) is the most significant element for groundwater
    potential due to the infiltration through permeability of rock (Aggarwal et al.,
    2019). In this study, the detailed geological lithology can be mentioned as; Plateau
    basalts (1.37%), Quaternary volcanics (5.64%), Ashange (32.06%), Aiba (29.09%),
    Alajie (29.19%), Guna trachyte (1.68%), Tuff (0.84%), and Trachyte plug (0.13%).
    Ashange, Alajie, and Aiba are the major dominant rocks in the Gunabay watershed
    (Fig. 4). Lineament density is one of the most important factors, which helps
    to control the occurrence and movement of groundwater through infiltration. The
    study area of lineament density (in km/km2) is ranges from 0 to 1.36. The lineament
    density of Gunabay watershed was classified into five groups such as; very high
    (0.79–1.36), high (0.53–0.79), moderate (0.32–0.53), low (0.14–0.32), and very
    low (0.-0.14). In this study area, the west and western south parts are dominated
    by moderate to very high lineament density (0.32–1.36 km/km2) (Fig. 5). Due to
    moderate to very high groundwater potentiality, these areas are not suggested
    for construction of engineering structures (i.e., dam construction) (Das et al.,
    2018). Transmissivity is one of the most significant to identify groundwater potential
    zones (Dimple et al., 2023). In the present study area, the transmissivity (m2/day)
    ranges from 0.01 to 1.49 and classified into five classes based on these numerical
    values, namely very high (132.11–175.59), high (101.34–132.11), moderate (75.24–101.34),
    low (53.84–75.24), and very low (5–53.84) (Fig. 6). The west part of the study
    area is presented by moderate to very high transmissivity zones. Drainage density
    is infiltration is inversely proportion, while directly proportion with runoff
    (Ahmad et al., 2023). Generally, due to a higher probability of groundwater recharge,
    the watershed areas with lower drainage density have higher groundwater potential
    (Doke et al., 2021). Therefore, in this study area, the drainage density (km/km2)
    ranges from 5.0 to 175.59 and classified into five classes based on these numerical
    values, namely very low (0.96–1.49), low (0.78–0.96), moderate (0.64–0.78), high
    (0.48–0.64), and very high (0.01–0.48) (Fig. 7). The west part of the study area
    is presented by very high transmissivity zones. Geomorphological units (Fig. 8)
    have impacted on water percolation and groundwater recharge into groundwater reservoirs
    (Abijith et al., 2020). In this study, streams, valley, and plains units have
    higher significant impact on the potential influence of groundwater. Groundwater
    recharge potential vary significantly spatially ana temporarily due to the variability
    of hydrogeology variables, topographic factors, and climate conditions (Jaafarzadeh
    et al., 2021; Dimple et al., 2023). It is one of the most important factors of
    groundwater potential. In this study the major groundwater influencing factors
    (land cover, temperature, wind speed, soil, elevation, slope, evapotranspiration
    (PET), groundwater depth, rainfall) were considered to quantify and mapping of
    groundwater recharge potentiality zones (Tegegne et al., 2023b). As shown in Fig.
    9, based on quantile classification, five classes (very high (83–508 mm/year),
    high (51–83 mm/year), moderate (30–51 mm/year), low (6–30 mm/year), and very low
    (0–6 mm/year)) of recharge potential zones have been presented represented. North
    western and west parts of the study area have receiving higher potential of groundwater
    recharge, while north eastern part receiving lower groundwater recharge potential

    3.2. Variable importance analysis using factor detector During the research, groundwater
    recharge, lithology, lineament density, transmissivity, drainage density, and
    geomorphology were considered as comprehensive groundwater conditioning factors
    to generate the final products of groundwater potentiality (GPM). Groundwater
    recharge is also estimated from elevation, slope, land cover, groundwater depth,
    PET, rainfall, temperature, soil, and wind speed datasets (Tegegne et al., 2023b).
    The factor detector results revealed that all of the input variables considered
    had remarkable sway on groundwater occurrence in the watershed (Fig. 12). Transmissivity
    (0.48) had the greatest influence on groundwater occurrence, followed by recharge
    (0.26), lineament density (0.26), lithology (0.13), drainage density (0.12), and
    geomorphology (0.06). The overall, potentiality of groundwater was strongly related
    to transmissivity, recharge, and lineament density. However, lithology, drainage
    density, and geomorphology have little influence on the occurrence of groundwater.
    Occurrence of groundwater is predominantly available in valley and plain areas

    factors using interaction detector analysis The interaction between transmissivity
    and recharge is greater than the individual influences (Table 3). This conclusion
    may be attributed to that the internal storage of downstream groundwater reservoirs
    gains water through recharged aquifer zones in the area. Table 3. Interaction

    The potential of groundwater was identified and mapped in the data scarce area
    of upper Blue Nile Basin (i.e., Gunabay watershed), Ethiopia. The delineated map
    was classified into five potential zones based on natural breaks (Jenks): very
    high-value ranges (0.66–1.00), high (0.53–0.66), moderate (0.41–0.53), low (0.27–0.41),
    and very low (0.00–0.27). The western part of the area is expected to have very
    high groundwater potential, while the upper (northern) part of Guna Mountain is
    nearly free from any groundwater occurrence (Fig. 13). However, Mountainous areas
    are the source of spring waters. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    Zones belonging to very high and high spatial groundwater potentiality correspond
    to transmissivity and, to a lesser extent, recharge and lineament density (Fig.
    5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Generally, the spatial distribution of groundwater availability
    is classified and ranked as moderate (31.62%), low (25.68%), high (19.93%), very
    high (12.05%), and very low (10.72%) (Table 4). Table 4. Summery of land characteristics
    and its groundwater potential. Characteristics of the land in the study area Potentiality
    of groundwater Remarks Water bodies, forest, sandy, sandy loam soils, flat, areas
    having high rainfall, high recharge, lower runoff, ridge/hills and rocky benches,
    very low drainage density, very high lineament density, and very high transmissivity
    Very high This land zone has high groundwater potential. This area is required
    an intensive water resources management to keep safe from constructing of engineering
    structures, landfill and industrial linkages. Agricultural lands, gentle, loam,
    mixed forests, low drainage density, high lineament density, and high transmissivity

    water resource management to keep safe from landfill and industrial linkages.
    Mild, crop lands, grassland, silty loam, sandy clay loam, moderate drainage density,
    moderate lineament density, and moderate transmissivity Moderate This land has
    moderate groundwater potential but there is need to afforestation and some proper
    water control activities. Shrub land, silty clay loam, steep, high drainage density,
    low lineament density, and low transmissivity Low This land has slight groundwater
    potential zone. It requires soil and water conservation practices. Settlement
    (towns, cities, paved roads, asphalt …), clay loam, steep to extra steep slopes,
    barren land, very high drainage density, very low lineament density, and very
    low transmissivity Very low This land has not groundwater potential zone. It is
    not considered for groundwater. It requires soil and water conservation practices.
    3.5. Discussion Groundwater resource is overexploiting due to low recharge potentiality
    in climate changing environment and anthropogenic activities (Masroor et al.,
    2023). Therefore, the knowledge of mapping of spatial groundwater recharge zones
    should be given priority to addressing sustainability through better management
    of water resources (Jaafarzadeh et al., 2021). Hereafter delineation of groundwater
    potential is extremely important in data scare area of upper Blue Nile Basin (i.e.,
    Gunabay watershed). Identification and mapping of groundwater potentiality zones
    is precondition for planning and sustainable water resource development. Based
    on natural break the spatial potential of the area has been classified in to five
    major groups such as very low, low, moderate, high and very high zones (Fig. 13).
    The results of environmental influencing factors revealed the areas having that
    flat pain, valley topography, lower slope, forestry, water bodies, higher capacity
    of permeability and porosity (sandy soil) zones have high to very high groundwater
    distribution (Dar et al., 2021). Very high groundwater potentiality zone is located
    in western part of the study area. Hence nearby Bahir Dar city, this area should
    be protected from linkage of landfill sites and any wastage of factories. On the
    other hand, very poor to moderate zones of groundwater potential are found in
    the mountainous areas, hills with steeper slopes, ridges, presence of silty soil,
    less water infiltration and low storage due to high runoff potential is majorly
    dominated in this study area. Combined approach of GeoDetector (GD) and convolutional
    neural network (CNN) was showed best performance with in a complex flow process.
    Convolutional layer has many filters that perform convolution operation to extracts
    feature maps from images. Every image is considered as a matrix of pixel values.
    Therefore, the hidden layer compromises convolution and pooling operations (Zhao
    et al., 2018). The pooling layer is a down-sampling (subsampling) operation that
    selects the most significant features and reduces the dimensionality of feature
    image maps from the convolution layer. In the pooling operations, maximum is the
    most popular rather than minimum and average (Fig. 11). Flattening is the process
    of converting all the resultant two dimensional arrays from pooled feature maps
    into a single long continuous linear vector (Zhao et al., 2018; Panahi et al.,
    2020). Interaction and factor detectors were very important for identification
    of groundwater potential. The validation process also more acceptable results
    (Fig. 14, Fig. 15). Download : Download high-res image (592KB) Download : Download

    Testing (validation) dataset accuracy processing results. 3.6. Groundwater potentiality
    validation The scientific significance of spatial model is evaluated by validation
    system (Dimple et al., 2023). With the help of test datasets, the spatial prediction
    of the groundwater potentiality map was evaluated. The result showed an accuracy
    of 86.84%, which was more reliable and acceptable (Fig. 14, Fig. 15). Therefore,
    the performance of the model was very high and in the range of 80% and 90% (Arabameri
    et al., 2019b; Miraki et al., 2019; Khosravi et al., 2018; Saha et al., 2022).
    Generally, convolutional neural network with Adam optimizer has an advantage of
    automatically decay the learning rate, and their convergency rate is faster on
    datasets with sparse features, but inferior generation and likely to converge
    to sharp minimum (Liu et al., 2021b). Therefore, CNN-based spatial model is providing
    the highest precision results (Ngo et al., 2021) and it gives a better fitness
    for image processing of classification, regression and prediction (Tegegne, 2022).
    3.7. Limitations All environmental factors have been considered with scientific
    standards carefully. However, major limitations cannot be ignored (Doke et al.,
    2021). Therefore, lack of informative existing water borehole dataset (specific
    yields, vertical lithology layers, and well recovering time) is one of the limitations.
    Random generating of non-groundwater training and testing datasets may often lead
    to having models with less generalization capacity. Groundwater well discharge
    and borehole history may add more informative output. Lack of sufficient previous
    works in the study area that may not be enough for discussion and comparison.
    Furthermore, to provide better spatial information in the study area, it requires
    higher spatial resolution of groundwater influencing factors (<30 m resolution).
    4. Conclusions Groundwater potential assessment approaches have progressed significantly
    in recent days; however, the groundwater recharge effect is not well-investigated
    as the main influencing factor. Therefore, based on WetSpass-M modeling criteria,
    nine major groundwater recharge influencing factors (land cover, temperature,
    wind speed, soil, elevation, slope, evapotranspiration (PET), groundwater depth,
    rainfall) were utilized in the first stage. Hence, the study contributes to fil
    the gaps which enhancing the accuracy of groundwater availability prediction by
    investigating the groundwater recharge. Then, based on literature review and dataset
    availability, groundwater recharge, lithology, transmissivity, drainage density,
    lineament density, and geomorphology were considered for spatial modeling of groundwater
    potential. Groundwater recharge is the second major influencing factor followed
    by transmissivity and equivalently with lineament density. The contribution of
    geomorphology was low on the groundwater occurrence next to lithology and drainage
    density. The result revealed that the spatial and temporally distribution of groundwater
    is low due to the prevalence of rainfall runoff in the study area. With this connection,
    very low to moderate groundwater potentiality zones are more dominant in the area
    rather than zones of high to very high. Therefore, the spatial distribution of
    groundwater potential is presented as very low (420.27 km2), low (1006.58 km2),
    moderate (1239.74 km2), high (781.44 km2), and very high (472.22 km2). Thus, constructing
    artificial recharge, afforestation, soil and water conservation may recommended
    in the area. The performance of the newly innovated detector-based CNN model under
    the training and validation dataset scenarios for GWPM was high. The overall result
    showed that the accuracy level accrued from GD-CNN model can be accepted. The
    main challenges in GWPM are having limited recorded well yields to generate accurate
    groundwater inventory data. Because of the limited number of groundwater wells
    (springs) locations, deep learning models can be affected. However, the geographical
    detector has been evaluated as a better quantifier of the groundwater index and
    it has an advantage in the dataset dependence without further personal judgment.
    Finally, the delineated map of groundwater potential will provide multiple usages
    as the baseline for water sectors, and researchers, policy makers, environment
    protection agency, for better and sustainable water resources management. Groundwater
    potential delineation is also important for water hygiene activities to protect
    trachoma disease. Credit author statement Asnakew Mulualem Tegegne: Conceptualization,

  description: The agricultural sector plays an important role in contributing significantly
    to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries. On the other
    hand, agriculture is widely affected by major factors such as environmental changes,
    natural disasters, pesticide control, and soil and irrigation-related issues,
    which reduce crop yield. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and agriculture offers
    an opportunity to move into the next generation of Agriculture 4.0. The internet
    of things (IoT), remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, big data, cloud
    computing, thermal imaging, end-user apps and unmanned aerial vehicles offer a
    full-stack solution. IoT provides the ubiquitous connectivity of smart devices
    to the internet to collect, process and analyse a large amount of agriculture
    field data more quickly and synthesize them to make smart decisions using various
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This study reviews the challenges
    and major issues in the IoT agriculture domain and explores its emergence with
    new technologies. It covers the existing literature and illustrates how IoT applicationbased
    precision agriculture solutions have contributed. A case study on weed detection
    for smart agriculture using the YOLOv5 model is presented, achieving high accuracy.
    Finally, various IoT agriculture use cases are discussed, along with current research
    issues and possible solutions for future IoT-based agriculture advancement.

  description: Treated municipal wastewater (TMW) can provide a reliable source of
    irrigation water for crops, which is especially important in arid areas where
    water resources are limited or prone to drought. Nonetheless, TMW may contain
    residual antibiotics, potentially exposing the crops to these substances. The
    goal of this study was to investigate the dissemination of antibiotics resistance
    genes (ARGs) in the soil–plant–earthworm continuum after irrigation of spinach
    and radish plants with TMW containing trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and sulfapyridine
    in a greenhouse experiment, followed by feeding of earthworms with harvested plant
    materials. Our results showed that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were enriched
    in the soil–plant–earthworm microbiomes irrigated with TMW and TMW spiked with
    higher concentrations of antibiotics. The number of ARGs and antibiotic-resistant
    bacteria (ARB) enrichment varied with plant type, with spinach harboring a significantly
    higher amount of ARGs and ARB compared to radish. Our data showed that bulk and
    rhizosphere soils of spinach and radish plants irrigated with MilliQ water, TMW,
    TMW10, or TMW100 had significant differences in bacterial community (p < 0.001),
    ARG (p < 0.001), and virulence factor gene (VFG) (p < 0.001) diversities. The
    abundance of ARGs significantly decreased from bulk soil to rhizosphere to phyllosphere
    and endosphere. Using metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), we recovered many bacterial
    MAGs and a near complete genome (>90 %) of bacterial MAG of genus Leclercia adecarboxylata
    B from the fecal microbiome of earthworm that was fed harvested radish tubers
    and spinach leaves grown on TMW10 irrigated waters, and this bacterium has been
    shown to be an emerging pathogen causing infection in immunocompromised patients
    that may lead to health complications and death. Therefore, crops irrigated with
    TMW containing residual antibiotics and ARGs may lead to increased incidences
    of enrichment of ARB in the soil–plant–earthworm continuum.

    1. Introduction Agriculture accounts for about 70 % of global freshwater withdrawals
    (United Nations, 2022), making it the largest user of freshwater resources (Ritchie
    and Roser, 2017). The increasing demand for food production and the expansion
    of irrigated agriculture have placed significant pressure on water resources,
    particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. In recent years, many countries view
    irrigation using treated municipal wastewater (TMW) as an opportunity to secure
    and enhance agricultural production where freshwater is scarce. However, there
    are major concerns regarding trace contaminants of emerging concern (CECs; such
    as antibiotics) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in TMW (Barancheshme and
    Munir, 2018). Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) receive wastewater from diverse
    sources such as hospitals, households, and livestock farms, which often contains
    antibiotics, pathogenic bacteria, and nutrients (Ashworth et al., 2023, Ibekwe
    et al., 2023., Brown et al., 2006, Renew and Huang, 2004, Wang et al., 2020a,
    Wang et al., 2020b, Wang and Smith, 2023, Watkinson et al., 2009). WWTPs are effective
    in removing organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorous compounds, and pathogenic bacteria
    but often are relatively ineffective in removing antibiotics, ARGs, and other
    CECs (Michael et al., 2012, Pan and Chu, 2017a, Petrie et al., 2015), which are
    commonly detected in treated wastewater (Barancheshme and Munir, 2018). In a recent
    study by Rodriguez-Mozaz et al. (2020), 53 antibiotics belonging to 10 antibiotic
    families were detected in the TMW of seven countries in Europe (Rodriguez-Mozaz
    et al., 2020). The study determined quantification limits for various antibiotic
    families: fluoroquinolones (18.79–37.24 ng/L), quinolones (22.63–46.91 ng/L),
    penicillins (26.39–48.92 ng/L), cephalosporins (25.64–39.34 ng/L), macrolides
    (21.14–44.98 ng/L), tetracyclines (32.27–38.86 ng/L), lincosamide (25.59–37.05
    ng/L), sulfonamides (21.47–37.93 ng/L), nitroimidazole (17.72–41.87 ng/L), and
    a single value of 41.87 ng/L dihydrofolate reductase (Rodriguez-Mozaz et al.,
    2020). Recently, Ashworth et al., 2023 detected, trace levels of trimethoprim
    (67 ± 14 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (285 ± 11 ng/L), and sulfapyridine (77 ± 3 ng/L)
    in a wastewater treatment plant in California (Ashworth et al., 2023). The application
    of TMW containing antibiotic residuals via irrigation may facilitate the bioaccumulation
    of antibiotics in soil, which may exert a selection pressure on soil microbial
    communities and subsequently promote the development of ARGs and antibiotic-resistant
    bacteria (ARB) through vertical and horizontal gene transfer (Buta et al., 2021,
    Christou et al., 2017a, Kampouris et al., 2021, Sun et al., 2019). Long-term introduction
    of antibiotics and ARGs to the soil led to high ARG and ARB accumulation in soil
    (Zhang et al., 2023). The author reported that over four decades, the annual manure
    application caused linear or exponential ARG and ARB accumulation which differed
    compared to the short term. Yan et al., 2023 reported that HGT may not occur immediately
    under short term study in harsh conditions (Yan et al., 2023). These authors suggested
    that HGT mediated by plasmid RP4 in the transmission chain was not a main factor
    to promote the enrichment of ARGs due to the harsh survival environment of silkworm
    guts for the plasmid RP4 host E. coli. Our study used earthworms, and this may
    also be the case. Antibiotics and ARGs have been reported in agricultural soils
    (Kampouris et al., 2021, Mordechay et al., 2022, Mordechay et al., 2021, Pan and
    Chu, 2017b) as well as in crops irrigated with TMW. The presence of antibiotics
    in crops is attributed to their bioaccumulation within plant tissues (Ashworth
    et al., 2023). For example, trimethoprim has been detected in spinach leaves (1.10
    ng g−1) and pepper roots (270 ng g−1) (Wu et al., 2014), whereas sulfamethoxazole
    has been detected in tomatoes (0.15–0.62 ng g−1) (Christou et al., 2017b) and
    in cucumber roots (6.80 ng g−1) (Wu et al., 2013). Additionally, ARGs have been
    reported in all broad bean organs (leaves, roots, and beans) when plants were
    irrigated with TMW (Cerqueira et al., 2019). Irrigation with TMW also significantly
    alters the composition of agricultural soil bacterial communities (Ibekwe et al.,
    2018). Although studies on the transmission of antibiotic resistance in soil and
    plants have attracted much attention, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding
    the prevalence and dissemination of antibiotics resistance between the irrigation
    source, soil, plants harvested from agricultural fields (Wang et al., 2022), and
    animals. To study the dissemination of antibiotic resistance in agriculture, we
    focused on the TMW–soil–plant–invertebrate animal (earthworm) continuum. Earthworms
    are ecosystem engineers and can improve soil structure by burrowing and creating
    channels through the soil, increasing soil aeration, water infiltration, and nutrient
    cycling (Blouin et al., 2013, Edwards and Bohlen, 1996). They can be considered
    the invertebrate animal of choice for better understanding the inputs of contaminants
    into food chains as they are in contact with the soil, soil-pore water, and only
    migrate short distances (Carter et al., 2021). Due to the ingestion behavior and
    soil contact time of earthworms, their body tissues can bioaccumulate antibiotics
    and other pharmaceuticals (Ashworth et al., 2023, Bergé and Vulliet, 2015, Carter
    et al., 2016, Carter et al., 2014, Kinney et al., 2008). This exposure to antibiotics
    may increase ARG diversity and its abundance in the earthworm gut (Ding et al.,
    2019, Zheng et al., 2019). The transfer of residual antibiotics and antibiotic
    resistance to, and the development of antibiotic resistance within, the soil–plant–earthworm
    continuum when irrigated with TMW is of critical interest in terms of assessing
    the dissemination of AMR in food chains. While several studies have highlighted
    the rise in antimicrobial resistance in soil–plant systems because of crop irrigation
    with TMW (Cerqueira et al., 2019, Christou et al., 2017a), manure application
    (Li et al., 2017), and sewage sludge reuse (Rahube et al., 2014, Xie et al., 2016),
    we have not come across prior research that specifically examines the transmission
    and development of ARGs and ARB through the TMW–soil–plant–earthworm continuum.
    In the current study, spinach and radish plant pots were irrigated with (i) TMW
    (both as-collected and spiked with higher concentrations of the antibiotics trimethoprim
    (TMP), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), and sulfapyridine (SPD), each of which was detected
    in the as-collected TMW from the WWTP) and (ii) MilliQ water (control). The experiment
    was conducted under greenhouse conditions to determine the effect of antibiotic
    uptake by plants irrigated with TMW and TMW spiked with higher concentration of
    antibiotics on soil and plant microbiomes. Harvested spinach leaves and radish
    tubers were then used as a food source for earthworms in a microcosm study, with
    a focus on unraveling the effects of antibiotic uptake on the gut microbiome of
    the earthworms. Metagenomes were investigated to elucidate the development, enrichment,
    and dissemination of ARGs and ARB in the soil–plant–earthworm continuum. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Microbiome of plants used for uptake experiments Filtered wastewater
    effluent was collected after tertiary treatment and before chlorination from a
    local wastewater treatment plant in amber-colored glass bottles and stored at
    4 °C until used for irrigation. The plant processes about 26.7 MGD (million gallons
    per day) wastewater, and the final effluent after chlorination and dichlorination
    is used for landscape or lawn irrigation and for industrial purposes such as cleaning
    of equipment. The rest of the treated water is discharged into the local river
    and used in some cases downstream for the irrigation of crops, landscape, or lawn
    irrigation, and for industrial purposes. This TMW has a pH of 7.37, electrical
    conductivity of 0.97 dS m−1, and ionic composition (mg L−1) of Ca = 66.0; K =
    22.3; Mg = 11.0; Na = 91.0; B = 0.04; Fe = 0.05; Zn = 0.04; PO43− = 8.3; SO42−
    = 80.3; Cl = 106.9; CaCO3; NO3-N = 4.3; and Cu, Mn, Mo = non detectable. Trace
    levels of TMP (67 ± 14 ng/L), SMZ (285 ± 11 ng/L), and SPD (77 ± 3 ng/L) were
    detected in the TMW. Qualitative analyses (LC-MS/MS) were performed on the TMW
    from a local wastewater treatment plant for a wide range of antibiotic compounds
    from all major classes and only these three antibiotics were reliably identified.
    Detailed methods on the quantitative analyses can be found elsewhere (Ashworth
    et al., 2023). Since this TMW was selected as the source of irrigation water for
    this study, these three antibiotics (TMP, SMZ, and SPD) were selected for the
    spike. The soil used for the study was collected from the University of California
    Riverside Agriculture Experiment Station with no history of antibiotics application.
    It is a sandy loam (Arlington series) soil with a composition of sand (75 %),
    silt (18 %), clay (8 %), organic matter (0.92 %), and pH 7.1. The earthworms (Eisenia
    fetida) were purchased from The Worm Farm (Durham, CA, USA). The experimental
    pots used were one-liter glass beakers with a 1 cm diameter hole at the base.
    The sandy loam soil (adjusted to 10 % gravimetric moisture content) was passed
    through a 5 mm sieve. A stainless-steel mesh was used to cover the holes at the
    bottom of the pots before they were filled with 1.527 kg of sieved soil. In the
    greenhouse, each pot was placed in a 500 mL stainless steel dish. Eight treatments
    (Table 1A) with five replicates each (A–E) were arranged in a randomized block
    design. The sources of water for irrigation (Table1A) were, (i) MilliQ water,
    (ii) TMW (as collected), (iii) TMW10 (TMW spiked with 10 µg/L TMP, SMZ, and SPD),
    and (iv) TMW100 (TMW spiked with 100 µg/L TMP, SMZ, and SPD). In the present study,
    spinach and radish were selected since they are leafy greens often eaten raw or
    with minimal cooking. In addition, spinach represents the above-ground edible
    portion of plant while radish represents the under-ground edible portion of plant.
    Five spinach and radish seeds were sown in each pot. Only the two strongest plants
    per pot were retained after germination. The pots were irrigated two or three
    times a week. Each pot received the same volume of irrigation water (80–100 mL)
    in each irrigation event. Over the course of the experiment (eight weeks), each
    pot received 1770 mL of water (Ashworth et al., 2023). Table 1. A-B: A, Irrigation

    the pot experiment, soil and plant materials were collected for DNA extraction
    from replicates A-C. Bulk and rhizosphere soil samples were collected and stored
    at − 80 °C until DNA extraction. The phyllosphere bacterial community was extracted
    from spinach and radish leaves by adding five grams of leaves and 50 mL buffered
    peptone water (BPW) to a sterile stomacher bag and homogenized at 200 rpm for
    2 mins using a stomacher 400 circular lab blender (Seward, UK). The 50 mL of BPW
    was passed through a 0.22 µm membrane filter (Millipore, US). The membrane filters
    were stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction. Root samples of spinach and radish
    were thoroughly washed three times with sterile MilliQ water to remove soil. The
    roots were aseptically chopped and placed in stomacher bags with 50 mL BPW and
    homogenized at 200 rpm for 2 mins. The BPW liquid was then passed through 0.22
    µm membrane filter (Millipore, US). The membrane filters were stored at −80 °C
    until DNA extraction. 2.2. Microbiome of earthworms used for uptake study Following
    the pot experiment described above, an earthworm (E. fetida) microcosm experiment
    was conducted using the spinach (leaves) and radish (tubers) materials harvested
    from the earlier pot experiment (replicates D and E combined) as food sources.
    To 130 g of sandy loam (<2 mm; 12 % gravimetric moisture content) soil, 0.8 g
    of finely chopped and homogenized harvested plant material was mixed thoroughly.
    The soil was transferred into glass beakers (150 mL) to achieve 5-cm soil depth.
    In addition to four treatments for each plant type (Table 1A), plant materials
    surface-spiked with 1 and 10 µg g−1 of antibiotics (TMP, SMZ, and SPD) were included
    for this study, giving a total of six treatments for each of spinach and radish
    (Table 1B). Each treatment had six replicates. Across the 6 treatments each with
    6 reps, 2 plant types (72 worms total), 4 worms died during the experiment (survival
    rate of 94.4 %). Worm density is not relevant given that there was only one worm
    per beaker. Earthworm burrows were visible in the glass beaker (around the edges)
    throughout the experiment. On day zero of the experiment, one earthworm and an
    additional 0.8 g of plant material was added to each glass beaker. The glass beakers
    were covered with breathable fabric and placed in a controlled environment (20
    °C, 60 % relative humidity, 16/8h day/night cycle). Each week, 0.8 g of plant
    material was added to the glass beaker as food for the earthworm. Further details
    of the experimental setup have been previously published (Ashworth et al., 2023).
    On the last day of the experiment, the earthworms from each treatment were transferred
    on to sterile, damp (sprayed with MilliQ water) petri-plates and placed in a controlled
    environment (20 °C, 60 % relative humidity, no light) for 24 hrs. Earthworm feces
    were then collected from each petri plate and stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction.
    After transferring the earthworms, five grams of soil was collected from each
    beaker and stored at −80 °C until DNA extraction. 2.3. DNA extraction and sequencing
    DNA was extracted from bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, membrane filters (phyllosphere),
    homogenized plant material (endosphere), soil from earthworms beakers, and earthworm
    feces using the Qiagen PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All extractions
    followed the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. After extraction, all samples
    were stored at −20 °C for quantification using nanodrop 2000 (Nanodrop-ND 2000,
    Wilmington DE) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer dsDNA system (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,
    MA, USA). The extracted genomic DNA samples were sequenced at the Genomics Core
    Facility, University of California Riverside. Libraries were constructed using
    the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States), and
    sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 flowcell (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) with
    an output of 150 bps paired-end reads. A total of eight-six metagenomes were successfully
    sequenced. Details of sample information were presented in Table S1. 2.4. Metagenome
    taxonomic, antibiotic resistance and virulence gene profiling The reads were quality
    filtered with trimmomatic version 0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014). The taxonomic profiles
    of quality-filtered reads were performed using Kraken2 (Wood et al., 2019) and
    a pre-built core gene database (Chalita et al., 2020) containing k-mers (k = 35)
    of reference genomes obtained from the EzBioCloud database (Yoon et al., 2017).
    After acquiring a list of bacterial and archaeal candidate species, a custom bowtie2
    version 2.4.5 (Langdon, 2015) database was built utilizing the core genes and
    genomes from the species found during the first step. The quality-filtered reads
    were then mapped against the bowtie2 database using the –very-sensitive option
    and a quality threshold of phred33. Samtools version 1.18 (Li and Durbin, 2009)
    was used to convert and sort the output bam file. Coverage of the mapped reads
    against the bam file was obtained using Bedtools version 2.30.0 (Quinlan and Hall,
    2010). Then, to avoid false positives, using an in-house script, all reads that
    mapped to a given species were quantified only if the total coverage of their
    core genes (archaea, bacteria) was at least 25 %. Finally, species abundance was
    calculated using the total number of reads counted and normalized species abundance
    was calculated using the total length of all their reference genomes. Measures
    of alpha diversity (species richness and Shannon) were calculated using the EzBioCloud
    software platform (Yoon et al., 2017), as described previously (Brumfield et al.,
    2022, Chao and Lee, 1992). Briefly, Species richness was defined using the abundance-based
    coverage estimator algorithm. Shannon entropy of counts was calculated based on
    the description given in the Species Diversity and Richness manual. However, log
    base 2 (log2) was used as default instead of the natural logarithm (loge). Antibiotic
    resistance, virulence factor genes and mobile genetic element profiles of quality
    filtered reads were produced using separate pre-built bowtie2 (Langdon, 2015)
    reference gene databases composed of the NCBI National Database of Antibiotic
    Resistant Organisms (NDARO) database, VFDB (Liu et al., 2019). Metagenomic reads
    were mapped against respective databases using bowtie2, as previously mentioned.
    For each gene detected, depth and coverage were calculated using mpileup script
    from the SAMtools software package (Li and Durbin, 2009). 2.5. Metagenome assembled
    genomes (MAGs), taxonomy, and annotation The quality-filtered reads were de-novo
    assembled with MEGAHIT version 1.2.9 (Roux et al., 2017). The scaffolds were trimmed
    to a minimum length of 1500 bps with BBMap v38.18 (Bushnell and Rood, 2014). The
    per base coverage was calculated by mapping quality filtered reads against the
    scaffolds using BBMap version 38.18 34. The mapped file was subsequently used
    by MetaBAT1 version 2.15 to form bins from the scaffolds (Kang et al., 2019).
    The qualities of the formed bins were assessed by CheckM version 1.1.9 with the
    lineage-specific marker (Parks et al., 2015). MAGs with completeness of 70 % is
    commonly used for functional analyses of microbial communities (Levin et al.,
    2021). Thus, bins with more than 70 % completeness and less than 5 % contamination
    were designated as MAGs. The taxonomic affiliations of the MAGs were delineated
    using GTDB-Tk version 1.0.2 (Chaumeil et al., 2020). Prediction of protein and
    annotations for MAGs was performed using Prokka version 1.14.6 (Seemann, 2014).
    The predicted proteins for MAGs were parsed through Microbe-Annotator (Ruiz-Perez
    et al., 2021) for comprehensive functional annotations. These annotations were
    summarized in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) modules (Kanehisa
    et al., 2016). 2.6. Statistical analyses Difference in microbial, ARG, and virulence
    factor gene (VFG) diversity among treatments and sample groups were assessed using
    alpha diversity estimated based on Shannon and Chao1 richness indexes using the
    Phyloseq package (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013). Microbial, ARG, and VFG beta diversity
    was estimated by Bray–Curtis dissimilarities and analyzed by non-metric multidimensional
    scaling (NMDS) using the “metaMDS” function in vegan (Dixon, 2003) for microbial,
    ARG and VFG diversity. Differences in the composition and structure of microbial
    community, ARG, and VFG profiles between clusters were then evaluated using principal
    coordinate analysis (PCoA) implemented in the “vegan” package in R (Dixon, 2003).
    The beta diversity for each sample type was tested by permutational ANOVA using
    the adonis function of the vegan package in R (Dixon, 2003). A one-way ANOVA was
    also performed to test for significant differences in sample dissimilarity (Bray-Curtis)
    between sample types. 3. Results 3.1. Alpha-diversity and richness of the microbiome,
    ARGs, and VFGs The average number of reads obtained per sample was 18.6 million
    for the plant uptake experiments (range 0.4–40.1 million) and 3.5 million for
    the earthworm uptake experiments (0.9–8.8 million). The metagenomes of the spinach
    and radish plant treatments were categorized into six biomes: (i) bulk soil, (ii)
    rhizosphere soil, (iii) phyllosphere, (iv) endosphere, (v) earthworm feces, and
    (vi) soil from earthworm beakers (Tables 1 A, B). Bacteria belonging to eight
    phyla dominated the soil–plant–earthworm microbiomes: Actinomycetota, Bacteroidota,
    Cyanobacteriota, Bacillota, Gemmatimonadetes, Pseudomonadota, Planctomycetota,
    and Verucomicrobiota (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1 A, B). Detailed taxonomic
    affiliations have been described in the Supplementary Information section of the
    manuscript. The alpha diversity (Shannon) and richness (Chao1) of the microbiome,
    ARGs, and VFGs were calculated (Fig. 1, A–L) for each spinach and radish treatment.
    Spinach and radish plant phyllospheres harbored a low microbial diversity compared
    to other biomes in the soil–plant–earthworm continuum. The microbial diversity
    in the spinach plant phyllosphere was significantly lower (p < 0.001) than that
    of the bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, earthworm feces, and soil from earthworm beakers
    irrigated with MilliQ water, TMW, and TMW100 (Fig. 1 A, B). In the case of radish,
    the phylloshere microbial diversity was significantly lower (p < 0.01) compared
    with bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, earthworm feces, and soil from earthworm beakers
    irrigated with TMW and TMW10 (Fig. 1 C, D). Microbial diversity and richness indexes
    could not be calculated for (i) the phyllopshere of spinach plants irrigated with
    TMW10, (ii) the phyllosphere of radish plants irrigated with MilliQ water and
    TMW100, and (iii) the earthworm feces of radish plants irrigated with TMW100,
    as no sequence reads mapped to bacterial reference genomes. Download : Download

    soil–plant-earthworm continuum was significantly lower in spinach plants (p <
    0.01) in comparison to bulk soil, earthworm feces, and soil from earthworm beakers
    irrigated with MilliQ water, TMW, TMW10, and TMW100 (Fig. 1 E, F). For radish
    plants, significant differences were recorded in ARG diversity (p < 0.05) between
    bulk soils irrigated with MilliQ water, TMW, TMW10, and TMW100 (Fig. 1 G, H).
    The ARG diversity of the bulk soil was observed to follow the order: TMW100 >
    TMW > TMW10 > MilliQ water (Fig. 1 G, H). The ARG diversity of rhizosphere soil,
    earthworm feces, and soil from earthworm beakers was not recorded for radish plants
    as no sequenced reads mapped to the antibiotic resistant database were determined.
    In both spinach and radish plants, no ARGs were found in the phyllosphere of the
    plants. The diversity and richness of ARGs and VFGs for spinach and radish significantly
    decreased in earthworm feces and in the beaker soil (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1 E, L).
    3.2. Microbiome, ARG, and VFG beta-diversity analyses A comparison of beta-diversity
    of (i) microbial community, (ii) ARGs, and (iii) VFGs using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity
    index revealed the influence of the sample type spinach and radish in clustering
    ordination (Fig. 2 A–D; Supplementary Information, Fig. S2 A, B). The samples
    from treatments of spinach and radish were grouped into biomes: (i) bulk soil,
    (ii) rhizosphere soil, (iii) phyllosphere, (iv) endosphere, (v) earthworm feces
    biomes, and (iv) soil from earthworm beakers. For spinach and radish, the beta
    diversity of microbial communities for samples from each biome cluster together
    on the ordination plots (adonis2, p < 0.00001, spinach r2 = 0.86, radish r2 =
    0.85; Fig. 2 A, B). The rhizosphere and bulk soil sample clusters were closer
    to each other (highlighted by black ellipse) than to the sample clusters of other
    biomes (Fig. 2 A). The phyllosphere and endosphere (only for spinach) biome samples
    ordinated closer with earthworm feces and soil from earthworm beakers than with
    the rhizosphere and bulk soil biomes. For spinach, biomes with samples exposed
    to antibiotics via irrigation with TMW, TMW10, and TMW100 formed sub-clusters
    (highlighted by red ellipse), (Fig. 2 A, p < 0.00001); however, this was not the
    case for the radish biome samples exposed to antibiotics (Fig. 2 B). For the resistome
    (ARGs) beta diversity of spinach and radish, the biome samples clustered together
    (adonis2, p < 0.0001, spinach r2 = 0.85, radish r2 = 0.93, Fig. 2 C, D). The biome
    samples of soil from earthworm beakers (fed with spinach) were dispersed on the
    ordination plot (Fig. 2 C). The rhizosphere and bulk soil biome samples clustered
    together on the ordination plot (Fig. 2 C; highlighted by black ellipse), whereas
    for radish samples, the biomes of earthworm feces and soil from earthworm beakers
    were dissimilar as they positioned apart from each other on the ordination plot
    (Fig. 2 D). The biome samples of earthworm feces exposed to antibiotics via irrigation
    with TMW, TMW10, and TMW100 for the spinach formed a sub-cluster (Fig. 2 C; highlighted
    by red ellipse; p < 0.0001). A strong positive correlation was found between the
    beta diversity of ARGs and microbial community composition for both plants (Spinach:
    Procrustes m2 = 0.14, p < 0.0001; Mantel r = 0.81, P = 0.0001. Radish: Procrustes
    m2 = 0.23, p < 0.0001; Mantel r = 0.77, P = 0.0001). Download : Download high-res

    D, represents beta diversity for ARGs of radish treatments. Regions 1 and 2 in
    the circle are expanded on the righthand side to show details of sample sources.
    For the beta diversity of the spinach and radish VFGs, six biome samples were
    dispersed (adonis2, p < 0.0001, spinach r2 = 0.83, radish r2 = 0.78; Supplementary
    Information, Fig. S2 A, B). For spinach, the biomes in rhizosphere and soil from
    earthworm beakers formed a cluster (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2 A, p <
    0.0001). The exposure to antibiotics via irrigation with TMW, TMW10, TMW100 did
    not influence the beta diversity of VFGs as the biome samples appeared to be dispersed
    on the ordination plots (Supplementary Fig. S2 A, B). The VFG and ARG profiles
    of the spinach biomes (Procrustes m2 = 0.42, p < 0.0001; Mantel r = 0.21, P =
    0.01) showed a positive correlation. However, for radish, the VFG and ARG profiles
    have a negative correlation (Procrustes m2 = 0.46, p < 0.001; Mantel r = −0.01,
    P = 0.74). 3.3. Enrichment of ARGs in soil–plant–earthworm continuum The ARGs
    of antibiotic families shared between the treatments (Table 1 A, B) was represented
    as a bipartite network plot (Fig. 3 A, B). Only genes that were at least 30 %
    of the gene length reported in the database were further considered. The antibiotic
    families are depicted at the center (circled), with the treatments on the corners
    of the network plot (Fig. 3 A, B). The connections indicate the presence of ARGs
    of antibiotic families in each treatment of spinach and radish. In both spinach
    and radish treatments, the majority of ARGs were found to be from the beta-lactam
    and glycopeptide families. Specifically, in biome samples of spinach, ARGs from
    these two families were identified in bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, phyllosphere,
    endosphere, earthworm feces, and soil from earthworm beakers, which represents
    the interconnected soil–plant–earthworm continuum (Fig. 3 A). However, in the
    case of radish, no ARGs from a particular antibiotic family were detected across
    the soil–plant–earthworm continuum (Fig. 3B). Download : Download high-res image

    node represents the sample source, and the red node represents the ARG class.
    The size of the node is proportional to the number of edges connected to the node.
    (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the web version of this article.) The identified ARGs had variable
    gene lengths between 30 % and 100 % of database-reported gene length. Two genes
    are considered homologous if 30 % identical over their database-reported gene
    length (Pearson, 2013). Therefore, including genes with at least 30 % database-reported
    gene length may ensure identification of novel ARG diversity. The median gene
    lengths were ranked (in ascending order) starting with first set of controls (with
    no plants and soil irrigated with MilliQ water), a second set of controls (with
    no plants and soil irrigated with TMW), then radish and spinach plants (Fig. 4
    A). Three times greater number of ARGs were detected in control soil irrigated
    with TMW (number of ARGs 22) than soil irrigated with MilliQ water (Fig. 4 A).
    The number of near complete (80–100 %) ARGs in samples of spinach plants was three
    times greater than that of radish plants. Overall, the spinach plant samples had
    more ARGs than did radish plants (Fig. 4 A). The spinach and radish plants irrigated
    with TMW, TMW10, and TMW100 showed enriched ARGs that confer resistance to the
    antibiotics of trimethoprim and sulfonamide families (Fig. 4 B). Of the two plants
    studied, treatments with spinach plants had twice the number of ARGs that impart
    resistance to antibiotics of trimethoprim and sulfonamides families, when compared
    to radish plants. Additionally, the gene coverage of these ARGs was greater in
    spinach, with the median value greater than that of radish (Fig. 4 B). Download

    ARGs (>30 % complete) of Quinolone, Sulfonamide, and Trimethoprim (added) in spinach
    and radish treatments. C, represents the number of ARGs (>70 % complete) in each
    treatment of spinach and radish pots. D, the abundance of each ARG in spinach
    and radish treatments. Enrichment of ARGs for each treatment was plotted based
    on coverage length of genes and their abundance (diameter of closed circles) (Fig.
    4 C). A more stringent cut-off of a minimum of 70 % database-reported gene length
    was applied to select ARGs for the gene abundance analyses as previously suggested
    (Hu et al., 2013). For spinach and radish, the number and abundance of ARGs with
    ≥70 % database reported gene length coverage varied across the biome samples,
    bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, phyllosphere, endosphere, earthworm feces, and soil
    from earthworm beakers. Genes that impart resistance for antibiotics of the beta-lactam
    and glycopeptide families were common for the bulk soil of spinach and radish
    plant irrigated with MilliQ water, TMW, TMW10, or TMW100. Among the rhizosphere
    biome samples, ARGs for glycopeptide were recorded in all treatments. No ARGs
    (with ≥70 % database-reported gene length) were enriched in the phyllosphere and
    endosphere of spinach and radish plants irrigated with MilliQ water or TMW. The
    bulk soil of spinach plants irrigated with MilliQ water had greater ARG enrichment
    than those irrigated with TMW. Spinach and radish plants exposed to antibiotics
    through irrigation with TMW10 and TMW100 enriched diverse ARGs in the bulk soil
    (Fig. 4 C). No common ARGs (≥70 % database-reported gene length) across bulk soils,
    rhizosphere, phyllosphere, endosphere, earthworm feces, and soil from earthworm
    beakers were recorded. The ARGs for antibiotics of beta-lactam families were enriched
    in the microbiomes of the phyllosphere, endosphere, earthworm feces, and soil
    from earthworm beakers of spinach plants irrigated with TMW10 or TMW100 (Fig.
    4 C). 3.4. Metagenome assembled genomes of antibiotic-resistant bacteria A total
    of 330 bins were obtained from the spinach and radish treatment metagenomes. Only
    bins with >70 % genome completeness and <5 % contamination were assigned as MAGs
    (Bowers et al., 2017, Levin et al., 2021). Due to this stringent cut off, only
    a few MAGs were recovered from spinach and radish plant treatment metagenomes.
    These MAGs were of bacteria that were in high abundance within each sample of
    spinach and radish treatments. Metabolic reconstructions by gene prediction and
    annotations were performed for 78 MAGs. A total 40 MAGs from metagenomes of the
    spinach and radish plants were identified as potential ARB (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). No
    ARB MAGs were recovered from the metagenomes of the bulk soil in the treatments
    without spinach or radish plants and irrigated with MilliQ water. However, a potential
    beta-lactam resistant ARB MAG of the order Vicinamibacterales was recovered from
    the bulk soil in the treatments without spinach and radish plants and irrigated
    with TMW. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    of spinach plant treatments consisted of 33 MAGs that were potential ARB with
    beta-lactam, imipenem, carbapenem resistance, and multidrug resistance efflux
    pumps (Fig. 5 B). The recovered 30 ARBs which potentially impart resistance to
    antibiotic of beta-lactam family (Fig. 5C). Among the beta-lactam resistant ARBs,
    15 of them also have genes that code for MexJK-OprM (multidrug resistance efflux
    pump). The MexJK-OprM efflux pump and imparts resistance to antibiotic of beta-lactam,
    and sulfonamide families. Therefore, most recovered ARBs from spinach plant samples
    were resistant to antibiotic of beta-lactam and sulfonamide families. Interestingly,
    bulk soil from the spinach plant treatment irrigated with MilliQ water harbored
    three ARB MAGs: Pseudomonas e. sp003097075, Massilia sp001426525, and bacteria
    of the family Rhodocyclaceae. The bulk soil irrigated with TMW harbored three
    ARB MAGs: bacteria belonging to genus Massilia, Pseudomonas e. sp900005815, and
    Acidovorax sp001426525. The Massilia sp 001426525 and bacteria of genus Massilia
    had near complete genomes (>90 % complete; Fig. 5 C, D), but only the latter had
    gene coding for carbapenem resistance. No ARB MAGs were recovered from the phyllosphere
    and endosphere when irrigated with MilliQ water or TMW. The spinach plants irrigated
    with TMW10 or TMW100 harbored ARB MAGs in their plant compartments. These ARB
    genomes contained genes that code for imipenem resistance (Fig. 5 B). Acinetobacter
    guillouiae, an ARB with imipenem and carbapenem resistance, colonized the feces
    of spinach-fed earthworms. In our study we did not recover the feces metagenome
    of earthworms that were not fed spinach or radish. Thus, we cannot confirm if
    A. guillouiae is commonly present in earthworm guts and/or feces. However, A.
    guillouiae was not an abundant bacterium recovered as an MAG from the feces microbiome
    of radish-fed earthworms. For the earthworm uptake experiment, spinach plant leaves
    grown with MilliQ water irrigation were subsequently spiked with antibiotics,
    denoted as MilliQ water spiked I (1 mg kg−1 spike), and MilliQ water spiked II
    (10 mg kg−1 spike) (Table 1 B). The feces microbiome of spinach-fed earthworms
    in the MilliQ water spiked I treatment had not only the ARB MAG of A. guillouiae
    but also Sphingobacterium siyangense, Pseudomonas e. putida, and a bacterial MAG
    of flavobacterium (Fig. 5C). No MAGs were recovered from feces of spinach-fed
    earthworms in the MilliQ water spiked II treatment. A. gullouiae MAG was recovered
    from feces of spinach-fed earthworms irrigated with MilliQ water, TMW, TMW10,
    or TMW100. In the case of spinach irrigated with TMW100, three A. gullouiae MAGs
    of near complete genomes were recovered (Fig. 5 C and D), suggesting their abundance
    may have increased in the feces of earthworm with the increase in antibiotics
    exposure. A. gullouiae MAGs were not recovered from the earthworm beaker soil.
    The dominant bacterial species recovered as ARB MAGs in the soil from beakers
    with earthworms fed on spinach irrigated with MilliQ water were Pseudomonas quingdaonensis,
    Achromobacter spanius B, and Stenotrophomonas indicatrix. Stenotrophomonas rhizophila
    MAG was recovered as the dominant bacterial species in the microbiome of soil
    from beakers with earthworm-fed spinach plants irrigated with TMW. No ARB MAGs
    were recovered from soil microbiome inside beakers with earthworm-fed spinach
    plants irrigated with TMW10, TMW100, MilliQ water spiked I, or spiked II, due
    to the recovery of only low-quality bins from the metagenomes. A total of six
    ARB MAGs were recovered from the radish plants bulk soil, rhizosphere, phyllosphere,
    endosphere, earthworm feces, and soil from earthworm beakers metagenomes (Fig.
    6 A–D). The numbers of ARB in radish plants (six) were lower than for spinach
    plant (33) metagenomes. These results were in congruence with the abundance and
    diversity of ARGs in the radish plant treatment metagenomes (Fig. 4 B). Out of
    six ARBs, five potentially impart resistance to antibiotic of beta-lactam family.
    The ARB MAGs were only recovered from radish plant treatment metagenomes that
    were irrigated with TMW, TMW10, or TMW100 (Fig. 6 A–D). The feces microbiome of
    earthworms fed with spinach leaf or radish tuber grown using TMW10 had near complete
    (>90 %) bacterial MAG of genus Leclercia (Fig. 5 C, D and Fig. 6 C, D). The MAG
    recovered from the feces of earthworms fed with spinach leaf was phylogenetically
    classified as Leclercia adecarboxylata B, an emerging pathogen (Shaikhain et al.,
    2021). However, L. adecarboxylata B MAG was not recovered from the feces of earthworms
    that were fed spinach leaf or radish tuber grown with TMW or TMW100 irrigation.
    This was due to the recovery of incomplete bins from the feces of earthworms in
    these treatments. The incomplete bins could not be taxonomically classified. 4.
    Discussion The composition and assembly of microbial communities in soil and plant
    compartments (phyllosphere and endosphere) play a crucial role in the emergence
    and transmission of ARGs within the soil–plant system (Shen et al., 2019). Our
    results showed that the bulk and rhizosphere soils of spinach and radish plant
    treatments irrigated with MilliQ water, TMW, TMW10, or TMW100 had significant
    differences in bacterial community (p < 0.001), ARG (p < 0.001), and VFG (p <
    0.001) diversities (Fig. 1 A, L). These differences in the diversity of microbiomes,
    ARGs, and VFGs could be attributed to the bioaccumulation of residual antibiotics
    in the bulk and rhizosphere soil through the use of TMW, TMW10, or TMW100 for
    irrigation (Ashworth et al., 2023). Unlike the results obtained by Chen et al.
    (Chen et al., 2018), which suggested that abundance of ARGs is higher in rhizosphere
    soil than bulk soil of the Brassica chinensis L., our study highlighted higher
    ARG diversity in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere of spinach and radish irrigated
    with TMW, TMW10, or TMW100 (Fig. 1 E, G). Hence, we observed reduced transmission
    of ARGs to plant compartments such as phyllosphere and endosphere. This was evident
    from the lack of ARGs in the phylloshpere and endosphere (roots and leaves) of
    both spinach and radish plants irrigated with TMW, TMW10, or TMW100. Our observation
    of no ARGs in phyllosphere and endosphere could also be attributed to lower diversity
    of micro-organisms in the leaves of spinach and radish (Fig. 1A and C). The diversity
    of micro-organisms rapidly decreases from bottom (rhizopshere) to top (phyllopshere)
    of the plants (Knief et al., 2012). The plant associated microbial community contributes
    to variation in ARGs (Wang et al., 2020a, Wang et al., 2020b). The relationships
    between the concentration of sulfonamide resistance genes and the total concentration
    of sulfonamides (sulfapyridine, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamerazine,
    sulfamethazine, sulfachlororyridazine and trimethoprim) in water samples showed
    that water samples with more sul genes were found to contain higher levels of
    total sulfonamides residues. These consistent observations provide direct field
    evidence that the fate and transport of ARGs may be correlated to a certain degree
    to antibiotic residues in the environment. The microbial diversity and ARGs in
    soil–plant (spinach and radish) microbiomes were strongly correlated (spinach:
    Procrustes m2 = 0.14, p < 0.0001; Mantel r = 0.81, P = 0.0001; radish: Procrustes
    m2 = 0.23, p < 0.0001; Mantel r = 0.77, P = 0.0001). The bacterial composition
    of both the bulk and rhizosphere soil microbiomes (Fig. 2 A, B) are comparable,
    and the likelihood of the transfer of ARGs from soil to plant was significantly
    elevated through these bacteria. During the plant uptake experiments of the present
    study, Ashworth et al. (Ashworth et al., 2023) noted that residual antibiotics
    bioaccumulated in both the soil and plant (spinach leaf and radish tuber). Because
    the harvested plant materials were fed to earthworms, the bacterial and ARG diversity
    in the phyllosphere and endosphere (leaves only) microbiomes were related to earthworm
    feces and soil from earthworm beakers. Our observations were in line with Yan
    et al. (2023) that conducted a study on silkworm fed with mulberry leaves grown
    near a manganese mine restoration area. These authors reported that ARGs and pathogens
    were more enriched in feces after silkworms ingested those mulberry leaves with
    higher abundance of ARGs (Yan et al., 2023). Plant phenotypes are known to affect
    the microbial community structure as they affect the micro-environmental conditions
    such as nutrients, metabolites, amino acids and water (Chaudhary et al., 2017,
    Chen et al., 2023). These microbial communities impact the ARG enrichment in the
    soil–plant continuum. The result from our study also suggests a strong correlation
    between the microbial communities and ARGs in both spinach and radish plant treatments
    (Spinach: Procrustes m2 = 0.14, p < 0.0001; Mantel r = 0.81, P = 0.0001. Radish:
    Procrustes m2 = 0.23, p < 0.0001; Mantel r = 0.77, P = 0.0001). Our study also
    highlights that the enrichment of ARGs in soil (bulk and rhizosphere) and plant
    (roots and leaves) varies between plant types. As such, in the soil–plant continuum,
    the enrichment of ARGs was observed to be higher (∼1.7 times) in case of spinach
    (n = 488) than radish (n = 277, Fig. 4 A) plant treatments. The ARGs specific
    to TMP, SMZ, and SPD in spinach plant treatments were detected to be twice (∼2.2
    times) as many as in radish (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, our data agreed with several
    studies which reported the effect of plant types on the ARGs dissemination (Dires
    et al., 2019; Man et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023). The enrichment of ARGs (with
    ≥70 % database-reported gene length) was found to decrease between the bulk and
    rhizosphere soil for both spinach radish plants irrigated with TMW, TMW10, or
    TMW100 (Fig. 4 C). This observation was in congruence with earlier findings that
    the diversity of ARGs is higher in bulk soil than in the rhizosphere. Therefore,
    not only the diversity but also the abundance of ARGs was lower in the rhizosphere
    than in the bulk soil of both spinach and radish plants. As mentioned earlier,
    the diversity of plant associated micro-organisms directly impacts the abundance
    and distribution of ARGs in bulk soil, rhizosphere, phyllopshere, and endosphere.
    Our results indicate that the dominant bacterial communities varied with plant
    type. Even though both spinach and radish plants were grown in soil collected
    from the same field site, the dominant bacteria in the microbiomes differed. It
    was also evident that more ARBs colonized the soil (bulk and rhizosphere)–plant
    microbiomes of spinach than of radish. This could be because radish plants associated
    microbial community is less susceptible to enrichment of ARBs after exposure to
    antibiotics. A recent study by Zhang et al., 2020 highlights that edible part
    of cherry radish plants have lower risk of contamination with manure derived ARGs
    than leafy vegetables (Zhang et al., 2020). Bacterial MAGs of the order Vicinamibacterales,
    a potential beta-lactam resistant bacterium, were recovered from the bulk soil
    that had no plants and was irrigated with TMW, suggesting two plausible scenarios:
    (i) the soil environment is a natural reservoir of ARGs (Martínez, 2008), which
    when irrigated with TMW containing low or non-detectable quantities of antibiotics
    can exert a selection pressure leading to horizontal gene transfer events and
    enrichment of ARB in soil; (ii) the ARB could have escaped the tertiary treatment
    process of the WWTP. However, in our study we did not test the cultivable ARB
    in (i) bulk soil before irrigating with TMW and (ii) TMW as collected from the
    WWTP. Additional evidence on the resistance acquired by bacteria due to exposure
    to residual antibiotics and ARGs in TMW through irrigation was recorded in our
    experiment. A bacterial MAG of genus Massilia was recovered from spinach plants
    irrigated with MilliQ water and TMW. Only the bacterial MAG of genus Massilia
    recovered from spinach plants irrigated with TMW had genes that code carbapenem
    - a type of beta-lactams resistance. In a similar finding, Acidovorax sp 001411535,
    ARB MAGs were recovered from the rhizosphere soil of spinach plants irrigated
    with TMW or TMW100. The Acidovorax sp 001411535 MAG recovered from spinach plants
    irrigated with TMW100 had an additional gene that codes for the MexJK-OprM efflux
    pump and imparts resistance towards beta-lactam, sulfonamides, and several other
    antibiotics. It can be argued that bacterial MAGs recovered were incomplete and
    had gaps in the recovered genome. However, the bacterial MAGs of genus Massilia
    and Acidovorax sp 001411535 were near complete (>95 % completeness) and the genes
    that code carbapenem resistance and the MexJK-OprM efflux pump were not at the
    edge of the scaffolds. These findings from our present study suggests that the
    presence of residual antibiotics (Ashworth et al., 2023) and ARGs in TMW could
    apply a selection pressure on the soil–plant microbiomes, leading to the acquisition
    of ARGs through mechanisms such as horizontal gene transfer events (Sun et al.,
    2019). It is worth noting that the three antibiotics discussed in the present
    study were not the only compounds in the treated wastewater (other compounds could
    be under detection limit of our LC-MS/MS). Thus, the presence of unrelated ARRs
    from other class of compound is plausible. Our results showed that earthworms
    in the soil microbiome harbored significantly different bacterial communities.
    This is likely due to earthworm activities such as (i) burrowing changes to the
    soil structure; (ii) soil ingestion modifying soil microbial communities; (iii)
    competition for food resources, and (iv) excretion impacting the soil chemistry
    (Bertrand et al., 2015, Blakemore and Hochkirch, 2017, Gong et al., 2018). Not
    only do earthworms directly alter the food sources for plants and soil fauna through
    excretion but they also provide nutrients to the soil microbial community. Therefore,
    to account for the earthworm microbiome and its impact on the soil microbial community
    we investigated their feces. Spinach and radish plants grown using MilliQ water,
    TMW, TMW10, or TMW100 irrigation water were fed to earthworms in a separate experiment
    with soil collected from same experimental plots. Interestingly, the earthworm
    feces microbiome and the soil from the earthworm beakers shared similar microbial
    and ARG diversity (Fig. 2 A–D). However, the diversity of ARB in the microbiome
    was generally different between spinach and radish plants, except in the case
    of plants irrigated with TMW10. The feces of earthworms fed with spinach leaves
    had a dominant population of Acinetobacter guillouiae, an ARB MAG, across most
    treatments. In the case of fecal microbiomes of earthworms fed with spinach plants
    irrigated with TMW100, three A. guillouiae MAGs were recovered. Therefore, the
    abundance of ARB such as A. guillouiae increased in the feces of earthworm fed
    with plants that had been exposed to increased concentrations of antibiotics via
    irrigation with TMW100. This observation could be due to increased bioaccumulation
    of antibiotics in the spinach leaves irrigated with TMW100, as reported by Ashworth
    et al. (Ashworth et al., 2023). However, no ARB were recovered from the feces
    of earthworms fed with radish grown using MilliQ water irrigation. This indicates
    that the bacterial composition of the feces microbiome can vary depending on the
    type of plant and antibiotics that bioaccumulated in the plant tissues consumed
    by the earthworms. Earthworms have been shown to play a role in mitigating ARGs
    in soil (Zhu et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2021). Our study focused on the enrichment
    of ARGs in the earthworm feces–bulk soil microbiome when fed harvested plant material
    (leaves and tubers). The plant materials contained residual antibiotics, which
    were either bioaccumulated from irrigation water or spiked onto their surface.
    (Ashworth et al., 2023). The enrichment of ARGs increased and diversified with
    increasing concentrations of residual antibiotics in TMW, TMW10, or TMW100. However,
    earthworms fed spiked plant material (Spiked I and II) had low ARG enrichment
    (Fig. 4 C, D). This indicates that residual antibiotics that accumulate in the
    compartments of plants (leaves of spinach and tubers of radish) are more readily
    bioavailable to earthworms than those artificially applied to the surface of plant
    materials (Ashworth et al., 2023). The study may provide evidence that irrigation
    of plants often eaten raw or minimally cooked like spinach and radish with TMW
    containing residual antibiotics (Ashworth et al., 2023) may pose a risk of dissemination
    of antimicrobial resistance across the soil–plant–invertebrate continuum. We recovered
    a near complete genome (>90 % complete) of bacterial MAGs of genus Leclercia and
    Leclercia adecarboxylata B from the feces of earthworm microbiome that was fed
    harvested radish tubers and spinach leaves grown on TMW10 irrigated waters. Recovery
    of a near complete MAG suggests their high abundance in the microbiome. Leclercia
    adecarboxylata B is an emerging pathogen that has been reported to cause infection
    in immunocompromised patients and may lead to health complications and death (Shaikhain
    et al., 2021). MAGs affiliated with L. adecarboxylata B were not recovered from
    the fecal microbiome of earthworms fed with spinach and radish plants irrigated
    with TMW and TMW100, which could be due to their low abundance in feces. However,
    the crops irrigated with TMW containing residual antibiotics and ARGs may lead
    to increased incidences of enrichment of ARB in the soil–plant–invertebrate continuum.
    Some limitations of our study may be that the TMW was only found to contain three
    compounds (although we scanned for others). Using only these three compounds may
    have limited the types/levels of AMR that developed. Also, there is limited data
    regarding contaminants in treated municipal wastewater, their presence, concentrations,
    plant uptake, and viability of micro-organisms in both soil and crops irrigated
    with treated municipal wastewater. We need these kinds of data for risk assessment
    and mitigation strategies. As mentioned earlier in results, antibiotic resistance
    databases can have limitations. In our study a high number of ARGs belonging to
    beta-lactam and glycopeptide families were detected. This could be due to higher
    representation of gene belonging to glycopeptide and beta-lactam in the NDARO
    database (Papp and Solymosi, 2022) Results from Papp and Solymosi also showed
    high number of genes that impart resistance against antibiotic of beta-lactam
    and glycopeptide families (Papp and Solymosi, 2022). ARGs were also detected in
    spinach and radish samples irrigated with MilliQ water, which could be due to
    soil being a natural reservoir of antibiotic resistance gene (Martínez, 2008).
    Another limitation of this study is that we did not analyze viable pathogens to
    determine their AMR levels. Yalin et al. (2023) suggested that the recent proposal
    for a directive of the European Union (EU) Parliament and Council concerning urban
    wastewater treatment (COM/2022/541 final) dictates that by 2025 large WWTPs need
    to periodically monitor AMR indicators (Yalin et al., 2023). They noted future
    criteria for irrigation with TMW could require monitoring for target levels of
    specific AMR indicators in the EU and beyond. 5. Conclusion The soil–plant–invertebrate
    continuum is susceptible to the spread of AMR when irrigated with TMW containing
    residual antibiotics. Our study highlights that the development and dissemination
    of AMR in agriculture may vary with the type of crop; for example, spinach enriched
    more ARGs than did radish in the soil–plant–earthworm continuum. Further, exposure
    to antibiotics via irrigation of plants with TMW impacted the diversity of the
    soil microbial community and enriched ARGs and ARB in soil. We observed that a
    low abundance and diversity of ARGs in the rhizosphere soil impeded their transfer
    to plant compartments, such as the phyllosphere and endosphere. But this does
    not necessarily reduce the dissemination of AMR in agriculture. In addition, the
    effect of ARGs dissemination from irrigation of TMW containing residual antibiotic
    on soil- plant- invertebrate continuum study could be a safety warning on agricultural
    water source for leafy greens. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ananda

    harvestingNB-IoTSDN 1. Introduction One of the most important pillars of human
    society is agriculture. According to the food and agriculture organization (FAO),
    to cater the needs of growing population, food (FAO, 2009) production need to
    be increased by 70–65 % in 2050. Farmers must put in more effort while using the
    traditional agricultural approach, which also uses resources inefficiently. Several
    issues, including population expansion, climatic circumstances, a shortage of
    resources, etc., occur from this ancient farming approach. The term smart agriculture
    refers to digital farming practices that are used to maximize effectiveness instead
    (Javaid et al., 2022) of capability. This system performs structured and optimal
    input and output analytics through smart technologies, objective-focused analysis,
    planning, and monitoring. As a result of collecting and pooling analytical data
    using advanced sensor, a methodology group is built that is optimized for achieving
    this objective-oriented analysis. For monitoring and managing agricultural operations,
    this cutting-edge technology combines Internet of Things (IoT) networks, devices,
    AI, and big data analytics. Through the use of diverse electronic, biochemical,
    and electrical sensors and actuators, various farming field data can be collected,
    and through this data, different sub-operations of farming applications can be
    developed. Using IoT to monitor crops (Sreekantha and Kavya A.M., 2017), detect
    diseases and pests, predict crop yields, robotics-based harvesting of crops, and
    much more. The creation of a wireless sensor network (WSN) can be accomplished
    using various types of wireless connections, each with a range, bandwidth, and
    topology that varies. A novel kind of wireless network can be built using topologies
    like bus, star, and mesh and a variety of communication technologies including
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, LTE-M, thread, Sigfox, etc. to communicate data from one node
    to another about the farming field. The edge gateway layer where all sensor node
    data are stored and processed for further analysis is connected to this sensor
    network. The data can be communicated to a different distributed network over
    the internet to a cloud server for additional analysis and monitoring at the user
    end by using application protocols like “Hypertext transfer protocol” (HTTP),
    “Message queuing telemetry transport protocol” (MQTT), etc. The gateway can be
    utilized as single-board microcontrollers and computers similar the Raspberry
    Pi (Charania and Li, 2020). Digital transformation is the main advancement in
    agricultural development which (Baryshnikova et al., 2022) transforms 1.0 into
    5.0 in the twenty-first century. The key to advancing digital transformation in
    smart agriculture from version 5.0 to version 6.0 is the development of wireless
    communication technology. A number of wireless communication technologies, including
    “Long Range Radio (LoRa)”, Radio frequency module (RFM69)“, ”Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)“,
    and ”SigFox“ etc (Hidayat et al., 2020) have been utilised in agriculture. It
    is possible to create a secure smart farm system, also known as a 5G beyond Smart
    agriculture system (Tomaszewski et al., 2022) by fusing several technologies including
    IoT, Edge computing, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and Blockchain
    (Andreadis et al., 2022, Kasera et al., 2022). The ability to manage and achieves
    a variety of computing workloads and necessities for storage can be encouraged
    by developing a hybrid or dispersed sensor network employing cloud computing and
    edge computing. In this regard, edge computing will be able to regulate jobs that
    demand speed or limitations on connectivity. In addition, cloud computing will
    be able to accommodate operations that demand higher processing capabilities,
    for instance, machine learning (MCLRN), as well as managing enormous volumes of
    data by utilizing load-balancing techniques. From this type of technologies farmers
    will be able to access farming field status remotely and the system will be entirely
    automated through interoperability between machines (Li et al., 2021). Considering
    the research strategy that was used to write this review article is discussed

    Fig. 1 denotes the simplified structure of how the review article is organized.
    Based on pre-, during-, and post-harvesting operations, the various IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture literature has been identified and categorized. After classifying
    and reading the literature, each pre-harvesting, during-harvesting, and post-harvesting
    operations’ existing subsystems have been thoroughly discussed and its weaknesses
    analyzed. This analysis has been accomplished based on the IoT-enabled technologies,
    data set gathering, and approaches that have been used in the past and it also
    includes an overall thorough assessment of the pre-, during-, and post-harvesting
    subsystem''s research gaps. Based on this research gap a modified 5G IoT-based
    smart agriculture framework has been proposed to reduce the shortcomings of the
    existing work. The Pre-harvest to post-harvest activities have been categorized
    in this article to explain the existing work for the smart farming system. The
    classification of pre- to post-harvest activities is presented in the Fig. 2.

    2. Pre-harvesting system (PHRS) Throughout the pre-harvest process, there are
    a number of land preparation (LPR) sub-activities that considerably increase agricultural
    yield. Researchers, scientists, and engineers have made a number of advancements
    in the past to create a smart PHRS using smart agriculture technology (Gaikwad
    et al., 2021), that can choose the crop in advance depending on climate conditions,
    region, area, etc. and prepare the land for production. The sub-areas of PHRS
    that are used when preparing the land for farming are depicted in Fig. 3. Download

    PHRS subsystem classification. 2.1. Crop yield prediction (CYP) IoT-based method
    for yield prediction in which sensor node data is shared with data centers (Gayatri
    et al., 2015) and made available to the sons of the soil. To anticipate agricultural
    yield, supervised MCLRN is carried out utilizing (Kumar et al., 2020) the “Random
    Forest” (RADF) and “Decision tree” (DT) algorithm. In this situation the RADF''s
    accuracy is superior compared to the DT''s. A two-tier MCLRN model called the
    “adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN)” and the “Extreme Learning
    Machine algorithm (ELM)” were proposed to predict crop yield. By applying ELM
    to (Gupta and Nahar, 2023) increase performance accuracy, the suggested system
    optimize the weights using a modified version of the Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm
    (mBOA). The creation of an algorithm for predicting crop yield (Bhojani and Bhatt,
    2020) three new activation functions called “DharaSig,” “DharaSigm,” and “SHBSig”
    are employed to enhance the neural network''s performance on agricultural datasets.
    K Closest neighbor procedure is employed to identify the crop that is most acceptable
    (Gajula et al., 2021). For the purpose of forecasting the yield of the sorghum
    crop, (Jayaram and Marad, 2012) a fuzzy inference approach is implemented. A fuzzy
    model''s input tools are physio-morphological features. Due to estimates and ambiguity,
    the model''s performance depends on quantum data. A method for managing massive
    data and predicting crop productivity three different types of (Fan et al., 2015)
    approaches have been employed that is MapReduce weather data for computing large
    datasets; nearest neighbor weather data for comparing distances across like years;
    and, finally, an “Autoregressive moving average” (ARMA) model for forecasting.
    To determine crop yield, a “Support vector machine” (SVM) and DT approach are
    used. While choosing (Reshma et al., 2020) features for a specific location, factors
    like soil type, temperature, humidity, groundwater level, local population, farmers''
    availability, variety of plantations, and variety of farmed land were taken into
    account. Analysis has been conducted based on these traits to determine the optimal
    crop. A mixed MCLRN approach was put forth to estimate agricultural yield. The
    most precise (Anbananthen et al., 2021) MCLRN prediction from two models is combined
    using the stacking generalization model. Cross-validation is used to evaluate
    a hybrid MCLRN model''s performance to that of other MCLRN models for evaluation.
    For the purpose of predicting agricultural yield (Sajja et al., 2021) an MCLRN
    simulation is designed, where crop segments are built up experimentally for the
    training of models using SVM, random forest, and ID3. In which case SVM outperforms
    other methods. The key advantage of the current CYP is that most systems classify
    soil nutrients and geographic data for crop yield prediction using data mining
    techniques like KNN, ID3 and fuzzy inference systems, which produce superior prediction
    outcomes. The geographic information was gathered using a GPS approach that is
    IoT-enabled. The RGB-D camera is utilized as a mobile platform to enhance the
    CYP. Crop quality, data-driven decision-making, cost reduction, and resource optimization
    are all improved by using IoT-enabled data mining approaches. The shortcomings
    of the existing techniques are as follows: prediction based on time series analysis,
    area-wise analysis, soil quality analysis, country-wise analysis, and geospatial
    analysis remain to be explored. There is no hybrid MCLRN algorithm for handling
    huge datasets. Full IoT based system still need to be worked upon. 2.2. Crop selection
    (CSL) Enhancing Agricultural Sustainability through Crowdsensing (Ginige and Sivagnanasundaram,
    2019) a mobile-based agricultural information-sharing system is developed for
    monitoring real-time farming activities (CSL LPR, “seed selection”, “seed sowing”,
    “irrigation, “crop growth”, “fertilizing”, and “harvesting”) with the help of
    a crop calendar marker. IoT-based system for crop selection and monitoring precision
    farming (Bhojwani et al., 2020) various sensors are employed to measure environmental
    variables and interface with the microprocessor. An IoT gateway using ESP8266
    sends the data acquired to a cloud server. On the basis of data collected earlier
    from the cloud server, the existing working model uses K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
    to estimate prospective predictions to be able to make precise decisions about
    what crops to grow in a particular environment. Maximize the crop yield (Kumar
    et al., 2015) for selecting which crops to cultivate over a season the MCLRN method
    predict yield rates based on environmental variables including weather, soil type,
    water density, and crop type. Smart agriculture-based crop selection analysis
    utilising (Tseng et al., 2019) big data a platform is created to track environmental
    elements on a farm and use those environmental factors to evaluate farmers'' agricultural
    practices. The findings suggest that farmers can determine a crop''s suitability
    for their land with greater insight. This is so they can take a look at things
    like soil moisture levels and temperature. The suggested environmental factor
    analysis methodology aids farmers in learning which crops they can produce. In
    order to optimize food production (Udutalapally et al., 2021) an innovative agricultural
    solution is proposed that uses AI and IoT for selecting crops, disease monitoring,
    and automated irrigation systems. The fuzzy MULTIMOORA technology on (Balezentiene
    et al., 2013) language and numerical reasoning is provided as a fuzzy-based system
    for crop selection in Lithuanian climatic conditions. “Johnson''s reduct” classifier
    method is used (Deepa and Ganesan, 2019) to produce classification rules for three
    crops, including rice, “groundnut”, and “sugarcane”, in a decision-based system
    for crop selection. According to present environmental (Bakthavatchalam et al.,
    2022) circumstances a system has been established for precision agriculture that
    uses IoT and classifier-based MCLRN algorithms to recommend the crop for irrigation
    and acquire the highest yield. AI for characterization and forecasting the (Amkor
    and El Barbri, 2023) results of potato samples cultivated with “Nitrogen”, “Phosphorus”,
    “Potassium” (NPK) fertilizers has been suggested in which KNNs are used for classification
    and nonlinear autoregressive models for prediction. Machine learning and artificial
    intelligence advancements for the existing CSL system improve the decision-making
    for planting crops according to climate conditions and location. By using IoT-enabled
    solar power-based crop recommendation systems, energy consumption is reduced.
    Genetic optimization is the most common method for optimizing CSL performance.
    Crop guidance is improved when weather conditions are forecasted through the development
    of a crop calendar-based system. Some of the shortcomings may be as follows: the
    current CSL solution lacks self-sustainability, testing for additional crops,
    security of sensor node data, system optimization, and subsystem integration.
    2.3. Seed selection (SSL) A tillage drip architecture is used for recommending
    seeds for (Indira et al., 2018) planting. Additionally, it discusses how effective
    seed selection based on soil can produce precise results. Seed selection is possible
    in the first phase, automatic watering is covered in the second phase, and plant
    disease diagnosis is covered in the third phase. A computer vision to identify
    (Koklu and Ozkan, 2020) different dry bean seed kinds the user interface was created
    using MATLAB, and 13,611 grains of seven different types of dry beans were photographed.
    The model has undergone 20-fold cross-validation and has been constructed using
    a variety of MCLRN classification methods, including MLP, SVM, KNN, and DT. When
    compared to other classification model results, SVM performance performed better.
    Deep-learning methods for seed classification were proposed in which fourteen
    (Hamid et al., 2022) different types of seeds were gathered and pre-trained using
    “MobileNetV2″ to create a model. The trained model claimed accuracy of 98 % on
    the training set and 95 % on the test set after rigorous experiments, extensive
    pre-processing, and fine-tuning. The advantage of the current SSL system is that
    it chooses the appropriate seeds for individual fields using a computer vision-based
    method based on MCLRN and AI. Water, insecticides, and fertilisers may all be
    used more efficiently by farmers. This has good effects on the environment in
    addition to lowering costs. The existing work lacks a fully automated system and
    limited use of data. Need more research for various types of seed classification
    based on climate condition, geographical region wise, and land wise. 2.4. Seed
    germination (SGM) Proposed and created a smart germination assistance (SGA) system
    for SGM. “Temperature”, “humidity”, “light intensity”, “moisture”, and soil “pH”
    are all factors that (Islam et al., 2019) affect SGM. Using particular sensors,
    the system continuously measures the values of various factors in the surrounding
    environment. Each sensor reading from a different seed is kept and connected to
    an ideal value. Using a low-power embedded system (Shadrin et al., 2019) an AI
    method is proposed that can recognise SGM dynamics without necessitating heavy
    data transfer between nearby nodes. 97 % accuracy is attained with a “convolutional
    neural networks” (CNNs) model for seed recognition. A system based on the IoT
    was proposed to monitor, manage, and (Theparod and Harnsoongnoen, 2022) collect
    data regarding the effects of narrow-band light emitting diodes (LEDs) on sunflower
    nodes. With the help of “narrow-band LEDs” and dynamic germination, it was found
    through research that the germination of sunflower seeds was more successful in
    the red-light zones. IoT-based study is carried out for indoor tomato SGM (Seyar
    and Ahamed, 2023) systems at thresholds. Where transplanted seedlings were grown
    outdoors with a comparison of two irrigation systems using soil water balance
    methods with a long-range LoRa communication system, and the subsurface drip irrigation
    system produced the highest seedling levels of growth based on agronomical parameters
    at a 12 % threshold. A feature of the current SGM system is the usage of a LoRa-based
    data communication system for various modules during the SGM process, such as
    irrigation and seed growing status. For the dynamic seed germination process,
    the usage of IoT-based “narrow-band LEDs” produces better results. The system
    in place uses only one type of seed for testing, and it is not entirely IoT-based.
    As a result, there is a lack of a fully validated testbed system that uses an
    ideal sensor, is self-sustaining, and can be utilised for other crops. The current
    system still has flaws as it does not deal with plant biomass growth, flowering,
    fruits, and other types of crops utilising IoT-based technique and image processing
    algorithm. 2.5. Drought or flood monitoring (DFM) A “WPART” IoT-enabled smart
    farming system is established that uses MCLRN (Rezk et al., 2021) to anticipate
    crop productivity and drought for informed decision-making. The following data
    factors are used to pick features: year, month, rainfall, temperature, air pressure,
    season, crop, “area”, “production”, and productivity. An IoT-based tackle has
    been put up for agricultural drought (Ping, 2014) data transmission and accumulating.
    The outcome shows that the system''s data capture and transmission performance
    is flawless, and it has good application value for gathering and analysing agricultural
    drought data. An MCLRN/IoT-based flood tracking system is portrayed (Rani et al.,
    2020) to gauge the water level in a flood-prone site. The intensity of floods
    is gauged using raindrop and water sensors. An IoT-based dam water monitoring
    alerting system is developed (Ganesh et al., 2022) for calculating how much rain
    fell, one may determine how much water will be released from the dam. The signal
    is analysed and judgements are made using the Arduino UNO. IoT data collection
    in real-time and MCLRN analysis and drought result prediction are two benefits
    of the current DFM. For obtaining and analysing data on agricultural drought,
    the gearbox performance is faultless, and it has strong application value. Absence
    of a long-term analysis based on previously established value and absence of coverage
    based on humidity and rainfall across a vast area were observed. There is lack
    of long-distance data connection methods in remote fields. The absence of dark
    shadow detection in the current technology makes it difficult to detect noisy
    pixels values in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for flooded regions, which can
    lead to erroneous data. 2.6. Soil testing and measurement (STM) The optical transducer
    is used as a detecting sensor. This sensor (Goswami et al., 2020) comprises of
    three LEDs as a light source and an as “Light detector” (LDR) for assessing the
    results of soil tests performed on four distinct types of soils. Each nutrient''s
    threshold values divide its level into three voltage levels: Low, Mid, and High.
    A technique for monitoring soil health utilising four dynamic parameters was developed.
    In which the (Ramson et al., 2021) effectiveness of a network made up of nine
    soil health monitoring units was tested over the course of several weeks in an
    agricultural field site. Soil sensing, wireless range, power consumption, life
    expectancy, and implementation cost were all evaluated. An IoT-powered soil health
    tracking (Sengupta et al., 2021) approach that can manage agricultural parameters
    has been created. The variations in stimuli, including those related to light,
    heat, sound, motion, magnetic fields, etc., are converted into electrical signals
    by a sensor node and then processed and graphically displayed by the Thingspeak
    cloud server. Using cellphones or personal computers, a methodology is proposed
    for sensing (Saikia and Khatoon, 2022) the percentage of wetness of the soil and
    temperature remotely and continuously. Raspberry Pi-based soil nutrient monitoring
    system for tomato plantations is proposed using various soil sensors (Manickam,
    2020) such as PH and Soil NPK sensors for monitoring the soil continuously. The
    present STM''s strongest point is its use of an IoT-enabled method to assess soil
    health. Thanks to the existing technology that farmers can precisely administer
    fertilisers, insecticides, and water based on the soil''s nutrients, PH, and type,
    crop disease is reduced, and crop yields are increased. There are still lack of
    sensor assessment based on a specified period, in-depth data analysis, additional
    parameters for optimising soil testing in various existing activities etc. There
    is a demand for an affordable, universal solution that can be used to all kinds
    of farms. 2.7. Weather prediction & monitoring (WPM) An agro weather station (AWS)
    that is intended for farmers and researchers is (Faid et al., 2021) develop using
    four layers: perception, transmission, presentation, and administration. For various
    end users, it offers frequently data and AI-based insights. IoT-based intelligent
    energy-efficient approaches have been originated for monitoring and managing greenhouse
    interior temperatures. Many (Subahi and Bouazza, 2020) simulations utilizing a
    greenhouse temperature transfer function are run to show the usefulness of the
    recommended strategy. For temperature and irrigation control a computerized procedure
    is acquired. Using an Android app that connects (Kori et al., 2021) to the controller,
    many agricultural parameters, including as temperature, humidity, soil wetness,
    and rainfall, are tracked and visualised. A strategy to schedule weather forecasts
    was put out in order to foresee (Li et al., 2019) adoption of weather prediction
    information as well as future energy harvesting values based on historical harvesting
    values. A low-cost solar-powered (Devapal, 2020) soil and weather analysis system
    has been offered that looks at different soil properties and weather patterns
    to set up a high-tech smart farm for farmers. IoT, data mining, and android mobile
    applications are all used in the system''s development. Integrating a provincial
    weather station with dual modules to serve as a LoRa-based soil sensor node (Singh
    et al., 2022) for scrutinizing the state of the soil and the weather. During experiment,
    a LoRa portable communication device and an IoT cloud are used to transmit meteorological
    data. Constructed, and tested a flexible (El-magrous et al., 2019) meteorological-soil
    sensor station for acquiring site-specific maps of soil elements, atmospheric
    information, and yield information for the 2018 soybeans season of cultivation.
    Farmers were able to make well-informed decisions on soil selection, irrigation,
    planting, and harvesting thanks to the use of sophisticated tools for weather
    forecasting and data from already-existing systems. The existing weather monitoring
    and forecasting systems have a number of drawbacks, including the absence of AI
    fault detection approaches, a lack of integration with the existing IoT-based
    agriculture system, and a lack of optimize long-range communication technologies.
    There is a need for an intelligent weather system that can identify the soil''s
    nutritional needs and suggest a suitable crop. 2.8. Soil digging (SDG) To enhance
    tillage processes more significant by fusing IoT, “cloud computing”, and “Decision
    support system” (DESS) technologies (Fawzi et al., 2021) the ”Tillage Operations
    Quality Optimization (TOQO)“ model is constructed using two levels: ”Tillage Depth
    1 (TD1)“ and ”Tillage Depth 2 (TD2)“. TD1 = 10–15 cm and TD2 = 25–30 cm. The TOQO
    standard''s tested results improve long-term evolution for the agribusiness by
    maximizing farmer expenditures, accelerating field productivity, and optimizing
    tillage routines. Real-time monitoring of soil-digging machinery, which enables
    farmers to optimise the depth and spacing of rows or holes, is a strength of the
    current system. This accuracy supports resource utilisation that is efficient
    and minimises reductions in waste. Due to the significant differences in soil
    properties, such as moisture content and hardness, the current system needs to
    be improved in terms of performance, affordability, and sensor calibration. Analysis
    to reduce the environmental impact of soil tilling is still lacking in the system.
    More accurate measurements may be possible by the use of the cutting-edge MCLRN
    algorithm. The average growth rate of research publications published between
    2012 and 2023 for PHRS applications that are based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other
    techniques is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (193KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Publication growth rate analysis of PHRS application
    based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. The growth
    rate of publication has been assessed based on the quantity of articles published
    in a given year for a specific PHRS application, such as CYP, CSL, SSL, SGM, DFM,
    STM, WPM, and SDG, and the average growth rate analysis has been assessed based
    on the overall quantity of publications for PHRS application year-wise. As observed
    in Fig. 4 graph, a growing number of publications based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and
    other approaches for PHRS application are made each year, with a high percentage
    of IoT-based PHRS applications. Thus, it can be concluded that the number of PHRS-based
    smart agriculture applications is growing steadily as a result of the convergence
    of IoT, edge, cloud, and AI technologies. 3. During harvesting system (DHRS) After
    preparing the land for the cultivation of crops, there are numerous sub-operations
    engaged during harvesting. The subsystem of the DHRS is shown in Fig. 5. Using
    cutting-edge technologies to automate crop monitoring and irrigation (IoT, MCLRN,
    Data Mining, etc.). It not only emphasises the value of improved production but
    also strongly emphasises data analytics and environmental sustainability. This
    is done to assess the needs and anticipate the compatibility of crops and fertilisers
    in light of the soil and environment. Download : Download high-res image (261KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. DHRS subsystem classification. A wireless
    sensor network is essential for the implementation of smart agriculture (Haseeb
    et al., 2020). There are numerously IoT-enabled prior related work that has been
    done (Ahmed et al., 2018, Anagha et al., 2023, Sah Tyagi et al., 2021) in the
    domain of during the harvesting process. 3.1. Smart irrigation (SIR) Low-cost
    intelligent smart irrigation system using IoT is proposed in three modules. Combined
    (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) sensor module, irrigation module, and sensor communication
    module. The combined sensor module is used to access crop, plantation, and soil-related
    information. After accessing sensor monitoring data it uses a neural network model
    to make an intelligent decision. These decisions are sent to an irrigation module
    and sensor communication module. The aforementioned data determines whether the
    water machine has to be turned on or off in a certain location. The system keeps
    track of incoming data, and the sensor communication module logs it via the MQTT
    broker. The “AtMega 328” microcontroller and (Saraf and Gawali, 2017) Zigbee communications
    are used to monitor and control sensor data in the existing work. Each field''s
    central node stores sensor data in the cloud database. The report on automatic
    irrigation is delivered to a user via an Android application. An intelligent irrigation
    (Alomar and Alazzam, 2018) system is achieved using IoT and fuzzy logic. As environmental
    variables, air climate and humidity sensors, soil wetness sensors, and light intensity
    sensors are used. By utilizing all the sensor information, a Mamdani fuzzy controller
    controls the flow of water. IoT, a DPLRN, and fuzzy computation are combined to
    form an ecosystem for creating a self-sustaining irrigation system. Soil wetness,
    atmospheric (P. Patel et al., 2022) variables, and the state of crops are all
    input variables in this operational simulation. Leveraging the Raspberry Pi, a
    device called an IoT gateway allows for uploading data to the cloud. To estimate
    if a crop is healthy or slumping, an assortment of DPLRN algorithms are used.
    In order to determine the appropriate time to irrigate the crops, all measured
    input variables are analyzed with a fuzzy logic controller. RFID and sensors to
    establish an efficient farm tracking framework exploiting (Saha et al., 2022)
    “Long range wide area network” (LoRaWAN) protocol with six distinct harvesting
    issues, prohibiting fungal attacks on crops, screening cattle, appropriate watering,
    accurate soil wellness inspection, accurate inspection of crops, and enhancing
    productivity. It maintains appropriate irrigation while conserving water by using
    incredibly effective temperature and humidity sensors. Four distinct categories
    of sensors are used in the soil and crop wellness tracking system to gauge the
    “NDVI” readings of the crops, the “pH” rating of the soil, the percentage of nutrients
    that are contained in the soil, the soil''s compaction, and the amount of water
    in the soil. Cowlar is used by the cattle monitoring system to continuously check
    on the health of the cows. Smart farm decision-making powered by IoT and the cloud
    system that has been designed in order to communicate sensor (Lova Raju and Vijayaraghavan,
    2022) data using “NRF24L01” modules. A suitable irrigation is schedule in which
    the author, without (Sayanthan et al., 2018) the assistance of labour, employed
    an Arduino soil moisture analyzer to measure water requirements at various phases
    of eggplant growth. Using an “Arduino Uno R3” board and an “Arduino DUE”, the
    (Jamroen et al., 2020) intelligent irrigation system is scheduled. For data connectivity,
    the “NRF24L01” module is intended. The current method guards against crop water
    stress situations using a fuzzy inference system. The MCLRN-enabled autonomous
    watering mechanism has been constructed. The raspberry pi and (Vij et al., 2020)
    Arduino mega are two different types of microcontrollers employs in this method.
    The Arduino Mega is equipped with a number of sensors. Arduino Mega sends sensor
    data to Raspberry Pi through the wifi module. Weather data will be retrieved using
    an open-source Application programing interface (API), and a raspberry pi will
    operate to alert a system using weather data and sensor node data. A soil type''s
    propensity for irrigation is predicted using MCLRN. A way to regulating irrigation
    (Mohammed et al., 2023) systems using DPLRN that takes into account the moisture
    and soil structure. In their methodology, soil pictures and moisture sensors are
    used to gather data, which is then processed using real-time videos to determine
    the crop''s need for irrigation and moisture levels. A “VGG-19” model analyses
    the type of image and crop seeded to predict irrigation needs. “TensorFlow” lite
    is used to run experiments on cheap computational hardware and test the proposed
    model on a private dataset. A remote irrigation water pump monitoring, management,
    and (Kirar, 2022) security is developed. The sensors used in this work to detect
    supply voltage and motor current to estimate operating conditions and offer protection.
    The user receives the measured parameters via the SIM900 GSM component regarding
    the intent of remote oversight and management. The Android application was created
    with a better user interface, timer-based functionality, notifications for feedback
    and pump status, among other features. An ATmega 328P microprocessor that is included
    into the Arduino Uno board protects the pump. To track agricultural factors like
    temperature and relative humidity (Hamouda and Elhabil, 2017) a greenhouse smart
    management mechanism is suggested. The watering and cooling of greenhouses are
    managed and controlled automatically by the system. An intelligent system is created
    to track and control several subsystems, including irrigation, (Cecchetti and
    Ruscelli, 2022) lighting, heating, and solar. To enable sensor data to be connected
    to the farm Ethernet network, RS485 bus Ethernet convertor is employed. Automation
    of the heating system, irrigation system, circulation pump, and solenoid valve
    are accomplished using a relay board coupled to a Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller,
    which is controlled using the HTTP. PHP scripts handle the system''s overall business
    logic. A connected device WSN is created using the “SIXFAB” module (Kiani and
    Seyyedabbasi, 2018) to irrigate crops in agricultural fields, and the Arduino
    component of the module transmits data to a Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway. One
    of the strengths of the existing SIR system is its use of WSNs and machine learning
    techniques for monitoring and scheduling irrigation of crops for large and small
    farming fields by collecting wet and dry soil data according to the climate and
    soil condition, which ensures crops are irrigated at the right time and irrigation
    systems optimize crop growth. There should be irrigation and crop-specific field
    monitoring, which are weaknesses of the current approaches. The current system
    relies on a single kind of irrigation for a variety of crops. There are lackings
    of self-sustaining system and sensor calibration system. Based on the soil nutrients,
    moisture, temperature, and humidity, more data analysis needs to be done. Heuristic
    techniques for improving irrigation and minimising water use are still lacking.
    To prevent water waste for different crops, the water irrigation system can be
    scheduled or rain harvesting strategies need to be used. Transparency of sensor
    data is lacking. The current process is unable to communicate with another system.
    The system''s performance can be enhanced by using simple cryptographic techniques
    to safeguard data flowing from all the sensors. Communication over long distances
    for data is still unpredictable. 3.2. Soil health monitoring and fertilizer management
    (SHMFM) A methodical approach that accumulates instantaneous data from the farm
    site, such as light strength, wetness of the soil, surface temperature, humidity,
    etc was proposed to provide local access (Bachuwar et al., 2018) to soil temperature,
    humidity, soil wetness, and light intensity, an ESP826612E transmits sensor data
    over a Wi-Fi network using the “IEEE 802.11” protocol. A method to produce data
    sources made up of temperature, humidity, and N, P, and K nutrient content (Rahman
    et al., 2019) that are produced from soil data sensor readings. In order to create
    a soil fertility data warehouse, sensor data is uploaded using IoT technologies.
    By combining Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) in
    a novel NPK sensor (G et al., 2020) an IoT-based system took into account. To
    determine whether N, P, and K deficiencies exist in the soil chosen for testing,
    the Mamdani inference procedure is used. At regular intervals, the farmer is alerted
    to the quantity of fertilizer to be applied. A technique that (Postolache et al.,
    2022) can aid in the evaluation of changes in soil nutrients for more effective
    administration of drainage and fertiliser control. The appliance may gather information
    on the amount of NPK in the soil, further information on soil temperature, conductivity,
    pH, and moisture. A solar fertigation control mechanism for watering using a hybrid
    model and forecasting control (Ahmad et al., 2022) is built on a weather-based
    system accompanied by a crop a repository controlled by real-time sensors that
    keep track of the water condition of the plants as well as the soil moisture and
    water quality. The continuous gauging system for evaluating the water in the soil
    and nutrients for citrus (Zhang et al., 2017) moisture and nutrient status in
    citrus orchards, so that fruit farmers can understand their orchard''s condition
    in time and adjust fertilization and irrigation strategies according to the data.
    To make it simpler for farmers to plant citrus seeds, (Pratama et al., 2021) an
    IoT-enabled gadget that indicates the soil''s nutrients for citrus seedlings using
    a “NPK” indicators and feeds the outcomes to the Thingspeak cloud. A soil wetness
    monitoring system was developed using LoRaWAN detectors with (Hossain et al.,
    2022) blended transmission modules, no in-field root stations or routers, and
    an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based mobile router to retrieve the gauges of
    soil wetness taken from buried indicators for a variety of crops. A continuous
    measurement system is proposed for soil nutrition content using an automated fertilizer
    unit for (Visvesvaran et al., 2021) greenhouse systems. The fertilizer system
    automatically provides the plants with the nutrients required once the measurement
    value reduces under the trigger value. The NodeMSU is utilized throughout the
    system for data communication. The performance of the LoRaWAN network beats that
    of the current system for long-distance data transmission, and the “Mamdani inference”
    optimization method based on IoT fuzzy logic yields the best results for measuring
    soil health. From the discussion above, it can be seen that the current system
    has some drawbacks, such as a lack of standardisation due to the fact that different
    soil sensors use different data formats and protocols to collect data. Due to
    the dependence of soil temperature on climate, sensor calibration is still lacking.
    To better manage soil surface and fertilisation, the current system has to be
    optimized. 3.3. Disease detection and analysis (DDAN) For autonomously identifying
    and categorising plant diseases from leaf photos, a DPLRN algorithm is suggested.
    Using the collected images, (Sladojevic et al., 2016) CNNs are trained and validated
    along with fine-tuning. A convolutional neural network model with squeeze net
    architecture is utilised (Hidayatuloh et al., 2018) to distinguish between healthy
    and diseased tomato plant leaves. There are four steps to creating a DPLRN based
    (Andrianto et al., 2020) smartphone application for spotting rice plant diseases.
    These are creating a system architecture for plant disease detection, creating
    a cloud server application and a smartphone application, testing the smartphone
    application, and assessing the system''s performance. The MLP simulation of plant
    diseases, which acquires information as 10 characteristics and 4139 data points,
    was put forward as a real-time (Kumar et al., 2021) detection method. The four
    common forms of disorders are accurately detected by the neural network. An app
    for cellphones that makes use of deep convolutional neural networks to (Pallagani
    et al., 2019) anticipate crop diseases. A total of 38 different diseases have
    been predicted by the app. Farmers everywhere can make use of it even without
    an internet connection. Controlling a pandemic illness with an IoT-based gauge
    is a crucial agricultural (Khattab et al., 2019) application. The system architecture
    can forecast a variety of plant diseases, and the model has been put to the test
    on tomato and potato crops in lab settings. An electronic method designed to communicate
    with mobile phones (Nagasubramanian et al., 2021) to manipulate disease classification,
    environmental objects, and farmer suggestions. MCLRN algorithms, SVMs, and CNNs
    are used to develop the farming suggestion. A leaf detection analysis is put forward
    using (Thorat et al., 2017) an assortment of sensors, such as temperature and
    soil moisture meters, etc. After processing, the leaf image is collected and uploaded
    to the server. The status of the leaf disease is also communicated to the farmer
    via the mobile app. Using “MDFC-ResNet” and DPLRN-based IoT (Hu et al., 2020)
    devices, a crop diagnosis of illnesses IoT system for several crop types is being
    developed. A publicly accessible collection of 54,306 pictures of ailing and healthy
    plant leaves has been assembled (Mohanty et al., 2016) in which a deep CNNs was
    utilised to identify 14 crop types and 26 illnesses from this controlled sample.
    An IoT-based system that uses MCLRN to deliver conveniently (Truong et al., 2017)
    available real-time local environmental data in rural crop fields. With the method,
    it is possible to both identify fungal illnesses and forecast their potential
    spread among crop fields. A “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based technique for
    plant disease identification is designed. Once the model has been trained using
    (Adeola et al., 2022) MCLRN methods, it is transformed into a lightweight model
    with a kilobyte (KB) size that can be placed into devices with external memory.
    Tensorflow lite is used to perform the model conversion with the already installed
    library. The existing method''s strength is its effectiveness in locating the
    illness at the plant''s root system using information on the soil and environment
    of a given region. The performance of the “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based
    technique to identify the kind of sickness was superior to that of existing DPLRN
    systems. For gathering a vast number of statistics on various plants and climatic
    circumstances, the aforementioned existing method still has several shortcomings.
    Lack of ability to detect and control various diseases. To identify plant diseases,
    several existing systems used CNN-based DPLRN algorithms, but the algorithm performance
    still has to be optimized in terms of accuracy, usefulness and real time plant
    disease analysis. 3.4. Pathogens detection (PDT) Biosensors possessed the ability
    to develop into the forefront of diagnostic techniques for various fields of biological
    studies, which comprises immediate assessment of human blood (Sonu and Chaudhary,
    2022) ingredients for both animal and plant infection recognition, environmental
    surveillance, and airborne pathogen identification. As a result variety of techniques
    for detection of (R. Patel et al., 2022) plant pathogens and mechanisms of biosensing
    systems have been examined, whose two main categories of conventional analytical
    methods for the detection of plant diseases are the “Digital droplet polymerase
    chain reaction” and the “Quantum dots-based biosensor”. The exploration of techniques
    for agricultural disease detection is the overall strength of the present work.
    The analysis illustrates the benefits of miniaturized sensors in terms of convenience
    in production; affordability, speed of reaction, and responsiveness, establishing
    those instruments useful for observations in the field. In terms of high levels
    of automation, the work currently being done for pathogen detection still has
    a research gap. It is lacking sensor standardisation. It is necessary to improve
    the methods for detecting various pathogen types, sensor calibration, dataset
    gathering, and technology integration. A cheap sensor needs to be deployed in
    the creation of an affordable, eco-friendly system. Due to the need for further
    optimisation of IoT-enabled systems, there is still a gap in field testing. 3.5.
    Pest controlling (PCN) IoT and CNN-based insect recognition techniques are combined
    in a system. The technology is (Ramalingam et al., 2020) utilized by pest management
    businesses to keep an eye on pests in a variety of settings, including food storage
    areas, hospitals, gardens, etc. Using the IoT for crop monitoring and pest control
    (Tian et al., 2021) an infrastructure for simultaneous and collaborative simulation
    strategy has been provided. Based on the results, the applied simulation with
    IoT assistance system is the most efficient and accurate solution. An artificial
    IoT and DPLRN (Chen et al., 2020) technology can be used to analyze crop growth
    and predict pest occurrences in an environment. A neural network algorithm called
    “You Only Look Once (YOLO)” is used to identify pests in images. A system for
    the detection and control of pests embedded in an embedded environment is proposed
    in which (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2019) if the acceptable limit gets surpassed in
    terms of both temperature and humidity, then the “raspberry pi” captures the image
    of the plant and compares it to the database, and if pests are found, the farmers
    are notified to fertilize. A “Multi-Agent System (MAS)” by deploying a (Debauche
    et al., 2020) Docker environment orchestrated by “Kubernetes” in the Edge AI-IoT
    architecture is constructed. The system utilizes an AI algorithm to identify plant
    diseases and pests and uses an irrigation pivot to treat the crop. The positive
    aspects of MCLRN algorithms like KNN and the (Materne and Inoue, 2018) linear
    regression framework are used to construct a prediction model in a plantation
    to forecast disease and insect outbreaks. The upside of already-existing systems
    is that building a decentralized and accordance simulation structure with the
    IoT for pest control and crop monitoring in combination to increase crop yields,
    lessens the load on one GPU, and contributes to the operation evenly and concurrently
    with all accessible GPUs and perceives data. Based on the usefulness of data,
    the current pest management method still has a gap. For a robotic technique based
    on DPLRN to detect different kinds of insects and rodents, the current solution
    still has to be improved. Due to various data formats and IoT protocols, there
    are still issues when integrating the current system with another system. The
    amount of manual field monitoring by farmers can be decreased, for example, by
    merging deep irrigation systems with current pest management techniques. By including
    preprocessing to normalise the image before the prediction to minimise the effects
    of photo exposure (varying light intensity in outdoor situations), plant disease
    and pest detection can be enhanced. IoT-based security and privacy of sent data
    still require improvement. 3.6. Weed detection (WDT) Robotic weed control that
    uses MCLRN and IoT to detect weeds in onion fields and (Arakeri et al., 2017)
    spray them with the required herbicide. Installing a weed detecting system in
    a chilli (Islam et al., 2021) field using RADF, KNN, and SVM, among other MCLRN
    and image processing algorithms. Systems were built using MATLAB. In order to
    identify weeds in soybean crops (Razfar et al., 2022) a DPLRN based vision-based
    weed identification system is prepared. Three unique CNNs models and MobileNetV2
    are employed in the five-layer DPLRN architecture. In order to increase agricultural
    productivity (Dasgupta et al., 2020) a concept is suggested by utilizing wireless
    sensor networks and AI models for crop forecast and weed identification. In this
    approach, MCLRN is used to create a model after data are collected from sensors
    via WSN. CNN is used in conjunction with this to detect marijuana in drone-taken
    photo. An algorithm is designed based on CNNs to identify and (Jabir and Falih,
    2022) locate weeds in wheat harvests in the region of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Morocco,
    using an intelligent system. The YOLO model is used to construct a real-time detection
    and identification model on the Raspberry Pi. A network is established for detecting
    weeds (Kulkarni and Angadi, 2019) using a CNN. The CNN is constructed as a pooling
    layer, and the activation function is a “ReLU”. A remote-controlled robot based
    on a Raspberry (Dankhara et al., 2019) Pi is used to detect weed using an image
    processing technique. A model has been formed for precision (Karthikeyan et al.,
    2021) agriculture based on K-means clustering to classify weed plants. A “CNN”
    technique associated with IoT is used for image processing. When compared to another
    neural network technique, the performance of a WSN employing a Raspberry-based
    system with the DPLRN approach is superior. More accurate results were obtained.
    The above-discussed existing work has flaws based on real-time mobile application
    monitoring of weed detection; more parameters can be added to make the DPLRN model
    performance optimised so that real-time weed can be detected accurately; and analysis
    of weed mapping method still has a gap where more research can be carried out.
    Improvements still need to be made to real-time UAV-based technique optimisation.
    The existing system does not incorporate the integration of various environmental
    sensors, actuators, or feedback controllers for monitoring. More research is still
    needed to develop a custom deep learning algorithm that can identify different
    weed types based on plants. 3.7. Crop losses (CLO) To gain an adequate understanding
    of crop health, an apparatus has been (Shafi et al., 2020) put together that combines
    multi-modal data from the IoT nodes and drone photos. The fused data was subjected
    to MCLRN and DPLRN algorithms for crop health classification and creating health
    maps. Data from the sensor nodes is transmitted via a LoRa module. The system
    is intended to design, develop, and test a next generation of automated (Pérez-Ruiz
    et al., 2015) and robotic systems for efficient pest management in agriculture
    and forestry operations using a real-time kinematics (RTK) and “Global positioning
    system” (GPS) controlled autonomous tractor for straight-line tracking. A drone-based
    system is designed in which a “Raspberry Pi” module is integrated (Saha et al.,
    2018) with an array of 64 separate temperature sensors over 12C, an RGB-D camera
    for taking real-time photos, and a GPS navigation module. The cloud server receives
    and stores all sensor data. A system that makes use of multiple sensors to assess
    the temperature, humidity, pH level and scent of the leaves is compared and examined
    (Giri Babu and Anjan Babu, 2020) to check if the gathered leaf values fall within
    the range specified in the actual dataset for tracking crop health. Using IoT
    and remote sensing (Shukla et al., 2021) a method is proposed for agricultural
    health monitoring. To identify healthy crops, IOT-connected UAVs and MCLRN are
    used. Prescription maps are important because they make use of resources like
    pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Farmers are able to decide what resources
    are necessary to ensure that crops are healthy at every stage of growth. An IoT
    platform is constructed that uses image processing and a classifier algorithm
    to detect plant illnesses. If an (Ayalew et al., 2022) automatic medicine system
    identifies ailments, a sprinkler sprays medication. Additionally, disease transmission
    is tracked based on changes in weather using soil humidity and temperature sensors.
    An automated decision-making (Grimblatt et al., 2021) tools and metrics that track
    plant development and health, which have an immediate and measurable effect on
    farmers'' ability to produce crops. Experiments are carried out using two separate
    sensors, soil moisture and temperature, to ascertain the significance of each
    parameter as the foundation for plant growth. An agricultural production system
    simulation is designed (Matsumoto et al., 2017) to carry out intricate business-based
    assessments of the abundance of inventories and crop destruction brought on by
    an absence of knowledge about the quantity of food acquired, the number of unit
    crops, and the enlargement of cultivated fields. IoT-Edge module (Park and Kim,
    2021) collects strawberry hydroponic environment data and strawberry photos, allowing
    for monitoring and determining strawberry harvest time. Utilizing a Wide-area
    inexpensively network (LPWAN) based on the “NB-IoT” (Chang et al., 2018) a smart
    lighting system is developed for greenhouses of expensive crops. Using the temperature,
    humidity, and methane gas sensors MQ4, LDR, and DHT11 (Mahfuz et al., 2020) an
    embedded system is established based on microcontrollers. Its purpose is to keep
    track of the atmosphere all over the greenhouse. In the event that any sensor
    value is outside of its acceptable range, the Arduino will send the user a notification
    SMS using a SIM 900 GSM modem. Through the Android app, a new threshold value
    is also configured. The performance of the smart monitoring of healthy crops is
    outperformed by the IoT that utilises drone and hybrid MCLRN to detect healthy
    crops in the growing environment. The data is transmitted quickly and cheaply
    between the edge and the cloud using an LPWAN based on the “NB-IoT”. It has been
    determined through research of the already-existing system previously described
    that there is still a gap in monitoring and controlling the crop from numerous
    losses. The current system is missing data processing steps and robotic sensors
    with intelligence that can detect different soil parameters, such as soil PH,
    soil water levels, and other characteristics. The ability for mobile-based applications
    to provide the end user with real-time access to farming field information from
    any location still needs refinement. For example, alerts for watering plants,
    temperature control notifications, and disease detection alarms based on the disease
    types and how this disease might be controlled. The examination of extensive data
    based on various crop types is still lacking. Because of climatic circumstances,
    dissimilar data formats, and dissimilar communication protocols, the system is
    not self-sustaining; it is dependent on a certain region and environmental condition.
    It is also unable to integrate with another subsystem. Fig. 6 exhibits the average
    annual growth rate of papers on research produced throughout 2012 and 2023 for
    DHRS implementations based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other procedures. Download :

    growth rate analysis of DHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other
    methodology from 2012 to 2023. According to Fig. 6, the DHRS application research
    publication growth rate analysis has been conducted similarly to that of the PHRS
    application research publication growth rate analysis. The DHRS publishing analysis
    graph shows an increase in the number of research published articles year over
    year. Comparing IoT-based DHRS applications to AI, MCLRN, and other techniques,
    the publishing growth rate was higher between 2019 and 2022. This is because more
    research is being done on SIR, DDAN, and CLO-based applications. In comparison
    to the period from 2012 to 2018, the average annual growth rate of publications
    for SIR-based applications between 2019 and 2022 has been calculated to be 69.23
    %. In contrast, between 2019 and 2022, the average growth rates for CLO and DDAN,
    respectively, were 53.26 % and 63.98 %. It is therefore possible to predict that
    there will be an increase in the number of research publications using IoT and
    AI-based approaches for developing DHRS applications. 4. Post harvesting system
    (POHRS) When preparing the ground for agricultural cultivation, farmers that practice
    traditional farming face a number of challenges. These challenges were brought
    on by the rising demand for agricultural production, and it is not simple to match
    this rising demand for food processing, storage, and supply. The Fig. 7 shows
    the post-harvesting subsystem in which various existing research work has been
    done based on storage, harvesting cycle, supply chain, food processing, etc. (Abouelsaad
    et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. POHRS subsystem classification. The post-harvest physiology
    and management of fruits and vegetables are covered in this area, along with topics
    like harvesting, handling, packaging, storage, hygienic practises, transportation,
    crop waste, etc. In the context of severe weather, it also covered postharvest
    handling. 4.1. Reaping, sorting, cooling, and storage (RSCS) An agricultural robot
    design is incorporated that would use “Autodesk Fusion 360″ (Sazid et al., 2022)
    and ”Webots Simulator“ for reaping, seed sowing, excavating, unmanned ploughing,
    watering, fertilising, and harvesting. “Proteus 8.9” simulates the complete system.
    For data analysis, “MATLAB” is being used. An IoT-based microcontroller farm robot
    automates the system as a whole. An IoT-based low-cost solution is structured
    in which warehouse''s (Banerjee et al., 2020) hazardous gas, CO2, is detected
    using a gas sensor. Tilts or lateral motions of the rack are picked up by shock
    sensors. To safeguard grains from fire, a warning is issued if a fire flame is
    discovered. The Node-Red dashboard allows a user to view the findings of live
    sensor data anywhere, at any time. IoT has been used to monitor and manage food
    grain waste in warehouses. A “DHT11” indicator (Devi et al., 2021) for temperature
    and humidity, a CO2 sensor for air quality, a PIR sensor for moving object detection,
    and other sensors are integrated using “Arduino” to act as a rat and insect repellant.
    A fan is activated to cool the room if the temperature and humidity are above
    and below, respectively, the threshold levels. All sensor node data is accessible
    on the mobile application. Immediate terms surveillance equipment powered by IoT
    that (Siddiqua et al., 2022) can track temperature, humidity, brightness, and
    gas concentration in freezing storage and notify the user of potentially dangerous
    values when the levels surpass the thresholds. The “Arduino UNO” microcontroller
    regulates sensor data and provides it to the ESP32. The MIT App Inventor is used
    on either a computer or an Android phone to monitor the status of the storage
    room. Using a combination of blockchain technology (Sangeetha et al., 2021) a
    system for gauging crop quality and monitoring storage that links farmers with
    distributors directly. Data is gathered in real-time both in the warehouse and
    on the field. All sensor nodes are linked together using Arduino, and information
    is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway using Lora communication.
    Farmers and distributors can visualise and analyse data via a web application,
    which is stored in Azure SQL databases. The invention of a stated IoT-enabled
    warehouse management system in which (Anoop et al., 2021) the NodeMSU microcontroller
    is set up to receive temperature and humidity data in this study. A DT method
    is used to examine the temperature swings that took place in Kerala during the
    past five years. To assess and display the warehouse''s climate state, this climate
    data is transmitted to the cloud server Thingspeak. A system based on IoT is established
    for controlling and monitoring food (Hema et al., 2020) instantaneous grain storage
    and procurement. To monitor the overall status under the granary, the system makes
    use of gauges for climate control, moisture, gas, real-time clocks, and burning
    flame gauges. Sensor data is visualized using the thingSpeak cloud platform. An
    MQTT-based application control warehouse system is developed for fruits and vegetables
    storage. Using MQTT and COAP protocol (Deshmukh and Bhalerao, 2017) sensor information
    can be displayed on a web page and accessed via mobile apps. Compared two techniques,
    ”Evaporative Cooling Chambers“ (ECCs) (Verploegen et al., 2018) and ”clay pot
    coolers,“ and proposed employing non-electric cooling and storage devices as a
    potential solution to the post-harvest warehouse issues in rural Mali. An IoT-enabled
    approach is structured that employs sensors to track the condition of agricultural
    fields and warehouses in real-time. The (Nayak et al., 2022) necessary region
    is surrounded by a number of sensors that can identify any impending dangers and
    notify the appropriate people. The infrastructure for safeguarding the harvested
    crops in the warehouse and monitoring the same in real time through an IoT sensor
    network performs better than the performance of the entire existing system for
    developing refrigeration sections through WSN-based clay pots. The system is affordable
    and accessible to all farmers. The aforementioned summary of current research
    has a number of drawbacks based on harvesting, storing, and cooling. There is
    a dearth of smart alert notifications in the storage system. The current storage
    system still lacks real-time monitoring of insects and rodents. There is a need
    for such a sophisticated intelligent-based algorithm that can regulate the warehouse''s
    temperature automatically in accordance with diverse environmental factors and
    locales. For different fruits and vegetables, storage systems should be based
    on weight and long-term storage capability, which is still lacking in the current
    work. On the security and usability of the system at the user end, there is a
    research gap. To boost the performance of the current system, other sensors can
    be added, including RFID, sound sensors, and various gas sensors. 4.2. Crop waste
    management (CWM) A solution to identify (Chihana et al., 2018) warehouse breaches
    and track grains using IoT prototypes is suggested. The usage of cloud storage,
    WSN, and RFID technologies increases accountability and efficiency while reducing
    theft and administrative mistakes. Using an IR sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi
    module a smart garbage management (Jayalakshmi et al., 2017) system built on IOT.
    After garbage levels reach maximum, dustbins are cleaned as soon as possible.
    A framework is formed for smart (Bong Cassendra P. C. et al., 2018) agriculture
    based on a smart waste management perspective. The author discusses the various
    sensor and communication protocols that can be used to track the waste of crops
    in agriculture. The current system''s main strength is its ability to collect
    data instantaneously on the amount and type of agricultural waste. These data
    are examined using cloud computing to determine where crop waste is accumulating
    and to evaluate the risk of fire, illness, and pest infestation. Satellite images
    and ground-based sensors can be used to monitor crop waste degradation. Farmers
    at present have access to information on greenhouse gas emissions and decomposition
    rates. According to a study of previous research, smart agro-waste control research
    is still in its early stages. Low-energy power sensors and sophisticated techniques
    for managing post-harvest waste are not used. Research is still needed for all
    forms of crop loss management. 4.3. Transportation and tracking (TTN) A three-layer
    perishable generate fog computing model is proposed (Musa and Vidyasankar, 2017)
    in which the RFID-embedded sensors that generate sensor readings for the monitoring
    and control layer are among the data producers. A system for the effective distribution
    and transportation of fresh fruit is developed by utilizing the MQ3 sensor. The
    (Elavarasi et al., 2019) system''s result was that it lessened fruit contamination.
    When damaged fruit is discovered, an SMS is delivered to the user''s mobile device,
    and through a remote, the system removes the spoiled fruit using a pick-and-place
    robot. In this article the author go into great (Onwude et al., 2020) detail about
    how cutting food losses during postharvest cold chain activities might enhance
    food security. IoT and blockchain were suggested (Pervez and Haq, 2019) as a means
    of digitally disrupting supply chains and logistics. The supply-chain architecture
    built on a block chain is designed using a direct acyclic graph data structure.
    The IoT-based technologies used in the management of the agricultural supply chain
    in a developing nation like India are discussed. Real-time data sharing (Luthra
    et al., 2018) uses embedded components including actuators, sensors, and network
    connectivity. Digital technologies enable the (Dadi et al., 2021) creation of
    effective agri-food supply networks. “Big data” and IoT are a combination of several
    technologies that the system uses to evaluate enormous amounts of information
    quickly. RFID can sense the food environment. The Blockchain-based supply chain
    management plan (Bhutta and Ahmad, 2021) that places an emphasis on employing
    IoT devices and Blockchain technology to securely identify, trace, and track agricultural
    food during transportation. The methods used to anticipate backorders include
    SVM, KNN, RADF, and AdaBoost. The IoT-based dairy supply chain model is suggested
    and put into practise. In which (Jachimczyk et al., 2021) the related solution
    and the domain-oriented knowledge model are well matched for the integration and
    synergy-enabling processes. RFID is used to capture and share data for production,
    warehousing, sales, supply, and other processes. Advocated in China by integrating
    blockchain and RFID in the (Feng Tian, 2016) supply chain. Information is transferred
    securely and made public via the traceability system by using blockchain. Real-time
    monitoring of the climate, humidity, and geolocation guarantees that harvested
    crops get to their destination in the best feasible conditions, reducing spoiling
    and improving crop quality. Blockchain technology leveraging RFID-based sensor
    nodes optimises supply chains for all crops in real-time. It reduces waste and
    guarantees that crops get there at their intended location in the best feasible
    condition. It has been determined from the discussion of the TTN''s current system
    that the secure supply chain technique has to be updated for all agricultural
    products. Sensor-based technologies, device security and failure, software security,
    and power management all require improvement. The current infrastructure does
    not allow for the dynamic scheduling of transportation based on the agricultural
    products'' shelf lives. There are significant research gaps in the areas of cloud
    platform load balancing, computational cost, and security protocol. Logistical
    processes based on smart contracts can be added to the system to increase its
    efficiency and power. There is still a need for an autonomous system that unifies
    numerous subsystems using IoT with technologies like blockchain and AI. 4.4. Food
    processing (FDP) “Big data” analytics, MCLRN, and the IoT are used to build a
    (Konur et al., 2023) cyber-physical / IoT based food manufacturing system. The
    intelligent production control system offers intelligent decision assistance.
    A tools is structured for tracking and (Jagtap et al., 2021) lowering energy and
    water consumption (FEW), as well as a decision-support system with pertinent hardware
    and software components, utilizing an IoT four-layer architecture. FEW data are
    gathered and used in the food manufacturing sector to examine and improve procedures.
    The food processing system is more effective when IoT, big data analytics, MCLRN,
    and cyber-physical systems are incorporated than when they are automated. Additionally,
    this analysis teaches data professionals new information about how to forecast
    the baking process for achieving product consistency. Productivity may be raised,
    and performance and profitability can be raised by analyzing these data. The current
    research has been examined for individual agricultural goods. For all agricultural
    goods, testing can be done based on the ingredients and food processing. It is
    necessary to integrate seamless IoT devices to improve food processing. The current
    system lacks a strong security system to safeguard system data. Based on IoT,
    AI, MCLRN, and other processes, Fig. 8 presents the average annual growth rate
    estimation of research publication for POHRS application from 2012 to 2023. Download

    Publication growth rate analysis of POHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN
    and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. For the TTN and RSCS system implementations,
    a large number of research articles have been published between 2018 and 2022.
    The average growth rate for the IoT and blockchain-based TTN system has been measured
    as 63.23 % between 2018 and 2021, and the average growth rate has been measured
    for the IoT and AI-based system for storage and cooling at 58.41 % between 2018
    and 2021. However, there has been less growth in research publications on the
    topics of IoT and AI for the other POHRS applications, such as FDP, CWM, sorting,
    and cooling, between 2012 and 2022. Therefore, there is a need for greater study
    in that area. Using IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other methodology categories, the average
    growth rate of research papers for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS was 41.12 %, 43.23 %,
    and 36.10 %, respectively, till January 2023. 5. Metaheuristic based algorithm
    in smart agriculture application From growing to reaping, an agricultural application
    (Kiani et al., 2022a) uses a meta-heuristic approach. In the first unit, the “Sand
    Cat Swarm Optimization” (SCSO) based algorithm has been created to delegate the
    cultivation work to the appropriate autonomous machines, reducing the labor factor.
    In the second unit, IoT devices keep track of cultivated crops. For crop harvesting
    in the third unit, an improved “ANT colony optimization” (ACO) algorithm has been
    created. A 3D strategy approach has been (Kiani et al., 2022b) employed using
    a couple of Progressive enhancement Grey Wolf Optimisation (I-GWO) and Improved
    Grey Wolf Optimisation (Ex-GWO) for self-sustaining farm operations to search
    for a collision-free feasible route in a sufficient period with minimal expenditure
    in various atmospheric conditions and for multiple barriers. The goal is to tackle
    the NP-hard problem of successful crop harvesting by identifying the finest and
    most suitable paths for UAVs. The results indicate an endeavor to avoid any local
    optima pitfalls and determine the most effective response in an adequate span
    of duration. The fuzzy logic-based “Non-dominated sorting (Fathollahi-Fard et
    al., 2023) genetic algorithm” (NSGEA) model has been developed as a metaheuristic
    optimization strategy where the model incorporates the advantage of multiple factors
    of apprehension such as harvesters'' effectiveness, waves of crops that become
    ripe, parameter weather, as well as adjustments in the value of commodities. The
    framework takes into consideration a wide range of desired results, including
    profitability optimization, preventing waste, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction,
    and it is utilized to calculate the optimum amount of day''s labor for farmers
    and laborers on every block of land. The usefulness of the currently available
    SCSO, ACO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, and NSGEA metaheuristic algorithms put into effect in
    IoT-based agriculture exceeded other approaches, and the model suggested may be
    used for different applications in a variety of agricultural areas. There are
    still some issues with the optimised performance technique that is currently being
    used to solve NP-hard issues in the field of smart agriculture. Lack of standardisation
    for big croplands utilising IoT and IoT of transportation employing a portable
    robot system to monitor the farming field based on SIR, SCL, CSL, CYP, SGM, SSL,
    STM, SHMFM, DDAN, PDT, WDT, PCN, CLO, TTN, FDP, and RSCS. While supply chain optimizer
    for several harvested crops is currently lacking, the used NSGEA algorithms in
    multiobjective problems can be extended by “Benders decomposition” or “Lagrangian
    relaxation”. 6. Technologies based on the IoT for smart agriculture The development
    of IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems has relied on a variety of technologies
    in the past. It is possible to use this technology wirelessly or wiredly. It is
    conceivable to build an infrastructure for intelligent agriculture at a low cost
    by combining sensors, controllers, and communication technologies. Through the
    synthesis of IoT, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and cloud computing,
    IoT-enabled technologies have made advancements in developing smart agriculture
    systems as well. This section analyses various technologies for developing smart
    agriculture systems in the different major areas of farming operations on the
    basis of discussion in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application. The estimation average rate of several technologies utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS system is depicted in Fig. 9 of the graph.
    According to the existing survey (Kalyani and Collier, 2021) and proposed survey
    report, this is the estimated percentage of technologies used in smart agriculture
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (215KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Growth rate of various technologies used in PHRS, DHRS, POHRS subsystem
    between 2012 and 2022. According to an average percentage analysis of various
    technologies conducted between 2012 and 2022, the use of IoT and other technologies
    for the development of smart agriculture would increase by 2028 (Research and
    Markets, 2023). Table 1 presents cutting-edge technologies, sensor or devices
    that can be applied to build smart agriculture using IoT architecture (Chamara
    et al., 2022) based on PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS. From Table 1 it can be seen that
    the use of IoT has advanced the field of smart agriculture from 2012 to 2023.
    The advancement has been done by deploying various IoT devices / sensors (Pyingkodi
    et al., 2022), wireless communication protocols (Khanh et al., 2022), and UAVs
    using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies to automate the farming
    field operations (Boursianis et al., 2022). It is possible to communicate from
    machine to machine using a variety of communication standards (Orfanos et al.,
    2023). Table 1. Analysis of Technologies used in the smart agriculture between

    The graph in Fig. 10 represent how much data is consumed in GBPS by PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems. This data bandwidth estimate is evaluated and (Annual Internet,
    2023; Virtual Cisco, 2017) measured using prior research. This information is
    obtained through a variety of IoT sensors and actuators, including cameras, DHT
    temperature and humidity sensors, air pressure sensors, rain sensors, distance
    sensors, water flow metres, and others. These sensors and actuators are utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Information for real-time crop
    management is updated often, like every minute or hour. In the upcoming years,
    it is anticipated that the average data bandwidth for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems would keep expanding. The rapid development of sensors and actuators,
    as well as the rising demand for real-time crop management data, are to blame
    for this. As technology has developed, the maximum data bandwidth for IoT-based
    smart agriculture systems has increased year over year. The available data bandwidth
    for various IoT based PHRS, DHRS and POHRS applications from 2012 to 2022 is shown

    wise for various IoT based subsystems in smart agriculture. IoT technologies were
    still in their infancy between 2012 and 2014, and data storage capacity for applications
    in the IoT remained quite constrained. Data rates ranging from a few kilobyte
    per second (Kbps) to a few megabyte per second (Mbps) were accessible via wireless
    technologies including 2G and 3G cellular networks, which were widely used. The
    data bandwidth for IoT applications has increased dramatically between 2015 and
    2018 thanks to 4G LTE cellular networks technologies. Higher data speeds were
    offered by 4G networks, which typically oscillated between tens of Mbps to hundreds
    of Mbps. This made it possible to collect and analyse more data thoroughly while
    also enabling the transfer of data more quickly. Improvements to 4G networks and
    the rollout of 5G networks, which promise even more data bandwidth and lower latency,
    started in 2019 to 2021. Data rates of up to several gigabits per second (Gbps)
    are available with 5G technology. Even while 5G was not yet widely available,
    its promise for fast data transfer was becoming more and more clear. The global
    rollout of 5G networks, which are currently in development, will continue in 2022
    and 2023. This will result in enhanced data bandwidth for IoT-based smart agriculture
    applications. Although the actual data rates that can be achieved in real-world
    settings depend on network coverage and infrastructure, the data bandwidth needed
    for IoT-based smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems might vary depending on the
    implementation and the amount of data being communicated. The overall bandwidth
    needs will be influenced by elements including the volume of data gathering, the
    number of sensors placed, and the complexity of the data being conveyed. Communication
    involves a number of factors, such as the data rate, the frequency bands, the
    range, the application, and the cost. A systematic analysis of these factors has
    been conducted in Table 2 to determine which communication standards are to be
    used in PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystem. As from Table 1 and Table 2, some IoT-based
    communication technologies can also be considered in the 5G/5G beyond smart agriculture
    system. Table 2. Comparative analysis of various communication technologies used
    in smart agriculture. Communication Technologies Frequency Bands Data Rate Range

    collected based on PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS. This dataset can be used to solve a
    problem in CYP, SSL, SIR, DDAN, PCN, WDT, and CWM operations. Existing public
    dataset has been reviewed for several farming operations (Lu and Young, 2020)
    including SSL, DDAN, WDT, CWM, etc., and classified this dataset based on the
    specific problem that can be solved using the IoT based computer vision algorithm
    for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Including some existing external datasets
    created by various authors can be found in Table 3. This collection includes many
    plant-leaf diseases that affect fruits, vegetables, and seeds. For instance, tomatoes,
    brinjal, potatoes, guava, wheat, cotton, apples, oranges, and so forth. Table
    3. Analysis of dataset that can be used for developing smart agriculture based
    subsystem. References Details (Rauf and Lali, 2021) This dataset of healthy and
    unhealthy guava fruits and leaves can be used to solve plant disease-related issues
    using computer vision techniques. The illness categories in this image dataset
    are Dot, Canker, Mummification, and Rust. Pakistan is the source of the images.
    (Yogesh Suryawanshi et al., 2022) An image collection consists of four vegetables:
    “Bell Pepper”, “Tomato”, “Chili Pepper”, and “New Mexico Chile”. The five distinct
    substructure classes in each vegetable collection are Ripe, Old, Dried, and Wounded.
    (Natnael Tilahun, 2022) This image collection was gathered from a potato farm
    in Holeta, Ethiopia to help in the detection of potato leaf disease. The aforementioned
    collection comprises two distinct varieties of photos. Both “Healthy” and “Late
    Blight” have 363 and 63 images, respectively. The potato disease issue can be
    resolved with this dataset. 8. Comprehensive shortcomings of PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS
    As discussed above in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application, some shortcomings have been addressed from the existing
    work on IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems. Individually, these gaps are identified
    according to the various farming activities. The gaps that are noticeable for
    PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS are discussed in the Table 4 from which it can be analysed
    that smart agriculture is a broad research area and the developed existing IoT-enabled
    system still has shortcomings in terms of standard protocols, inconsistencies
    in collected data, and inconsistencies of IoT devices (such as there are multiple
    temperature sensors but their data formats are different and also it is difficult
    to interface that sensor with multiple subsystem microcontroller because of the
    varying platform), difficult to integrate existing system to multiple regions
    because of the environmental factor, cost, lack of technologies enhancement of
    the system and endorsement with real-time information with external source information.
    As from sections, 2, 3, 4 and 5 it can be extrapolated that more examination needs
    to be performed to accomplish IoT-based solutions for the SSL, SGM, SDG, PDT,
    affected crop sorting, CWM, and FDP. Research can be conducted on different crop
    types location-wise. IoT data security is a significant uncertainty, so there
    is a need for scalable WSN or robust mechanisms to protect data. Table 4. In depth
    shortcomings analysis of the existing smart agriculture system based on PHRS,
    DHRS and POHRS. PHRS Problems Focused Description Inconsistency with Standards
    Security protocols, device compatibility, and firmware still need to be standardized
    for IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM, SSL, SGM, DFM, WPM, and SDG systems. Compared to
    other methods and outcomes, the existing systems are difficult to compare. Standardized
    procedures and frameworks are necessary for assessing and comparing different
    methods. Limited Data analysis IoT is dependent on the volume of data. Most of
    the time that information is not easily accessible because of non-availability
    of open source data. More trustworthy sensor data and adequate data-gathering
    techniques are required because still depended on external source data. Data should
    be location-wise, all types of data, and should be validated with real-time and
    existing data. There is need for advanced data analytics techniques to make sense
    of these vast generated data. Inadequate scalability For IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM,
    DFM, and WPM applications, there are many active research projects; nevertheless,
    there is still work to be done to scale this system for commercial applications.
    SGM, SSL and SD-based IoT-based systems require more research. This system are
    not fully automated. Inadequate knowledge Performing experiments on the crop relies
    on understanding of the crop physiology as well as a range of environmental factors,
    which is yet not fully understood. More study is needed on the physiological processes
    of various crops, as well as the effects of environmental conditions on crop growth
    and development. Inability to integrate with current agricultural systems To make
    the fully IoT-based pre-harvesting method more effective, the system can be incorporated
    with the existing agricultural systems such as smart crop recommendation system
    based on weather, location, seed selection and soil nutrients analysis, smart
    soil digging, etc. There is a lack of research in this area of integration. The
    study has to be performed to discover the potential benefits and drawbacks of
    the integration. Limited Accuracy Currently, most IoT devices lead to erroneous
    and inconsistent data, as they have limitations in terms of accuracy, reliability,
    and precision. In addition, sensor calibration is also important despite being
    complex and time-consuming and can result in inconsistent results if not done.
    Also, these devices have to place optimally to ensure correct data collection,
    which can be further used for analysis. The study has to be performed to make
    a system accurate and reliable. Cost Effective IoT-based systems can be expensive
    to install and maintain and thus can be a barrier while adopting the technique,
    especially for small-scale farmers. Although the cost of devices has decreased
    in recent years, the overall integration can still lead to a higher cost. Research
    has to be focused to investigate cost-effective solutions. Use of MCLRN approaches
    The present work has used MCLRN techniques in IoT-based systems, however due to
    the overfitting issue, the trained MCLRN model still cannot make an accurate forecast.
    DHRS Multi-technology incorporating IoT makes it possible for the system to apply
    a variety of technologies during the harvesting process. These technologies can
    be combined to create a system, but research is needed to determine the best way
    to do so. According to the study of the current work, several systems have not
    been fully incorporated. Such as SIR with SHMFM, PCN, PDT, WDT, CLO etc. System
    for Enhancing Irrigation Research must be conducted to point out the efficient
    way to irrigate the plants as compared to the traditional methods of irrigation.
    Such as irrigation system should be managed automatically on behalf of different
    of types crops. Acquiring and adopting users Existing IoT-based DHRS systems are
    still mishandled and challenging to adopt in various environments. Research must
    be performed to make a system that can be easily handled and adopted by end users
    in different environments. Soil health The DHRS process includes IoT enabled system
    for crop monitoring and SHMFM. Research must be performed to examine how SIR affects
    soil systems, microbial residents, and nutrient process for various crops. Environment''s
    impact Still, research is to be investigated based on environmental factors such
    as calibration of temperature, humidity, and rainfall during SHMFM and DDAN. Privacy
    and Security As far as the security of IoT-based DHR systems is concerned, very
    little research has been conducted. Detecting the diseases accurately Although
    IoT-based systems can provide real-time plant health data, there are still limitations
    to how precise the data is. Various factors affect accuracy and research must
    be done to monitor those factors, which can impact accuracy. Efficient Energy
    Continuous data collection is difficult in remote regions. A cost-effective, self-sustaining,
    and optimised technique should be implemented in the current IoT-based systems
    for PDT, DDAN, SHMFM, and WDT so that field monitoring data can be gathered continually.
    Analysing pest behaviour The system to detect pests accurately still needs improvement.
    As various pests respond differently in different environments. Optimization of
    Object Detection algorithms Need more research in the areas of IoT-enabled systems
    for WDT, PDT, CLO, and PCN to provide optimized solutions for accurate results.
    So system performance can be increased. POHRS Security and Privacy While most
    harvesting data must be stored properly and securely. Various IoT-based systems
    can be implemented to monitor and store the data. In this era of cyber threats,
    the system must be made in such a way to make the data properly stored, thus making
    it secure. Innovative solutions with a low cost Developing IoT enables cost-effective
    solutions in post-harvest activities is challenging based on security and privacy.
    As in POHRS, there are still some shortcomings in the existing system, which needed
    to be addressed. Such as in RSCS, SWM, and TTN there is still lacking data security,
    data storage, and low-cost automated system of fruits and vegetables monitoring.
    Research must be done to deeply understand such a situation and make a cost-efficient
    system so that it can be used by small-scale farmers also. Miniature studies In
    POHRS most of the ongoing work is focused on TTN, RSCS, and CWM but missing this
    existing system on a large scale for post-harvest phases. In the current automated
    RSCS system, the sorting technique management can be improved by including scheduling
    and weightage systems for post-harvest storage of crops during the TTN process,
    because Indian farmers have fewer low-cost smart facilities. Research can be done
    to investigate the effectiveness of the IoT system on a large scale as well. Incorporating
    multiple methods IoT system integrates different components which are somehow
    correlated to each other. Research should be carried out to determine how those
    components must be integrated as a distributed system that develops a self-sustainable
    and cost-efficient system. Availability and Reliability The IoT-based system should
    be readily available for the end users. Research should be done regarding the
    improvements in the availability of the data during TTN as well as while RSCS,
    utilizing real-time monitoring. 9. Proposed architecture for smart agriculture
    From PHRS to POHRS, a number of existing smart methodologies have been established
    for all different types of farming tasks, and they are all covered above along
    with their benefits as well as their drawbacks. By using the proposed architecture
    the limitations of the present structures can be reduced in light of the discussion
    above. A compact sensor network is made possible. Thanks to the integration of
    IoT, MCLRN, metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, AI, edge computing, cloud computing,
    SDN, cryptography for data security, UAVs, etc. Using 5G (gNB architecture) and
    5G beyond networks (Abdulghaffar et al., 2021), the recommended IoT-facilitated
    smart farming architecture is designed on the basis of IoT layered architecture
    in the Fig. 11. The sensor layer consists of different types of sensors, and data
    transmitters (“sx1276”, “nrf24l01”, etc.), cameras, high-frequency navigation
    (GPS), etc. It acts to collect and transmit facts it to the central server utilizing
    a 5G network connectivity via an edge gateway for data processing and analytics.
    The central server gives the farmers useful information using miscellaneous algorithms
    and standard procedures. These details may be on the choice of crop, seed germination,
    irrigation, soil analysis, and status, livestock status, crop diseases detection,
    crop sorting and storage, tracking, etc. The collected data are about the PHRS
    subsystem, DHRS subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. These subsystems are interconnected
    to each other to make the overall agriculture system automated. So that farmers
    can optimize their farming procedures and enhance crop yields. Under this system,
    the automated actuators can be used to enable farmers to remotely control some
    of the devices such as irrigation motors, pest control, soil digging, etc. Layer
    by layer, smart agriculture can be developed as follows: Download : Download high-res
    image (896KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Proposed 5G based Smart
    Agriculture Framework. 9.1. Perception layer In this layer, multiple sensor networks
    can be created by deploying various sensor nodes for the PHRS subsystem, DHRS
    subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. This subsystem is communicated to each other as
    machine-to-machine communication (Sakthivel and Vidhya, 2021) and connected to
    an each 5GIoT base edge gateway. The PHRS subsystem retrieves the data of various
    environmental factors, including water in the soil, fertiliser, temperature, and
    humidity, sunlight, flood and drought-related, etc, and transmits this data to
    the local IoT edge gateway for further computation and analysis. The DHRS subsystem
    consists of the sensor data of irrigation, NPK, pest controlling, weed detection,
    disease prediction, livestock, insects sound, crop field, etc. This data is also
    transmitted to a local IoT edge gateway and the same as POHRS sensor network data
    will be collected and transmitted to its IoT local edge gateway for further computing
    and analysis. This all subsystems are the backbone of the IoT sensor network.
    9.2. Network layer The entire IoT AGRI subsystem is designed based on the 5G network,
    but it can enable 5G beyond the network as needed. Essentially, a 5G core network
    is a high-level network that is made up of a radio access network and one or more
    edge networks. The 5G base stations are connected to open flow switches which
    are known as gNB switches (edge network). For traffic offloading and “quality
    of service (QoS)” implementation, SDN controllers can interface with base stations
    using the open flow protocol. The “protocol data unit (PDU) session” or “user
    plane function (UPF)” is used in the core network to connect the data network
    (DN). The SDN controller controls all gNB, UPF, and data plane switches. This
    layer is responsible for all transmissions and communications between sensors,
    IoT gateways, and cloud servers. 9.3. Cloud layer The network layer''s via SDN
    controller would transport the sensor data acquired from the perception layer
    to the cloud layer platform, where analytics would be carried out utilising tools
    like AI, MCLRN, Weka, and Hadoop, among others. Cloud platforms include “AWS”,
    “Azure”, “IBM Cloud”, etc. To handle and analyse the data gathered from the sensors,
    this cloud service offers storage and computational capabilities. The designed
    API gateway is used to manage communication between the edge gateway and the cloud
    server while utilising all authentication services. 9.4. Application layer The
    insights produced by the cloud server will be available to the end user through
    mobile applications, web applications, etc., including farmers, stack holders,
    suppliers, ranchers, purchasers, etc. So that farmers may make informed judgements,
    this programme gives them real-time information regarding the PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS. 9.5. Data storage and processing layer Depending on the particular applications
    and the volume of data collected, the data storage needs for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems can change. Numerous services, including data source, data
    processing, decision support, transmission system, authorization, storage space,
    and reliability, are offered in the data storage and processing layer. The digital
    footprint of the data collection and storing for the IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems in smart agriculture is shown in Fig. 12. Download : Download
    high-res image (611KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Data processing
    and storage footprint. Data gathering: Obtaining information from numerous agricultural
    fields (F) using a variety of sensors, including those that measure things like
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil ph, soil NPK, air pressure, RFID, rodents,
    insects, and other animals, as well as things like plant color recognition, rainfall,
    disease detection, and recognization through cameras, storage and cooling control
    of harvested vegetables or fruits, transportation and tracking, water flow measurement,
    level, and pump control. This sensor and actuator data is sent to the server for
    analysis and decision-making for the farm fields, or real-time monitoring. Depending
    on the sensor type and frequency, a single sensor node may generate data on average
    in the range of KB to a megabyte (MB) each day. The expected data storage, for
    instance, can range from GB to terabytes (TB) per year if there is a vast farming
    area with numerous sensors. In addition, image and video data are gathered from
    drones to monitor crop health, pest detection, weed detection, and crop yield.
    This data contains high-definition images of farms in 5 to 100 MB sizes. It is
    possible to estimate total storage capacity by estimating the frequency of capturing
    such imaginary data. The sensor data for CYP, CSL, SGM, STM, SDG, SIR, RSCS, CWM,
    DDAN, PDT, CLO, WDT, SHMFM TTN, and FDP systems as well as scheduling irrigation,
    measuring insect control effectiveness, managing livestock, keeping track of crop
    yields, and managing agribusiness depend on the overall dimension of the farm,
    the variety of crops grown there, and the amount of detail that can be gathered.
    For each crop every year, this data size can be in the KB to MB range. However,
    WPM generates climate-related data that can be recorded for historical research
    and transmitted in KB each hour or day. Data pre-processing: In the pre-processing,
    the gathered data are prepared for further analysis. Which is used to fill in
    the missing data, remove the redundant data, format the data into its size, type,
    and classes, and normalize the data to make data more reliable and knowledgeable.
    Data repository: The local storage server, which may be a NoSql, time-series,
    or relational database, stores all pre-process data. It is quite difficult to
    make the data more trustworthy and long-lasting because the database storage can
    come from a variety of sources of different types and sizes. The data is cleaned
    using a variety of pre-processing techniques throughout the pre-process. There
    are different, specialised cleaning techniques for text and picture data, such
    as stemming and lemmatization, as well as image geometric conversions, image filtering,
    segmentation, Fourier transform, and image restoration, among others. Data from
    both the past and the present is kept in the storage repository. In the edge computing
    layer, data transmission management is carried out between this data processing
    layer. The interval between acquisition and utilisation might vary extensively,
    ranging from a couple of seconds, minutes, or hours to a few weeks, or possibly
    a full year in extreme circumstances. Therefore, several transmission techniques
    can be used for quick and secure long-distance transmission via wired or wireless
    means. High-speed data connection, such as a 5G communication network, is also
    necessary. Various data flow control techniques, including stop and wait, feedback
    control, sliding windows, two-directional communications, etc., will be used to
    manage the data communication traffic between these two communications. Throughout
    all of these steps, data analyses are carried out utilising different MCLRN and
    AI algorithms to send actions and notifications to the user''s cloud server. A
    suggested approach for smart farming system data footprint is developed based
    on smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS existing work deficiencies using a 5G data communication
    network. For the storage of this PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the maximum
    average data volume analysis is shown as a graph in Fig. 13. The regular data
    volume analysis is estimated in Fig. 13 as a graph based on the communication
    technologies range, periodicity of the sensor devices, camera resolution, data
    bandwidth, etc. Using different types of agricultural activity properties, this
    average data volume utilisation analysis over the past 30 days has been calculated.
    The analysis of the 30-day total average data volume was calculated at 1.38856
    GB. Depending on the particular PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the data transfer
    frequency changes. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Estimated digital footprint for one month of proposed
    PHRS,DHRS and POHRS Systems. For instance, a system used to track soil temperature
    and nutrient content might release information once each hour or day. Meanwhile,
    a different system will deliver data every minute for crop growth assessment.
    As more smart sensors are deployed and technology is developed, the amount of
    data conveyed for different crops in soil and crop growth monitoring will expand
    in the future. Aspects that can increase the volume of data include the number
    of sensors used, the type of data (image, text, or numerical), frequency, distance,
    time, cost of data transmission, size of the farmed area, crop type, climate,
    irrigation method, soil type, disease type, etc. 10. Comparative analysis of existing
    smart agriculture system with proposed 5G based architecture For the recommendation
    of a 5G-based smart agriculture framework, some of the existing available research
    surveys have already (Liu et al., 2023) been carried out, in which the major technologies
    and technological barriers preventing the advancement and development of smart
    agriculture applications leveraging 5G technologies are described. The resultant
    effect of 5G on the IoT for smart agriculture is outlined. An exploration of precision
    agricultural (Majumdar et al., 2023) applications has been explored using green
    IoT-based solutions, utilizing UAVs, LPWANs, and 5G networks as well as an assortment
    of technical issues. Utilizing 5G networks and beyond, the long-lasting expansion
    of digital farming through the incorporation of green IoT technology enables the
    IoT greener. The proposed architecture above has been recommended by incorporating
    each multiple-edge gateway grid with the central controller for all small and
    large farming area data based on the existing 5G-based smart agriculture architecture.
    The advantages of using this agriculture system over existing IoT-based agriculture
    systems include the immediately apparent advancement across multiple agriculture
    applications, centralised archives of data, estimation process power, etc. Existing
    smart agriculture exhibits challenging obstacles and demands to handle high volume
    data storing processes, computation power, and managing various agriculture applications
    of small and large farming areas. Therefore, in this instance, data computation,
    interpreting, and other capabilities can be offered close to the network''s edge,
    where initially the data are originated. Edge computing power has benefits such
    as decreased latency, bandwidth savings, reduced downtime, increased trustworthiness,
    improved privacy and security, etc. The proposed IoT-based architecture allows
    for the best provisioning of resources using SDN, network segmentation, route
    optimisation, load balancing, and other practises. A evaluation of current smart
    farm systems with the proposed IoT architecture is shown in Table 5 below based
    on the various parameter. Some of the characteristics are identical in the proposed
    5G-based smart agriculture architecture and the existing smart agriculture architecture.
    The comparison has been verified based on this characteristic. Table 5. Advantages
    of the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system with existing smart agriculture
    system. Comparative parameter (Udutalapally et al., 2021) (Liu et al., 2023) Proposed
    5G based IoT agriculture architecture system Bandwidth Low Bandwidth Fast bandwidth
    with single edge network Fast bandwidth with single and multiple edge network
    with LPWAN communication Latency High latency rate and risk of data loss during
    cloud transmission. Delay time will be increased for large farming area. Delay
    time is reduced as of using multiple edge gateway. Interruption Interruption rate
    are high Interruption rate can be high if switching to 5G beyond network or multiple
    edge network. Interruption are reduced because authenticated edge connection for
    small and large farming field WSN and can be customized based on the network.
    Data storage Limited storage capacity and complicated database management because
    of limited globalization. High storage capacity at the cloud end, as the architecture
    is for small farming area. Capable of managing databases at the edge network and
    storage capacity will be maximum as using distributed system. Energy efficient
    Requires a lot of energy for calculation and processing while transmitting various
    types of data at long distances. More energy required as system is not fully distributed.
    Less energy consumption as system is distributed. Minimises the necessity for
    transmission of data over long distances. Real time decision Real-time decision-making
    can be accomplished although has a larger latency, which restricts its effectiveness
    for circumstances where timeliness is essential. Real time decision possible but
    lack in independency at each edge network. Increase productivity and yield by
    enabling real-time decision-making with exposure to the constantly changing conditions
    on the farm. PHRS Subsystems Integration of PHRS sub systems is possible with
    other farming sub system but need much enhancement, as limited range of network
    connections and no such algorithm for intelligent decision making at the edge
    level. Since PHRS module data differ from farm to farm, there are chances of data
    overload at the edge network level because there are no such discussions on NP-hard
    problem optimization strategies. Using of metaheuristic-based algorithms it is
    possible to increase the efficiency of PHRS, sub-systems in 5G-based or beyond
    networks. DHRS Subsystems Integration of DHRS sub-systems is limited as it provides
    a huge volume of image and video-type data. Integration of the DHRS subsystem
    is achievable as discussed about the UAVs-based system for various image vision
    problems. Integration of DHRS with PHRS subsystem is achievable using NB-IoT M2M
    communication. POHRS Subsystems Integration of POHRS subsystem is limited. POHRS
    subsystem integration for supply chain management. Management of POHRS subsystems
    for TTN, FDP, cooling, harvesting, and farmers'' inventory. Security and privacy
    Device security, data authentication, network slicing, and encryption still need
    to be improved. There is no analogous method discussed for recognising security
    ambiguity while deploying IoT devices for securing inconsistent energy-efficient
    communication devices for considerable distance and durability. The system becomes
    more efficient and capable with the help of 5G, SDN, and distributed edge computing
    structures and is able to oversee massive amounts of network traffic and data
    authentication. As a result of the discussion in Table 5 above, it can be concluded
    that creating the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system using edge computing
    could effortlessly extend to meet the increasing necessities of modern farming.
    The entire structure can be customized by how the agricultural operation grows
    and network changes or whether its operations require more sensors and devices.
    The below Table 6 discusses the proposed literature survey information with existing
    surveys information. Table 6. Comparative analysis of proposed survey from existing

    level. 5G Proposed Survey ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ According to Table 6, the proposed review fills
    the gap in existing reviews for IoT-based smart agriculture by classifying pre-
    and post-harvest activities into PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Based on this
    categorization, various existing work has been discussed in detail with an analysis
    of the IoT communication technologies and metaheuristic approach used in the IoT
    based smart agriculture system. As a result of the discussion of the problem in
    existing work, the 5G and 5G beyond smart agriculture system architecture are
    being prepared. With this recommended framework, the shortcomings of the existing
    work can be reduced, and the system can be optimized. 11. Conclusion IoT-based
    smart agriculture is the advancement of the digital transformation of various
    traditional farming subactivities. In this a comprehensive review by categorizing
    the farming subactivities based on the Pre, During, and Post harvests of the smart
    agriculture-based existing application has been discussed in detail. We have also
    observed the research gaps for each and every activity separately. Based on these
    research gaps it has been analyzed that developing an intelligent farming system
    is still a challenging process. We have tried to address these challenges and
    enhance the performance of the existing systems by proposing a 5G-based hybrid
    framework for smart agriculture. The outcome of the proposed survey is validated
    by comparison with the existing survey papers. It is found that various existing
    surveys have not been represented considering the smart agriculture applications
    according to the Pre, During, and Post harvesting phases. Therefore, our survey
    methodology and outcome seem to outperform the other surveys conducted so far
    for smart agriculture. In future work the technology wise survey for the different
    aspects of smart agriculture may be conducted. For example, we can have a comprehensive
    survey on the use of Machine learning algorithms for each activity of smart agriculture.
    Also crop wise comprehensive survey can be conducted involving all the pre, during
    and post-harvest activities. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

    Farming by Monitoring and Controlling Irrigation System Using Sensors Chapter
    © 2022 1 Introduction Most people in world depend on agriculture to live. It also
    increases a country’s gross domestic product (GDP). Growth in the agricultural
    sector is essential for developing countries’ economies. Unfortunately, most farmers
    are still using traditional agricultural practices, which has resulted in stagnant
    crop development. IoT based application in terms of automation in agriculture
    gives better yield and crop growth when compared with human based agriculture.
    IoT applications can replace human intervention in agriculture. IoT-enabled farming
    equipment in agriculture further improve crop output. A recent study has shown
    how to use sensor networks to father information and upload it to cloud servers
    and protocol networks to share it with other people and devices [1, 2]. Data are
    gathered from parametric sources and used for irrigation system monitoring. Our
    proposal introduces the real-time monitoring of data collected from fields, which
    help us regulate and operate them more efficiently. Our primary goal is to install
    smart irrigation and field-monitoring devices. Various forms of parametric data
    can be obtained by using sensors, which include smart irrigation data. IoT-enabled
    components on smart phones and other wireless devices process those data in real
    time by remaining connected to the Internet via Wi-Fi and Raspberry Pi interfaces.
    2 Background In our work, we utilize a monitoring system to regulate and collect
    data from various sensors to smart devices utilizing a Wi-Fi module to stay up
    to date on soil quality data and water levels [1]. The Bluetooth block focuses
    on greenhouse field parameters and controls key factors involved in regulation.
    We focus on creating a smart farming method that uses metrics such as soil moisture,
    temperature, and humidity—acquired via DHT11—and that remotely uploads data on
    those metrics to a server [3]. The proposed model would regularly record temperature
    and humidity data by using an Arduino microcontroller at various time intervals
    through ESP8266 and a Wi-Fi block [4]. The major goal of this study is to send
    collected data on various conditions to a user via a mobile app connected to a
    Wi-Fi relay and a Uno R3 so that water management can be carried out in the moment
    [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. 3 Proposed Model of a System (Fig. 1) The proposed
    model consists of four primary components: Raspberry Pi, a moisture sensor, a
    relay, and an IFTT app. Fig. 1 Proposed model Full size image The system block
    model is shown below. Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers
    that are used to perform small computing operations on a network. This component
    is the major element used in IoT. It provides an entry point in operation with
    the Internet to perform various automatic operations over Wi-Fi. The humidity
    sensor is used to immediately transfer digital data over a network. This component
    performs analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) operations and measures the humidity
    in the atmosphere around the field. The data captured from the sensor in real
    time are transmitted to the Internet and stored on a server. The moisture sensor
    is used to measure the moisture level and water content in soil. It uses the basic
    property of electric resistance to gather data on soil. It also compares the data
    captured from soil to environmental factors such as type, temperature, and electric
    conductivity of soil. The mobile application provides up-to-date information from
    various sensors to the user and server to analyze the data and record them in
    a database. The app sends a notification to the user in the form of an alarm.
    The IFTT app is connected to a controller and physical device that uses the Internet.
    The device receives various commands from other applications that control its
    components. IFTT is based on the notification that the pump is on or off on the
    day notified. The IFTT app, which is connected to the Internet, creates a link
    between devices to show various conditions. The IFTT app is available on smartphones
    connected to the Internet. 4 Methodology of Study Our proposed model collects
    data from various stages of inputs by using sensors, which are processed by Raspberry
    Pi because of the constraints on the work. Initially, the sensor has to access
    the data on soil moisture. Next, the sensor monitors the water management system,
    which controls the moisture level of soil. It automatically uploads these data
    onto the Altair SmartCore server, notifies to the user, and activates the pump.
    In this way, the user gathers all the relevant information on humidity, temperature,
    and water in the field by using sensors (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Workflow of the proposed
    model Full size image In the second phase, the level and flow of water are measured
    by using a sensor. Depending on the moisture level and level of the water in soil,
    the pump has to be turned off or on. The condition of the soil is reported to
    the user in a notification bar with additional data on humidity and temperature.
    Data Analysis We built an IoT-based, moisture- and temperature-monitoring, automated
    irrigation system utilizing field data sensor that transmit data via a microcontroller.
    Using Raspberry Pi, a serial device communicates with the moisture sensor and
    temperature sensor. Raspberry Pi is equipped with a learning technique, namely
    a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, that factors in soil temperature and moisture
    values. KNN categorizes the nearest training data set objects according to space
    feature values. This is functionally local. The classifier method detects earlier
    data supplied as needed. By analyzing the field for irrigation, the various conditions
    of the soil—i.e., wet, slightly wet, dry, or slightly dry—are compared against
    the training data set. The model monitors soil status in real time, obtaining
    data from the actuator, and may activate the water pump that supplies the fields.
    Finally, analyzed field data and the time necessary to irrigate the fields are
    updated to a server, informing the user of the soil condition and how much water
    to irrigate. All of these data are available on the farmer’s/user’s smartphone
    app. A temperature-versus-moisture data sheet containing a Comma-Seperated Values
    (CSV) file relevant to the training data set is also saved on server (Fig. 3).
    Fig. 3 Flow of verifying the rain condition Full size image On rainy days, there
    is no need to display the water level in the fields. If the moisture level is
    low, the IFTT application will offer data updates on the current day and day after.
    If heavy and regular rain occurs, this application will inform the server and
    user via the Internet. A rain alert notifies the user via the IFTT app. Depending
    on the type of notification, the pump will be on/off for the notified day. The
    IFTT app, connected to the Internet, constructs a condition-dependent chain connection
    utilizing applets (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Setup and connection location of IFTT app Full
    size image To access the app, the user must first set up and log in to a Gmail
    account. Then, using Gmail, the user must set up a user account for IFTT. After
    logging in, the user can turn on and off the rain-related forecast notifications.
    If the user wants to find out tomorrow’s rain forecast, they may set the date.
    After setting the date, the IFTT app notify the user of the rain forecast. To
    ensure the correct forecast, the user must select the field area location. Communication
    between the server, app, and user must be established via IoT in such a way that
    only the user may start receiving notifications via the app. The app notifications
    feature rain-related data such as overcast, partly cloudy, and rainy. It offers
    status information such as high, low, and medium. It also features ultraviolet
    (UV) index values. When a user receives a rain notification, they will not need
    to utilize this app on the pump. This information is continuously saved on a SmartCore
    server. The server also alerts the user via email whether the pump is on or off
    and includes the current soil humidity and temperature values (Fig. 5). Fig. 5
    IoT app for agriculture, for turning the pump on or off Full size image The soil
    pH value indicates acidity or alkalinity. A numerical scale is used to measure
    pH levels. This scale ranges from 0.00–14.00, where its minimum value, 0.00, is
    the most acidic and its maximum value, 14.00, is the most alkaline. The middle
    value, 7.00, is neutral, meaning that this value is neither alkaline nor acidic.
    The soil pH value affects the basic factors for plant growth: 1. The availability
    of nutrients 2. The structure of soil 3. The number of bacteria available in soil
    4. The toxicity of soil 5. Nutrient leaching Various nitrogen-free bacterial products,
    including fertilizers and some organic substances, may influence soil pH. Beneficial
    bacteria operate best in a 5.5–7.00 pH range. Aluminum in the soil can dramatically
    affect plant development by reducing the pH value to 5.0. The optimal pH range
    for most plants in clay soil is 5.0–7.0. Where alkalinity or acidity is severe
    in soil, the pH value affects plant production and growth. The pH level does not
    affect fertilizer itself, but it does affect fertilizer nutrients. A pH sensor
    evaluates the soil conditions while confirming the pH value on a 5.5–7.0 scale.
    If the soil pH value is higher, pH-related information is uploaded to and saved
    on an Altair SmartCore server. At the same time, the user of this server is notified
    of the current pH value of the soil. If the pH sensor value drastically changes,
    such as it exceeds a value higher than 7.0, indicating alkalinity, this pH value
    will be uploaded to and saved on the server. At the same time, the user is notified
    via an email also containing data on other various conditions of the soil, including
    the sulfur content, peat sphagnum content, sulfate aluminum content, sulfate iron
    content, fertilizer acidity, and amount of compost and mulch. 5 Discussion with
    Results Input Training Data Sets (Table 1) Table 1 Input Training Data Set Full
    size table Analysis (EDA) of Training Data Python was used to visualize the relationships
    between the data. A pairs plot allows us to see both the distribution of single
    variables and the relationships between the two variables. Figure 6 contains scatter
    plots comparing each pair of columns against the target value column (i.e. yes/no).
    The columns are temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and water level. The target
    values ‘no’ are marked as blue plots, and the target values ‘yes’ are marked as
    orange plots (Figs. 7 and 8). Fig. 6 Feature mapping graph Full size image Fig.

    Messaging Service (SMS) Text Sent to User Scenario 1: Soil moisture is LOW, but
    water level is empty; hence MOTOR will remain OFF. Scenario 2: Soil Moisture is
    LOW; hence MOTOR is ON. Scenario 3: Soil Moisture is HIGH; hence MOTOR is OFF
    (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 A notification send to the user’s smartphone Full size image
    Depending on which SMS was sent to the user, which itself depends on the water
    level detected, they will be notified of whether to turn the motor on or off.
    (a) The pump flips on or off depending on the detected condition: When the water
    level is low, the pump motor turns on automatically. In certain scenarios, while
    the pump is in operation, data can be sent to the user accord to their preferences.
    (b) The pump is flipped on or off by the user: Water flow is measured within a
    specific period of time, and this measurement determines whether the pump is on
    or off. The pump’s on/off condition is based on the condition detected by the
    moisture sensor. The user is notified of this condition in a notification bar
    that details the humidity and temperature values. Also, the notification can be
    sent when the user is far away, depending on the user’s notification bar settings,
    which can display more details than just the water level. (c) The soil acidity
    increases: If the soil acidity increases, the user’s email address will be notified
    of this change, and the details of that email will include the current pH values
    of their soils. (d) The soil alkalinity increases: When a pH sensor detects a
    pH value higher than 7.0, the soil is alkaline. The detected pH value is at this
    point uploaded to and saved on an Altair SmartCore server. At the same time, the
    information is automatically sent to the user’s email address, along with details
    on the correct chemical composition of the soil, including the sulfur content,
    peat sphagnum content, iron sulfate content, fertilizer acidity, and amount of
    mulch. The pH Database The database bridges the gap between the sensor and the
    user, saving time. The database is managed and stored on a native cloud platform.
    This platform contains the digital information from the sensor and other IoT components.
    The Altair SmartCore improves the reliability of and speed in accessing the platform
    and its data. The stored data are analyzed and converted into readable reports
    that they can be used when making decisions. The reports also date the information
    (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Agriculture monitoring system and smart irrigation system Full
    size image 6 Future Scope and Conclusion The proposed model offers flexible setup
    options when configuring various components, reduces costs, and can be customized
    in how it monitors the conditions of agricultural production. The flexibility
    of this setup improves its ability to detect and solve more problems. This model
    can effectively control and monitor large areas of farmland. Future studies should
    increase the model’s throughput by adding more sensors to record more inputs at
    the same time so that the various elements necessary for crops are accurately
    supplied in fertilizer instead of extracting them from the ground. This model
    can be also implemented in other industries to monitor tanks and tank leaks. References

  description: Hydrogeophysical methods have been increasingly used to study subsurface
    soil–water dynamics, yet their application beyond the soil compartment or the
    quantitative link to soil hydraulic properties remains limited. To examine how
    these methods can inform model-based evapotranspiration (ET) calculation under
    varying soil water conditions, we conducted a pilot-scale field study at an experimental
    maize plot with manipulated irrigation treatments. Our goal was to develop a workflow
    for (1) acquiring and inverting field electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)
    data, (2) correlating ERT to soil hydraulic properties, (3) spatially characterizing
    soil water stress that feeds into ET modeling (the FAO-56 model), and (4) evaluating
    the performance of ERT-based ET computation. Our results showed that ERT was able
    to capture decimeter-scale soil water content (SWC) dynamics from root water uptake
    and irrigation manipulation and the contrast of soil water stress between deficiently
    and fully irrigated maize. We also demonstrated the flexibility of using ERT to
    spatially integrate soil water stress in the soil volume of interest, which could
    be adjusted based on different crops and plot layouts. The integration of the
    ERT datasets into ET modeling provided insights into the spatial heterogeneity
    of the subsurface that has been challenging for point-based sensing, which can
    further our understanding of the hydraulic dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum.

    resistivity tomography (ERT) data, (2) correlating ERT to soil hydraulic properties,
    (3) spatially characterizing soil water stress that feeds into ET modeling (the
    FAO-56 model), and (4) evaluating the performance of ERT-based ET computation.
    Our results showed that ERT was able to capture decimeter-scale soil water content
    (SWC) dynamics from root water uptake and irrigation manipulation and the contrast
    of soil water stress between deficiently and fully irrigated maize. We also demonstrated
    the flexibility of using ERT to spatially integrate soil water stress in the soil
    volume of interest, which could be adjusted based on different crops and plot
    layouts. The integration of the ERT datasets into ET modeling provided insights
    into the spatial heterogeneity of the subsurface that has been challenging for
    point-based sensing, which can further our understanding of the hydraulic dynamics
    in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Abbreviations DOY day of year ER electrical

    SWC soil water content 1 INTRODUCTION Advancing field-scale soil water content
    (SWC) mapping tools is critical to improve crop evapotranspiration (ET) computation
    that requires root zone water availability as a model input. Economic, operational,
    and ecological objectives such as optimizing irrigation-to-yield ratio, planning
    for heat and droughts, and transitioning to sustainable practices all seek to
    increase crop water use efficiency. Quantifying SWC in time and space provides
    the key information to evaluate when, where, and if the water management scheme
    needs to be adjusted. Because SWC measurements in the field still largely rely
    on point sensors, upscaled SWC imaging tools remain desirable, which allows a
    more holistic evaluation of the extent, severity, and development of soil water
    stress (Ritchie, 1981). Such data are key to informing irrigation manipulation,
    and they are also the often-lacking inputs of hydrological models that estimate
    ET. Analyzing and predicting how ET is or will be affected by agricultural practices
    and climate patterns through modeling are also crucial components of water resource
    management. One of the widely adopted ET models in the agricultural field is FAO-56,
    developed by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization based on the
    Penman–Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998; Monteith, 1965; Penman, 1948). FAO-56
    standardizes the calculation of a reference ET (ETo) from local meteorological
    observations made above well-watered short grasses, and it includes a library
    of crop coefficients that correlate ETo to the ET of a great variety of crops,
    also well-watered, at different growth stages. To quantify the percentage of ET
    reduced by soil water stress, FAO-56 introduces evaporation (E) and transpiration
    (T) reduction coefficients as functions of the amount of water remaining in the
    soil. Because FAO-56 uses a one-dimensional and history-dependent analysis of
    water fluxes in and out of the root zone to calculate the reduction coefficients,
    the model assumes spatially homogeneous SWC distribution and root water uptake
    (RWU) intensity in the rooting depth, generalizing the heterogeneous and depth-dependent
    root zone water dynamics. Without spatial inputs such as in situ SWC measurements
    (water source) and the knowledge of where roots actively uptake water (water sink),
    the derived coefficients could misrepresent the severity of soil water stress
    that the crop experiences. Spatial quantification of SWC has been validated using
    geoelectrical techniques in laboratory and field studies (al Hagrey et al., 2004;
    Cimpoiaşu et al., 2020). Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is one of the
    methods that characterizes the subsurface with active electrical measurements
    and inverse modeling (Binley & Kemna, 2005; Ernstson & Kirsch, 2006; Samouëlian
    et al., 2006), and it has produced soil electrical resistivity (ER) maps that
    were sensitive to SWC distribution (Kelly et al., 2011; Michot et al., 2001; Panisodd
    et al., 2001). Because current flow in the soil depends on pore water connectivity
    (Bussian, 1983), pedophysical relationships between soil ER and SWC could be established.
    These soil-specific calibrations have been tested in situ with embedded arrays
    of time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors (Beff et al., 2013; Michot et al.,
    2003; Werban et al., 2008) and neutron probes (Srayeddin & Doussan, 2009), and
    ex situ with laboratory pedophysical experiments (Celano et al., 2011; Zhou et
    al., 2001). Petrophysical models such as Archie and Archie-like formulations have
    been adopted to describe the soil ER–SWC correlation (Archie, 1942). Vadose zone
    hydrological processes have been investigated by analyzing the temporal and spatial
    variation in SWC from the ERT monitoring datasets. Time-lapse ERT helped visualize
    SWC dynamics such as RWU (Mary et al., 2020; Michot et al., 2001), irrigation
    drainage (Kelly et al., 2011), and preferential water infiltration via root channels
    (Beff et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2001). At an hourly timescale, ERT monitoring
    also captured the diurnal trends of transpiration and SWC redistribution (Blanchy
    et al., 2020; Werban et al., 2008). Agricultural practices that contribute to
    the spatial heterogeneity of SWC were also surveyed using ERT, including deficient
    irrigation (Srayeddin & Doussan, 2009; Vanella et al., 2021), soil compaction
    from machinery, tillage, and pasturage (Losinno & Sainato, 2018; Michot et al.,
    2003), and cover crop rotation (Celano et al., 2011). Several studies also used
    ERT to compute agricultural variables such as plant available water (Brillante
    et al., 2016), water depletion rate (Garré et al., 2011), and SWC mass balance
    (Cassiani et al., 2012; Celano et al., 2011) by analyzing the changes of soil
    ER over time. To the best of our knowledge, ERT has only been coupled with the
    FAO-56 model once to improve the estimation of the fraction of wet and exposed
    soil surface and thus the evaporation from soil (Vanella et al., 2019), while
    the calibration of FAO-56 ET reduction coefficients using ERT has not been investigated.
    We conducted a field study in a conventional maize plot in Davis, CA, where ET
    was supplied with controlled subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). Our goals were
    to (1) investigate ERT''s capability of resolving decimeter SWC variations resulting
    from contrasting irrigation regimes and RWU patterns and (2) integrate ERT-based
    SWC characterization into ET computation, such as daily ET based on the United
    Nations Food and Agricultural Organization ET model (FAO-56) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and accumulative ET through SWC mass balance. Core Ideas Electrical resistivity
    tomography (ERT) captured soil water dynamics induced by root water uptake and
    irrigation manipulation. ERT enabled spatial analysis and quantification of soil
    water stress, a key input to the evapotranspiration (ET) model. A workflow from
    field ERT data acquisition to ET computation was demonstrated. 2 MATERIALS AND
    METHODS 2.1 Field site and experiment timeline The field experiment was carried
    out at Russell Ranch Sustainable Agriculture Facility in Davis, CA (38°32′32.9″N,
    121°52′32.0″W). Zea mays (maize) was seeded in a row crop field (64 × 64 m2) at
    a density of 80,000 plants ha−1 on April 21, 2018, and harvested on October 5,
    2018 (Figure 1a). To compensate for the lack of precipitation (7.4 mm during the
    experiment duration) and low water table (12-m deep on March 21, 2018, and 21-m
    deep on October 4, 2018) during the growing season, groundwater was pumped and
    supplied to every two rows (one bed) of maize via SDI pipelines buried at 0.1-m
    depth (Figure 1b). The timeline of irrigation was divided into four stages: (1)
    no irrigation (day of year [DOY] 111–148), (2) manipulated (deficit) irrigation
    (149–196), (3) full irrigation (197–229), and (4) no irrigation (230–278) (Figure
    2). On each day of irrigation, the water was delivered at an average rate of 1
    mm h−1 for 8 h for both full and deficit irrigation (between 0630 and 1430 PST).

    2 Open in figure viewer Accumulated irrigated volume per bed. The equivalent unit
    in millimeter was calculated as volume (m3) divided by interbed area (1.5 × 64
    m2). Four stages of irrigation and 7 days of electrical resistivity tomography
    (ERT) surveys (in red) are also labeled. In this study, we focused on the 10 beds
    at the west end of the plot, excluding two beds at the edge where maize was visually
    undersized (Figure 1a). Among the 10 beds, five levels of water or nitrogen stress
    treatments (T1–T5) were applied to five pairs of adjacent beds (Table 1). At T1–T2,
    manipulated deficit irrigation, an irrigation-to-yield optimizing strategy, was
    adopted, where water was limited to the maize before the drought-sensitive growth
    stages. During the manipulated irrigation stage, the irrigation system was activated
    for 2 (T1), 3 (T2), or 6 (T3–T5) days per week, followed by the full irrigation
    stage when all treatments received 6 days of irrigation per week to ensure kernel
    development during the maize reproductive stages (silk and grain filling) (Figure
    2). TABLE 1. Details of the water and nitrogen stress treatments. Treatment Irrigationa

    showed that the plot had a similar particle size distribution from 0- to 2-m depth
    with an average of 22% sand, 57% silt, and 21% clay (silt loam) (Table 2), and
    overall the mean dry bulk density gradually increased with depths (Table 3). Soil

    acquisition to ET computation is summarized in Figure 3. Note that the figures,
    tables, and equations that will be discussed in the future sections are included
    here for future reference. In short, ERT was converted into ET reduction coefficients
    based on laboratory pedophysical experiments, and a spatial analysis of the coefficients
    was performed to generate model input to calculate daily ET. Time-lapse differences
    in ERT, together with the irrigation data, were also used to compute accumulative
    ET. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer Summary of the workflow. ER, electrical resistivity;

    potential; SWC, soil water content. 2.3 ERT data acquisition and inversion Throughout
    the growing season, we acquired seven ERT surveys on DOY 134 (no irrigation),
    153 and 187 (manipulated irrigation), 214 and 228 (full irrigation), and 243 and
    260 (no irrigation). On each day of acquisition, we laid down a 31.5-m long ERT
    transect, crossing the 10 beds of interest perpendicularly at their N-S midpoint
    (Figure 1a,c). Sixty-four stainless steel electrodes were installed at 0.05-m
    deep with a 0.5-m inter-electrode spacing, and the position of the electrodes
    was kept consistent across acquisition by using a cable with a fixed 0.5-m lead
    spacing and referring to flags we set in place along the transect (Figure 1c).
    The ERT system in use was MPT-DAS-1 (Multi-phase Technology). Our acquisition
    followed a skip-2 dipole–dipole sequence with 1284 reciprocal pairs of electrode
    configurations, where the same responses are expected when the pairs of electrodes
    used for injection and measurement are interchanged (Parasnis, 1988). The measurements
    were taken in the time domain at the base frequency of 1 Hz, target voltage of
    200 V, target current of 2 A, and stacking of 3. Before the inversion, ERT data
    with high reciprocal errors (>5%), stacking errors (>5%), apparent resistivity
    (>1000 Ωm), electrode contact resistance (>30,000 Ω), and/or low voltages (absolute
    value < 0.0005 V) were excluded. On average, 84% of the data were retained, ranging
    from 65% to 99% depending on the data quality of each acquisition. Each time step
    was then inverted independently using pyGIMLI processing codes (Rücker et al.,
    2017), aiming at a smoothed inversion of the apparent resistivity data while minimizing
    the data misfit (0.8 < chi-squared < 1.2). Time-lapse constraints were not applied
    in the inversion due to dynamic and competing processes such as irrigation and
    ET in this open system, which does not guarantee sequential changes among acquisitions
    at t − 1, t, and t + 1. The inverted resistivity (ρT [Ω m]) was adjusted to 25°C
    (ρ [Ω m]) based on the soil temperature (T [°C], ranging between 16 and 24 °C
    during the growing season) measured and interpolated among depths (0.1, 0.25,
    0.5, 1, 2, and 5 m) (Hayashi, 2004): (1) 2.4 Laboratory pedophysical experiments
    2.4.1 Soil electrical experiment To correlate soil-specific electrical and hydraulic
    properties, we measured soil ER and soil matric potential (SMP) across a wide
    range of saturation degrees in the lab. Soil ER was measured in a cylindrical
    polyvinyl chlroide (PVC) column (inner diameter 0.145 m, height 0.05 m), in which
    the topsoil (0– 0.25 m) sampled from the field using the direct push method was
    repacked with a pestle (Figure 4a). We installed two four-electrode arrays (a
    total of eight Ag/AgCl electrodes) from the bottom of the column, where the two
    outer electrodes were used to inject current, and the inner pair measured the
    soil resistance (PSIP, Ontash & Ermac). Resistivity was calculated from resistance
    using the geometric factors determined with solutions of known conductivity (Figure
    4b). To saturate the soil, we placed the soil column in the water obtained from
    the field, and the water was only allowed to flow upward into the soil via openings
    drilled from the bottom of the column to avoid trapping air. The bottom-up saturation
    process lasted 2 weeks until the soil surface appeared glossy, and the SWC estimate
    exceeded 0.41, a value obtained from the water retention experiment described
    in the following section. During the experiment, water loss was only allowed via
    evaporation from the top, and the SWC (θ [m3 m−3]) and saturation degree (S [m3
    m−3]) at each acquisition were determined gravimetrically and eventually via oven-drying
    at 60°C until the weight stabilized (porosity [φ] = 0.453 and dry bulk density
    = 1.46 g cm−3): (2) FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer Pedophysical experiments: Soil

    and (M, N) for measuring resistance. (b) From the bottom of the column: the location

    soil water content (SWC) gravimetrically. ID, inner diameter. Soil ER was corrected
    to 25°C (ρ [Ω m]) and saturation degree (S) data were fitted using the Waxman–Smits
    model (Waxman & Smits, 1968): (3) (3a) (4) (5) where φ (m3 m−3) is the porosity,
    ρf (S m−1) is the pore water resistivity, b ([S m−1]/[meq cm−3]) is the equivalent
    ionic conductance of exchange cations, Qv (meq cm−3) is the cation exchange capacity
    per unit pore volume, CEC (meq g−1) is the cation exchange capacity (taken as
    0.2529, measured by Blundell et al., 2020), and Dsoil (g cm−3) is the soil particle
    density (taken as 2.65). The model parameters, M [−] (cementation exponent) and
    N [−] (saturation exponent), were fitted with linear regression using the log-log
    form of the Waxman–Smits model (Equation 3a). The saturation-dependent pore water
    resistivity (ρf) was estimated following Hilhorst (2000): (6) where εw (−) is
    the dielectric permittivity of the water (taken as 78.5 at 25°C), εs (−) is the
    dielectric permittivity of the dry soil (taken as 4.1, Hilhorst, 2000), and ε
    (−) is the dielectric permittivity of the bulk soil, solved using Topp Equation
    (Topp et al., 1980): (7) Finally, an empirical model was fitted to generalize
    pore water resistivity (ρf) as a function of saturation degree (S): (8) where
    ρf sat, (S m−1) pore water resistivity at full saturation, and c (−), an empirical
    exponent, were fitted linearly using the estimated pore water resistivity (Equations
    6 and 7) and the measured saturation. 2.4.2 Soil water retention experiment SMP
    was measured in a Hyprop unit (METER). Adjacent to the soil sample used for the
    electrical measurements, a cylindrical soil sample was cored from the field at
    0.05- to 0.1-m depth and saturated with the irrigation water initially using the
    aforementioned bottom-up saturation technique. As the soil dried, SMP was measured
    and calculated as the geometric mean between the two tensiometer readings, and
    SWC was monitored gravimetrically with the balance and determined via oven-drying
    at 60°C until the weight stabilized eventually (porosity = 0.407 and dry bulk
    density = 1.56 g cm−3) (Figure 4c). Additional SMP of drier soil (<−880 hPa) was
    measured using WP4C (METER), which calculated the SMP of the sample by measuring
    its dew point temperature. The SMP and saturation degree data were fitted with
    a PDI variant (Iden & Durner, 2014; Peters, 2013) of the unimodal constrained
    (van Genuchten model, 1980) using the Hyprop-Fit software: (9) where S (m3 m−3)
    is the saturation degree, ψ (hPa) is the SMP, and Sres is the saturation degree
    at maximum SWC of adsorptive water. The retention curve parameters, α (cm−1) (the
    inverse of the soil suction at air entry of the adsorptive retention) and n (−)
    (a curve shape parameter), are embedded in the formulation of the two saturation
    functions: capillary (scap) and adsorptive saturation function (sad) (Pertassek
    et al., 2015): (10) (11) (12) A distinction of the PDI model is that it forces
    the soil suction to reach oven-dryness at ψo = −106.8 hPa when SWC = 0 (Schneider
    & Goss, 2012). The parameters α, n, and Sres were fitted by minimizing the residual
    sum of squares. 2.5 Evapotranspiration 2.5.1 Reference ET model In this study,
    we used the dual crop coefficient model from FAO-56 as our reference model: (13)
    where ETc adj (L/T) is the adjusted crop ET for nonoptimal conditions, ETo (L/T)
    is the reference ET over a well-watered grass surface, Ke (−) is the soil evaporation
    coefficient, Kcb (−) is the basal crop coefficient (for transpiration), and Ks
    (−) is the water stress coefficient (for transpiration). ETo is a standardized
    measurement available in most weather stations, and we acquired ours from a station
    managed by the California Irrigation Management Information System, 9 km away
    from the maize plot. Ke depends on the irrigation method, crop coverage, and water
    availability in the topsoil; Kcb depends on the species, crop development, and
    local climate; Ks depends on the species and water availability in the root zone.
    The derivation of Kcb, Ke, and Ks can be found in FAO-56 Chapters 7 and 8 (Allen
    et al., 1998). 2.5.2 ET reduction coefficients FAO-56 uses two ET reduction coefficients
    to quantify the decrease of evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) rate as the
    soil dries: Kr (soil evaporation reduction coefficient, embedded in the calculation
    of Ke) and Ks, where Kr and Ks are the ratios of the actual E and T to their optimal
    rates, respectively. FAO-56 defines three stages of reduction: (1) Optimal ET
    (K = 1): when field capacity is reached after a significant precipitation or irrigation
    event, there is readily evaporable water in the evaporative depth (Ze) and plant-available
    water in the effective rooting depth (Zr) for ET without limitation. (2) Reduced
    ET (1 < K < 0): when the readily evaporable/available water is depleted, the rate
    of E or T decreases from its optimal rate as the SMP decreases. (3) ET Ceases
    (K = 0): strong adsorption between soil matrix and water inhibits E or T when
    total evaporable or available water is depleted (see fig. 38 and 42 in Allen et
    al., 1998). Computing ET reduction coefficients as a function of the cumulative
    depletion of soil water requires quantifying and balancing the water influxes
    (irrigation, precipitation, and capillary rise) and effluxes (ET, surface runoff,
    and deep percolation). Several limitations arise with this approach: (1) subsurface
    fluxes are difficult to quantify; (2) ET, the final output, feeds into the computation
    of Kr and Ks; (3) the assumption that the soil is at field capacity homogeneously
    after rain or irrigation can be invalid; (4) reducing the soil volume to one dimension
    ignores the spatial distribution of SWC and roots. To address these challenges,
    we reformulated the reduction coefficient (Kr and Ks) equations from functions
    of cumulative depletion to functions of SWC ( θ): (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19)
    where θFC (m3 m−3) is the SWC at field capacity (using Equation 9), θWP (m3 m−3)
    is the SWC at wilting point (using Equation 9), θKr (m3 m−3) is the SWC below
    which the evaporation rate is reduced (Kr < 1), and θKs (m3 m−3) is the SWC below
    which the transpiration rate starts to decrease (Ks < 1). The reduction coefficients
    are a function of Δz (m) (effective evaporative depth, taken as 0.1 m, eq. 73
    in Allen et al., 1998) or p (−) (a crop-specific soil water depletion fraction
    before the roots start to experience water stress, taken as 0.55 for maize, tab.
    22 in Allen et al., 1998). This SWC-based approach does not require temporal fluxes
    as inputs, and it allows spatial analysis of soil water stress when spatial SWC
    characterization is available. In alignment with FAO-56, our water stress analysis
    was only concerned with soil drier than field capacity, and therefore the hypoxic
    condition was not discussed. 2.6 Hydrogeophysical methods in ET computation ERT
    and the pedophysical relationship were introduced into ET computation through
    (1) calculating the ET reduction coefficients for the daily FAO-56 dual crop coefficient
    model and (2) quantifying accumulative ET based on SWC mass balance from ERT time
    lapse. The first step of both methods involved converting soil ER from ERT to
    SWC based on the laboratory pedophysical relationship. Several assumptions were
    made to bridge laboratory results to field application: (1) model parameters—M
    and N in Waxman–Smits (Equation 3a), ρf sat and c in pore fluid resistivity (Equation
    8), and α, n, and Sres in van Genuchten (Equations 9-12)—were taken as the fitted
    values from the column experiments; (2) CEC and soil particle density were set
    constant (Equation 5); (3) porosity of the soil at the field was treated as a
    depth-dependent input (Table 3), which was used to (a) convert saturation degree
    derived from ERT into SWC (Equations 3a and 5), (b) determine SWC at field capacity
    and wilting point (Equations 14 and 15), and (c) calculate SWC thresholds where
    E/T is reduced (Equations 16 and 17). After the SWC (θi) of each ERT mesh cell
    (i) was determined, we calculated local ET reduction coefficients (kri and ksi)
    at each cell (Equations 18 and 19), which were finally integrated spatially as
    weighted averages to be the inputs to FAO-56 model (Kr ERT and Ks ERT): (20) (21)
    where wi (−) is the weight given to each cell based on their contribution to ET.
    For transpiration (wi), the soil underneath the nonirrigated paths and/or deeper
    than the effective rooting depth (Zr), where RWU was insignificant, received w
    = 0. The effective rooting depth was estimated as a function of growth days based
    on nonlocal field measurements of maize (Archontoulis & Licht, 2017). They observed
    a root growth rate of 7 mm day−1 before the fifth-leaf stage (DOY 131 at our plot),
    followed by 31 mm day−1 until the silking stage, when the maximum depth of ∼1.5
    m was reached (DOY 175 at our plot). Within the root zone, the weight was assigned
    as a function of depth, w(z), according to a 4-3-2-1 rule proposed by Kranz et
    al. (2008), where the maize roots in the top quarter of the rooting depth contribute
    to 40% of the total water uptake (w = 0.4), second quarter to 30% (w = 0.3), third
    quarter to 20% (w = 0.2), and the bottom quarter to 10% (w = 0.1). For evaporation
    (wi), the soil deeper than the effective evaporative depth (Δz = 0.1 m), where
    E was insignificant, was assigned w = 0, because the residual diffusive evaporation
    below Δz is incorporated into Kcb and therefore governed by Ks (Equation 13; Aleen
    et al., 1998). The topsoil was assumed to contribute uniformly to E (w = 1), which
    could be adjusted based on canopy coverage. No depth-dependent weight was assigned
    to kri because we did not intend to resolve the vertical differences within Δz
    using the 0.5-m spaced electrodes. To calculate accumulative ET (ETacc), we subtracted
    two consecutive ERT to obtain the changes in SWC at the top 2 m (ΔSWC). Capillary
    rise and deep percolation beyond 2 m were neglected, assuming that the SDI system
    was efficient (Ayars et al., 1999). ETacc between the two surveys was calculated
    as: (22) 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Soil electrical-hydraulic calibration The
    relationship between saturation degree and soil ER was fitted with the Waxman–Smits
    model (M = 2.893; N = 2.292), saturation and pore water resistivity with an empirical
    relationship (ρf sat = 2.37 Ω m; c = 0.727), and saturation potential and SMP
    with the van Genuchten model (α = 0.0143; n = 1.247; Sres = 0.523) (Figure 5a–c).
    The figures also show the depth-dependency of these relationships when the mean
    porosity at each depth (Table 3) was fed into the functions to apply the calibration
    on the field data. The SWC thresholds at field capacity, reduced E/T, and wilting
    point at each depth were calculated and summarized in Table 4, and the equivalent
    SMP was around −2200 hPa at reduced T (θKs) and between −2850 and −2590 hPa at
    reduced E (θKr). FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer Soil electrical–hydraulic relationship.

    water dynamics Time-lapse ERT and the pedophysical relationship were applied to
    obtain the spatial distribution and temporal changes of SWC at the maize plot.
    Here, we focused on the top 2-m depth where ERT data coverage and resolution were
    higher, ET was active, and soil particle size distribution was similar, which
    led to the assumption of the applicability of the laboratory-fitted model parameters
    in the homogeneous soil. The surface ERT array was able to distinguish decimeter-scale
    contrasts in the irrigated row crop system (Figure 6). The pre-irrigation survey
    (DOY 134) showed a vertical transition from higher to lower resistivity without
    noticeable anomalies. The observed gradient aligned with the expectation that
    the predominant ET during the early vegetative stages of maize would be homogeneous
    surface evaporation of the rainfed soil water, when canopy coverage, root growth,
    and water uptake were less significant (Figure 1b). Upon irrigation, ERT was able
    to differentiate the irrigated beds from the exposed and nonirrigated paths in
    the topsoil. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer Time-lapse electrical resistivity
    tomography (ERT) between 0- and 2-m depth. The center (i.e., the SDI pipelines)
    of the 10 beds of interest, each including two rows of maize (black dots), are
    marked with the treatment and the replicate number, and the positions of the electrodes
    (red dots) are labeled on day of year (DOY) 134. ERT also highlighted the extent
    of soil affected by ET in response to irrigation manipulation and the development
    of maize. During and after the manipulated irrigation period (DOY 187 and 214),
    ERT showed higher resistivity at the water-stressed T1–T2 than the non-water-stressed
    T3–T5 at matching depths (Figure 6). Time-lapse ERT also showed a significant
    increase in resistivity (decrease in estimated SWC) at T1 and T2 between DOY 153
    and 214 (Figure 7), and the drying of soil at such depths suggested deeper RWU
    activities. Maize was found to induce soil drying as deep as 1.6 m when well-watered.
    When the soil water stress was present in the topsoil, the maximum RWU rate of
    maize was found to shift deeper, and root length density at depths also increased
    (Garré et al., 2011; Srayeddin & Doussan, 2009). FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer
    Temporal changes in soil water content compared to the previous acquisition. Negative
    values (red) indicate drying, and positive values (blue) indicate wetting. SWC,
    soil water content. During the full irrigation period (DOY 197–229), all treatments
    received the same amount of irrigation, while ERT showed SWC decreased between
    DOY 214 and 228 at T3–T5 (irrigation < ET) but increased at T1–T2 (irrigation
    > ET) (Figure 7). Physiologically, for a 150-day maize planted in April in California,
    the period between growth days 71–120 (corresponding to DOY 181–230) is its reproductive
    stage when kernel development is most active and crop water demand is at its peak
    (tabs. 11 and 17, and fig. 37 in Allen et al., 1998). The observation of smaller
    ET at T1 and T2 suggests a state of prolonged and severe soil water stress during
    the vegetative stages that could trigger physiological adaptation or damage (Cai
    et al., 2017; Tardieu et al., 2018)—to lower transpiration rate even if the SWC
    became available. Beyond growth day 121 (i.e., DOY 231), grain filling ceases,
    maize has reached maturity, and crop water demand decreases linearly from maximum
    to baseline. Also, no more irrigation was applied during this period. Therefore,
    the plummeting crop water demand, rather than the recovery of maize at T1 and
    T2, played a stronger role in the gradual decrease in lateral ΔSWC contrast from
    DOY 228–260 (Equation 22). 3.3 Soil water stress and ET ERT was introduced to
    spatially analyze soil water stress in the root zone. The one-dimensional approach
    (such as the method documented in the FAO-56 paper) requires a single estimation
    of the total water in the rooting depth, therefore assuming that the relevance
    of RWU and soil water stress is homogeneous in the root zone. However, maize roots
    were found to have the highest density and contribution to the total RWU near
    the surface when well-watered (Li et al., 2002). Here, ERT also showed an overall
    dry-to-wet resistivity gradient despite having the source of irrigation near the
    surface (Figure 6), indicating a diminishing contribution to the total ET with
    increasing depths. Under the assumption that RWU decreases with depth, we applied
    depth-dependent weights when integrating the water stress coefficient in the root
    zone (Figure 8a). FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer (a) Depth profile of local water
    stress coefficient (ks). The dotted lines are the four quartiles of the effective
    rooting depth, labeled with the contribution (%) to the total evapotranspiration
    (ET). Spatially integrated (b) soil evaporation reduction coefficient Kr ERT and
    (c) water stress coefficient Ks ERT. (d) Daily ET from FAO-56 model. The points
    are the ET values without ERT soil water stress adjustment. (e) Accumulative ET
    since day of year (DOY) 134 based on soil water content (SWC) mass balance. The
    dotted line is accumulative ET without electrical resistivity tomography (ERT)
    soil water stress adjustment. Vertical water stress profiles showed a persistent
    reduction of transpiration rate at the top 0.5 m due to low SWC caused by high
    ET intensities (Figure 8a). During the manipulated irrigation stage (DOY 187),
    transpiration was inhibited at shallow T1–T2 when SWC approached the wilting point,
    which prompted deeper RWU activities. The ET reduction coefficients were spatially
    integrated and fed into the FAO-56 model to compute daily adjusted crop ET (ETc
    adj) (Figure 8b–d). The difference between ET adjusted with ERT-based soil water
    stress at each treatment versus ET without ERT adjustment (Kr = 1, Ks = 1) was
    highlighted (Figure 8d). The accumulative ET calculated based on SWC mass balance
    showed higher values at the non-water-stressed treatments (Figure 8e), which merely
    reflected the fact that those treatments received a higher volume of irrigation
    input. However, we encountered negative ET at T1–T2 toward the end of the growing
    season, as seen from the slight decrease in acculturative ET values. This issue
    was also observed by Cassiani et al. (2012), which could be attributed to (1)
    the different time scale between the dynamic events (i.e., irrigation, ET) and
    ERT acquisition frequency (Blanchy et al., 2020); (2) smoothing of the resistivity
    in ERT inversion (Descloitres et al., 2008); and (3) decreasing sensitivity and
    resolution with depths using surface electrodes (Srayeddin & Doussan, 2009). 3.4
    Limitations and future outlook Converting soil ER from ERT to soil hydraulic properties
    based on a universal pedophysical relationship has been challenging. Given a heterogeneous
    field, multiple calibrations would be necessary, which could introduce sharp transitions
    between the defined boundaries (Garré et al., 2011). An example of heterogeneity
    would be the compaction at the paths from machinery passages, where soil and pore
    structures could be heavily modified (Celano et al., 2011; Michot et al., 2003).
    Hysteresis due to wet–dry cycles was also identified as an issue when the pedophysical
    relationship was applied during both cycles (Zhou et al., 2001). How representative
    the calibration relationship derived from controlled laboratory experiments was
    in the entire field has been questioned, while the lack of ground truth at matching
    locations to evaluate the applicability of the calibration was the limitation
    of this study. Nevertheless, comparing SWC derived from ERT and TDR SWC sensors
    (5TM, Decagon) (installed at the north end of the plot, not at the ERT transect)
    at matching depth (0.1 m), we observed that, throughout the growing season, (1)
    TDR measured higher SWC at water-deficit T1 and T2 than T3, and (2) TDR showed
    similar trends of decreasing SWC at all treatments, irresponsive to the irrigation
    manipulation (Figure 9). In this study, the TDR sensors were installed near the
    end of the irrigation pipelines, where we observed wetter surface soil compared
    to the rest of the plot. The comparison between point sensors and ERT highlighted
    the importance of the installation locations and the advantage of ERT thanks to
    its spatial coverage. FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer Comparison between electrical
    resistivity tomography (ERT)-derived soil water content (SWC) and time-domain
    reflectometry (TDR) point SWC measurement at 0.1-m depth. The error bar is the
    standard deviation of the SWC from ERT mesh cells at matching depths of each treatment.
    The bar plot (dark blue) is the irrigation volume per day. Some potential issues
    with the assumptions of the ET reduction coefficients (Kr, ERT and Ks, ERT) are
    as follows: (1) using a fixed maximum rooting depth and fixed depth-wise contribution
    to RWU across all treatments did not consider if soil water stress has triggered
    deeper root development and higher RWU from the deep roots, as observed in time-lapse
    ERT (Figure 6); and (2) the assumption that the transpiration rate decreased linearly
    with SWC after a threshold value (θKs) and ceased at wilting point, independent
    of species, has been questioned. Increasing ERT survey frequency will enable more
    detailed spatiotemporal analyses that can improve the use of ERT in crop ET computation.
    With temporally denser ERT datasets, the rate of RWU as a function of depth and
    time and the accumulative ET over a shorter time frame could be calculated using
    the SWC mass balance approach. These data can be used to (1) adjust the extent
    of rooting depth and the contribution of each depth to the total ET, (2) study
    if prolonged water stress physiologically alters transpiration, and (3) investigate
    the applicability of SWC thresholds to determine the RWU rate. These objectives
    will be beneficial to evaluate the performance of the manipulated deficient irrigation,
    study how prolonged heat and drought may temporally and permanently alter ET patterns,
    and improve the ET monitoring and modeling capability that better informs water
    resource management. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Chunwei Chou: Conceptualization; data

    Abstract Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based smart irrigation solutions rely on
    sensors for data reporting, a central infrastructure for generating irrigation
    parameters and a mobile machinery called Linear for irrigating. In this scenario,
    change in soil and environmental properties is referred as an event. Spatial distribution
    of such properties leads to multiple event regions in farmland. Identifying Boundary
    Nodes (BNs) of an event region is a well investigated problem in WSN, however,
    data reporting from BNs that caters to application specific requirements have
    rarely studied. To this end, an energy efficient data harvesting protocol for
    smart irrigation is designed that integrates three modules. First, to reduce number
    of source nodes and hence, energy consumption, a distributed Representative Node
    (RN) selection mechanism is proposed to identify a subset of BNs as the source
    nodes. Information from these RNs ensures correct actions even when nodes of more
    than two event regions lie nearby that is not achieved by existing RN selection
    mechanisms. Second, stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect data from
    RNs for ensuring proper actions. However, existing mechanisms limit to optimizing
    network lifetime. Calculation of data collection dependent stop time of Linear
    without having any information of RNs is proposed. Third, Reduced overhead broadcast

    Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Smart irrigation or Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI)
    is an emerging technique for precision agriculture where an area is irrigated
    according to its requirement. A field is divided into smaller sub-regions (event
    regions) of varying water requirement subject to soil texture, topography, crop,
    and environmental parameters. These event regions are called Management Zones
    (MZs). In traditional VRI setup, an irrigation machinery called Linear is guided
    by Base Station (BS) to move on a predefined linear path and irrigate the field.
    To generate control actions for irrigation, BS collects data from sensors in two
    ways. First, sensors send data to BS (placed outside the farmland) via multi-hop
    in flat [1, 2] or clustered architecture [3]. Second, data is collected from the
    nodes deployed in MZs of farmland having similar soil properties and irrigation
    requirement [4, 5]. These arrangements suffer from high energy consumption in
    data transmission from sensor nodes to BS for community agriculture where a large
    farmland is to be irrigated. Moreover, studies from agronomy [6] report the need
    of dynamic identification of MZs for monitoring purpose. MZs are spatio-temporally
    varying. To make the information regarding this change available near real-time
    at the Linear, is a key challenge. To accomplish this, Boundary Nodes (BNs) and
    non-BNs of MZ are marked in distributed fashion in our previous work [7]. The
    next step is to send information of BNs to Linear for generation of actions. Hence,
    the proposed work investigates the challenges of data harvesting from BNs of MZs.
    We assume that BS is mounted on Linear that stops at on-the-go identified locations,
    collects data from BNs, generates control actions and irrigates field while moving.
    In this work we intend to explore following research questions: Can a subset of
    BNs be identified as source nodes without loss of information of the event region
    boundary? How can stop time of Linear at a location be calculated at BS without
    any information of BNs? How does a Linear disseminate its location information
    with reduced network traffic and how a path is constructed from BNs to Linear?
    Will partial event region information be able to facilitate required action? What
    are the other applications where similar problem of data harvesting from BNs exists?
    Fig. 1 Data collection from a small region (Source: http://www.valleyirrigation.com)
    Full size image Figure 1 presents a scenario of data collection from BNs. A large
    irrigating machinery called Linear is guided by BS to move on a predefined linear
    path and irrigate the field. Linear moves at a low speed (\\(\\approx 2 m/s\\))
    or stops at some locations depending on the control action generated by BS. Data
    from the sensor nodes in a small region in front of Linear is collected at the
    BS, which then controls the sprinklers (actuators) mounted on Linear accordingly.
    For example, in Fig. 1, Linear is at position A and irrigating the region around
    it. The next region to be irrigated is B (enclosed by red line). Therefore, the
    information from sensors deployed in the shaded region must be delivered before
    Linear moves from position A and enters region B. Region B may consist of more
    than one event regions (sub regions of different irrigation requirements). Partial
    boundary information of all the sub regions facilitate irrigation schedule for
    region B. If all BNs send data to BS, the boundary information received at BS
    will be correct and proper actuation is ensured. However, if the number of BNs
    is large in a sub-region, network traffic increases. So, to reduce network traffic,
    the proposed work identifies a minimal set of BNs as sources laying in an event
    region. The minimal set must be selected such that the information from identified
    nodes suffice for the decision at BS. The nodes belonging to such minimal set
    are called Representative Nodes (RNs). Information from these nodes are sufficient
    to construct event boundary at BS. To demonstrate the impact of reducing BNs and
    hence, loss of information at BS, concept of event region map construction is
    introduced. Event region map is the virtual boundary of event regions created
    at BS from the position and data information of RNs. An example scenario (see
    Fig. 2a) consists of three event regions (MZs) A, B, and C where BNs 1–10 form
    boundary of A, 11–15 and 16–22 are the BNs of B and C, respectively. Suppose the
    RNs for construction of the event regions A, B, and C are \\(\\{2, 4, 6, 7, 10\\}\\),
    \\(\\{12, 13, 15\\}\\), and \\(\\{16, 17, 19, 21\\}\\), respectively. The coarsely
    constructed local map at BS from the information of these RNs, is shown in Fig.
    2b. Exclusion of any of these nodes will result in incorrect event region map
    and addition of other BNs to the set of RNs will fine grain the coarsely constructed
    boundary, however, increase the energy consumption. Thus, a trade-off between
    network traffic and information loss is to be maintained. Fig. 2 Minimal set of
    BNs Full size image Construction of event region map is limited to our work and
    actual decision making process depends on the algorithm running on BS. This work
    identifies a minimal set BNs as sources and explores the challenges of mobility
    assisted data collection (as explained with the help of Fig. 1). These challenges
    are application specific and vary from application to application. For example,
    in enemy troop detection [8], where soldiers move in their own area of surveillance,
    if there are some intruders, it becomes important to be aware of the area ahead
    of the troop. The problem is same to that of VRI, however, precise boundary information
    is required for this application. In automated brooding systems (chick, quail,
    goose, ducks) [9], temperature and humidity sensors are deployed to report different
    temperature zones. The problem of local map construction is similar to VRI, however,
    network of sensors is three dimensional. Thus, for enemy detection and livestock
    monitoring, the proposed scheme must be modified according to the challenges posed
    by specific scenario. This work takes VRI as use case and investigates the challenges
    of energy efficient data collection for reconstruction of event region map at
    Linear. Having discussed the application specific scenario and the other application
    where the problem may find its place, the essential features of the problem considered
    in the work are presented as follows: To minimize the traffic and energy consumption,
    a minimal set BNs known as RN is identified in such a way that correct actions
    are ensured at BS using the information of these nodes. Fig. 3 Taxonomy of data
    harvesting schemes in WSAN/WSN. Deploying Linear as a data harvesting and processing
    infrastructure for smart irrigation is proposed for the first time in this work
    to the best of our knowledge. This taxonomy presents existing mobility assisted
    data harvesting techniques Full size image Considering the RNs are identified
    through a distributed scheme, another challenge is posed by data acquisition from
    these RNs. Linear stops at some locations and collects data from the BNs laying
    in sub-region ahead, constructs a local view of the sub-region and generates control
    actions. In this context, the stop time of Linear must be adequate to collect
    data from all RNs. Inadequate stop time can result into insufficient information
    from RNs leading to inaccurate event decision at Linear. Hence, a data collection
    dependent stop time of Linear at a location is proposed. Moreover, to reduce energy
    consumption in location information dissemination, a reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme is proposed where a node transmits only one location information message.
    Temporal and spatial suppression of information is prevalent to reduce energy
    consumption of nodes. For example, authors in [10] have reduced the volume of
    data by modified version of KNN algorithm on sensor node and further aggregation
    of data at Cluster Head (CH). Authors in [11] proposed Data Transmission (DaT)
    Protocol for suppressing redundant data to save the energy while maintaining a
    suitable level of accuracy. Other temporal data compression techniques to reduce
    the energy consumption is proposed in [12,13,14,15,16,17]. Spatial information
    suppression focuses on reducing number of source node in the network. The existing
    algorithms for identifying RNs as source nodes are designed for boundary monitoring
    [18,19,20,21]. These schemes are energy efficient and select lesser number of
    BNs, however, construct incorrect event region in the case of more than two subregions
    (A, B, and C in Fig. 2). The mechanisms give inaccurate result when neighbors
    of a sensor node lay in two different event regions. For example, BN 4 and its
    neighbors 15 and 16 in Fig. 2a. Node 4 suppresses the data of its neighbors and
    sends information to BS that 15 and 16 are BNs of another region. However, while
    constructing the event region map, BS can not visualize that nodes 15 and 16 are
    the BNs of two different subregions. Detailed discussion is presented in Section
    4.2.2 with the help of Figs. 17, 18, and 19. Moreover, these schemes do not investigate
    data acquisition from RNs. There is a plethora of mobile infrastructure based
    data collection schemes (a taxonomy is presented in Fig. 3). In most of these
    works, the stop time is either independent of data collection [22, 23] or negligible
    [24, 25] for a mobile BS. A few research works have modelled the stop time of
    mobile BS. Table 1 discusses these works and the limitations regarding applicability
    to the scenario under consideration. The paper aims to design a distributed Lightweight
    Event Region map Construction based data harvesting protocol LERC, for delay tolerant
    applications with following contributions: To reduce network traffic, RNs are
    identified as data transmitters. The scheme identifies RNs that in turn construct
    correct event region map even when BNs of more than two event region lay in the
    neighborhood (explained in Section 4.2.2). BN calculates the gradient (defined
    in the first paragraph of Section 3.3) of line joining it to previous RN. If the
    gradient is greater than an application dependent threshold, BN marks itself as
    RN. The decision of BNs is evaluated by plotting the boundary of event region
    at Linear in which less number (at least 58%) of BNs are required for correct
    event region construction. A reduced overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for
    path construction that ensures only one message transmission by each node. It
    restricts transmission of multiple copies of location information message of Linear
    in the network. The efficiency of this scheme is measured in terms of energy consumption.
    Reduced overhead broadcast decreases the energy consumption of network by 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    with respect to the limited broadcast scheme proposed in [26]. Sojourn locations
    of Linear are identified on-the-go and data collection dependent stop time at
    a location is modelled. The modelled stop time is adequate to collect data from
    all RNs laying in the event region ahead that in turn ensures correct event region
    map construction at BS. Modelled stop time is the sum of maximum time required
    for dissemination of location information to the farthest BN of the region and
    data transmission from it to Linear. 2 Related work This section discusses the
    research related to RN selection, limited broadcasting, stop time, and stop location
    modelling. A summarized discussion of the research gaps with respect to the applicative
    scenario’s requirements, follows. 2.1 Selection of RNs (data reporting nodes to
    sink) In [19] energy efficient Continuous Boundary Monitoring (COBOM), only one
    BN is selected randomly as RN among its neighbor BNs. Selected RNs maintain and
    transmit a BN-array to sink that includes the boundary information around the
    RN. First all nodes send their position to sink to maintain a neighborhood map
    at sink. In each iteration, only one BN sends the data to sink along with the
    status of its neighbors as BN or non-BN. COBOM suppresses the BNs and achieves
    desired accuracy when nodes are belonging to only one event region that is either
    a node is inside the event region or outside of it. However, for smart irrigation
    there may be more than one event regions present. A node’s neighbors may belong
    to different event regions and in such condition boundary construction at sink
    will fail. It is proved by simulation in Section 4.2.2 with the help of Fig. 17.
    Authors in [20] have proposed a BN selection algorithm that identifies a small
    set of BNs independent of node density and provides well-balanced RN selection
    from the small set. It chooses only the closest sensor nodes to the boundary of
    an object as BN. A Neighbor Descriptor Table (NDT) that includes neighbor location
    information and event detection status is maintained as each node. From the selected
    BNs, the algorithm tries to choose only one RN per each radio range regardless
    of node density. The algorithm selects a BN as RN if no RN selection message arrives
    from its neighbor BNs and the two most distant neighbor BNs are selected as left
    and right RNs. Since the RN selection algorithm identifies only one RN per each
    radio range, it is not suitable for the applications where one-hop neighbors belong
    to different event regions. For the applicative scenario considered in our work
    one-hop neighbors may lay in different event regions and selection of only one
    BN among neighbors as RN lead to information suppression and incorrect decision.
    Hence, the above mentioned scheme is not applicable to the applications mentioned
    earlier in Section 1. Energy-efficient DEtection and MOnitoring for COntinuous
    objects in wireless sensor networks (DEMOCO) [21] focuses on reducing the number
    of BNs that eventually results in lowering the number of RNs to reduce traffic
    as well as communication between sensor nodes. It selects the nodes inward to
    the boundary of continuous event as RNs and ignores the outward BNs. It reduces
    number of RNs to half in comparison to COBOM. In this work, minimizing number
    of RNs and hence, overall energy consumption in data reporting are the main objectives.
    However, event region construction at BS is ignored. Hence, DEMOCO is not suitable
    for the applications where information from RNs facilitate construction of event
    region at BS. In [18], authors have proposed BN detection and boundary refinement
    scheme for continuous boundary monitoring in heterogeneous Internet of Things
    (IoT). Boundary of event region consists of resource rich backbone nodes that
    are assisted by resource constrained edge nodes. Planarization algorithms are
    applied to generate a coarse boundary region. Sensory data of edge nodes is estimated
    by backbone nodes by applying interpolation techniques. For boundary refinement,
    mobile BS visits each BN to collect data. The path of mobile BS is optimally planned
    by applying models including the Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with
    time constraints and Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), to enable the near real-time
    requirement of domain applications. The scheme identifies less number of BNs,
    however, the accuracy of boundary region decreases. Moreover, the scheme is centralized
    and hence, not suitable for automated smart irrigation scenario where BNs are
    identified by a distributed algorithm. 2.2 Limited broadcast Authors in [27] have
    proposed a limited broadcast scheme, where an actor transmits the location information
    in its Voronoi cell. Authors have assumed that sensors belonging to the Voronoi
    cell of an actor, are one-hop distant to it. Hence, number of messages transmitted
    for location update reduces. However, in applications such as VRI a few RNs may
    or may not be one-hop neighbors of Linear at its current stop location. In such
    scenario, the above mentioned scheme tends to perform as flooding. A Mobile Actor
    Routing Protocol (MARP) for data transmission in mobile Wireless Sensor and Actuator
    Networks (WSAN) is proposed in [28]. Actors stop at some locations for random
    time and broadcast two control signals to construct cluster around it. Cluster
    members send data to the actor within its pause time at that location. Stop locations
    and stop time are independent of data collection. The location information dissemination
    is restricted to the nodes belonging to the cluster around stop location of actor.
    However, the approach is still flooding that causes high energy consumption and
    moreover, if cluster size or node density increases energy consumption increases
    exponentially. Authors have proposed sensor-actor coordination mechanism in [29]
    where network is divided into grids and a CH is chosen for each grid. Actor broadcasts
    its location information while moving and CHs further floods it to other CHs and
    sensor nodes. The location information dissemination is restricted to the grid
    however, flooding of location messages consumes much energy. Moreover, if size
    of grid or density of nodes increases energy consumption increases exponentially.
    A limited flooding mechanism for cluster formation is proposed in [26], in which
    mobile BS broadcasts beacon periodically. Beacon contains hop count, energy, source
    address, and time to live (ttl). A node discards a packet if hop count of received
    packet is greater than the hop count stored at the node. If hop count is less
    than current value, it is updated and broadcasted again. Cluster formation stops
    if ttl has expired. Though limited flooding consumes less energy than flooding,
    the repetitive transmission by a node till ttl is reached, causes significant
    energy consumption in larger networks and hence is not scalable. 2.3 Stop time
    modelling A taxonomy of research works utilizing mobile BS is shown in Fig. 3.
    In WSAN (where mobile BS works as actuators), mechanisms of periodic visit are
    not appropriate to the problem under consideration, as the stop locations depend
    either on the nearness of previous stop point [30] or on the probability of event
    occurrence [31] and thus, are independent of data collection. However, for Linear
    move irrigation, next stop locations and stop time should take decision making
    and actuation into account. In existing works of on-demand visit [32], the key
    concern is to select an optimal actuator to take action in the event region. Table
    1 Evaluation of stop time based models Full size table In Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN) (where mobile BS acts as a data collector), for Linear visiting each node
    [38], the stop time is modelled for one hop transmission taking buffer constraint
    and speed of mobile BS into account. Another way of data collection is to visit
    a subset of nodes such as Rendezvous Points (RPs) [24, 25, 39,40,41] or Rendezvous
    Area (RA) [42, 43]. The stop locations are RPs that are decided by BS and known
    a priori to mobile data collector. Stop time at RPs are negligible most of the
    time. These algorithms do not fit for the applicative scenarios’ requirement as
    BS mounted on Linear has no prior knowledge of the BNs. Moreover, BNs are subject
    to change, so every time transmitting location of all BNs for calculation of stop
    locations will be wastage of constrained resources. In RA based mechanisms, stop
    time and stop location are random. When RPs are selected along the path of mobile
    BS, stop time is either negligible or modelled for one hop transmission. To the
    best of authors’ knowledge, none of the works design stop time and stop location
    taking the crucial aspects (collision, number of hops) of multi hop data collection
    into account. Apart from stop time and stop location, neither RP nor RA can furnish
    Linear with the event region boundary information. The mechanisms that model stop
    time are discussed in Table 1. 2.4 Discussion Limited flooding mechanisms broadcast
    location updates in a smaller region rather than entire network and hence, perform
    better than flooding. However, nodes are involved in repetitive transmission that
    consumes a considerable amount of energy. Stop time modelling in literature is
    either negligible or dependent on the energy consumption of the nodes for lifetime
    maximization. However, in application under consideration, stop time of the Linear
    should be adequate to collect data from enough BNs to construct a map of the event
    region. For reducing network traffic, data aggregation on CHs is a much prevalent
    method. However, CH election and cluster formation itself consume a considerable
    amount of energy [19, 20]. Moreover, CHs are not able to demarcate the boundary
    of a subregion (detailed discussion is presented in [7]). On the other hand, the
    RN selection schemes are energy efficient, however, fail to construct accurate
    map at sink when neighbors of a node lies in two different subregions. In VRI,
    incorrect boundary identification at sink hampers the decision making and actions
    to event region. 3 Lightweight Event Region Construction (LERC) protocol This
    section discusses the proposed methodology for data collection from BNs of a MZ.
    First, system framework and problem formulation are presented. Next, the three
    modules of the proposed methodology namely, reduced overhead broadcasting method
    (Section 3.2), RN selection scheme (Section 3.3), and calculations of stop time
    and next stop location (Section 3.4) are discussed. 3.1 System framework In this
    subsection, first we present the network model, energy model and problem formulation
    follows. 3.1.1 Network model Figure 4 depicts a scenario of farmland where a set
    of sensor nodes S = {\\(s_1, s_2...., s_n\\)} are deployed in an irregular polygon
    shaped field. The uniformly distributed sensors form a network represented as
    a graph \\(G=(S,E)\\) where sensor nodes form the vertices and connection among
    them is represented by a set of edges E = {\\(e_1, e_2...., e_m\\)}. \\(\\forall\\)
    s\\(_i\\), \\(\\exists\\) NB\\(^{d}_i\\) where NB\\(^{d}_i\\) is the one hop Neighborhood
    set of \\(s_i\\) with d members and \\(d <n\\). A node \\(s_j \\in\\) NB\\(^{d}_i
    \\iff \\left| s_i-s_j \\right| \\le\\) 2r, where \\(\\left| s_i-s_j \\right|\\)
    is the Euclidean distance between \\(s_i\\) and \\(s_j\\) and r is the communication
    range of \\(s_i\\). A multi attribute sensing sensor node \\(s_i\\) is capable
    of measuring different soil properties (for example soil moisture, temperature,
    AWC). In Fig. 4 there are two categories of nodes, namely, Boundary Nodes (BNs)
    and Interior Nodes (INs) where boundary of a MZ is demarcated by the BNs (solid
    circles). A node \\(s_i\\) marks itself as BN or IN depending on the measurements
    and position information received from the nodes in NB\\(^{d}_i\\). Each node
    upon receiving data from its neighbors runs MZ delineation algorithm (for details,
    please refer [7]). A list of symbols is presented in Table 2. Table 2 List of
    symbols Full size table BNs represent the MZ, on boundary of which, these are
    laying. To collect data from the BNs, Linear are deployed in the field. BS is
    responsible for data collection and generation of control actions and is mounted
    on a self propelled Linear move irrigation machinery (shown in Fig. 1). The actuators
    (mounted on Linear) control the rate, amount, timing of irrigation as well as
    the on/off mode of sprinklers according to the location of BNs. Fig. 4 An example
    scenario with multi Linears Full size image Linear (\\(Linear_1\\) or \\(Linear_2\\))
    starts from the periphery of the farm that is the first stop location of it. It
    gathers data from RNs (a subset of BNs), construct MZ map, generates control actions
    and irrigates the field while moving. Thus, there are two states of Linear namely,
    Stop and Collect (S&C) and Move and Irrigate (M&I). The assumptions made are based
    on the various real life VRI systems. VARIwise [44] is an autonomous control platform
    developed to generate Prescription Map for automated VRI. In an another project,
    VRI system developed by University of Georgia [45], for generating dynamic Prescription
    Map takes feedback from the sensor network. The University of Georgia Smart Sensor
    Array (UGA SSA) consists of smart sensor nodes and a base station that form a
    mesh network. 3.1.2 Energy model In this setup, sensor nodes are deployed in the
    field having transmission range equal to r. Nodes remain in sleep state till a
    control signal from Linear arrives to wake these nodes. Energy consumption of
    a node is the sum of the energy consumed in various states of a node namely, idle
    (\\(E_{idle}\\)), transmit (\\(E_t\\)), and receive (\\(E_r\\)) as proposed in
    [46, 47]. Where, \\(E_{idle}\\) is the energy consumed in Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access (CSMA) backoffs and idle state (waiting for data or control packet). Since,
    we are not optimizing any parameter of idle state, energy consumed is depicted
    as \\(E_{idle}\\) to keep it simple. Energy consumed in transmit state (\\(E_t\\))
    and receive state (\\(E_r\\)) are as follows [46]: $$\\begin{aligned} E_t= (e_t+e_{d}r^{p})B.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) $$\\begin{aligned} E_r=e_{r}B. \\end{aligned}$$ (2) where,
    \\(e_t\\) is the energy/bit consumed by the transmitter electronics, and \\(e_d\\)
    accounts for energy dissipated in the transmit op-amp. r is the transmission range
    and p is the channel path loss index. B is the bit rate of radio. The first phase
    of LERC protocol is Reduced Overhead Broadcast, where, each node receives a control
    message from all its predecessors and broadcast one message to its successors.
    Thus, in this phase, a maximum of k messages are received and one message is transmitted
    for a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{ROB}_i
    = (k_i*E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where, \\(k_i\\) is the number of neighbors
    of node \\(s_i\\). A node enters in RN selection phase after it receives a control
    message \\(RN_c\\) from its predecessor (explained in the first paragraph of Section
    3.3). It broadcasts this control message after deciding about its role as RN or
    non-RN. Thus, in this phase at most one message is transmitted and received by
    a node. The energy consumed during this phase is: $$\\begin{aligned} max E^{RN}_i
    = n_{BN}(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where, \\(n_{BN}\\) is the number of BNs.
    Though size of packets in downstream, upstream and RN selection phase differs,
    it is ignored to make calculations simple. After deciding its role as RN or non-RN,
    a node transmits its data towards Linear (via the path constructed in reduced
    overhead broadcasting phase) if it is a RN or waits for the data from RNs to forward,
    otherwise. In worse case, a node may forward data packets of all RNs. So, for
    upstream data transmission, a node receives and transmits messages equal to number
    of RNs. So, the maximum energy consumption is written as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    max E^{DT}_i = n_{RN}*(E_r+E_t). \\end{aligned}$$ (5) Thus, the maximum energy
    consumption of a node \\(s_i\\) is written as: $$\\begin{aligned} max E_i = E_{idle}+
    (k_i*E_r+E_t)+(n_{RN}+n_{BN})*(E_t+E_r). \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where, \\(E_{idle}\\)
    is the energy consumed in idle state for during all phases mentioned above. LERC
    aims to reduce number of transmissions of a node for location information dissemination.
    Moreover, it selects a subset of nodes as the source nodes that further decreases
    in-network traffic. Thus, LERC regulates \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\), and \\(n_{BN}\\).
    The objective function of the proposed work can be formulated as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\forall {s_i\\in S} \\hspace{.1in}Minimize \\sum _{i=1}^{|S|} E_i \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) Subject to constraints: $$\\begin{aligned} Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge R_0.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (8) $$\\begin{aligned} D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN) \\le
    T. \\end{aligned}$$ (9) where, the constraints in Eqs. (8) and (9) are explained
    as follows: 1. Minimum reliability constraint \\(Re(MZ(RN\\subseteq BN) )\\ge
    R_0\\) The constraint depicts that number of RNs must not be reduced beyond \\(R_0\\),
    where, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs to achieve correct event region
    map at BS. In this work, we define reliability (Re) with respect to MZ map construction.
    It is the number of BNs sending data to Linear for MZ map construction. If all
    BNs transmit data to Linear, Re is 100% and the map constructed is correct and
    can be treated as the reference. However, in-network traffic and energy consumption
    in this case is high. Let us define a set of BNs as \\(BN=\\{BN_1, BN_2...., BN_{n_{BN}}\\}\\).
    To reduce in-network traffic, a subset of BN defined as \\(RN= \\{RN_1, RN_2....,
    RN_{n_{RN}}\\}\\) is chosen as source nodes such that \\(RN \\subseteq BN\\) and
    \\(n_{RN}\\le n_{BN}\\). As the number of selected RNs decreases, the constructed
    map can deviate from the correct (reference). After one point, the deviation in
    map hampers the decision making and implementation of actions (explained by Figs.
    14 and 15 in Section 4.2). The number of RNs at this point is defined as the minimum
    reliability \\(R_0\\). Thus, \\(R_0\\) is the minimum number of RNs required to
    demarcate the boundary of MZs at Linear such that the decision and implementation
    remains same to the reference. A generalized approach to calculate \\(R_0\\) is
    not mentioned in the proposed work since it is topology and event region dependent.
    Minimum number of BNs to construct an event region (MZ) at BS is \\(R_0\\) and
    its value ranges from 1 to \\(n_{BN}\\). So, an event region may be represented
    by 1 BN or may be represented by all BNs laying in that event region. As the soil
    parameters change, shape of event region (MZ) changes and so the BNs representing
    the MZ. Thus, proposing a method to calculate the exact number of \\(R_0\\) is
    out of scope of this study. However, an empirical study is shown with the help
    of Figs. 14 and 15. 2. Delay constraint \\(D((RN_{i}^{MZ}\\in RN)\\subseteq BN)
    \\le T\\) T is the stop time of Linear at a location for data acquisition. If
    delay of a packet is greater than T, it will be discarded by Linear. Thus, D is
    the maximum end to end delay of data transmission of a RN that is selected as
    data transmitter to construct MZ map at Linear. Fig. 5 Flow chart of the proposed
    method Full size image Thus, the work intends to minimize energy consumption of
    sensor nodes. The energy consumption of a node depends on \\(E_t\\), \\(E_r\\),
    and \\(n_{BN}\\) (as represented by Eq. (6)). These variables are in turn depend
    on the number of transmissions of control packets in disseminating the location
    information of Linear and data packets in sending information from source nodes.
    To minimize the number of messages during location information dissemination of
    Linear a Reduced Overhead Broadcast mechanism (explained in Section 3.2) is proposed
    where nodes receive control packets from all predecessors and transmit only one
    message. To reduce number of data packets, number of source nodes are minimized
    by selecting a sub-set of BNs namely, RNs, where the number of RNs must be sufficient
    to construct boundary of event region at Linear. RN selection mechanism minimizes
    \\(n_{BN}\\). It is an angle-based greedy approach where each BN marks itself
    as RN or non-RN depending on the angle formed with previous RN (explained in Section
    3.3). Since, RNs are identified in a distributed fashion, stop time (T) of Linear
    must be adequate to collect data from all RNs to ensure the correct construction
    of event region boundary at Linear. A data collection dependent stop time is modelled
    and explained in Section 3.4. Section 3.5 discusses the RN selection when one-hop
    neighbors belong to multiple MZs and data collection by multiple Linears. A flow
    chart of the mechanism is shown in Fig. 5. 3.2 Reduced overhead broadcasting In
    S &C state, at a stop location, Linear sends two control signals. First control
    signal is broadcasted with a transmission range R that is greater than the transmission
    range of sensor nodes (r). This control signal is sent to wake up the nodes from
    sleep state. R depends on the Region of Action (ROA) of Linear that in turn depends
    on the length of field (L) and number of sinks deployed. For example, in Fig.
    4, \\(R=L/4\\), to cover the ROA of Linears. However, for single sink in the same
    region R will be L/2. Fig. 6 Structure of start message Full size image Next,
    a control message start is transmitted with a transmission range of r. start is
    sent for path construction from BNs to Linear. It contains the coordinates of
    Linear (coordinate), hop, residual energy (energy), and sleep time = present time
    + stop time (time) of nodes as shown in Fig 6. Nodes receiving start from neighbors,
    will increment value of hop by one and store its remaining energy in residual
    energy field. Every node will broadcast only one start message to its neighbors
    to reduce network traffic. To ensure reduced overhead broadcast, once a node receives
    first start message (at time \\(t_{start}\\)), it will wait for time \\(t_w\\)
    (Please refer Eq. (15) in Section 3.4), to collect start messages from other neighbors.
    Among all of its neighbors, a node will select one having smallest hop as next
    hop node, for upstream data transmission. If two nodes with same hop are there,
    then a node with largest energy is selected. If multiple nodes with same energy
    and hop are there, randomly a node will be selected as next hop. After next hop
    selection, each node will broadcast its start message to neighbors. Any start
    message received after this broadcast will be discarded. For example, please refer
    Fig. 7 that represents a small portion of a larger network. It consists of a Linear
    (diamond shaped) near node 41 and 42 and BNs (laying on the boundary of network
    and MZ). Let us suppose all nodes shown in the figure are in receive state and
    waiting for start message. Linear broadcasts start message that is received by
    the one-hop neighbors of Linear, nodes 41, 42, 40, 39, 38, 37, 33, and 32. Since
    these nodes are one-hop neighbors of Linear (hop = 0), they update hop and energy
    of the start message and broadcasts it. After this broadcast, these nodes start
    contending for data transmission (explained in the second last paragraph of right
    column on page 12) and discard the start message received from their one-hop neighbors.
    Fig. 7 An example scenario for start message dissemination and RN selection Full
    size image Next, we take example of node 27 to elaborate the reduced overhead
    broadcast scheme. It will wait for \\(t_w\\) time (depends on the maximum transmission
    time of all neighbors), after it receives first start message. After \\(t_w\\)
    time expires, it has start messages from nodes 33(hop = 2), 34(hop = 3), and 26(hop
    = 2). It does not receive start from nodes 35 and 30, since these nodes will broadcast
    start after \\(t_w\\) for node 27 is expired. It selects node 33 or node 26 depending
    on the energy as its next hop since hop is least for them. Node 27 then broadcasts
    start message. Figure 8 depicts various states of Linear and activities associated
    with it. S &C state comprises of three states namely, transmit, wait, and receive.
    In transmit state, Linear sends two signals, wake and start. It then switches
    to wait state, where it waits for a time T (calculation is shown Section 3.4).
    If data packets are received from sensor nodes, it switches to receive state and
    start preparing the Prescription Map (PM) that is set of control actions such
    as rate, location, on/off state for sprinklers, etc. When timer T expires Linear
    switches to M &I state and irrigate the field according to the PM generated. When
    the next stop location is reached, calculation of which was done in S &C state,
    Linear switches to next S &C state and repeats the above mentioned activities.

    Node (RN) selection Key idea of RN selection scheme is to select a BN as RN if
    it lies on a large gradient (\\(\\theta\\)) with respect to previous RN. Large
    \\(\\theta\\) depicts a significant change in the shape of event region. Each
    BN marks itself as RN or non-RN. One hop neighbors of Linear (nodes 41, 42, etc.)
    and corner nodes, for example nodes 36 and 37 in Fig. 7 (for corner node identification
    please refer Outward Nodes in the algorithm proposed in [7]), are RNs by default.
    One hop neighbors of Linear are RNs as only one hop transmission is required for
    these nodes. Corner nodes are RNs as these nodes are key enablers to achieve minimum
    reliability (shown by Fig. 15 and discussed in the last paragraph of left column
    on page 18). These nodes broadcast a control message \\(RN_c\\) to inform others
    that they are default RNs. Other nodes, when receive this message, first calculate
    Euclidean distance from Linear. If the calculated distance is in between \\(R-r\\)
    and \\(R+r\\), the BN marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message. If the
    calculated distance is less than \\(R-r\\), BNs calculate angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with its neighbor RN. \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1})\\)
    if \\(y_2-y_1 < x_2-x_1\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is \\({{\\,\\mathrm{tan\\,inverse}\\,}}(\\frac{x_2-x_1}{y_2-y_1})\\),
    otherwise. (\\(x_2, y_2\\)) is the coordinate of neighbor RN and (\\(x_1,y_1\\))
    is the coordinate of the node calculating \\(\\theta\\). If \\(\\theta\\) is less
    than \\(\\theta _0\\) (an application dependent threshold discussed in the next
    paragraph), it marks itself as non-RN and as RN otherwise. A non-RN node sends
    \\(RN_c\\) message containing coordinate of RN with which it has calculated the
    angle \\(\\theta\\). The BN receiving this message calculates the angle \\(\\theta\\)
    with the coordinate received in the message. A BN receiving multiple \\(RN_c\\)
    messages will decide according to the lowest \\(\\theta\\). Exact \\(\\theta _0\\)
    can be calculated in a distributed fashion by local talk of sensor nodes where
    nodes between two corner nodes can decide among themselves the value of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) for that setting. However, when boundary pattern changes significantly re-tuning
    \\(\\theta _0\\) is required. Exact mechanism for fixing \\(\\theta _0\\) is a
    work in progress. For the sake of simplicity, in this work, we assume that the
    boundary does not change significantly to change \\(\\theta _0\\). However, a
    safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) is provided by recording the effect of \\(\\theta
    _0\\) on energy consumption and reconstruction of coarse boundary by simulating
    various networks (explained in Section 4.2.1). We elaborate RN selection by an
    example scenario, shown in Fig. 7. The one hop neighbors of Linear (node 41, 42,
    37, 38, 39) excluding the non-BNs (32 and 40) mark themselves as RN and send \\(RN_c\\)
    message to their neighbor node. Moreover, the corner nodes (36 and 37) also mark
    themselves as RN by default. Among neighbors of node 42, only node 33 calculates
    the angle \\(\\theta\\) since others are either non-BNs or RNs. Suppose \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\) for this case. \\(\\theta\\) for node 33 is \\(32^\\circ\\)
    and hence, node 33 marks itself as RN and sends \\(RN_c\\) message to its neighbors.
    Angle \\(\\theta\\) for nodes 34, 26, 27, 29 are \\(4^\\circ\\), \\(12^\\circ\\),
    \\(17^\\circ\\), and \\(38^\\circ\\) respectively. Node 29 marks itself as RN.
    However, when node 29 receives message of node 27 and calculates angle with node
    27 (it is an RN because distance from Linear is \\(R-r\\)) that is \\(6.7^\\circ\\),
    it marks itself as non-RN. Nodes 34 and 35 will mark themselves as non-RN with
    respect to node 33. Node 30 will mark itself as RN with respect to node 36. All
    default RNs (one hop neighbors of Linear and corner nodes) start contending for
    channel access through Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
    (CSMA/CA) [48] scheme as soon as they receive start message. Other nodes contend
    after marking themselves as RNs or non-RNs. If a RN has residual energy less than
    a threshold, it informs its neighbors about the situation and go to sleep. Its
    neighbors transmit data and its position information to next hop neighbors. Figure
    9 shows various states of sensor nodes and actions associated with it. Each sensor
    node can be in one of the four states namely, sleep, receive, wait, and transmit.
    Sensor nodes switch from sleep state to receive state when they receive wake signal
    from Linear and go to sleep state when timer T expires. When start message is
    received, a node (BN or non-BN) broadcasts it by changing hop and residual energy.
    A BN first decides whether it is a RN or not. If it is RN, it follows CSMA/CA
    mechanism. Various activities associated with it is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 State
    space representation of a sensor node Full size image 3.4 Stop time modelling
    and next stop location calculation for the Linear Stop time of Linear at a location
    depends on the data collection delay from all RNs. This delay in turn is the sum
    of propagation time of start message to the farthest RN (within range R) and data
    transmission time from this RN to Linear. The stop time (T) can be calculated
    as: $$\\begin{aligned} T = h_{max}*(delay_{d,max} + delay_{u,max}). \\end{aligned}$$
    (10) where, \\(h_{max}\\) is the maximum number of hops between Linear and the
    farthest RN, \\(delay_{d,max}\\) and \\(delay_{u,max}\\) is the one hop delay
    of downstream and upstream traffic respectively. \\(h_{max}\\) is calculated from
    the probability density function (pdf) of distance covered in one hop proposed
    in [49]. The pdf depends on the number of neighbors of a node that can forward
    data towards Linear, transmission range of nodes (r), and the maximum transmission
    range of Linear (R). The maximum one hop delay in transmitting start message to
    the farthest RN is the sum of the waiting time (\\(t_w\\)) a node waits for its
    neighbors to send start message and the time required for that node to successfully
    broadcast it. $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{d,max} = t_w + t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (11) where, \\(n_R\\) is the average number of retransmissions and \\(t_{tx}\\)
    is the total time required for transmission of a packet that depends on the back
    off time (\\(t_{BO}\\)), Clear Channel Access (CCA) time (\\(t_{CCA}\\)), transmission
    time of a packet (\\(t_{txn}\\)), and transmission of an acknowledgement (\\(t_{Ack}\\)).
    $$\\begin{aligned} t_{tx}=t_{BO} + t_{CCA} + t_{txn} +t_{Ack}. \\end{aligned}$$
    (12) The upper bound of \\(t_{BO} + t_{CCA}\\) is reached when a node extracts
    highest back off timer at each back off stage, and at each back off stage it finds
    the channel busy. The value is 120*\\(t_b\\), where \\(t_b\\) is the duration
    of one time slot [48]. The average number of retransmissions \\(n_R\\) is modelled
    using Geometric distribution, that is the probability of number of failures before
    first successful transmission [50]. $$\\begin{aligned} n_R= (1-p)/p. \\end{aligned}$$
    (13) where, p is the probability of successful transmission given by: $$\\begin{aligned}
    p=\\frac{1}{n_c}. \\end{aligned}$$ (14) where, \\(n_c\\) is the number of nodes
    contending for channel access. For the worse case analysis, number of nodes contending
    is taken as number of nodes of the network (n) as stated in [48]. Based on the
    above discussion, \\(t_w\\) of a node can be calculated as the time required for
    receiving start message from all neighbors. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} t_w = k*(t_{tx}+
    n_R*t_{tx}). \\end{aligned}$$ (15) where, k is the average degree of the network.
    Similarly, \\(delay_{u,max}\\) can be written as: $$\\begin{aligned} delay_{u,max}=
    t_{tx} + n_R*t_{tx}. \\end{aligned}$$ (16) Next stop location of Linear The data
    packets received in S &C state contain the coordinates of source RNs. The farthest
    RN in the direction of move of Linear will be its next stop location. However,
    there may be a situation where no data packet is received from the farthest RN.
    Such situation may arise due to two reasons: first, there are no BNs (in receive
    state) in the direction of move of Linear and second, data packet from BN may
    be lost due to various reasons (congestion, link quality, etc.). In this case,
    Linear stops at a location that is R meters away from present stop location. Although
    the probability of packet loss is low due to re-transmission, however, loss of
    packet of corner nodes for \\(Re \\ge R_0\\) and of RNs for \\(Re=R_0\\), can
    effect the decision of Linear. 3.5 Critical cases In this subsection, we discuss
    some critical situations that may occur during data acquisition. These situations
    are discussed separately for ease of understanding. 3.5.1 How will a BN mark itself
    as RN if BNs of two MZs are in receive state Fig. 10 BNs laying in different MZs
    Full size image The example discussed for RN selection in previous subsection
    assumed that BNs of one MZ are in receive state. However, in some cases BNs of
    two adjacent MZs may be in receive state as shown in Fig. 10. Nodes 6, 17, 20,
    29, 26, 27, and 30 are the BNs of one subregion. Nodes 7, 19, and 18 are the BNs
    of second subregion and nodes 8, 9, and 21 are the BNs of third subregion. We
    propose a rule based scheme for marking a BN as RN, when BNs of two MZs are in
    receive state. When all neighbors of a BN are BNs of another MZ: The BN will mark
    itself as RN, since it is the only BN of its MZ, among its neighbors. For example,
    refer Fig. 10, where BNs of three subregions are shown, as mentioned above. Node
    8 is a BN of third subregion, and all other neighbors are the BNs of second subregion,
    Hence, node 8 marks itself as RN. When only one neighbor of a BN is in its MZ
    and others are in different MZs: The BN will mark itself as RN, since it is the
    node laying on the corner of its MZ. For example please refer nodes 7, 19, 9,
    and 21 in Fig. 10. For nodes 7 and 19, node 18 is the only neighbor BN in their
    subregion. Similarly, node 9 and node 21 are the only BN neighbors of each other
    laying in same subregion. Thus, these nodes mark themselves as RNs. When more
    than one neighbors of a BN are its MZ and others are in different MZs: The BN
    will measure angle \\(\\theta\\) with RN of its MZ, and declare itself as RN if
    \\(\\theta > \\theta _0\\) (as explained in Section 3.3). For example, refer nodes
    27, 26, 29, 20, and 17 of the first subregion and node 18 of second subregion
    in Fig. 10. These nodes will calculate \\(\\theta\\) from neighboring RN and will
    decide accordingly. 3.5.2 How will data collection be accomplished by multiple
    Linears We have discussed data harvesting by single Linear, so far. However, for
    a large area multiple Linears can be utilized for data collection. Figure 4 shows
    data acquisition by two Linears, where each Linear has a fixed area in which it
    can collect data, named as its ROA. It is equal to \\(\\frac{L}{S}\\), where,
    L is length of the field perpendicular to the direction of move of Linear and
    S is number of sinks. The area is divided into three subregions namely, A, B,
    and C. RN selection, next stop location, and stop time calculation remain same
    for multiple Linears to that of single Linear. However, the maximum range (R)
    with which Linear transmits control signal to wake the nodes, changes for multiple
    Linears. R should be selected in such a way, so that it covers the nodes laying
    in the ROA of the Linear horizontally. Thus, \\(R=\\frac{L}{2S}\\) for proper
    functioning of the proposed protocol. However, the BNs laying near to the dividing
    boundary of ROAs of both sinks (nodes 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 4) may receive signals
    from both Linears. These nodes can send data to any of the Linear, and Linears
    can exchange data before the generation of control actions. The range R decreases
    with increase in number of sinks and so does the area from which data is to be
    collected for current S &C state. However, number of sinks must be bounded by
    a value where R becomes 2r. Since increasing number of sinks beyond this point
    will result in a collecting region as small as the sensing range of a sensor node
    that in turn leads to one hop data collection by Linear. Number of collecting
    regions are \\(\\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil\\) for one sink where W is the length
    of the area along the direction of move of Linear. Lemma 1 Total energy consumption
    of the network decreases by \\(\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}\\) for S Linears.
    Proof Let us assume that energy consumption of the network with \\(N_b\\) sources
    (BNs) and one sink is \\(E_T\\), where, $$\\begin{aligned} E_T= N_{b}h_{avg}E_b.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (17) where, \\(E_b\\) is the average energy consumed in one hop
    transmission and is calculated taking the various factors (backoff and retransmissions)
    into account, as discussed in Section 3.4 and \\(h_{avg}\\) is average number
    of hops between source and destination. As number of sinks increases by 1, ROA
    and R of a sink shrink by a fraction of 2. Number of collecting regions are \\(\\lceil
    \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S\\), from which data is to be collected for S sinks. Energy
    consumption for S sinks is: $$\\begin{aligned} E_{T}^{''}= \\lceil \\frac{W}{R}
    \\rceil SE_S. \\end{aligned}$$ (18) where, \\(E_S\\) is energy consumption for
    one collecting region and is given by: $$\\begin{aligned} E_S= N_b^{''}h_{avg}^{''}E_b=\\frac{N_b}{
    \\lceil \\frac{W}{R} \\rceil S}h_{avg}^{''}E_b. \\end{aligned}$$ (19) where, \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is the average number of hops when distance between source and destination in
    one collecting region with reduced range R. Thus, $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{E_{T}}{E_{T}^{''}}=\\frac{h_{avg}}{h_{avg}^{''}}.
    \\end{aligned}$$ (20) Validation of the proposed lemma is done through numerical
    analysis and network simulation. For numerical analysis, \\(h_{avg}\\) and \\(h_{avg}^{''}\\)
    is calculated by the pdf given in [49] and \\(E_b\\) is calculated as the sum
    of energy dissipated in different states namely, idle, transmit, and receive.
    In idle state, average number of backoffs is calculated by the equation proposed
    in [48]. Energy in transmit and receive states are calculated taking average number
    of retransmissions (discussed in Section 3.4) and packet size into account. Values
    are calculated and simulated for two networks of 42 nodes (low average degree
    \\(\\approx\\) 6) and 150 nodes (high average degree \\(\\approx\\) 20) deployed
    in an area of \\(900\\times 500\\) \\(m^2\\). For network simulation, average
    of 100 runs is considered as the values saturate after this point. The result
    shown in Fig. 11 depicts that numerical analysis matches with the simulation.
    Number of sinks is varied from 1–2 for this network since, range of sink R reduces
    to 125m that is less than 2r (160m). 4 Results and discussion Fig. 11 Validation
    of Lemma 1 through numerical analysis and simulation Full size image Table 3 Simulation
    setup Full size table The section discusses the performance of the three modules
    of LERC. Simulation is performed on the discrete event simulator NS3.30.1 and
    various simulation parameters are mentioned in Table 3. Experiments are performed
    on a data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes deployed in a \\(900\\times 500 m^2\\)
    area. The range of sensor nodes is set as 80m as this is the minimum range for
    connected graph. The data set [51] consists of soil moisture values and position
    information at 42 locations in a farm. The proposed work identifies source nodes
    (RNs) among BNs that in turn depend on position information of sensor nodes. Moreover,
    the proposed work intends to reduce energy consumption in data collection from
    RNs. Thus, the data set is apt to add a realistic flavor for simulating the impact
    of the proposed work. First, energy consumption in reduced overhead broadcast
    is discussed in comparison to cluster trail [26] and MARP [28]. Since, reduced
    overhead broadcast does not depend on the data values of sensor nodes, different
    networks are created keeping transmission range constant. Number of nodes are
    increased randomly to vary average degree of the network by 2. Average degree
    is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. In Section 4.2, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear and event region map construction at Linear
    for different value of \\(\\theta _0\\) is discussed. RN selection depends on
    BN identification (proposed in [7]) that in turn is data dependent. Scarcity of
    available agriculture data set restricts the evaluation of RN selection, stop
    time modelling and total energy consumption to one data set [51]. However, robustness
    of RN selection is shown in different topology by varying \\(\\theta _0\\). RN
    selection is scheme is compared with the recent state-of-the-art methods in terms
    of event region map construction in Section 4.2.2 for \\(\\theta _0=0^\\circ\\).
    Stop time modelling is evaluated by comparing the end to end delay in transmitting
    data from RNs to Linear with the modelled stop time of Linear. End to end delay
    is recorded for different values of \\(\\theta _0\\). Total energy consumption
    of the proposed scheme compared with CH based data transmission, cluster trail,
    and MARP is presented in Section 4.4. Total energy consumption of data collection
    is the sum of energy consumed in BN detection, RN selection and transmission from
    identified RNs to Linear. BN detection mechanism [7] is our previous work and
    is evaluated in same simulation environment and data set. Thus, reduced overhead
    broadcast, RN selection, and stop time modeling are evaluated by simulation in
    this work and total energy consumption includes simulation results from our previous
    work in same simulation environment. 4.1 Analysis of reduced overhead broadcast
    Energy consumption in dissemination of start message for the proposed reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme, cluster trail scheme, and flooding is shown in Fig.
    12. The proposed mechanism is tested for different networks, keeping transmission
    range constant. Number of nodes are increased to vary average degree of the network
    by 2. Average degree is varied from 6–20, varying nodes from 42–150. The proposed
    reduced overhead broadcast scheme consumes 33.3%\\(-\\)61.1% and 19.5%\\(-\\)46.6%
    less energy than the flooding scheme [28] and cluster trail [26] respectively.
    A node receives k number of messages and transmits only one message as opposed
    to multiple message transmissions in others. Fig. 12 Energy consumption in start
    message dissemination Full size image 4.2 Analysis of data transmission from BNs
    to Linear and construction of MZ map at Linear In this subsection, variation in
    number of RNs and corresponding energy consumption of the network, with respect
    to the tuning of angle \\(\\theta _0\\) is presented. As \\(\\theta _0\\) increases,
    number of RNs (source) decreases and so is the energy consumption (as shown in
    Fig. 13). The values written in brackets are the number of RNs for corresponding
    \\(\\theta _0\\). \\(\\theta _0\\) is varied from 0\\(^\\circ\\) to 45\\(^\\circ\\)
    (maximum \\(\\theta\\) is 45\\(^\\circ\\) from the formula given in Section 3.3),
    with an interval of 1. However, only those values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in the figure for which there is a change from previous value. When \\(\\theta
    _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\), all BNs act as data transmitters to Linear. A BN does
    not mark itself as a RN if its \\(\\theta\\) (angle of the gradient of line joining
    it to its previous RN) is less than \\(\\theta _0\\). Thus, number of RNs keeps
    on decreasing with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\),
    number of RNs and energy consumption are minimum. For this value, only the BNs
    that are one hop neighbors of Linear and the corner nodes act as RNs. However,
    this value is not the optimum one to achieve reliability (Re), since it depends
    on the MZ construction at Linear. Fig. 13 Variation of energy consumption in data
    transmission from RNs to Linear with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Fig. 14 MZ map at Linear for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 0 Full size image Fig. 15 Variation
    in the construction of MZ at Linear with varying \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image
    Linear constructs MZs, depending on the data and position information received
    from RNs. Constructed MZs at Linear for some values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is shown
    in Figs. 14 and 15. When \\(\\theta _0\\) is 0\\(^\\circ\\) (refer Fig. 14), all
    BNs send data to Linear and MZ is constructed with 100% reliability. As \\(\\theta
    _0\\) increases, number of RNs decreases gradually and MZ at Linear changes. For
    example, when \\(\\theta _0\\) is 5\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 34
    do not mark themselves as RNs. However, exclusion of these nodes have insignificant
    impact on construction of MZ at Linear (it can be clearly seen in Fig. 15a). Similarly,
    for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 15\\(^\\circ\\) nodes 15, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31 are excluded
    (Fig. 15b) and for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 20\\(^\\circ\\), nodes 17 and 20 are removed
    from RN set having a negligible variation in MZ map at Linear (Fig. 15c). When
    node 30 marks itself as non-RN node for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) (Fig.
    15d), distortion in MZ map is seen with respect to the original MZ for \\(\\theta
    _0\\) = 0\\(^\\circ\\). For \\(\\theta _0\\) = 40\\(^\\circ\\) only corner nodes
    and one hop neighbors are marked as RNs. (refer Fig. 15e). Thus, it can be inferred
    from the above discussion that as value of \\(\\theta _0\\) increases, number
    of data transmitter BNs and overall energy consumption decreases. However, after
    a certain value of \\(\\theta _0\\), data collected from RNs become insufficient
    to construct a correct MZ map at Linear. For the topology under consideration
    \\(\\theta _0\\) should be less than or equal to 20\\(^\\circ\\) for a reliable
    construction of MZ map at Linear. Moreover, Fig. 15f shows the constructed MZ
    map for \\(\\theta _0\\) = 35\\(^\\circ\\) without corner nodes 4 and 12. The
    map shows that corner nodes are key enablers for MZ map construction and hence,
    must be selected as RNs. 4.2.1 Safe range of \\(\\theta _0\\) To test the variation
    of MZ map with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) further, networks are deployed by varying
    number of nodes from 50–150 with an increase of 1 in average degree in the area
    900\\(\\times\\)500 \\(m^2\\). Change in boundary and BNs was insignificant for
    the networks of more than 150 nodes. RNs are identified by varying \\(\\theta
    _0\\) from \\(0^\\circ -45^\\circ\\) and effect on the boundary is observed. As
    \\(\\theta _0\\) increases number of RNs decreases and so is the energy consumption
    of the network. However, the reconstructed boundary of MZs deforLinear with decrease
    in number of RNs. \\(\\theta _0\\) after which no significant change in energy
    consumption is recorded for various networks is shown in Fig. 16. The results
    show that the minimum value among all recorded values of \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(20^\\circ\\).
    Maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) to retain the shape of coarse boundary is shown in Fig.
    16. For correct reconstruction of boundary, maximum \\(\\theta _0\\) is \\(30^\\circ\\).
    Thus, \\(\\theta _0\\) must be tuned between \\(20^\\circ\\) and \\(30^\\circ\\).
    \\(\\theta _0\\) selected in this range reduces energy consumption while maintaining
    the correctness of coarse boundary of reconstructed MZ map. Limitation Exact tuning
    of \\(\\theta _0\\) is a limitation of the proposed work as mentioned in Section
    3.3. Fig. 16 Optimal values of \\(\\theta _0\\) for energy consumption and correct
    MZ map reconstruction Full size image 4.2.2 Comparison with RN selection schemes
    The RN selection algorithm of the proposed LERC protocol is compared with COBOM
    [19], DEMOCO [21], and the algorithm proposed in [20]. Figures 17, 18 and 19 show
    the selected RNs among BNs and the demarcated boundary map by the algorithms.
    Both the algorithms identify lesser number of RNs than the proposed scheme, however,
    give ambiguous and incorrect results. Fig. 17 RNs and event region construction
    by COBOM [19] Full size image As shown in Fig. 17, COBOM identifies 9 RNs among
    20 BNs. If a node has different reading (depending on threshold) than its neighbors,
    it is marked as BNs. RNs are selected among BNs by suppressing the neighbors.
    A node in COBOM declares itself as RN if none of its neighbors broadcast their
    status as RN within a predefined time. RN transmits its data and its neighbors’
    IDs. Thus, every two-hop neighbors are marked as RNs. Node 27 informs the sink
    that its neighbors, nodes 18, 19, and 22 are in different subregion. On the other
    hand, node 21 informs that nodes 9, 13, and 22 are in same subregion. Nodes 17
    and 8 informs that nodes 7 and 18 are in different subregion. According to these
    reports, sink draws a boundary as shown in Fig. 17 where nodes of two different
    subregions are merged (please refer Fig. 14 for correct map). COBOM is designed
    for continuous object boundary monitoring, where only two subregions exist: one
    in which object is present and second in which object is not present. Fig. 18
    RNs and event region construction by DEMOCO [21] Full size image Fig. 19 RNs and
    event region construction by the scheme proposed in [20] Full size image DEMOCO
    reduces number of BNs and hence, number of RNs to minimize number of source nodes.
    It enhances COBOM by selecting only \"IN\" nodes as BNs leaving \"OUT\" nodes.
    Thus, it selects BNs that lay on one side of the boundary. BNs, RNs, and the event
    region boundary constructed at BS by DEMOCO is shown in Fig. 18. It reduces number
    of RNs to 5, however the event region boundary formed at BS is Incorrect. The
    BNs belonging to four event regions are entirely suppressed since, DEMOCO selects
    nodes laying one side of the boundary as BNs. Thus, neighbors of BNs laying in
    different event regions are not selected as BNs and RNs. DEMOCO reduces number
    of RNs to a great extent, however, this in turn leads to suppression of information
    from different event regions. The algorithm proposed in [20], identifies a node
    as BN if its data value is different from at least one neighbor and distance from
    this neighbor is least among the distances from all of its neighbors. Every two
    hop neighbor among BNs is selected as RN. In this course, the algorithm reduces
    RNs by 72% as compared to LERC. However, such suppression leads to information
    loss and the constructed event region map is faulty as shown in Fig. 19. 4.3 Stop
    time for the Linear In this subsection, the modelled stop time is evaluated by
    varying the application dependent threshold \\(\\theta _0\\) as shown in Fig.
    20. Calculated stop time is 30seconds for network of 42 nodes and simulated End
    to End (E2E) delay for \\(\\theta _0\\) = \\(0^\\circ\\) is 23.5seconds. The E2E
    delay decreases slightly with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\), as number of RNs decreases
    with increase in \\(\\theta _0\\) (explained in previous subsection). Decrease
    in number of source nodes in turn decreases in-network traffic and retransmissions.
    Hence, E2E delay decreases. However, for \\(\\theta _0>40^\\circ\\) E2E delay
    saturates at 23.05seconds as decrease in number of RNs seizes beyond this point
    (shown in previous subsection). The modelled stop time for two sinks is lesser
    than that of one sink because of the number of hops between Linear and farthest
    RN. E2E delay for two sinks is less than the modelled stop time and decreases
    slightly with increasing \\(\\theta _0\\). Hence, it can be concluded that modelled
    stop time of Linear is adequate to collect data from all RNs. Fig. 20 Variation
    in end to end delay with respect to \\(\\theta _0\\) Full size image 4.4 Overall
    analysis of the system The proposed scheme is compared with a clustering based
    data collection by mobile BS moving on fixed trajectory [41], to prove the efficacy
    (in terms of energy consumption) of data transmission from BNs to Linear over
    the data transmission from CHs to mobile BS. Next, the proposed scheme is compared
    with MARP that is a recent sensor actuator coordination protocol. Further, the
    proposed scheme is compared with two recent agent based routing protocols. Energy
    efficient Geographic Routing Protocol based on mobile sink (EGRPM) [23] is mobile
    BS based data collection protocol, whereas, Energy Efficient Layered Routing Protocol
    (EELRP) [52] is a static BS based layered routing protocol. In addition, the proposed
    scheme is compared with cluster trail [26] that is a communication protocol implementing
    limited broadcast for mobile BS location information dissemination. Experiments
    are performed on the data set [51] consisting of 42 nodes. Total energy consumption
    is the energy consumed in transmitting start message from Linear to nodes and
    data transmission from RNs to Linear. To test reduced overhead broadcast scheme
    we varied number of nodes since BNs are not required for it. However, energy consumption
    in data transmission from RNs to Linear for varying number of nodes requires selection
    of BNs in each setting. Scarcity of available agriculture data set restricts the
    performance evaluation to this data set [51]. However, variation in number of
    nodes can be done by extrapolation technique. Fig. 21 Comparison of total energy
    consumption with recent protocols Full size image The proposed scheme performs
    better in terms of energy consumption as shown in Fig. 21. For network of 42 sensors,
    there is 12 %, 19%, 24%, 34%, 56% decrease in energy consumption with respect
    to EGRPM, CH based scheme, cluster trail, MARP, and EELRP, respectively. Total
    energy consumption of the proposed scheme is the sum of energy dissipation in
    BN selection (algorithm proposed in [9]), start message dissemination, and data
    transmission from selected RNs to Linear. For CH based data transmission, there
    are two phases namely, initial and collection. Initial phase involves control
    message flooding from mobile BS to the sensor nodes, hop count transmission from
    each node to BS, and maximum and minimum hop count flooding from BS to sensor
    nodes. Flooding of several control messages incur high energy consumption, however,
    it is a one time process. In collection phase, CHs are elected by several control
    message transmission, sensor nodes are attached to CHs as Cluster Members (CMs),
    and CHs choose another CH as next hop for forwarding of data transmission. At
    the end, data is transmitted from CMs to respective CHs and is forwarded to BS
    via another CHs. In the proposed scheme, BN selection algorithm consumes approximately
    529 mJ in which identification of BNs laying on network boundary (one time process)
    consumes 400 mJ (for details please refer [7]). The initial phase of [41] consumes
    less energy (=350 mJ) than the proposed scheme despite of more number of message
    exchanges. The reason behind this decrease is the size of packets. In BN identification,
    data packets are transmitted in addition to the control packet transmission whereas,
    in [41], only control packets are flooded. However, in collection phase the CH
    election, cluster formation, and data transmission consumes more energy than reduced
    overhead broadcast and data transmission from selected RNs. EELRP [52] divides
    the network into sectors centered at the BS that sits in the middle of it. Each
    node transmits three control packets to select agent of their sector and sends
    data to the agent via multi-hop. Agents of the sectors aggregates and forwards
    the data to BS via multi-hop. The proposed scheme performs better than EELRP since
    selecting agent involves multiple messages and moreover, multi-hop data transmission
    between sensor nodes to agent and agent to BS causes high energy consumption.
    Table 4 Key findings of the research Full size table EGRPM [23] divides the network
    into similar grids where the size of grid is decided based on the length and width
    of the network. Each cell nodes flood control messages to identify agent of the
    cell. Mobile BS traverses through the network and stops at four locations on the
    periphery of the network. Each cell node sends data to the agent of cell via one-hop
    or multi-hop. The agent then transmits data to mobile BS via one-hop or multi-hop.
    LERC performs better than EGRPM in terms of energy consumption as in EGRPM selection
    of agent is an energy consuming process due to flooding of control messages. Moreover,
    all nodes are source nodes and forwards data towards agent via multi-hop. Moreover,
    agent forwards data to mobile BS via multi-hop. Average path length is 5 for EGRPM.
    LERC achieves less energy consumption by reducing number of source nodes and minimizing
    location information messages of mobile BS. Energy consumption of cluster trail
    is more than the proposed scheme as mobile BS location information broadcast consumes
    much energy as shown in previous subsection. Data transmissions from sensor nodes
    consume slightly more energy due to the movement of sink. In some cases, BS moves
    before data is received by it. In such cases, nodes follow the trail generated
    and ends up into many multihop transmissions. The proposed scheme consumes less
    energy than MARP [28], because of two reasons. First, the reduced overhead broadcast
    scheme and second is the selective sources. In MARP, actuator floods its control
    message to establish a path from each source to it. Flooding causes high energy
    consumption as already shown in previous subsection. Moreover, all nodes transmit
    sensed data to the actuator during its pause time that consumes more energy than
    the data transmission from a few RNs in the proposed scheme. A summary of the
    key findings in this research is presented in Table 4. 4.5 Interpretability and
    explainability of performance gain over existing methods The performance gain
    of the proposed mechanism is twofold: Correct map construction and Low energy
    consumption. Correct map construction is achieved by transmitting data from RNs.
    The existing mechanisms for RN selection mechanism are developed for selecting
    appropriate nodes among BNs. However, these methods do not include the communication
    cost from RNs to BS. Therefore, to evaluate the communication cost of the proposed
    mechanism, it is compared with existing communication protocols. Thus, the proposed
    scheme is compared with two class of state-of-art mechanisms: RN selection mechanisms
    and communication protocols. Correct map construction is achieved by the proposed
    mechanism even if nodes of more than two event regions lie nearby. The existing
    methods fail to reconstruct the boundaries at BS in such a scenario (As described
    in Introduction section and shown in the results (Figs. 17 and 19). However, in
    case of two event regions sharing a single boundary, existing methods perform
    better than the proposed mechanism as less number of RNs are selected by existing
    mechanisms. As RNs are the sources for data transmission, less number of RNs result
    into reduced energy consumption. There are two components contributing for low
    energy consumption in data transmission for local map construction than the existing
    methods. First component is the reduced overhead in Linear location information
    dissemination. Each node waits for its neighbour to transmit the control packet
    having Linear location information and sends only one message. Second component
    is the reduced number of sources. However, for a particular boundary, decrease
    in number of RNs beyond a point reduces the energy consumption but hampers the
    correctness of map constructed at Linear. Selection of this point is the limitation
    of our work as mentioned in above subsection. The cost of correct local map construction
    with low energy consumption at Linear is increased delay. Linear waits for a certain
    period of time modelled as the Stop Time before decision making and actuation.
    This time includes the waiting time of nodes for location information dissemination
    of Linear and the data transmission time from the farthest RNs to Linear. The
    waiting time for Linear location information dissemination ensures reduced energy
    consumption and data transmission time guarantees the correctness of constructed
    map. However, the application under consideration can tolerate the increased delay.
    5 Conclusion The paper develops a distributed lightweight scheme for event region
    map construction at Linear. It identifies minimal set BNs as source nodes and
    models stop time of Linear to collect information from these nodes. A reduced
    overhead broadcast scheme is proposed for location information dissemination where
    each node transmits only one message. This scheme addresses the challenge of reducing
    message overhead in location information dissemination. Stop time is modelled
    as the sum of control message transmission to the farthest BN, and data packet
    transmission from it to Linear. The challenge of modelling adequate stop time
    for data collection is addressed in this module. Next, to reduce network traffic,
    a minimal set BNs are selected as data transmitters (RN) to Linear. The RNs are
    selected such as the data transmitted by them must construct a correct map at
    Linear. Moreover, data collection in multiple Linear scenario is investigated.
    Simulation results demonstrated a significant decrease in energy consumption with
    respect to the state-of-art mechanisms. Data availability Not applicable. References

  description: 'In monsoon-dependent South Asia, harvesting and managing water is
    a necessity. Thus, monuments and modified landscapes related to irrigation, water
    storing and water worship represent a large share of Indian architectural heritage.
    Yet, this rich corpus and its attached hydrological knowledge awaits full recognition:
    thus far, documentation and studies focus on the most visible elements, especially
    stepwells, tanks and other dug facilities. Hydro-structures are generally considered
    in an isolated manner and lack contextualisation. Following the observations of
    English chaplain Edward Terry (1590–1660), this paper aims to explore the relationship
    between the medieval Indian city and the presence of monumental, often religiously
    connoted, hydraulic constructions. Based on archaeological and historical data,
    the paper proposes a fresh look at the hydraulic elements in the larger context
    of the city. The main argument rehabilitates the artificial lake and underlines
    its crucial function in plain regions that depend on a sufficient refilling of
    aquifers. In Western India, the typical city of the Solanki and later the Vaghela
    and the Muzaffarid dynasties had access to a broad variety of water sources capable
    of meeting the needs of multiple religious and secular activities (hydro-diversity).
    This generous waterscape and its multifaceted developments reflect on functions
    of sociability and religiosity in the city. Water here appears as an essential
    identity marker of urbanity.'

  description: Measurement of soil water content is complicated due to the soil heterogeneity
    and environmental variability. No single efficient method has been developed to
    map the different soil moisture zones at great depth at the field scale without
    disturbing the soil structure and paths of the waterflow. Partially or completely
    non-destructive measurement of soil moisture is provided by ground-penetrating
    radar (GPR), which offers high resolution and significant penetration depth for
    medium-scale soil moisture measurements, bridging the methodological gap between
    small-scale point-based and large-scale remote sensing techniques. In addition,
    this technique can be used with better time efficiency compared to other destructive
    or non-destructive procedures. GPR has been used for soil water content estimation
    including measuring soil water content profile, identifying specific soil water
    depths or soil water variation under irrigation conditions. Despite the high potential
    of GPR for hydrological investigations, it is important to realize that no single
    geophysical method is able to perform optimally under all conditions. For example,
    GPR is mostly restricted to areas with relatively low electrical conductivity
    (low attenuation of the electromagnetic wave). In addition, some of the GPR interpretation
    methods require the presence of well identifiable and continuous GPR reflections,
    which requires sufficient and spatially continuous subsurface contrast in dielectric
    permittivity. Soil moisture (considering its flow) is a key variable in the fields
    of agriculture. It is the essential requirement for plants to grow. Consequently,
    soil moisture is important for irrigation management particularly in semiarid
    and arid regions. In this paper, the literature of the principles of GPR measurements
    and utilization possibilities is summarized with the emphasis on the agricultural
    sector. GPR can be a beneficial measuring device that can help in mapping soil
    moisture distribution, taking into account infiltration, but also water loss caused
    by evaporation and plant water absorption. Consequently, it can be used in agriculture,
    due to its precision at high central frequency values, even (fine)root characteristics
    of the plants, essentially the xylem-water relationship can also be determined
    (xylem transports water and water-soluble minerals and supply water used during
    photosynthesis). In addition, GPR can provide valuable information regarding natural
    stratification and soil compaction. The data interpretation of GPR measurements,
    in addition to soil compaction causing a decrease in the moisture of soils (as
    three-phase systems), can in principle be extended to other aspects of agrotechnology,
    such as soil contamination studying. However, it has not been sufficiently explored,
    as no recent literature can be found on this subject. Soil radar can be a useful
    part of "Smart farming", which can help in the selection of soil moisture measuring
    sensors placed in the soil as part of it. Especially when associated with the
    recently released new simultaneous multi-offset and multi-channel (SiMoc) GPR
    system, which enables fast soil profile mapping with seven receivers, but at the
    speed of a traditional single-channel GPR. If complete non-destruction is the
    goal, air-coupled GPRs mounted on a drone can provide an opportunity. It should
    be noted, however, that due to the significant signal attenuation (wave scattering)
    occurring at the soil-air interface, only a small penetration depth can be achieved.

    ARTICLES Abstract A talajnedvesség-tartalom variabilitásának mérését jelentősen
    megnehezíti a talaj heterogenitása és a környezeti változatosság. Jelenleg még
    nem fejlesztettek ki olyan univerzális módszert, amely a magas vagy alacsony talajnedvesség-zónák
    szántóföldi léptékű feltérképezésére alkalmas úgy, hogy a talajnak és a talajnedvesség
    áramlásának teljes zavarásmentességét nagy mélységben is biztosítja. A talajnedvesség-mérés
    részben (talajkapcsolt), vagy teljesen roncsolásmentes (levegőkapcsolt) lehetőségét
    biztosítja a földradar (GPR), amely nagy felbontást és jelentős behatolási mélységet
    biztosít a közepes léptékű talajnedvesség meghatározáshoz, így hiánypótló technikát
    jelent a kisléptékű pontszerű és a nagyléptékű távérzékelt mérési technikák közötti
    metodikai hiány kitöltésére. Emellett jobb időhatékonyággal alkalmazható más roncsolásos
    és roncsolásmentes eljárásokkal összevetve. A talajradart sikeresen alkalmazták
    a talajnedvesség-meghatározásra, de hidrológiai vizsgálatokban történő alkalmazásának
    nagy potenciálja ellenére nem minden körülmény között működik optimálisan. Felhasználhatósága
    többnyire olyan területekre korlátozódik, ahol viszonylag alacsony az elektromos
    vezetőképesség (az elektromágneses hullám gyenge csillapodására való tekintettel).
    Ezen túlmenően egyes talajradar módszerek működésének alapfeltétele a jól azonosítható
    és folyamatos jelvisszaverődés, továbbá a dielektromos állandó tekintetében a
    földradar-rendszerek térben folyamatos felszín alatti kontrasztot igényelnek.
    A talajnedvesség és annak áramlása kulcsparaméter a mezőgazdaság különböző területein.
    A talajnedvesség (és a talajvíz) látja el a növényeket, ami elengedhetetlen feltétele
    a növények fejlődésének. Ennélfogva a talaj nedvességtartalmának, eloszlásának,
    áramlásának, valamint a beszivárgás sajátosságainak alapos és lokális ismerete
    az öntözés hatékony megvalósításának alapköve, különösen a félszáraz és száraz
    éghajlatú területeken. A talajradar mérési alapjaival, valamint hasznosítási lehetőségeivel
    összefüggésben az elsősorban nemzetközi szakirodalmat összegezve megállapítható,
    hogy a GPR előnyös mérőeszköz lehet, amely segíthet a talaj nedvességeloszlásának
    feltérképezésében, tekintettel a beszivárgásra, a párolgás és a növényi vízfelvétel
    okozta vízveszteségre is. Következésképpen mezőgazdasági felhasználhatósága lehetséges.
    A talajradar hasznos része lehet a „Smart farming”-nak (intelligens gazdálkodás),
    segítséget nyújthat a talajban elhelyezett talajnedvesség-mérő szenzorok kijelölésében.
    Különösen, ha a közelmúltban megjelent új, szimultán többeltolásos és többcsatornás
    (SiMoc) GPR rendszerre asszociálunk, amely gyors talajprofil-feltérképezést tesz
    lehetővé a hét vevőegységével, de a hagyományos egycsatornás GPR sebességével.
    Ha a teljes roncsolásmentesség a cél, úgy a drónra szerelt levegőkapcsolt GPR-ek
    nyújthatnak lehetőséget. Megjegyzendő azonban, hogy a talaj-levegő határfelületen
    jelentkező szignifikáns jelcsillapodás (hullámszóródás) következtében a feltárási
    mélység jelentősen csökken. A földradar végső soron mérési alapul szolgálhat a
    hatékony (precíziós) öntözési gazdálkodás kialakításához, és a megfelelő vízfelhasználási
    hatékonyságot biztosítva járulhat hozzá a precíziós mezőgazdasági programok megvalósításához.
    Bevezetés Korunk egyik legégetőbb globális kérdése az élelmiszertermelés szempontjából,
    hogy meddig tudjuk élelemmel ellátni az egyre növekvő népességet egyre kevesebb
    (és gyakran gyengébb minőségű) rendelkezésre álló termőterületről (FAO, 2020).
    A kulcs a növényi erőforrás-felhasználás hatékonyságának folyamatos fejlődése
    (MORISON et al., 2008), és a termőtalajok minőségének javítása (LIU et al., 2015).
    A Föld vízkészletének csak 0,0012%-át képezi a földfelszín közeli talajnedvesség
    (VANDER & CASEY, 2010), azonban a hidrológiai folyamatok egyik kulcsparamétere,
    amely befolyásolja a vízcserét és az energiaáramlást a földfelszín/légkör határfelületen
    (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014). Szántóföldi körülmények között a talajnedvesség a növények
    fejlődésében kulcsparaméter, a termény minőségét leginkább meghatározó faktorok
    egyike (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). Legnagyobb kihívást a száraz és félszáraz régiók
    jelentik, ahol a felszín alatti vízforrásokat, különösen a víztartó rétegeket
    használják öntözésre, mivel a csapadék csak egy részét fedezi a termőnövények
    párologtatási veszteségének (NEUPANE & WENXUAN, 2019). A talajban tárolt nedvesség
    mennyisége a talaj szemcseméret-eloszlásától, szerkezetétől, porozitásától, tömörödöttségének
    fokától, a termőrétegének vastagságától, ásványi összetételétől, sótartalmától,
    szennyezettségétől, szervesanyag tartalmától, illetve a légkör hőmérsékletétől
    és a páratartalmától is függ (MUNOTH et al., 2016). A talajnedvesség-tartalom
    jelen cikk esetében a térfogati talajvíztartalmat jelenti, ami az adott talajban
    lévő víz térfogatának, a teljes talajtérfogathoz viszonyított aránya egy egységre
    vonatkoztatva (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A talajnedvesség és annak tér- és időbeli
    változása több tudományterület, így az ökológia, mezőgazdaság, hidrológia és mérnöki
    tudományok (pl.: talajok, talajfelszín alatti rétegek kutatásai) kulcsparamétere,
    ezért meghatározza a csapadéknak a beszivárgásra, felszíni lefolyásra jutó részét,
    ezáltal az erózió, vízfolyás-vízhozam, és a talajvíz-utánpótlódás arányait (KLOTZSCHE
    et al., 2018). A talajnedvességtartalom-meghatározási eljárásoknál (áttekintés
    a következő fejezetben) jelenleg is hiányosság van a nagyléptékű, azaz pontszerű
    (<0,01 m2), és a kis/közepes léptékű, vagyis távérzékelt (>100 m2) mérési lehetőségek
    között. A két véglet közötti (0,01–100 m2) hiány áthidalását jelentheti a szántóföldi
    léptékű alkalmazást biztosító földradar (vagy talajradar – ground penetrating
    radar; GPR) (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014; TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A GPR mérések sikeres mezőgazdasági
    alkalmazásának két fő követelménye a felszín alatti első méterig való behatolás
    képessége és a centiméteres felbontás (LOMBARDI et al., 2022). Jelen cikk célja
    a talajnedvesség-tartalom földradarral történő mérési, valamint mezőgazdasági
    alkalmazhatósági lehetőségeinek bemutatása, összefoglalva a legfontosabb, elsősorban
    nemzetközi szakirodalmat. Talajnedvesség-meghatározási módszerek A talajnedvesség
    meghatározásának legelterjedtebb, hagyományos, leginkább kutatott, ugyanakkor
    nagyszámú minta esetén munkaigényes, direkt eljárású lehetősége a magfúrásokra
    alkalmazott termogravimetrikus eljárás (hőelemzési technika, ahol a vizsgált mintát
    standard 105 °C-on tömegállandóságig szárítják, és az így mért abszolút száraz
    tömegre vonatkoztatják a tömeg%-os nedvességtartalmat). A módszerrel a talaj térfogattömegének
    (vagy térfogatsűrűségének) mérése alapján konvertálhatók a kapott tömegarányos,
    (vagy tömeg%-os) nedvességtartalom eredmények térfogatarányos, (vagy térfogat%-os)
    értékekké (STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012; TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A kevesebb roncsolással
    járó, indirekt módszerek közé sorolhatók a nukleáris eljárások, mint a gamma sugárgyengítéses
    módszerek, vagy a finomabb kalibrációt biztosító neutronszonda (KLOTZSCHE et al.,
    2018), valamint az elektromágneses szenzorok. Ezen utóbbi csoportba tartoznak
    a dielektromos és kapacitás alapú technikák: a legismertebbek közül például a
    magasfrekvenciás impedancia mérést lehetővé tevő kapacitás szonda, az időtartománybeli
    reflexiómérés (Time Domain Reflectometry; TDR), és a frekvencia-tartománybeli
    reflexiómérés (Frequency Domain Reflectometry; FDR). Az elektromágneses szenzorok
    közé tartoznak továbbá az elektromos ellenállás és elektromos vezetőképesség alapú
    technikák (1. ábra). Az alkalmazott technikák közül érdemes még megemlíteni a
    hőimpulzusszenzorokat, tenziométereket és a gipszblokkok-nylonelemek elektromos
    vezetőképességének mérését is (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). VIEW FULL SIZE 1. ábra Talajnedvesség-meghatározási

    tesz lehetővé a távérzékelési eszközök alkalmazása, ahol a műszerek nem érintkeznek
    a talajjal. Továbbá a nagyobb területi lefedettségre vonatkozó méréseket is lehetővé
    teszik (100 m2 – 100 km2) (ROBINSON et al., 2008). A talajnedvesség távérzékelés
    alapú meghatározása elsősorban mikrohullámú szenzorokkal történik. Mivel mind
    a passzív, mind az aktív mikrohullámok érzékenyek a víz dielektromos állandójára,
    ami befolyásolja azok emissziós képességét és visszaverődését, lehetővé téve ezzel
    a felszíni talajnedvesség mérését. Az aktív érzékelő mikrohullámú impulzust bocsájt
    ki és fogad, míg a passzív érzékelő a természetes hőkibocsájtást rögzíti a föld
    felszínéről. A spektrumtartomány alapján optikai (VIS – VISible – látható fény;
    NIR – Near Infrared közeli hullámhosszú infravörös), termális (LWIR – Long WaveLength
    Infrared – hosszú hullámhosszú infravörös), valamint mikrohullám típus (passzív
    és aktív) különíthető el. A spektroszkópiai módszer elve az elektromágneses sugárzási
    energia és az anyag közötti kölcsönhatáson alapul. A talaj fizikai és kémiai jellemzőinek
    – például vízmolekuláknak – jelenléte miatt az elektromágneses sugárzás az egyes
    molekuláris kötések rezgését idézi elő. A rezgések révén a fény elnyelődik egy
    frekvenciához kötött, meghatározott energiakvantummal, lehetővé téve a talaj tulajdonságainak
    elemzését (PRADIPTA et al., 2022a; SHUKLA & GARG, 2014). Az aktív mikrohullámú
    érzékelők nagyobb térbeli feloldóképességgel bírnak, mint a passzív mikrohullámúak,
    ezért felhasználásuk egy farm gazdaság szintjén célszerű (amelyek átlagos területe
    1,8 km2 az USA-ban). A passzív mikrohullámú szenzorok a helyi vagy regionális
    szintű mezőgazdasági döntéshozatalban hasznosak (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). A növénytakaró
    és a talaj jellemzői jelentősen befolyásolhatják a talajnedvesség-meghatározás
    pontosságát, úgy, hogy a szenzor érzékenysége a növényzet sűrűségének növekedésével
    csökken. Általában ez a probléma minimálisra csökkenthető hosszabb hullámhossz
    használatával. A műhold alapú távérzékelés fő korlátja, hogy nem képes megragadni
    a talajnedvesség dinamikáját a mélyebb talajzónában (gyökérzóna talajnedvesség),
    ami a gyökérvízfelvétel és a talaj hidraulikus paraméterei szempontjából lényeges
    információ (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). Az optikai és termikus szenzorok kombinációja
    (optikai-termikus), az úgynevezett hőmérséklet-növényzet háromszög megközelítés.
    Alapelve, hogy a talajnedvesség szorosan összefügg a földfelszín hőmérsékletével
    és a vegetációs indexszel (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). A felszíni talajnedvesség
    mérés konkrét, távérzékelési alapú termékei, mikrohullám szenzor esetén a SMAP_SM
    (Soil Moisture Active Passive) (9 km-es térbeli felbontás); az AMSR2 SM (Advanced
    Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) (25 km-es térbeli felbontás). A MODIS_LST (MODerate
    resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer_Land Surface Temperature), mint termikus
    (1 km-es térbeli felbontással) és a MODIS_ Surface Reflectance, mint optikai (250
    m-es térbeli felbontás), továbbá a Sentinel-1 és -2 Landsat-8 OLI & TIRS (ahol
    a Sentinel-1: 15 m, míg a Sentinel-2: 10–60 m térbeli felbontásúak), az előbbi
    esetén mikrohullám, optikai és termális, utóbbi esetén pedig optikai és termális
    szenzorokról beszélhetünk. A gyökérzóna talajnedvesség-feltérképezésének, távérzékelés
    alapú termékei mikrohullám-optikai szenzor esetén a SMAP SM, SMOS SSM (Soil Moisture
    and Ocean Salinity Surface Soil Moisture) (35 km-es térbeli felbontás), SMOS_RZSM
    (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Root Zone Soil Moisture), MODIS LST, MODIS Surface
    Reflectance (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). Itt jegyezzük meg, hogy a terepi módszerek
    mindig pontosabbak, mint a távérzékelés alapú, közvetett adatgyűjtési eljárások.
    Kiemelendők a geofizikai módszerek, amelyek kifejezetten érzékenyek a talaj elektromos
    tulajdonságainak változásaira, a dielektromos permittivitásra vagyis „áteresztőképességre”
    és/vagy az elektromos vezetőképességre. Fő előnyük, hogy minimális roncsolással
    vagy teljesen roncsolásmentesen kivitelezhetők, és jelentős területet (1–80 km2)
    képesek lefedni. A mezőgazdasági alkalmazás tekintetében, a geofizikai módszereken
    belül az elektromos ellenállás (ERT), az elektromágneses indukció (EMI), illetve
    a jelen cikk tárgyát képező földradar (GPR) a legszélesebb körben alkalmazott
    technikák. A GPR esetén az elektromágneses hullámoknak – rádióspektrum, mikrohullám
    tartomány – a talajba történő kibocsájtása, majd detektálása történik (TOSTI &
    SLOB, 2015). A precíziós gazdálkodás területén legelterjedtebben a GPR-t alkalmazzák,
    mivel a módszer érzékeny a vizsgált közeg (talaj) permittivitási és vezetőképességi
    tulajdonságaira is (LOMBARDI et al., 2022). GPR alkalmazhatósága talajnedvesség-tartalom
    mérésére A földradar egy részben, vagy teljesen roncsolásmentes eljárás, amely
    nagy horizontális és vertikális felbontást tesz lehetővé. Alacsony veszteségű
    anyagok, például a homok maximális elérhető függőleges felbontása nagyfrekvenciás
    (900 MHz-es) antennával 2–8 cm (NEAL, 2004). Másik előnye, hogy jelentős, akár
    50 méteres behatolási mélység is elérhető vele (XINBO et al., 2019). A GPR-t számos
    tudományterületen sikeresen alkalmazzák, így például a régészetben és a kultúrmérnöki
    tudományokban felszín alatti objektumok, például védőgátak állapotának feltérképezésére
    (SHEISHAH et al., 2022), vagy útpályaszerkezetelemzéshez (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015;
    PRIMUSZ & TÓTH, 2021). Ez utóbbi kapcsán HERCEG (2022) mutatja be az útpályaszerkezetek
    földműveinek vizsgálatára alkalmazható GPR alapú talajnedvesség-tartalom meghatározásának
    szakirodalmát. A talajvizsgálatok során, a GPR leggyakoribb alkalmazása a talajnedvesség
    meghatározása, a nedvességtartalom elektromágneses jelterjedést befolyásoló tulajdonsága
    miatt (ZAJÍCOVÁ & CHUMAN, 2019; PATHIRANA et al., 2023). A GPR nagyfrekvenciás
    (többnyire 10–1200 MHz-es) elektromágneses hullámokat használ a vizsgálandó közegben
    lévő célobjektumok detektálására (DANIELS, 2004). A GPR adó egysége elektromágneses
    hullámimpulzusokat bocsájt a vizsgálandó közegbe, a vevő egysége a visszavert
    jeleket fogadja, amit bisztatikus kialakításnak neveznek. A földradar elsődlegesen
    időt mér, az úgynevezett kétirányú futás idejét (HUISMAN et al., 2003). Ezt bővebben
    a GPR alapú talajnedvességmérési módszerek c. fejezet tárgyalja. A földradar kifejezetten
    érzékeny a talajtextúrára, és a talaj elektromos vezetőképességére (HUISMAN et
    al., 2003), ezért felhasználhatósága többnyire olyan területekre korlátozódik,
    ahol viszonylag alacsony a talaj elektromos vezetőképessége, gyenge az elektromágneses
    hullám csillapodása (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). A földradar két főparamétere a felbontás,
    és a behatolási mélység. Felbontása, annak központi frekvenciájával együtt nő
    (XINBO et al., 2019). A GPR mérések esetén a sávszélesség értéke alapvetően 10
    és 1200 MHz közé esik. A feltárható mélység a vizsgálandó talaj elektromos konduktivitásának,
    és a GPR központi frekvenciájának függvénye. Alacsony vezetőképességű közeg (száraz
    homok, kavics) esetén az alacsony frekvenciás GPR rendszerek (pl. 50 vagy 100
    Mhz-es) néhány 10 méteres, de akár 50 méteres behatolási mélységet is képesek
    elérni (DOOLITTLE et al., 2007). A magas frekvenciás típusok (pl.: 450 vagy 900
    MHz) pár méteres behatolási mélységet valósíthatnak meg. A GPR azonban nem megfelelő
    eszköz szikes talajokon, ahol a behatolási mélység jellemzően 25 cm-nél kisebb.
    Kőzetlisztes homok vagy agyag esetén is jelentősen csökken a behatolási mélység.
    A nedves agyagokban kifejezetten kedvezőtlenek a lehetőségek a talajnedvesség-tartalom
    meghatározására, mert ezeknél a behatolási mélység jellemzően kevesebb, mint 1
    m (DOOLITTLE et al., 2007). SCHROTT és SASS (2008) rámutat, hogy a meredek és
    sziklás terepfelszín a GPR antennák nagy méretei miatt gyakorlatilag lehetetlenné
    teszi azok alkalmazását. Emellett az erdőállományok földradar alapú vizsgálata
    is korlátozott, hiszen a fák gyökérzete, mint visszaverődést okozó felületek,
    hibás mérési adatokat generálnak. Míg a fák gyökérzetének talajradarral történő
    feltérképezéséről az elmúlt 20 évben számos tanulmány született, addig a mezőgazdasági
    termőnövények gyökérzetének vizsgálatával csak korlátozott számú közlemény foglalkozott
    (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014). A DOOLITTLE és munkatársai (2007) által bemutatott talajalkalmassági
    térképek információt adnak azokról a talajtulajdonságokról, amelyek befolyásolják
    a földradar alkalmazhatóságát. Ezeket a térképeket az Egyesült Államokban fejlesztették
    ki a talaj elektromos vezetőképességének adatai alapján, amelyet a talaj agyagtartalma,
    nátrium-abszorpciós aránya és kalcium-karbonát-tartalma befolyásol (LIU et al.,
    2016). Hazai kutatásként ki kell emeljük NÁDASI és munkatársai (2020) munkásságát,
    akik Magyarország földradar-alkalmazhatósági térképét készítették el. Öt osztályt
    különítettek el úgy, hogy az első jelenti a legalkalmasabbat, míg az ötödik jelenti
    a legkevésbé alkalmasat. Az alkalmassági osztályok meghatározásánál a radarhullámok
    terjedését gátló tényezők, mint jelző faktorok, jelentették az alapot, ami elsősorban
    a víz felszínközeli jelenléte (vagy hiánya), az agyagtartalom, az oldott ionok
    potenciális mennyisége, a szikesedés és a kémhatás. A NÁDASI et al. (2020) által
    közölt alkalmassági térkép rámutat, hogy Magyarországon a GPR mérésekre kimondottan,
    illetve közepesen alkalmas területek aránya a teljes területhez viszonyítva megközelítőleg
    15–15%. Körülbelül 50%-ra tehető a kevésbé alkalmas, míg 20%-ra az alkalmatlan
    területek aránya. Jó területeknek számítanak a Duna-Tisza köze, valamint a Nyírség
    homok szövetű talajai. A GPR mérési elve A dielektromos állandó (valós része)
    (𝜀𝑟) egy anyag vákuumhoz viszonyított elektromos térerősség-tárolási kapacitását
    adja meg. Értéke a háromfázisú polidiszperz rendszerben széles skálán mozoghat,
    így a cseppfolyós halmazállapotú (szabad, vagy másnéven gravitációs) víz értéke
    a hőmérséklet függvényében 78–88 közötti (a magasabb hőmérséklet a polarizáció
    erősödésével csökkenti a permittivitást), a talajlevegő értéke kb. 1, míg a szilárd
    fázisok kb. 3–10 közöttiek (CASSIDY, 2009; HUISMAN et al., 2003; STEELMAN & ENDRES,
    2012). A három talajalkotó fázis közti szignifikáns különbség főként a vízmolekulák
    jelentős polarizálhatóságának köszönhető (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A higroszkópos
    (adszorpciós) víz esetében a permittivitás 4 alá is csökkenhet (SAARENKETO, 1998),
    a kapilláris víz permittivitása pedig a szabad víz és a higroszkópos értékei között
    található. Ezt a hatást a nagy fajlagos felülettel rendelkező részecskék (agyag
    vagy humusz) okozzák, melyeknek nagyobb a vízmolekulákat megkötő potenciáljuk;
    ezért a vízmolekulák nem képesek válaszreakcióba lépni az elektromágneses mezővel,
    és így csökken a talaj dielektromos permittivitása (LAUER et al., 2010). A talajra
    jellemző jelentős dielektromos állandó különbség teszi lehetővé a GPR-ek mérőeszközként
    való használatát a talajnedvesség-tartalom meghatározásában (XINBO et al., 2019).
    A telítetlen talajok dielektromos permittivitása elsősorban a talaj víztartalmától
    függ, azonban más tényezők, mint a litológia, a hőmérséklet, az ionkoncentráció
    és a pórusfolyadék összetétele szintén befolyásolják azt (LOMBARDI & MAURIZIO,
    2019). Itt jegyezzük meg, hogy a talaj dielektromos permittivitása a talaj szervesanyagtartalmának
    emelkedésével csökken, ami a talaj, adott térfogategységnyi súlyának csökkenéséből
    következik. A száraz biomassza dielektromos permittivitása 1-hez közeli értékű,
    ami a lebomlással növekszik (ZAJÍCOVÁ & CHUMAN, 2019). GPR alapú talajnedvesség-mérési
    módszerek Számos, a nedvességérzékelést megcélzó GPR-alapú módszert fejlesztettek
    ki különböző alkalmazási területekre és anyagokra, így a természetes (módon kialakuló)
    talajokra is (LAMBOT & ANDRÉ, 2014). Az elmúlt évtizedekben a földradar egy lehetséges,
    nagy hatékonysággal alkalmazható műszere volt a telítetlen zónák hidrológiai feltárásának,
    a vízkészlet kutatásoknak (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015), a talajrétegek azonosításának
    (DAVIS & ANNAN, 1989), a felszín alatti hidraulikai paraméterek feltérképezésének
    (HUBBARD, et al. 1997), a talajvízszint lokalizálásának (NAKASHIMA et al., 2001),
    és természetesen a jelen cikk tárgyát képező talajnedvesség-tartalom mérésnek
    is (HUISMAN et al., 2003; KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). A GPR-alapú talajnedvesség-mérési
    módszerek területén, a közelmúltban elért kutatási eredményeket XINBO és munkatársai
    (2019) mutatják be az alapelvek, előnyök, korlátok, valamint alkalmazási lehetőségek
    tekintetében. A szerzők hét elterjedt mérési technikát demonstrálnak, név szerint
    a visszavert hullám, a talajhullám, a felszíni visszaverődés, a fúrólyuk GPR technika,
    teljes hullámforma inverzió, átlagos burkológörbe amplitúdó és frekvencia eltolás.
    Hardver tekintetében talajkapcsolt GPR-t és levegőkapcsolt földradar antenna kialakítást
    különíthetünk el. Előbbi esetén az eszköz a talajjal közvetlenül érintkezik, ezért
    ez a megvalósítás csak a felszín alatt roncsolásmentes. Az adatminőséget a talaj
    felületérdessége, a vegetáció, az antenna pozícionálásakor esetlegesen fellépő
    akadályok befolyásolják (HUISMAN et al., 2003). A felszínvisszaverődés módszer
    levegőkapcsolt antennával működik, ezért teljes roncsolásmentességet biztosít.
    A technika alkalmas a talajnedvesség nagy térbeli felbontással kivitelezett feltárására,
    emiatt azonban néhány cm-re szűkül a feltárási mélység, továbbá érzékennyé válik
    a felszínborítottságra, felületérdességre, (XINBO et al., 2019), ami az érdesség-modell
    integrálásával javítható (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). Az elterjedt földradar-technikák
    adatgyűjtési és adatfeldolgozási metódusát tekintve a visszavert hullám, a talajhullám
    és a fúrólyuk GPR módszerek esetén először a rendelkezésre álló radarhullámok
    átlagos sebességének meghatározása szükséges (a GPR által kibocsájtott elektromágneses
    hullám jel kétirányú futási idejéből meghatározva), amelyet a dielektromos állandó,
    majd a talajnedvesség számításához használnak. A felszín-visszaverődés módszerrel
    a reflexiós együttható (a levegő és a talaj felszíne közötti határfelületről történő
    visszaverődés amplitúdóból meghatározva) és a talaj dielektromos állandója között
    határoznak meg összefüggést; a teljes hullámforma inverzió és az átlagos burkológörbe
    amplitúdó módszerekkel viszont a radarjelekből közvetlenül is meghatározható a
    talaj dielektromos állandója. A dielektromos állandó alapú módszerek átszámítási
    képletet igényelnek (bővebben a „Petrofizikai összefüggések” fejezetben) a talaj
    dielektromos állandójának talajnedvességgé alakításához, továbbá terepi kalibrációt
    (STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012). A szokványos megközelítéstől eltér a frekvenciaeltoláson
    alapuló módszer, amely a talajnedvességet a FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation)
    révén kapja meg. A talaj, GPR alapú nedvességtartalom meghatározásának pontossága
    – a talajviszonyoktól és a talajradar antenna konfigurációjától függően – 0,0026
    cm3 cm–3 (STOFFREGEN et al., 2002) és 0,115 cm3 cm–3 (WEIHERMÜLLER et al., 2007)
    között változhat. A GPR módszerek mérési pontossága mellett a precíz, térbeli
    pozicionálása is kiemelt szerepet kap, amit a legtöbb GPR-rendszer ma már lehetővé
    tesz a GPS-rendszerekkel való plug-and-play kapcsolat segítségével. A közelmúltban
    kereskedelmi forgalomba került műholdas kommunikációs jelvétel alapú GPS rendszer
    az „European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service” (EGNOS) és a „Wide Area
    Augmentation System” (WAAS), melyekkel akár 0,04 m abszolút pozíciópontosság érhető
    el (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). Petrofizikai összefüggések A dielektromos állandón
    alapuló módszereknél a talaj dielektromos állandóját határozzák meg első körben,
    majd abból helyszíni kalibrációval, vagy empirikus módon a talajnedvességet petrofizikai
    összefüggés segítségével. A petrofizikai összefüggéseknek 3 csoportja ismeretes:
    empirikus összefüggések, térfogati keveréses formulák, effektív közeg megközelítések.
    TOPP et al. (1980), ROTH et al. (1990), NADLER et al. (1991), JACOBSEN és SCHJONNING
    (1993) rámutattak, hogy a terepi és laboratóriumi mérés alapú, kevésbé összetett
    empirikus megközelítések, a talaj szerkezeti tulajdonságairól (pl. térfogatsűrűség,
    porozitás, pórusszerkezet stb.) csak korlátozott információt igényelnek. A térfogati
    keverés formulák, a háromfázisú talaj-levegő-víz rendszer térfogati összetevőit
    és dielektromos állandóját veszik alapul a kapcsolat felállítására. Ilyen például
    a CRIM (Complex Refractive Index Model) modell (DOBSON et al., 1985; JONES & FRIEDMAN,
    2000). Az effektív közeg megközelítések figyelembe veszik egy kompozit anyag textúrális
    és szerkezeti hozzájárulását annak dielektromos állandójához (TYČ et al., 1988;
    FRIEDMAN, 1998; ENDRES & BERTRAND, 2006). Jelen cikkben a két legelterjedtebb,
    a nemzetközi szakirodalomban leggyakrabban előforduló empirikus petrofizikai összefüggést,
    vagyis a Topp és Roth egyenleteket vázoljuk (ROTH et al., 1992; TOPP et al., 1980;
    STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012). θ s o i l = − 5 , 3 * 10 − 2 + 2 , 92 * 10 − 2 ε s o
    i l − 5 , 5 * 10 − 4 ε 2 s o i l + 4 , 3 * 10 − 6 ε 3 s o i l  ( 1 a ) ahol 𝜃𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙:
    térfogati talajnedvesség, 𝜀𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙: talaj dielektromos állandója A Topp-egyenletet
    empirikus módon határozták meg a különböző fizikai talajféleségekre (különböző
    textúrával rendelkező ásványi talajokra), de elsősorban homokos talajok esetén
    alkalmazható (TOPP et al., 1980; STOFFREGEN et al., 2002). Pontossága JACOBSEN
    és SCHIJONNING (1994) validációja alapján: 0,022 m3 m–3 ROTH et al. (1992) TDR
    segítségével ásványi, szerves és mágneses tulajdonsággal rendelkező talajokra
    alkalmazható empirikus összefüggést alkotott, 0,015 m3 m–3 előrejelzési hibával:
    θ = − 7 , 28 ⋅ 10 − 2 + 4 , 48 ⋅ 10 − 2 ε r − 19 , 5 ⋅ 10 − 4 ε 2 r + 36 , 1 ⋅
    10 − 6 ε 3 r  ( 1 b ) STEELMAN és ENDRES (2012) a talajnedvesség és a dielektromos
    állandó közötti kőzetfizikai összefüggések hatékonyságát vizsgálták. A GPR terepi
    mérések homokra, homokos vályogra és iszapos vályogra irányultak. A teljes adatsort
    nézve ROTH et al. (1990) összefüggése mellett TOPP és munkatársai (1980) adták
    a legpontosabb előrejelzést a talajnedvesség-tartalomról 0,052 m3 m–3 négyzetes
    hibával (RMSE: root mean square error). DEIANA és munkatársai (2008) a beszivárgás
    hatására létrejövő lefelé irányuló vízáramlást vizsgálták kiterjedt vadózus zónákban,
    GPR segítségével. A szerzők rámutattak, hogy legtöbb tanulmány a természetes infiltrációhoz
    kapcsolódóan kis (max. 0,03 cm3 cm–3) talajnedvesség változásokat jelzett. Meg
    kell jegyezni azonban, hogy a GPR-vizsgálatokat túlnyomórészt alacsony elektromos
    vezetőképességű talajokon végezték, amelyek jellemzően alacsony vízmegtartó képességgel
    is rendelkeznek (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). GPR mérési technika számítási menete
    (visszavert hullám módszerrel) A GPR adóegysége által kibocsájtott elektromágneses
    hullámok visszaverődnek, illetve megtörnek a levegő/talajfelszín határfelületen
    és/vagy két eltérő dielektromos tulajdonságú talajrétegen, majd levegő-, talaj-,
    visszavert vagy megtört hullámként érik el a vevőegységet. HUISMAN et al. (2003)
    rámutatnak, hogy a visszavert hullám sebessége a talaj elektromos értelemben vett
    áteresztőképességétől, dielektromos állandójától függ, ha kis vezetőképességű
    és nemmágneses talajt vizsgálunk: v s o i l = c √ ε s o i l  ( 2 ) ahol, 𝑣𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙:
    a visszavert hullám talajban történő átlagos terjedési sebessége, 𝜀𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙: talaj
    dielektromos állandója, c: elektromágneses hullám vákuumban való terjedési sebessége
    (2,9979 108 m s–1) Amennyiben a mélység ismert, akkor a vevőegységbe érkező hullámok
    kétirányú futásidejéből meghatározható a vizsgált zóna (itt talaj) átlagos talajnedvesség-tartalma
    a következő egyenlettel: v s o i l = 2 d t r w  ( 3 ) ahol, 𝑡𝑟𝑤: a visszavert
    hullám kétirányú futásideje, d: vizsgált réteg mélysége Ha az adó és a vevőegység
    között jelentős a távolság, akkor a (3) egyenlet módosul (HUISMAN et al., 2003;
    TOSTI & SLOB, 2015): v s o i l = 2 √ d 2 + ( 0.5 a ) 2 t r w  ( 4 ) ahol, 𝑎: antennatávolság
    A bemutatott számítás a talajfelszín és a visszaverő felület közti réteg (talajszelvény)
    talajnedvességét reprezentálja, amin a hullám áthalad. A visszavert- és a talajhullám
    értelmezésekor idealizált esetben homogén talajnedvességeloszlást feltételezünk,
    azonban a valós terepi viszonyok nem mindig egyszerűsíthetők le ennyire. Kifejezetten
    igaz ez az olyan dinamikus hidrológiai folyamatok esetén, mint a beszivárgás,
    a kapillaritás vagy az olvadás, ahol a vékony rétegek közötti erős kontraszt és
    a permittivitás gradiense lényegesen befolyásolhatják a földradar válaszjelét
    (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). A földradar mezőgazdasági alkalmazhatósága a talaj nedvességtartalmának
    meghatározására Az éghajlatváltozás főként a globális felmelegedéssel, szárazodással
    tipizálható. (IPCC, 2022). A világszintű, ugyanakkor régiónként eltérő hőmérsékletemelkedés
    következményeként az evapotranszspiráció (ET), a csapadék és a légköri vízgőztartalom
    tér és időbeli változékonysága is fokozódik. Ez a talaj nedvességtartalmának ingadozását
    és a teljes hidrológiai ciklus felerősödését okozza. Globális szinten a 21. század
    eleje óta az evapotranszspiráció meghaladja a csapadék mennyiségét (DENG et al.,
    2020). Hazánkra, a minimum- és maximumhőmérsékletek 21. század végi emelkedése
    mellett, a csapadék szabálytalan eloszlása jellemző. Elviekben a heves csapadékesemények
    és a súlyos szárazság előfordulása egyaránt valószínű, a gyakorlatban azonban
    az 1980-as évek óta egyre gyakrabban fordul elő aszály, amely elsősorban a vegetációs
    időszakot sújtja (GÁLOS et al., 2015; MÁTYÁS et al., 2018). A fokozódó aszály
    miatt a vízgazdálkodási feladatok aránya nő. A 2021 végére országosan 112 állomással
    rendelkező Operatív Aszály- és Vízhiánykezelő Monitoringrendszer magában foglalja
    és ingyenesen elérhetővé teszi a talajnedvesség-mérő monitoringhálózat adatait,
    a védekezési fokozatok elrendeléséhez szükséges (napi) meteorológiai és talajnedvesség
    adatokat is tartalmazó kombinált aszályindexet, az ezekre épülő elemzéseket, kármentesítési
    terveket, és védekezési fokozatokat. A rendelkezésre álló adatok révén így napi
    szintű tájékoztatás kapható a vízhiány (aszály) aktuális helyzetéről és várható
    tendenciáiról (FIALA et al., 2018). A mezőgazdaság fenntarthatóságának – ahol
    a növényi erőforrás-felhasználás hatékonysága folyamatosan fejlődik – meghatározó
    tényezője a rendelkezésre álló víz mellett (MORISON et al., 2008) a termőtalaj
    minősége (LIU et al., 2015). A növények gyökérzete a vizet és a szükséges tápanyagokat
    a talajból veszi fel, aminek állapota befolyásolja a növények gyökérzetének eloszlását
    és működését (ZHANG et al., 2009; SHARMA et al., 2014; LIU et al., 2015; 2016).
    Megjegyzendő azonban, hogy egy mezőgazdasági terület esetén a talajfelszín alatti
    kölcsönhatások komplexek, így a talajnedvesség mellett, a talaj szerkezete és
    tömörödése is befolyásolhatja a gyökéreloszlást. Agrotechnológia szempontjából
    a talajdegradáció egyik formája, a talajtömörödés a mezőgazdasági talajok sajátossága.
    AKINSUNMADE et al. (2019) kutatása a talajtömörödés vizsgálatát célozta meg. A
    talajtömörödés az intenzív gazdálkodással, a nehézgépek súlya révén alakul ki.
    A tömörödés a talajban a nagy hézagok redukálódását (makroporozitás-csökkenését),
    vagy eltűnését okozhatja, így a talaj hidraulikus vezetőképessége és ezáltal a
    nedvessége és az oldottanyag-tartalma is csökken. A folyamat gátolja az öntözővíz
    beszivárgását és a tápanyagfelvételt. A lefolyást és a talajeróziót fokozza, illetve
    korlátozza a gyökér fejlődését is (LOMBARDI et al., 2022). A GPR mérések sikeres
    mezőgazdasági alkalmazásának két fő követelménye a felszín alatti első méterig
    való behatolás képessége és a centiméteres felbontás. Ezért a mezőgazdasági vizsgálatokhoz
    használt GPR berendezések többsége 200–900 MHz közötti központi frekvenciatartományra
    kiélezett, ami száraz talajok esetén 3–14 cm, nedves talajok esetében pedig 8–18
    cm vertikális felbontásnak felel meg (LOMBARDI et al., 2022). A növénytermesztés
    hozamának a talajtömörödés okozta veszteségei gyorsan kivizsgálhatók GPR segítségével.
    Ennek oka, hogy a talaj agrotechnikai tulajdonságainak változása szorosan összefügg
    a talajszerkezetben lévő víz térfogati hányadával. A talajtömörödöttség fokával
    változik a porozitás, a pórusméreteloszlás, ezáltal a víz térfogatarányos mennyisége
    is változik, ami a GPR jelet is megváltoztatja. AKINSUNMADE et al. (2019) krakkói
    mezőgazdasági parcellán végzett talajtömörödéssel kapcsolatos kutatási eredményei
    rámutattak, hogy a GPR hullámamplitúdó abszolút értéke, a traktor által tömörített
    talaj esetén körülbelül háromszor kisebb, mint a jármű futását megelőző értéke.
    A GPR mérés eredményeit, a talajtömörödés mellett a talajszennyezettség is befolyásolhatja.
    A mezőgazdasági talajokban a nehézfémek kevésbé oldódó formában felhalmozódhatnak,
    negatívan hatva a termés minőségére, hiszen a növények számára esszenciális tápanyagok
    felvételét akadályozzák. Ugyanakkor előfordulhat, hogy bizonyos körülmények (pH,
    vagy redoxipotenciál-változások) hatására ismét vízoldható formába kerülnek a
    fémek, ezért elszennyezhetik a talajvizet, és bekerülhetnek a növényi szövetbe,
    majd a terményen tartott haszonállatba, végül az emberbe. Kiemelendő a szennyvíz
    alapú öntözés, különösen, ha az ipari eredetű, ami hozzájárul egyes toxikus nehézfémek
    koncentrációnövekedéséhez (KELEPERTZIS, 2014; ULLAH et al., 2022). Ez utóbbi különösen
    a fejlődő országokban probléma, ahol a vízhiány miatt széles körben használják
    fel öntözésre a szennyvizet (ATTA et al., 2023). A hagyományos mezőgazdálkodási
    gyakorlat egységesen kezeli a termőterületet anélkül, hogy figyelembe venné a
    domborzati, talaj- és növényfejlődési feltételek valamint egyéb agronómiai tényezők
    változékonyságát. A környezet geológiai és hidrológiai viszonyainak heterogenitása
    miatt a terepről származó pontadatok gyakran leegyszerűsített képet adnak, és
    nem tükrözik a tényleges állapotot. Ez tápanyag kimosódást (túlöntözést), környezetszennyezést
    (pl. szennyező anyagok talajvízbe mosódását) és a gazdálkodó szempontjából csökkent
    jövedelmezőséget eredményezhet. A precíziós mezőgazdálkodás során a termőterületet
    kis gazdálkodási egységekre osztják fel, az optimalizált termelést megcélozva
    (ZAJC et al., 2020). A precíziós mezőgazdaság egy olyan irányítási rendszer, amely
    a termőföld és a termésnövekedés tér- és időbeli változékonyságát méri és reagál
    azokra, a résztáblák szintjén növelve a jövedelmezőséget és csökkentve a környezeti
    terhelést. A főbb technológiák közé tartoznak a földrajzi információs rendszerek
    (GIS), a távérzékelés, a globális navigációs műholdrendszer (GNSS) és a terméshozam-figyelés.
    Lehetővé válik továbbá az öntözővíz helyspecifikus kijuttatása is. A változó arányú
    öntözési technológia (VRI = variable rate irrigation) segíthet a megfelelő mennyiségű
    víz megfelelő időben történő kijuttatásában a tábla megfelelő területén, ami kb.
    10–15% vízmegtakarítást eredményez (NEUPANE & WENXUAN, 2019). A szenzoros technológia
    a talaj nedvességszintjének folyamatos nyomon követését biztosítja, vagyis döntéstámogató
    eszközként szolgálhat az öntözés ütemezéséhez, így elkerülhetővé válik a szárazságstressz
    (MUNOTH et al., 2016). A talaj nedvességtartalmának szántóföldi monitorozása a
    precíziós öntözésen alapuló gazdálkodás alapköve (VISCONTIA et al., 2014), ami
    lehetővé teszi a termésminőség optimalizálását (LOMBARDI & MAURIZIO, 2019). A
    talajnedvesség eloszlásának ismerete segíthet a növények gyökérkarakterisztikájának
    feltárásában, mivel a hajszálgyökerek megnövelik a makropórustereket, légtereket
    hozva létre a talajszerkezetben (ZHANG et al., 2009; LIU et al., 2016). A mezőgazdasági
    kutatások jelentős része foglalkozik talajnedvesség méréssel (GROTE et al., 2003;
    GALAGEDARA et al., 2005; ROBINSON et al., 2008; LU et al., 2017). A GPR lehetőséget
    ad a talaj nedvességének meghatározására, és ahogy LIU, et al. (2016) kutatása
    rámutat, hatékonyan alkalmazható (magas központi frekvencia értékeken) akár hajszálgyökér
    becslésre is hidrológiai alapú inverz modell segítségével. Lényegében a xilém-víz
    kapcsolat is meghatározható (a xilém feladata a víz és a vízoldékony ásványi anyagok
    szállítása, és a párologtatás, illetve fotoszintézis során felhasznált víz pótlása).
    A GPR talajnedvesség-tartalom becslése a talajnedvesség profiljának mérését (LAMBOT
    & ANDRÉ, 2014), a talaj nedvességtartalom tér- és időbeli változásának nyomon
    követését (PAN et al., 2012), a talajnedvesség-tartalom térbeli változásának szántóföldi
    léptékben történő feltérképezését (WEIHERMÜLLER et al., 2007), a talajművelés
    talajnedvességtartalomra gyakorolt hatásának összehasonlítását (JONARD et al.,
    2013) és a talajnedvesség változásának, öntözés alatt és után történő becslését
    (GALAGEDARA et al., 2005; LIU et al., 2016) jelenti. A növény hajszálgyökér fejlődésének
    egyik bevált hatékony meghatározási módja a makroszkopikus gyökér-tápanyagfelvétel
    modell, kiegészítve a talajnedvesség-áramlási modellel (YADAV & MATHUR, 2008).
    A gyökérnövekedés mintázatainak becslésére és a talajfizikai tulajdonságok meghatározására
    különféle optimalizálási megközelítéseket alkalmaztak a mért talajnedvességtartalom-adatok
    alapján (DONG et al., 2010). LU és LU (2022) egy roncsolásmentes, GPR jel (parabola)
    alapú rendszert alkotott a gyökérről történő visszaverődés elemzéséhez és a gyökérforma
    rekonstrukciójához. A modellt almaültetvényen tesztelték. A rekonstruált finomszemcsés
    3D-s gyökérmodell további alkalmazási lehetőségeket is lehetővé tesz: a gyökérátmérő
    és a növekedés becslését. A legtöbb talajnedvességre és annak fizikai tulajdonságaira
    irányuló meghatározási módszer pontmérés alapú, ezért a kivitelezésük időigényes,
    sőt megnehezíti az ismeretlen paraméterek megbízható meghatározását. ZAJC és munkatársai
    (2020) egy szlovéniai, hordalékos üledéken elhelyezkedő gyümölcsösben tesztelték
    a GPR módszert, és hasonlították össze az eredményeket talajprofiladatokkal. A
    GPR hasznosnak bizonyult a talajnedvesség-szondák optimális helykijelölésében.
    Alkalmazásával meghatározhatjuk a kritikus területeket, mint a magas agyagtartalmú,
    sekély felszín alatti vízvisszatartó, vagy a magas homoktartalmú gyorsabb vízelnyelésű
    területeket. Alkalmazása tehát hasznos lehet öntözés-optimalizálási felméréseknél,
    a vízfenntarthatóság és jelentősebb mezőgazdasági termelés biztosítása érdekében
    a precíziós mezőgazdaságban. A GPR-alapú talajfeltárással térbeli átlagolás is
    megvalósítható, ami ideális kiegészítője lehet a makroszkopikus gyökér-tápanyagfelvétel
    modellnek. A földradar mellett más, szintén geofizikai alapú mérőeszközök (mint
    az időtartomány-, és frekvenciatartomány alapú reflexiómérések) is használhatók
    a talajkarakterisztika átfogóbb feltérképezéséhez (LIU et al., 2016). Konkrét
    példaként a talajnedvesség meghatározásra LIU et al. (2016) az iszapos agyag esetén
    a frekvenciatartomány alapú reflexiómérést javasolja a GPR mellé kiegészítésnek.
    Maga a GPR ez esetben konkrétan a teljes-hullámforma inverzió módszer (200–800
    MHz-es központi frekvencia-tartományban), a kőzetfizikai összefüggés pedig valamely
    keverési modell. Másik példaként LIU et al. (2016) a geoelektromos képalkotó eljárás
    módszerének földradarral (600–1600 MHz) való kombinációját javasolják, frekvenciacsúcs-elemzéssel,
    homokos vályog esetén, Topp-egyenlettel. Sem LIU et al. (2016), sem a többi példában
    szereplő kutató(csoport) nem közöl további konkrét információkat az egyes kombinációk
    alkalmazásának sikerességéről. LU et al. (2017) egy Belső-Mongóliai sivatagi sztyeppén
    négy különböző felszínborítottság-típus (öntözött zöldség és lucerna, természetes
    gyep, mocsár) talajnedvességét, valamint a talajnedvesség-változásának dinamikáját
    vizsgálták különböző mélységben, földradar talaj és visszavert hullám elemzésével.
    A GPR mérés pontosságát gravimetriás módszerrel ellenőrizték. Az alkalmazott empirikus
    kőzetfizikai módszerek közül a Topp-egyenlet pontosabb, mint a Roth-egyenlet a
    GPR-adatokon alapuló talajnedvesség számításában. A GPR talajnedvesség-mérések
    összhangban voltak a gravimetriás mérési eredményekkel, hiszen az RMSE = 0,0101
    m3 m–3. Eredményeikből világosan látszik, hogy sűrű növényborítottság esetén,
    a levegőhullám, a talajhullámmal és a visszavert hullámmal is interferál a radarprofilban,
    ami a GPR mérés pontosságát csökkentheti. Emellett a csapadék is csökkenti a talajhullám-feltárás
    mélységét bizonyos körülmények között. WIJEWARDANA és GALAGEDARA (2010) kutatásának
    középpontjában talajradar alapú talajnedvesség-tartalom tér- és időbeli változásbecslése
    állt mezőgazdasági táblák esetén (Gannoruwa, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka). A GPR méréseket
    termogravimetrikus mintavételi adatokkal ellenőrizték, és a talajnedvesség-tartalom
    2D-s térképeinek kidolgozását végezték el. A GPR mérései révén meghatározott talajnedvesség-tartalom
    jól illeszkedett a mért adatokhoz (R2 = 0,754). A vadózus zóna vizsgálatokhoz
    elengedhetetlen a talaj heterogenitásának jellemzése. A talaj magminta-vételezésen
    alapuló vizsgálata azonban időigényes, és hiányzik a kellő térbeli lefedettség
    (KAUFMANN et al., 2020). PAN és munkatársai (2012) sikeresen alkalmazták a GERHARDS
    et al. (2008) által kifejlesztett, többcsatornás GPR adatok (Multi-Offset Techniques)
    módszerét, amely lehetővé teszi a talajnedvesség tér és időbeli változásának nagy
    felbontású meghatározását heterogén talajszerkezetű mezőgazdasági terület esetén.
    A módszer nyilvánvaló potenciálja ellenére a többcsatornás GPR méréseknek is vannak
    korlátai. A legjelentősebb kihívást az egyértelműen meghatározott visszaverő felületek
    folyamatos szükségessége jelenti, az antennaeltolások miatt (KLOTZSCHE et al.,
    2018). A LOMBARDI és MAURIZIO (2019) lépésfrekvenciás, folyamatos hullám GPR (Step
    Frequency Continuous Wave Ground Penetrating Radar; SFCW GPR) alkalmazási lehetőségeit
    vizsgálta. A frekvenciatartomány alapú talajradar esetén, egy fixen beállított
    frekvencia helyett, diszkrét lépésekkel változtatott frekvenciaértékekkel történik
    a célterület vizsgálata. A kutatás eredményei rámutatnak a GPR jel amplitúdójának
    a vizsgált központi frekvenciától függő szignifikáns ingadozásaira, vagyis a heterogén
    talaj elektromágneses tulajdonságai erősen frekvenciafüggőek, ami bizonyos feltárási
    minőség esetén lényeges. Ez a GPR technika a növényzet vízfelhasználás-hatékonyságának
    vizsgálatára alkalmas, ezért precíziós mezőgazdasági programok tervezésének alapjául
    szolgálhat. A hagyományos FO (fixed offset – rögzített távolság) GPR mérések a
    talajréteg változásait csak az idő függvényében érzékelik, így a (talajnedvességmeghatározáshoz
    szükséges) permittivitás pontos meghatározása kivitelezhetetlen. A sebességbecsléshez
    CMP (common middle point – közös középpont) vagy WARR (wide-angle reflection and
    refraction – szélesszögű visszaverődés és refrakció) mérésekre van szükség, amelyek
    kifejezetten időigényesek. Ezért ezekkel a mérésekkel nagyobb területeket kell
    reprezentálni, ami így a felszín alatti sebesség tekintetében alacsony térbeli
    felbontást jelent. Mindez növeli a becsült rétegvastagságban, a talaj áteresztőképességében
    és ezáltal a talajnedvességben megjelenő hibalehetőséget. A közelmúltban megjelent
    egy új, szimultán többeltolásos és többcsatornás (SiMoc) GPR rendszer, amely gyors
    talajprofilfeltérképezést tesz lehetővé a WARR segítségével (KAUFMANN et al.,
    2020). Az úgynevezett „WARR-gép” (WARR machine) egy adó és hét vevőegységet használ.
    Minden mérési pozíciót egy nagy pontosságú differenciál-GPS rögzít. Ez az új rendszer
    a többeltolásos és többcsatornás GPR adatok egyidejű mérését ugyanolyan sebességgel
    teszi lehetővé, mint egy hagyományos egycsatornás FO GPR, akár 10 000 WARR h–1
    teljesítménnyel. A GPR méréseket a németországi Selhausenben, egy mezőgazdasági
    tesztterületen végezték. A GPR mérésekkel számított talajnedvesség-értékek (Topp-egyenlet
    felhasználásával) 0,20 m mélységben jól korreláltak a kontrollként használt meteorológiai
    állomás és a TDR szondák talajnedvesség-változásával (KAUFMANN et al., 2020).
    A modern pilóta nélküli légijárművek (unmanned aerial vehicle; UAV) számos tudományterületen
    vonzó technológiát képviselnek egyszerű használatuk, alacsony karbantartási költségük
    és nagyfokú működési rugalmasságuk miatt. Az UAV-k nagyon kis területekről tudnak
    fel- és leszállni, és minden irányban mozoghatnak, vagyis szinte minden helyet
    – beleértve a nehezen megközelíthetőeket is – elérhetnek (NOVIELLO et al., 2022).
    Az UAV és GPR technológiájának kombinációjaként, innovatív képalkotási rendszer
    valósítható meg, ami a földi telepítésű akna felderítésétől (BURR et al., 2021),
    a keresés/mentésen (JENSSEN et al., 2020) át a mezőgazdaságig (KAIJUN et al.,
    2019) számos gyakorlati területen alkalmazható (NOVIELLO et al., 2022). NOVIELLO
    és munkatársai (2022) rámutatnak, hogy ezen újszerű kombinációval a mezőgazdaság
    területén még csak kevesen foglalkoztak, ezért az ebben rejlő lehetőség még nincs
    kihasználva. Kiemelendő, hogy teljes roncsolásmentességet biztosít, megkímélve
    ezzel a talajt és a növényeket. Az elért eredmények azt mutatták, hogy a talajnedvesség-térképek
    jól korrelálnak a mezőgazdasági táblák topográfiai térképeivel és a légi fotogrammetriai
    megfigyelésekkel, demonstrálva ezzel a precíziós mezőgazdasági és környezeti monitoring
    célokra használt UAV alapú GPR rendszerekben rejlő potenciált (NOVIELLO et al.,
    2022). KAIJUN et al. (2019) drónra szerelt GPR alapú mérési tapasztalatait összegzi
    a talajnedvesség-térképezéshez kapcsolódóan egy belgiumi mezőgazdasági területen,
    Saint-Denisben. A GPR rendszer egy vektorhálózatelemzőből, mint frekvenciatartomány-radarból,
    a radar vezérléséhez használt mikroszámítógépből, a távvezérléshez alkalmazott
    okoseszközből, valamint egy GPS-ből áll. A radaradatok feldolgozása teljes hullámforma
    inverzió módszerrel történik LAMBOT és ANDRÉ (2014) munkássága alapján. A központi
    frekvencia tartománya 500–700 MHz. A GPR adatokból származtatott dielektromos
    állandó értékeket a Topp-egyenlettel alakították talajnedvesség-értékekké. DEHEM
    (2020) Belgiumban, egy gemblouxi mezőgazdasági területen drónra szerelt, dipólantennával
    ellátott GPR-t használt nagy felbontású térképek készítésére, valamint a talajnedvesség-tartalom
    térbeli eloszlásának és dinamikájának tanulmányozására. Két mérési alkalommal,
    csupán két talajnedvesség-térkép készült (2020 júliusában) eltérő adatsűrűséggel
    (0,24 mérés m–2 és 2,62 mérés m–2). Köszönetnyilvánítás Jelen publikáció a 143972SNN

    ABSTRACT SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL PDF/ePub Tools Share Abstract Time-lapse monitoring
    of the resistivity changes in the salinized Bookpurnong Irrigation District of
    South Australia has been reported. Gramian constraint is imposed on the resistivity
    models of the time-domain and frequency-domain airborne (AEM) data with a 2-year
    time interval. Without a priori information, the Gramian constraint projects the
    baseline resistivity onto the time-lapsed resistivity to establish the linear
    relationship between the two time-lapsed resistivity models. Unlike in the conventional
    joint inversion of synchronous data types for which the linear correlation is
    1, the Gramian constraint drives the time-lapse process towards a target correlation
    coefficient which is less than 1. Consequently, the Gramian constrained time-lapse
    evaluation of the AEM data produces satisfactory results under different conditions
    in the subsurface processes: resistivity, structural, geometrical and dynamical
    changes. Keywords: salinization, monitoring, time-lapse Permalink: https://doi.org/10.1190/image2023-3907937.1

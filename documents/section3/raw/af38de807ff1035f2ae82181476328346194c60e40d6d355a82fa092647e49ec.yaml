    \ a transformation driven by new technologies, which seems\nvery promising as\
    \ it will enable this primary sector to move to the next level of farm productivity\n\
    and proﬁtability [1]. Precision Agriculture, which consist of applying inputs\
    \ (what is needed) when\nand where is needed, has become the third wave of the\
    \ modern agriculture revolution (the ﬁrst was\nmechanization and the second the\
    \ green revolution with its genetic modiﬁcation [2]), and nowadays,\nit is being\
    \ enhanced with an increase of farm knowledge systems due to the availability\
    \ of larger\namounts of data. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ already reported in October\n2016 that Precision Agriculture technologies increased\
    \ net returns and operating proﬁts [3]. Also,\nwhen considering the environment,\
    \ new technologies are increasingly being applied in the farms\nto maintain the\
    \ sustainability of farm production. However, the adoption of these technologies\n\
    involves uncertainty and trade-oﬀs. According to a market analysis, the factors\
    \ that would facilitate\nthe adoption of sustainable farming technologies include\
    \ better education and training of farmers,\nsharing of information, easy availability\
    \ of ﬁnancial resources, and increasing consumer demand\nfor organic food [4].\
    \ When applying these new technologies, the challenge for retrieving data from\n\
    crops is to come out with something coherent and valuable, because data themselves\
    \ are not useful,\njust numbers or images. Farms that decide to be technology-driven\
    \ in some way, show valuable\nadvantages, such us saving money and work, having\
    \ an increased production or a reduction of costs\nwith minimal eﬀort, and producing\
    \ quality food with more environmentally friendly practices [5].\nHowever, taking\
    \ these advantages to the farm will depend, not only on the willingness of producers\n\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n2 of 21\nfor adopting new technologies in their ﬁelds,\
    \ but also on each speciﬁc farm potential in terms of scale\neconomies, as proﬁt\
    \ margin increases with farm size. The USDA reported that, on average, corn\n\
    farm operating proﬁt of Precision Agriculture adopters was 163 dollars per hectare\
    \ higher than for\nnon-adopters, taking into account that the highest adoption\
    \ rates for three technologies (computer\nmapping, guidance, and variable-rate\
    \ equipment) were on farms over 1500 hectares [3]. Such margins\ncan even go up\
    \ to 272 dollars depending on the crop. A greater use of Smart Farming services\
    \ is vital\nto not only improving a farm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet\
    \ the food needs of an expanding\npopulation [6].\nThe ﬁnal purpose of this paper\
    \ is to demonstrate how making decisions with the modern\ndata-based agriculture\
    \ available today can lead to sustainable and proﬁtable actuation to nourish\n\
    people while reducing harm to the environment. In order to evaluate how modern\
    \ agriculture can help\nin a sustainable decision-making process, this article\
    \ revisits the main steps of an information-based\nagriculture and focuses on\
    \ data management systems by reviewing recent applications related to each\ncrucial\
    \ step, from data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to the execution of tasks with variable\
    \ rate equipment.\n2. Data-Driven Agriculture: Agriculture 4.0\nThis new philosophy\
    \ centered on agricultural data has been expressed with several names:\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0, Digital Farming, or Smart Farming, and was born when telematics and data\
    \ management\nwere combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture,\
    \ improving the accuracy of\noperations [7]. As a result, Agriculture 4.0 is based\
    \ on Precision Agriculture principles with producers\nusing systems that generate\
    \ data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper\n\
    strategical and operational decisions. Traditionally, farmers have gone to the\
    \ ﬁelds to check the status\nof their crops and make decisions based on their\
    \ accumulated experience. This approach is no longer\nsustainable as, among other\
    \ reasons, some ﬁelds are too large to be eﬃciently managed according to\nthe\
    \ threefold criteria that will lead the coming years: Eﬃciency, sustainability\
    \ and availability (for\npeople). Advanced management systems within the context\
    \ of Smart Farming are providing practical\nsolutions. Also, despite some farmers\
    \ have a long-time experience gathered after many years of work\nin the ﬁeld,\
    \ technology may provide a systematic tool to detect unforeseen problems hard\
    \ to notice\nby visual inspection on occasional checks. Regarding the willingness\
    \ of adopting modern tools in\nagriculture, young farmers show a more positive\
    \ attitude than elder ones, as the former can support\ntheir not-so-large experience\
    \ in the ﬁeld with new smart tools providing key information. However,\nthe average\
    \ age of farmers in the last decades has been alarmingly increasing: Around 58\
    \ years old in\nthe USA and Europe, 60 in sub-Saharan Africa, or 63 in Japan [8,9].\
    \ Fortunately, this trend is expected\nto change. Several European policies, for\
    \ example, are being set to support a generational renewal,\nfacilitating access\
    \ to initial investment, loans, business advice, and training [9]. A generational\
    \ renewal\nin a rural development context goes beyond a reduction in the average\
    \ age of farmers; it is also about\nempowering a new generation of highly qualiﬁed\
    \ young farmers to bring the full beneﬁts of technology\nin order to support sustainable\
    \ farming practices [10]. This implies that young farmers will need to\ntransform\
    \ the existing land to more modern and competitive farms with the purpose of maintaining\n\
    viable food production while improving the competitiveness of the agrifood chain,\
    \ because with\nadvanced technologies and new thinking, young people can transform\
    \ the agricultural sector [8].\n2.1. Internet of Things: Collecting Information\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) in an agricultural context refers to the use of sensors\
    \ and other devices to\nturn every element and action involved in farming into\
    \ data. It has been reported that an estimation\nof a 10% to 15% of US farmers\
    \ are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares and\n250,000\
    \ farms [11]. IoT drives Agriculture 4.0 [12]; in fact, IoT technologies is one\
    \ of the reasons why\nagriculture can generate such a big amount of valuable information,\
    \ and the agriculture sector is\nexpected to be highly inﬂuenced by the advances\
    \ in these technologies [13]. It is estimated that, with\nnew techniques, the\
    \ IoT has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 70% by 2050 [14],\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n3 of 21\nwhich is positive, because according to Myklevy\
    \ et al., the world needs to increase global food\nproduction by 60% by 2050 due\
    \ to a population growth over nine thousand million [15]. The main\nadvantages\
    \ of the use of IoT are achieving higher crop yields and less cost. For example,\
    \ studies from\nOnFarm found that for an average farm using IoT, yield rises by\
    \ 1.75% and energy costs drop 17 to\n32 dollars per hectare, while water use for\
    \ irrigation falls by 8% [12].\n2.2. Big Data: Analysis of Massive Data\nIn the\
    \ current technology-based era, the concept of big data is present in many economic\
    \ sectors,\nbut is it already available to agriculture?\nThe ever-growing amount\
    \ of data available for ﬁeld\nmanagement makes necessary the implementation of\
    \ some type of automatic process to extract\noperational information from bulk\
    \ data. However, the volume of data currently retrieved from most\ncommercial\
    \ ﬁelds is, arguably, not yet at the level considered to be classiﬁed as big data.\
    \ According to\nManyica et al. [16], big data has three dimensions: Volume, velocity,\
    \ and variety. Kunisch [17] added a\nfourth V for veracity. Finally, a ﬁfth V\
    \ was added by Chi et al. for the extra dimension valorization [18].\nOverall,\
    \ the ﬁve V (dimensions) of big data stand for:\n•\nVolume refers to datasets\
    \ whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to\ncapture,\
    \ store, manage, and analyze information. This deﬁnition includes an estimate\
    \ of how big\na dataset needs to be in order to be considered big, and it can\
    \ vary by study sector, depending on\nsoftware tools that are commonly available\
    \ and common sizes of datasets, typically starting in the\nterabyte range [16].\n\
    •\nVelocity refers to the capability to acquire, understand and interpret events\
    \ as they occur.\nIn agriculture, this would refer to applications that occur\
    \ in real time, like data being processed\nright in the ﬁeld to apply variable\
    \ rates of chemicals in equipment featuring variable rate\napplication technologies.\n\
    •\nVariety refers to the diﬀerent data formats (videos, text, voice), and the\
    \ diverse degrees of\ncomplexity. This situation is not strange in agriculture\
    \ when diﬀerent data sources are used to\nwork in complex scenarios such as images\
    \ and soil or weather probes.\n•\nVeracity refers to the quality, reliability,\
    \ and overall conﬁdence of the data.\n•\nValorization is the ability to propagate\
    \ knowledge, appreciation and innovation [18].\nIn the context of crop management,\
    \ Kunisch [17] concluded that big data is applicable only in\nsome cases in agriculture,\
    \ depending on each farm and its level of technology adoption. Nevertheless,\n\
    the Proagrica [19] report conﬁrmed that big data was being increasingly applied\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector. Kamilaris et al. [18] cited 34 works where big data\
    \ was used in agricultural applications, and\nWolfert et al. [20] published a\
    \ review on big data applications in Smart Farming. In line with this\ntrend,\
    \ the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR, Montpellier,\
    \ France)\ncreated a Platform for Big Data in Agriculture with the purpose of\
    \ using big data approaches to solve\nagricultural development problems faster,\
    \ better, and at a greater scale than before [21].\n2.3. Agriculture 5.0: Robotics\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to Help in Nourishing People\nBig engineering\
    \ challenges typically spur big solutions through disruptive technologies,\nand\
    \ Agriculture 5.0 is probably the one for the ﬁrst half of the 21st Century. The\
    \ concept Agriculture\n5.0 implies that farms are following Precision Agriculture\
    \ principles and using equipment that involves\nunmanned operations and autonomous\
    \ decision support systems. Thus, Agriculture 5.0 implies the use\nof robots and\
    \ some forms of AI [22]. By tradition, farms have needed many workers, mostly\
    \ seasonal,\nto harvest crops and keep farms productive. However, society has\
    \ moved away from being an agrarian\nsociety with large quantities of people living\
    \ in farms to people living in cities now; as a result, farms\nare facing the\
    \ challenge of a workforce shortage. One solution to help with this shortage of\
    \ workers is\nagricultural robots integrating AI features. According to a Forbes\
    \ study [23], farm robots augment\nthe human labor workforce and can harvest crops\
    \ at a higher volume and faster pace than human\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n4 of\
    \ 21\nlaborers. Although there are still many cases in which robots are not as\
    \ fast as humans, agriculture is\ncurrently developing robotic systems to work\
    \ in the ﬁeld and help producers with tedious tasks [24–27],\npushing agricultural\
    \ systems to the new concept of Agriculture 5.0. According to Reddy et al. [28],\n\
    the advent of robots in agriculture drastically increased the productivity in\
    \ several countries and\nreduced the farm operating costs. As said before, robotic\
    \ applications for agriculture are growing\nexponentially [27], which oﬀers promising\
    \ solutions for Smart Farming in handling labor shortage and\na long-time declining\
    \ proﬁtability; however, like most innovations, there exist important limitations\n\
    to cope with at the current early stages. These technologies are still too expensive\
    \ for most farmers,\nespecially those with small farms [29], because scale economics\
    \ make small individual farms less\nproﬁtable [30]. Nevertheless, the cost of\
    \ technology decreases with time, and agricultural robots will be\nsurely implemented\
    \ in the future as the alternative to bring about higher production [4,31]. The\
    \ world\nagricultural production and crop yields slowed down in 2015. The concept\
    \ of agricultural robotics\nwas introduced to overcome these problems and satisfy\
    \ the rising demand for high yields. Robotic\ninnovations are giving a boost to\
    \ the global agriculture and crop production market, as according to\nthe Veriﬁed\
    \ Market Intelligence report, agricultural robots will be capable of completing\
    \ ﬁeld tasks\nwith greater eﬃciency as compared to the farmers [32].\nAgricultural\
    \ tech startups have raised over 800 million dollars in the last ﬁve years [31].\
    \ Startups\nusing robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture\
    \ started gaining momentum in\n2014, in line with a rising interest in AI [33].\
    \ In fact, venture capital funding in AI has increased by 450%\nin the last 5\
    \ years [34]. This kind of new agriculture pretends to do more with less, because\
    \ nourishing\npeople while increasing production sustainably and taking care of\
    \ the environment will be crucial in\nthe coming years, as the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates\nthat, in 2050, there will\
    \ be a world population of 9.6 billion [35]. Advanced sensing technologies in\n\
    agriculture can help to meet the challenge; they provide detailed information\
    \ on soil, crop status,\nand environmental conditions to allow precise applications\
    \ of phytosanitary products, resulting in a\nreduced used of herbicides and pesticides,\
    \ improved water use eﬃciency and increased crop yield and\nquality [2].\n3. Data-Driven\
    \ Management for Advanced Farming: Principal Stages\nThe raw measurements of key\
    \ parameters from crops need to be eﬃciently processed so that\nnumbers or images\
    \ unambiguously turn into valuable information. Crop management based on ﬁeld\n\
    data already evolved when Precision Agriculture came to light thirty years ago,\
    \ but it has certainly\nbeen transformed by the present digital information era.\
    \ Traditionally, and in those places where\ntechnology has not arrived yet, ﬁeld\
    \ management consists of visually inspecting the development of\ncrops to reach\
    \ a diagnosis with which farmers make decisions and actuate giving diﬀerent treatments\n\
    to their crops. This approach relies on ﬁeld experience and the information perceived\
    \ through the\neyes of farmers. Additionally, associated growers can follow the\
    \ recommendations of cooperative\ntechnicians or engineers hired by the society\
    \ they belong to. In farms where advanced technology\nhas been implemented, ﬁeld\
    \ management varies according to the operating cycle shown in Figure 1.\nThis\
    \ management system based on objective ﬁeld data and smart decision-making starts\
    \ with the actual\ncrop to manage, taking advantage of its inner variability,\
    \ both spatial-wise and time-wise. The platform\nrefers to the physical means\
    \ with which information is acquired, being the sensors the speciﬁc elements\n\
    through which objective data are obtained. Data includes the information directly\
    \ retrieved from the\nparameters measured from the crop, soil, or ambient. Retrieving\
    \ the data from the sensors can be done\nin multiple ways, from inserting a pen\
    \ drive in a USB port to get the ﬁles [36] to retrieving data from\nsoftware applications\
    \ synchronized to the Internet. The nexus between the data and the decision stage\n\
    involves ﬁltering routines and AI algorithms for getting only the right data and\
    \ helping the grower\nmake correct decisions. Finally, actuation refers to the\
    \ physical execution of an action commanded by\nthe decision system, and is typically\
    \ carried out by advanced equipment that can receive orders from\na computerized\
    \ control unit. As each action takes place over the crop, the cycle starts and\
    \ closes at\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n5 of 21\ncrop level; the response of the\
    \ crop is then registered by specialized sensors and the loop continues\nsystematically\
    \ until harvesting time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle.\nAgronomy\

    \ several years may be needed to determine \ntrends in the parameters of interest,\
    \ and hence, data becomes a regular input to the farm management \nsystem. Therefore,\
    \ the necessity of monitoring crops comes from the existence of variability, but\
    \ there \nis a need for the producer to manage that variability in a feasible\

    \ of management \nzones would reduce the cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, \nprovide better farm records that are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for \nmanagement decisions [4]. According\
    \ to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a \nfunction of the\
    \ natural variability within the field, the size of the field and certain management\
    \ \nfactors. If the variability is high, the minimum size of a zone is limited\
    \ by the possibility of each \nfarmer to differentially manage regions within\
    \ a field in economic and logistics terms. In addition to \ndecide the area of\

    \ is assumed for all \nfields by nature. According to Searcy [37], natural variability\
    \ is influenced by weather within a \ngrowing season and from year to year; then,\
    \ data from several years may be needed to determine \ntrends in the parameters\

    \ of variability, but there \nis a need for the producer to manage that variability\

    3.1. Stage I: The Crop as the Beginning and End of the Agricultural Management\
    \ Cycle—Analyzing Variability\nRegardless how the crop will be managed, some degree\
    \ of spatial variability is assumed for all\nﬁelds by nature. According to Searcy\
    \ [37], natural variability is inﬂuenced by weather within a growing\nseason and\
    \ from year to year; then, data from several years may be needed to determine\
    \ trends in\nthe parameters of interest, and hence, data becomes a regular input\
    \ to the farm management system.\nTherefore, the necessity of monitoring crops\
    \ comes from the existence of variability, but there is a need\nfor the producer\
    \ to manage that variability in a feasible way, and the widely accepted way to\
    \ do it is by\nsetting within-ﬁeld management zones. Management zones are subﬁeld\
    \ areas that have homogeneous\nfeatures, so ﬁeld practices can be custom-made\
    \ to each of such areas, resulting in a practical and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n\
    6 of 21\ncost-eﬀective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption of\
    \ management zones would reduce\nthe cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, provide better farm records\nthat are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for management decisions [4]. According\n\
    to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a function of the natural\
    \ variability within\nthe ﬁeld, the size of the ﬁeld and certain management factors.\
    \ If the variability is high, the minimum\nsize of a zone is limited by the possibility\
    \ of each farmer to diﬀerentially manage regions within a\nﬁeld in economic and\
    \ logistics terms. In addition to decide the area of working zones, the selection\
    \ of\nthe speciﬁc parameters to be tracked within those zones must be carefully\
    \ made early in the process.\nRovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio [65] classiﬁed crop biometric\
    \ traits in a tri-level division of crop features\ndepending on the focus of interest\
    \ being at soil level, plant level, or produce level. This division\nallowed the\
    \ superimposition of various layers in a standardized map with the aim of determining\
    \ a\ndata-based wine quality index deﬁned as the Quality Potential Index (QPI)\
    \ for each subﬁeld area in a\nvineyard. Nevertheless, there may be speciﬁc cases\
    \ where the spatial variability of a ﬁeld is so low that\na single mapping event\
    \ can be suﬃcient, as reported by Klassen et al. [42] when characterizing soil\n\
    variability in rice ﬁelds.\n3.2. Stage II: Platforms Supporting Sensors\nSensors\
    \ are the universal devices to monitor crops and to obtain objective information\
    \ from them.\nThey are usually integrated in a platform, which is the general\
    \ term used in Figure 1 to name the\nstructures where sensors are placed and carried.\
    \ These platforms may be attached to oﬀ-road vehicles\nor ﬁxed to the ground within\
    \ ﬁelds such as local weather stations. One of the most urgent challenges to\n\
    cope with in the next few years will be getting a wider range of non-invasive\
    \ sensors able to measure\non-the-go. This approach would be closer to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0, as these sensors could be attached to\nautonomous platforms and robots.\
    \ Nowadays, not all the parameters of interest can be measured\nnon-invasively\
    \ and at a distance from the target; however, some technologies such as multispectral\
    \ or\nhyperspectral imaging are making signiﬁcant improvements.\n3.2.1. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms: Satellites\nRemote sensing has played a key role in the progress\
    \ of Smart Farming when ﬁeld data became\ngenerally accessible from artiﬁcial\
    \ satellites. Important satellites providing agricultural information are\nthe\
    \ American Landsat satellites (eight satellites take spectral data from the Earth\
    \ each 16 to 18 days),\nthe European Sentinel 2 satellite system (it provides\
    \ multispectral data at 10 m pixel resolution for\nNDVI—Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation\
    \ Index—imagery, soil, and water cover every ten days), the\nRapidEye constellation\
    \ (ﬁve satellites provide multispectral RGB imagery, as well as red-edge and NIR\n\
    bands at 5 m resolution), the GeoEye-1 system (captures multispectral RGB data\
    \ and NIR data at a\n1.84 m resolution), and the WorldView-3 (collects multispectral\
    \ data from the RGB bands including\nthe red-edge, two NIR bands, and 8 SWIR bands\
    \ with a resolution of 1.24 m at nadir). IKONOS\nand QuickBird have been already\
    \ decommissioned. There exist several reviews on satellite sensing\napplications,\
    \ having recent studies focused on the potential applications of thermal technologies\
    \ using\nremote sensing [44] and nutritional status in commodity crops [45].\n\
    3.2.2. Aircraft Systems\nThe distance between crops and satellites is considerable,\
    \ typically around 700 km, and deeper\ninsights are reachable when sensors remain\
    \ closer to the targets. For aircraft systems, the distance\nto land can be around\
    \ 100 m. For example, there is a legal limit of 120 m above the ground in Spain\n\
    for unmanned ﬂying vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remotely-piloted\
    \ aircrafts (RPA)\ncan basically be of two kinds: Fixed-wing aircrafts and multirotor\
    \ aircrafts. Rotary-wing UAVs are\nmore stable ﬂiers as they are capable of a\
    \ vertical take-oﬀ and landing; however, they are slower and\ncannot cover as\
    \ much area during their battery life. Fixed-wing platforms, on the other hand,\
    \ can cover\nmore area per ﬂight and carry larger payloads, but tend to be more\
    \ expensive and break more easily\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n7 of 21\nafter multiple\
    \ landings [45]. When compared to remote sensing, the advantages of UAVs for Precision\n\
    Agriculture are their ﬂexibility in frequency (revisit time of satellites) and\
    \ better spatial resolutions.\nWhen compared to ground vehicles, UAVs can get\
    \ data from inaccessible places where conventional\nequipment cannot stand; however,\
    \ they require a professional planning of the ﬂight route beforehand,\nand certain\
    \ machine vision applications may require ﬂying at midday to avoid vegetation\
    \ shadows\non the ground causing errors with imagery data. Furthermore, post processing\
    \ the data and image\nmosaicking is often quite challenging. An important disadvantage\
    \ of UAVs is the limited payload\nthey can carry, which often limits the suite\
    \ of sensors onboard, as well as the incapacity of ﬂying with\nstrong wind.\n\
    3.2.3. Proximal Sensing: Ground Autonomous Systems—the Great Push for Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nWhen monitoring platforms operate from the ground, the distance from the\
    \ sensors to the target\ncrop diminishes to less than 2 m. Due to the proximity\
    \ of the sensor to the plant, when data is acquired\nfrom ground-based platforms,\
    \ it is called proximal sensing. Ground vehicles are polyvalent in relation\n\
    to the payload of sensors. As these vehicles move near the crop, the data acquired\
    \ increase in accuracy,\nand resolutions of one or more samples per meter are\
    \ feasible, being only limited by the speciﬁcations\nof the particular sensors\
    \ implemented. When active sensors are used, weather conditions such as\nstrong\
    \ sunlight or poor illumination are not a serious problem anymore, and, in case\
    \ of on-the-ﬂy\nprocessing, real-time applications are possible, as spraying weeds\
    \ with the previous detection of the\npest [47]. There has been a signiﬁcant impulse\
    \ in the last ﬁve years for the particular case where data is\nretrieved from\
    \ an autonomous platform (unmanned ground vehicle or UGV) [48–52]. Aravind et\
    \ al. [48]\nreviewed ground robots for tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting,\
    \ crop scouting, pest control,\nweed removal and harvesting, where crop scouting\
    \ has been deﬁned as the process of continuously\nmonitoring the ﬁeld to acquire\
    \ information on the plant status, disease incidence, and infestations\naﬀecting\
    \ crop growth. Shamshiri et al. [27] described recent achievements of UGVs for\
    \ weed control,\nﬁeld scouting, and harvesting, highlighting that, if successfully\
    \ integrated and implemented, ﬁeld\nscouting robots can play a key role in reducing\
    \ production cost, increasing productivity and quality,\nand enabling customized\
    \ plant and crop treatments. The European Commission (EC) has recently\nbacked\
    \ the relevance of robotic technology for Smart Farming by funding four projects\
    \ involving the\nconstruction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: VineRobot,\
    \ Vinbot, GRAPE, and VineScout.\nIn 2016, the European project VineRobot [53]\
    \ delivered a monitoring robot prototype at a Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL)\
    \ status between 6 and 7 (TRL1 represents an early stage concept and TRL9\nis\
    \ a solution ready for production), paving the path for its conceptual termination\
    \ in the VineScout\nproject [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in Figure\
    \ 2. This robot is autonomously driven\nwhen monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local perception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and\nultrasound sensors) for\
    \ navigation and safeguarding. It gathers data from the canopy of the vines with\n\
    the goal of creating plant water status maps and nutritional status maps. In order\
    \ to accomplish its\nmission in a reasonable timeframe, established by end-users\
    \ at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors\nvine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies several challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust\nsensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and in motion, while having a cost-eﬃcient price\
    \ for the\nagriculture sector. Regarding software, the challenge was the agile\
    \ integration of all the crop-sensing\ndevices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ validation of the models developed in the ﬁeld.\nIn addition to scouting robots,\
    \ the introduction of robotics to the farm is also being led by industry\non speciﬁc\
    \ agricultural tasks. Naïo Technologies, for instance, has developed robot Oz\
    \ for mechanical\nweeding [55], and the autonomous sprayer GUSS received the Davidson\
    \ Prize in 2019 [56]. RowBot\nSystems LLC (Minneapolis, MN, USA) patented a robotic\
    \ platform whose structure was conﬁgured\nto perform several ﬁeld tasks, as selectively\
    \ applying fertilizer, mapping growth zones, or seeding\ncover crop [57]. Over\
    \ the 20th century, farm productivity has been increasing by augmenting the\n\
    size of machines, which has led to heavy and oversized equipment. In order to\
    \ invert this trend,\nresearchers and growers have started to think about alternatives\
    \ to tractors to avoid soil compaction.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n8 of 21\nShamshiri\
    \ et al. [27] suggested using various machines instead of one heavy machine. In\
    \ the same\nline, Hameed [58] proposed a technology that enabled a single farmer\
    \ to control a team of automated\nvehicles, and Ball et al. [59] used cooperative\
    \ robots as a measure to control weeds. In fact, there\nhave been several projects\
    \ implementing more than one machine operating in collaborative work,\nas the\
    \ Flourish European project that combines UAVs and UGVs to retrieve information\
    \ for decision\nsupport [46], or the RHEA project where a ﬂeet of autonomous robot\
    \ units performed treatments in\ncrops [82].\n \nfunding four projects involving\
    \ the construction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: \nVineRobot, Vinbot,\
    \ GRAPE, and VineScout. In 2016, the European project VineRobot [53] delivered\
    \ \na monitoring robot prototype at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status\
    \ between 6 and 7 (TRL1 \nrepresents an early stage concept and TRL9 is a solution\
    \ ready for production), paving the path for \nits conceptual termination in the\
    \ VineScout project [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in \nFigure 2.\
    \ This robot is autonomously driven when monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local \nperception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and ultrasound sensors)\
    \ for navigation and safeguarding. It \ngathers data from the canopy of the vines\
    \ with the goal of creating plant water status maps and \nnutritional status maps.\
    \ In order to accomplish its mission in a reasonable timeframe, established by\
    \ \nend-users at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors vine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies \nseveral challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust sensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and \nin motion, while having a cost-efficient\
    \ price for the agriculture sector. Regarding software, the \nchallenge was the\
    \ agile integration of all the crop-sensing devices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ \nvalidation of the models developed in the field. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure\

    \ \nFigure 2. Version II (2019) of VineScout autonomous robot: Front (a) and rear\
    \ (b).\n3.3. Stage III: Data\nOne of the fundamental diﬀerences between traditional\
    \ and modern farming is, apart from the\nmechanization level, the data collected\
    \ directly from the crops. In traditional farms where growers\njudge by visual\
    \ assessment, decisions are relative and subjective. Modern farming oﬀers assessment\n\
    by quantitative data producing objective decisions. Sensors allow data acquisition\
    \ in the ﬁeld, but\nthe special case of non-invasive technologies in combination\
    \ with on-the-ﬂy sensing from moving\nplatforms has opened the window of massive\
    \ data collection, a forerunner of big data in agriculture.\nHowever, the excess\
    \ of data is also a serious challenge to cope with, as vital information may result\n\
    masked by noise. The NDVI measurements collected for plotting the maps of Figure\
    \ 3 [94] were\ncollected with two sensors working simultaneously (SRS sensors,\
    \ METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA,\nUSA) and placed in the robot of Figure 2. One\
    \ of the sensors pointed to the sky and corrected NDVI\nestimates with the incident\
    \ light from the sun, and the other sensor pointed sidewise to the canopy\nto\
    \ collect data from the leaves at an approximate distance of 0.5 m. The zenithal\
    \ photo inserted on\nthe bottom-right corner of Figure 3a shows the VineScout\
    \ autonomous robot taking data between\ntwo rows in a vineyard. The onboard algorithm\
    \ averaged individual local measurements of NDVI in\nsquare cells of 16 m2 classiﬁed\
    \ into nine NDVI levels between 0 and 1 (Figure 3a). The grid map of\nFigure 3a,\
    \ despite informative, is not operational, so a further simpliﬁcation of data\
    \ is necessary before\na grower may ﬁnd it useful. Figure 3b is the result of\
    \ applying a clustering ﬁlter to Figure 3a. It shows\ntwo management zones based\
    \ on vine vigor (high-medium) for the grower to make decisions, together\nwith\

    3.3.1. Maps Containing Relevant Field Features\nDisplaying data in a coherent\
    \ format is key for ﬁnal users to understand what is happening in the\nﬁeld. The\
    \ most common way to display agricultural data has been in the format of maps,\
    \ as mapping is\nuseful to deﬁne spatial trends and homogeneous zones. However,\
    \ displaying agronomical information\nin beautiful maps should not be the goal\
    \ of map generation. Maps need to be useful for making decisions,\nthey need to\
    \ be a help to answer a question, providing an interpretation of spatial information\
    \ [39].\nThe goal of building maps is obtaining a few management zones with the\
    \ parameters of interest so that a\ntreatment can be eﬃciently applied. To get\
    \ plausible management zones, kriging is one of the most used\ninterpolation techniques\
    \ to delimit areas of manageable sizes [43]. Taking into account the considerable\n\
    amount of data that Smart Farming generates, there are many software applications\
    \ to cope with\ninterpolation, in general, or kriging in particular [66]. Also,\
    \ when building a map, a coordinate system\nneeds to be supplied along with the\
    \ map. One ideal alternative for agricultural maps is brought by\nthe Local Tangent\
    \ Plane (LTP) coordinate system, which features Euclidean geometry, allows user-set\n\
    origins, and employs the intuitive coordinate frame east-north. Regarding the\
    \ coding and display of\ndata in the maps, grids allow the systematic quantization\
    \ of the LTP coordinate system to manage crop\nproduction information more eﬃciently,\
    \ facilitating the exchange of information among successive\nseasons and the comparison\
    \ of multiple parameters on the same ﬁeld [67]. A practical example of\ngrid-based\
    \ maps using LTP coordinates is shown in Figure 3.\nTaking into account the key\
    \ role of positioning systems, a map-based approach is the method\nin which a\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS)—or any other Global Navigation Satellite System\n\
    (GNSS)—receiver and a data logger (e.g., an onboard computer) are used to record\
    \ the position of a\nparticular measurement (georeferenced data), so several maps\
    \ can be generated and processed along\nwith other layers of spatially variable\
    \ information [68]. In general, GNSS receivers are the universal\nposition devices\
    \ used to build maps; however, in some cases, for example in greenhouses or dense\n\
    ﬁelds of tall trees, GNSS is not the best option to use due to the diﬃculty of\
    \ getting signals with reliable\naccuracy; so, in some cases, alternative solutions\
    \ such as machine vision must be implemented [69].\n3.3.2. Data Management Software\
    \ to Ease the Process of Decision Making\nA popular way to manage ﬁeld data displayed\
    \ on maps and culminate with a practical solution\nis through the use of Geographic\
    \ Information Systems (GIS). This set of computer-based tools (or\ndata platforms)\
    \ allows to store, analyze, manipulate and map any type of georeferenced information.\n\
    A speciﬁc GIS system called the Field-level geographic Information System (FIS)\
    \ was developed\nfor Precision Agriculture applications [70], but it was set for\
    \ old computer operative systems\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n10 of 21\nsuch as Windows\
    \ 3.1×, 95, 98, or NT [71]. The updated version of FIS is the farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), which according to Burlacu et al. [72] is a management\
    \ information system\ndesigned to assist farmers with various tasks, ranging from\
    \ operational planning, implementation and\ndocumentation to the assessment of\
    \ performed ﬁeld work. The purpose of FMIS is to reduce production\ncosts, comply\
    \ with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety, guiding\n\
    growers to make the best decisions possible [95]. Farm management software solutions\
    \ support the\nautomation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning,\
    \ decision making, documenting,\nand managing the farm operations [64], and include\
    \ basic functions for record keeping like crop\nproduction rates (harvests and\
    \ yields), proﬁts and losses, farm tasks scheduling, weather prediction,\nsoil\
    \ nutrients tracking, and ﬁeld mapping, up to more complex functionalities for\
    \ automating ﬁeld\nmanagement accounting for farms and agribusinesses (accounting,\
    \ inventory management, or labor\ncontracts). In many cases, growers do not need\
    \ to be ﬂuid on data management because the software can\nbuild maps or decision-making\
    \ models with basic information introduced by growers. Furthermore,\na critical\
    \ feature of these applications is that they even help in the early warning of\
    \ weather-related\nhazards that enables farmers, policy makers, and aid agencies\
    \ to mitigate their exposure to risk [83].\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration\
    \ that the eﬃciency of a recommendation for a particular\nagent will depend on\
    \ the factors included in the algorithms of the software (technical, economic,\n\
    safety-wise. . . ). In this sense, a DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\
    \ Transfer)\nprovides outputs with experimental data for evaluation of crop models,\
    \ allowing users to compare\nsimulated outcomes with observed results, which is\
    \ critical if real-world decisions or recommendations\nare based on modeled results\
    \ [84]. Table 2 gathers a representative set of commercially available FMIS\n\
    programs speciﬁcally conﬁgured to deal with the usual data generated in the farm.\
    \ It includes the\nname of each application program, the company commercializing\
    \ it with its headquarters location,\nand the main features of the program. The\
    \ table is focused on programs managing crop data as the\nprimary tool, and its\
    \ purpose is not the compilation of all available FMIS software, which would\n\
    be futile given the rate new applications are constantly released, but bringing\
    \ a proof of the global\neﬀort realized in the last decade to deploy Smart Farming\
    \ in actual farms, accelerating the move\nfrom academics to agribusiness. The\
    \ examples show that some smartphone and tablet applications\nalready include\
    \ complex features so that growers can insert data directly in the ﬁeld; other\
    \ companies,\non the contrary, prefer having a basic application for mobile devices\
    \ to increase complexity in the\ncloud-based desktop version. In the majority\
    \ of cases, it is not necessary to have wireless connection\nwhile the grower\
    \ is entering data in the ﬁeld, because as soon as the mobile device ﬁnds a wireless\n\
    connection to the internet, it synchronizes the data previously introduced by\
    \ the grower in the mobile\ndevice with the data safely stored in the cloud. Many\
    \ of the programs listed below oﬀer the option\nof upgrading the software depending\
    \ on speciﬁc grower needs, increasing the price accordingly.\nThe most advanced\
    \ tools include features for ﬁnancial and machinery management, help in the\n\
    decision-making process, release warnings, or even propose management advice.\
    \ In many cases, these\nsoftware applications are not only addressed to the grower\
    \ or producer, but also to other stakeholders in\nagriculture such as inputs suppliers,\
    \ service suppliers, and food distributors, which makes a diﬀerence\nfor Smart\
    \ Farming, where multiple agriculture agents are connected. Regarding exploitation\
    \ rights,\nvarious agricultural management systems have been patented, as the\

    \ T: Technology); 2 PaaS: Platform as a service.\nThe use of commercial data management\
    \ systems, as the ones listed in Table 2, often implies\nthat producers need to\
    \ share their crop data with a software platform owned and run by private\ncompanies.\
    \ This fact creates some controversy regarding the ownership of the data. In the\
    \ Software\nServices Agreement (SSA), it is stated that the person or entity providing\
    \ the data to the farm\nmanagement software company shall own and retain all rights,\
    \ title and interest in and to their\ndata, so that the data belongs to the provider\
    \ [76]. However, when data are aggregated with other\ngrowers’ data, the combined\
    \ data typically become property of the software company [96]. The list of\napplications\
    \ included in Table 2 proves that there is a global interest in developing software\
    \ for farm\ndata management, and most of the features requested by end-users are\
    \ similar everywhere. This table\nalso gives an idea of the interest raised in\
    \ industry by software-based management systems. However,\nmany applications use\
    \ their own proprietary formats, which complicates the share of data among data\n\
    acquisition and processing systems. A standardization eﬀort is needed among software\
    \ developers\nand providers. The ADAPT toolkit of Table 2 [77] is an example of\
    \ how to face this challenge, as it\nprovides an open-source application that\
    \ eliminates a barrier to the broad use of Precision Agriculture\ndata by enabling\
    \ interoperability between diﬀerent hardware and software applications.\n3.4.\
    \ Stage IV: Decision-Making\nIn situations where many ﬁeld parameters need being\
    \ considered, people ﬁnd practical diﬃculties\nin managing complex information\
    \ to make eﬀective decisions. In such cases, artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) can\
    \ help with techniques like deep learning or neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic\
    \ algorithms,\nor expert systems. AI, with its modelling and reasoning capabilities,\
    \ can play a key role in agriculture,\nhelping to make sense of all the data available.\
    \ Fuzzy logic, to name one example within AI, resembles\nhuman reasoning imitating\
    \ the way of making decisions that involve several possibilities instead of\n\
    ‘true’ or ‘false’ alternatives; this technique uses linguistic variables that\
    \ ﬁt well with the complexity\nof the challenges posed by the diversity of agricultural\
    \ decision making. According to Dengel [20],\nagriculture oﬀers a vast application\
    \ area for all kinds of AI core technologies as agents operating in\nuncontrolled\
    \ environments. Giusti and Marsili-Libellia [81] designed a fuzzy-based decision\
    \ support\nsystem (DSS) taking as input variables soil moisture and rain forecast\
    \ for kiwi, corn, and potato.\nSimilarly, the DSS developed by Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [87] estimated weekly irrigation for citrus\norchards taking into account\
    \ climate and soil variables; in that work, real-time measurements from soil\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n14 of 21\nparameters in a closed-loop control scheme were\
    \ decisive to avoid the accumulative eﬀect due to errors\nin consecutive weekly\
    \ estimations, as the DSS was allowed to adapt to local perturbations. In the\n\
    same fashion, Lindsay Corporation (Omaha, Nebraska, USA) was awarded for its solution\
    \ FieldNET\nAdvisor™ [91] that provides irrigation management decisions for growers.\
    \ DSS may be more robust\nand reliable when diﬀerent variables are considered,\
    \ but some procedures remain controversial as\nobjectives can lead to diﬀerent\
    \ solutions at diﬀerent times based on the priority set by decision makers\nor\
    \ other people involved in the procedure [88].\nSrivastava and Singh [80] highlighted\
    \ the importance of incorporating the graphical part of GIS to\nDSS, which was\
    \ demonstrated for water management scenarios in India. The importance of using\n\
    GIS for agricultural DSS lies on using user-friendly graphical interfaces for\
    \ growers. The result of a\nquestionnaire distributed by VineScout project [36]\
    \ members to the attendees of a ﬁeld demonstration in\nPortugal (October 2019),\
    \ evidenced the high value given to graphical user interfaces (GUI). Considering\n\
    that the prototype is in research phase and not commercial yet, 84% of the attendees\
    \ concluded that\nthe robot GUI shown in Figure 4 was simple to understand and\
    \ easy to use (unpublished research).\nRupnik et al. [89] developed a cloud-based\
    \ system to allow growers upload their own data, utilize\nseveral data analysis\
    \ methods, and ﬁnally present their outputs as decisions to apply. This time,\
    \ their\nuse case focused on spray planning for ﬁghting against pests in vineyards\
    \ and orchards. Rose et al. [90]\nconducted a survey on DSS and arrived to the\
    \ conclusion that 15 factors were inﬂuential in convincing\nUK growers and advisers\
    \ to use DSS, including usability, cost-eﬀectiveness, performance, relevance to\n\
    user, and compatibility with compliance demands. In addition, they found that\
    \ 49% of UK farmers used\nsome kind of DSS, and the preferred ways of delivery\
    \ were software (28%), paper-based (22%) tools,\nand mobile apps (10%). These\
    \ results show that the use of software to manage decisions is growing,\nbut its\
    \ percentage is still low and comparable to those who preferred paper-based tools.\
    \ Choosing\nsoftware and mobile applications to make agricultural decisions may\
    \ be considered beneﬁcial because\ndigital tools increase management eﬃciency\
    \ when compared to paper-based tools; however, there is\nstill a long way to make\
    \ technology-based tools attractive enough—easy to understand, intuitive and\n\
    nice—for growers to adopt. On the producer side, it is important to have access\
    \ to proper training\nuntil these technologies can be comfortably managed.\nAgronomy\

    \ some action on the crop or\nrelated to it, and this can be done by making decisions\
    \ right after obtaining information (real-time\napplications) or in another moment\
    \ deferred in time (oﬀ-line). For farmers to execute decisions,\nthey need advanced\
    \ equipment that can receive orders from a computerized control unit. Variable\n\
    rate machines can execute a number of farming tasks driven by a smart system [60].\
    \ Variable rate\ntechnology (VRT) applied on site-speciﬁc crop management (SSCM)\
    \ has the potential to increase\nproﬁt and decrease environmental impact [61]\
    \ as only what is needed is actually applied. Colaço\nand Molin [92] conducted\
    \ a long-term study for six years with the goal of evaluating the eﬀects of\n\
    variable rate fertilization on fertilizer consumption, soil fertility, and yield\
    \ in citrus. The outcomes\nof comparing variable and uniform rates showed that\
    \ the former achieved higher yields while using\nless fertilizer: using nitrogen,\
    \ fruit yield (kg of oranges) respect to the amount of fertilizer resulted\nin\
    \ a 32% yield increase in ﬁeld 1, and 38% in ﬁeld 2. When using potassium, the\
    \ yield increase even\nreached 40% in ﬁeld 1. In the case of phosphorus, the growth\
    \ rate was approximately 20% for both\nﬁelds. A recent review led by Nawar et\
    \ al. [93] conﬁrmed that, when management zone delineation\ntechniques were used\
    \ for variable-rate nutrient application, farm eﬃciency increased in all cases\n\
    when compared to traditional uniform-rate applications, and environmental impacts\
    \ were reduced.\nMachinery manufacturers are leading the development of commercial\
    \ solutions implementing VRT.\nThomasson et al. [62] described commercial VRT\
    \ systems oﬀered by major agricultural machinery\nmanufacturers, like CLAAS, that\
    \ used the ISARIA crop sensor for the variable-rate application of\nnitrogen-based\
    \ fertilizer, or the CEBIS MOBILE ISOBUS, which, apart from having other Precision\n\
    Agriculture functions, it is a compatible terminal to integrate the ISARIA sensor.\
    \ Another promising\ntype of variable actuation is automatic diﬀerential harvesting\
    \ or variable rate harvesting (VRH),\nwhich attempts harvesting according to previously\
    \ deﬁned management zones. In specialty crops,\nSethuramasamyraja [40] worked\
    \ in diﬀerential harvesting for vineyards by using near-infrared sensors\nto determine\
    \ grape quality in the ﬁeld based on the anthocyanin content of berries. The three\
    \ steps for\nthis VRH system involved sensing the anthocyanin content of grapes,\
    \ using these data to produce\nquality map based on a threshold anthocyanin level,\
    \ and feeding the quality map to the harvester for its\ncommanding. CLAAS was\
    \ awarded for implementing VRH in combines and forage harvesters [91] by\nmerging\
    \ precision sensing technology with autonomous machine control. The goal was to\
    \ maximize\nproductivity and automatically optimize harvester performance, according\
    \ to the changing conditions\nof the soil, plants, grain, and humidity in the\
    \ harvested ﬁeld. A USDA statistical analysis conducted in\n2010 [3] showed that\
    \ variable rate technologies had positive, but small, rate adoptions of 1% due\
    \ to\ntheir diﬃculty of use. Apart from eﬃciency and utility, cost is also a critical\
    \ parameter to consider for\nthe adoption of this technology. In this sense, the\
    \ ubiquitous availability of low-cost electronics will\nfavor the introduction\
    \ of such digital applications. In fact, advances in autonomous driving technology\n\
    for cars, including object detection capabilities through multi-camera systems,\
    \ have already reduced\nthe cost of developing automated agricultural machines\
    \ [22].\n4. Discussion\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, mainly since the advent\
    \ of mechanization, and along the Green\nRevolution, humans and machines have\
    \ been eﬃciently collaborating for growing crops to feed people.\nHowever, to\
    \ face the population growth in the coming years, an extra eﬀort is needed to\
    \ succeed,\nnot only in feeding people by increasing productivity, but also in\
    \ doing it in the most eﬃcient and\nrespectful possible way, that is, producing\
    \ sustainably. To face this challenge, remarkable advances in\ntechnology have\
    \ been appearing over the last decades, in particular the access to reliable agricultural\n\
    data and advanced computer techniques to get the optimal meaning from them, eventually\
    \ obtaining\nmaximum beneﬁts while being respectful with the environment. This\
    \ new approach driven by digital\ntechnology implies that growers must act as\
    \ supervisors of their crops rather than laborers, in an attempt\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 207\n16 of 21\nof avoiding repetitive, physically-demanding, and tedious\
    \ ﬁeld tasks. In this modern agronomical\nframework, DATA is the key, and the\
    \ information-based management cycle described above provides\nthe practical approach\
    \ that unites concept and tasks. The following points summarize some of the\n\
    speciﬁc ideas drawn from this study:\n•\nPrecision Agriculture, which consists\
    \ of applying what is needed when and where is needed,\nhas further improved the\
    \ eﬃciency of managing farms with the addition of data-based digital\nsystems\
    \ that increase the knowledge of producers about their ﬁelds; this is known as\
    \ Agriculture\n4.0 or Digital Farming. When these data-driven farms incorporate\
    \ robotics with AI algorithms to\ntheir systems, the overall concept is then referred\
    \ to as Agriculture 5.0. Some studies report that\nagricultural robots integrating\
    \ forms of AI can do certain tasks faster than humans [23]. Despite\nthere are\
    \ other studies that contradict this statement [63], robotics is a growing economy\
    \ and there\nexists a great potential for many applications within agriculture.\n\
    •\nA greater adoption of Digital Farming by professional growers is vital to not\
    \ only improving a\nfarm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet the food needs\
    \ of an expanding population [6].\nSmall farms will steadily incorporate basic\
    \ technology whereas large ﬁelds will likely invest with\nsophisticated equipment,\
    \ but data-less intuition-driven management will no longer represent\nthe modus\
    \ operandi of professional farms in the future. This should be considered a source\
    \ of\nopportunities, especially for a new generation of young farmers used to\
    \ digital technology, who\nare the ones with the capacity to balance an aging\
    \ population in rural areas, mainly those in\nindustrialized countries.\n•\nAfter\
    \ the rapid growth of UAVs, a steady-state is being reached, mostly induced by\
    \ the fact that\ndata analysis and ground-truth validation has resulted far more\
    \ complex and delicate than image\nacquisition and platform handling. This has\
    \ promoted the expansion of proximal sensing and the\nexploration of combining\
    \ both data sources—aerial and terrestrial—for a better understanding of\nthe\
    \ physiology of plants and trees.\n•\nMaps, as the most common way to represent\
    \ agricultural data, would need to be standardized.\nIntensely-interpolated colored\
    \ maps are output by GIS, FMIS, and other software applications,\nbut at the time\
    \ of comparing data with the precision enough to grant statistical signiﬁcance,\
    \ it often\nbecomes an impossible mission without standardization. Figure 3, for\
    \ example, uses the ﬂat\nrepresentation provided by the local tangent plane (LTP)\
    \ and formatted in a regular grid. Other\nprograms use UTM projections, and there\
    \ are even images only given in geodetic coordinates.\nAt the need of overlapping\
    \ maps, it takes a big eﬀort to make all data compatible. Not only the\nway coordinates\
    \ are represented needs a standard, but also the units, intervals, and even colors\
    \ in\nwhich parameters are displayed. The combination of aerial and ground data,\
    \ for instance, will\ngreatly beneﬁt from such standardization in the way data\
    \ is visually displayed for the average\ngrower to understand.\n•\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a representative compilation of software applications for farm management.\n\
    The list is not exhaustive, and yet includes companies from four continents and\
    \ 14 countries,\nwhich provides evidence of the fact that agricultural digitalization\
    \ is in fact a global move.\n•\nRegarding variable rate applications, adoption\
    \ rates need to augment, and to do so, farmers must\nﬁnd by themselves the value\
    \ in this technology for their crops. Only after maintaining accurate\nspatial\
    \ records and analyzing ﬁeld data can eﬀective variable rate prescriptions be\
    \ created [39] to\naddress particular tasks.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis conﬁrms\
    \ that consistent knowledge about farms leads to optimal decisions.\nAgricultural\
    \ management systems can handle farm data in such a way that results are orchestrated\n\
    to address customized solutions for each farm. This aid for farmers in the form\
    \ of digital solutions\ncombines forces with robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to launch the imminent idea of Agriculture\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n17 of 21\n\
    5.0. After thirty years of great expectations—and disappointments—by the application\
    \ of robotics to\nagriculture, the timing seems right for the ﬁrst time. However,\
    \ in order to take the most advantages\nfrom Agriculture 5.0, deep training needs\
    \ to be delivered to users, ideally young farmers eager to\nlearn and apply modern\
    \ technologies to agriculture and granting a generational renewal still to come.\n\
    It seems to be the right time to move forward towards a modern and sustainable\
    \ agriculture that\nis capable of showing the full power of data-driven management\
    \ to face the challenges posed to\nfood production in the 21st Century. The evolution\
    \ to Agriculture 5.0 is in the agenda of most major\nfarm equipment makers for\
    \ the next decade, and therefore oﬀ-road equipment manufacturers will\nplay a\
    \ key role in this move if agricultural robots are considered as the next—smarter—generation\
    \ of\nfarm machines.\nAuthor Contributions: V.S.-R. and F.R.-M. contributed to\

    The blockchain is a ledger of accounts and transactions that are written and stored

    by all participants. It promises a reliable source of truth about the state of
    farms,

    inventories and contracts in agriculture, where the collection of such information
    is often

    incredibly costly. The blockchain technology can track the provenance of food
    and

    thus helps create trustworthy food supply chains and build trust between producers

    and consumers. As a trusted way of storing data, it facilitates the use of data-driven

    technologies to make farming smarter. In addition, jointly used with smart contracts,
    it

    allows timely payments between stakeholders that can be triggered by data changes

    appearing in the blockchain This article examines the applications of blockchain

    technology in food supply chains, agricultural insurance, smart farming, transactions

    of agricultural products for both theoretical and practical perspectives. We also
    discuss

    the challenges of recording transactions made by smallholder farmers and creating
    the

    ecosystem for utilizing the blockchain technology in the food and agriculture
    sector.

    INTRODUCTION

    The use of data and information becomes increasingly crucial for the agriculture
    sector to improve

    productivity and sustainability. Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
    substantially

    increases the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of collecting, storing, analyzing and
    using data in

    agriculture (Walter et al., 2017). It allows agricultural practitioners and farming
    communities to

    easily obtain update-to-date information and thus make better decisions in their
    daily farming

    (Kaddu and Haumba, 2016). For example, remotely sensed data on soil conditions
    can support

    farmers’ crop management (Brown, 2015), mobile phones reduce information cost
    and thus

    promote farmers’ access to markets and ﬁnancial support (Kaske et al., 2018),
    and the development

    of Global Positioning System (GPS) facilitates ﬁled mapping and machinery guidance
    and crop

    scouting (Youseﬁ and Razdari, 2015).

    From ICT to Blockchain

    Information and Communication Technology does not avoid bias in the collection
    and use of

    data. Individuals operating ICT always are motivated to use data in a way that
    favors their own

    interest. For example, stakeholders’ preference in a multi-criteria decision is
    highly inﬂuenced by

    the organization they represent (Collier et al., 2014) and NGOs can have a disproportionate
    focus

    on the issues to address due to its interest (Ngo Monitor, 2015). An eﬀective
    way of avoiding such

    Blockchain Technology for Agriculture

    bias is to make data manipulation diﬃcult or even impossible

    by distributing the power of data management to a very large

    number of individuals.

    A blockchain is a ledger in which agents take turns recording

    information on the process of generating, transacting and

    consuming a product or service. The ledger is collectively

    managed by all participating parties typically through a peer-

    to-peer network. A new record must be veriﬁed by the

    network before adding it to the blockchain. Any alteration

    to the recorded data should follow consensus decision-

    making protocol, meaning the majority of the parties involved

    should agree. In addition, an alteration to one record will

    lead to the alteration of all its subsequent records. It is,

    therefore, almost impossible to change in data recorded in

    a blockchain in practice. Blockchain is viewed as “an open,

    distributed ledger that can record transactions between two

    parties eﬃciently and in a veriﬁable and permanent way”

    (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Blockchain is a transformative ICT

    that have the potential to revolutionized how data is used

    for agriculture.

    Potential Blockchain Technology

    Beneﬁts for Agriculture

    The blockchain technology allows peer-to-peer transactions to

    take place transparently and without the need for an intermediary

    like a bank (such as for cryptocurrencies) or a middleman in the

    agriculture sector. By eliminating the need for a central authority,

    the technology changes the way that trust is granted – instead

    of trusting an authority, trust is placed in cryptography and

    peer-to-peer architecture. It thus helps restore the trust between

    producers and consumers, which can reduce the transaction costs

    in the agri-food market.

    The blockchain technology oﬀers a reliable approach of

    tracing transactions between anonymous participants. Fraud

    and malfunctions can thus be detected quickly. Moreover,

    problems can be reported in real-time by incorporating smart

    contracts (Haveson et al., 2017; Sylvester, 2019). This helps

    address the challenge of tracking products in the wide-reaching

    supply chain due to the complexity of the agri-food system.

    The technology thus provides solutions to issues of food

    quality and safety, which are highly concerned by consumers,

    government, etc.

    The blockchain technology provides transparency among all

    involved parties and facilitates the collection of reliable data.

    Blockchain can record every step in a product’s value chain,

    ranging a product’s creation to its death. The reliable data of the

    farming process are highly valuable for developing data-driven

    facilities and insurance solutions for making farming smarter and

    less vulnerable.

    This article reviews applications of the blockchain technology

    in the agriculture and food sector.

    APPLICATIONS

    In

    this

    section,

    we

    discuss

    four

    classes

    of

    applications

    in

    agricultural

    and

    food

    sectors:

    agricultural

    insurance,

    smart

    farming,

    and

    transactions

    of

    agricultural products.

    Agricultural Insurance

    Weather extremes threaten agricultural production, putting food

    security at risk (Lesk et al., 2016). Both, crop and livestock

    production are aﬀected, and climate change is expected to

    further exacerbate weather extremes in the future (Lobell

    et al., 2011; Finger et al., 2018). Agricultural insurance

    schemes are traditionally a well-recognized tool to manage

    weather related risks. Here, farmers pay an insurance premium

    before the cropping cycle begins and receive an insurance

    payout whenever they experience a loss on their farm.

    Thus, the insurer bears all the insured risk and farmers

    are able to manage their ﬁnancial exposure to weather

    extremes, i.e., ﬁnancial losses caused by weather extremes.

    In addition, in case of weather threats that systemically

    aﬀect all the insured farmers, the insurer can further hedge

    the systemic part of the risk with a reinsurance company

    (Miranda and Glauber, 1997).

    Agricultural insurances diﬀer with respect to how losses

    are assessed and consequently how payouts are triggered.

    Insurances that indemnify farmers based on a damage assessment

    that was made by an expert on the farm are denoted as

    indemnity-based insurances. Indemnity based insurances are

    able to precisely cover losses, however, they are prone to

    problems arising from asymmetric information problems (Just

    et al., 1999). More speciﬁcally, information on the riskiness

    of the agricultural production and production practices is

    asymmetrically distributed between farmer and insurer. Farmers

    are expected to be better informed about both which incentivizes

    adverse selection and moral hazard. The adverse selection

    indicates that farmers with a higher ex ante risk exposure

    are more likely to purchase insurance compared to farmers

    with lower risk. Moral hazard indicates that farmers shift to

    more risky production practices when being insured. Both

    phenomena lead to market failure of the insurance scheme

    if the insurer has insuﬃcient information on the two cases.

    Thus, indemnity-based insurances are prone to costly damage

    assessment and need to implement measures to avoid problems

    arising from asymmetric information, such as deductibles.

    Moreover, productions that cannot be measured, e.g., grazed

    meadows, cannot be insured although leading to ﬁnancial

    damage (Vroege et al., 2019).

    Motivated by the drawbacks of indemnity-based insurances,

    the idea of index-based insurances was born either as an

    alternative or complement to the classical products (Turvey,

    2001). Here the payout is not triggered by the loss itself but

    by a measurable index, such as rainfall at a nearby weather

    station (Barnett and Mahul, 2007; Barnett et al., 2008). If

    this weather station has suﬃciently long historical weather

    records, both parties, the farmer and the insurer, have identical

    information about the insured value and moreover, farming

    practices have no impact on the insurance payout. Hence, adverse

    selection and moral hazard play no role and the technical

    procedure to trigger a payout became substantially simpliﬁed.

    Moreover, full insurance coverage without any deductibles is

    Xiong et al.

    Blockchain Technology for Agriculture

    possible and payments can be made timely and automated

    just after an adverse weather event was measured. However,

    discrepancies between payout and on-farm loss can occur which

    is denoted as basis risk (Woodard and Garcia, 2008). Three

    sources of basis risk can occur. Spatial basis risk marks any

    diﬀerences between measured and on-farm weather, e.g., through

    spatial distance (Ritter et al., 2014; Dalhaus and Finger, 2016).

    Temporal basis risk indicates that an unprecise time window

    was chosen for index determination, e.g., whole year rainfall

    vs. growing season rainfall (Conradt et al., 2015; Dalhaus et al.,

    2018). Design basis risk summarizes all remaining sources, e.g.,

    missing weather variables or biased technical implementation

    (Leblois et al., 2014).

    Summarizing, index insurances are becoming an increasingly

    important risk management tool for farmers, while basis risk

    reduction is of central interest. Blockchain can contribute to

    improving index insurance in two dimensions. First, payments

    can be made timely and automated based on weather data

    that triggers the payout as deﬁned in a smart contract. Second,

    weather information and other data sources, such as plant

    growth information or data collected by farm machinery, can

    be automatically integrated via a smart oracle improving basis

    risk reduction and making the index determination and payout

    process more eﬃcient (Gatteschi et al., 2018). Smart contracts

    that integrate external data using smart oracles have already

    been proven useful in other crypto-economic applications

    (Harz et al., 2019).

    First prototypes for smart index insurance contracts are

    already in preparation or launched. For instance, Etherisc1,

    a Swiss-based company, provides decentralized crop insurance

    based

    on

    blockchain

    technology

    that

    provides

    payouts

    based on weather data in DIP as native currency (DIP –

    Decentralized

    Insurance

    Protocol

    tokens).

    Furthermore,

    WorldCover2, an insurance provider based in New York

    City who provides index insurance contracts to smallholder

    farmers in Ghana, simulated the application of an Ethereum

    blockchain-based smart contract. Payouts would hence be

    made in the cryptocurrency Ether.

    Another smart crop

    insurance provider is Arbol3. At Arbol, a farmer can propose

    a contract that includes the premium payment, a payout

    and a weather event that triggers the payout. Afterward,

    an

    investor,

    serving

    as

    counterparty

    can

    agree

    to

    that

    proposed contract. Initial and ﬁnal payments are made in

    Ether (Jha et al., 2018).

    Besides the above advantages of decentralized insurances that

    are based on smart contracts making automated payouts,

    the

    usability

    of

    cryptocurrency

    payouts

    to

    compensate

    farmers needs to be proven in the ﬁeld. Moreover, farmers,

    especially in the developing world, might not have access to

    the required infrastructure to participate in a decentralized

    blockchain-based insurance system. As a ﬁrst solution, e.g.,

    Etherisc proposes that third party organizations “[. . .] can

    oﬀer payment gateways and integrations which remove the

    (Mussenbrock, 2017).

    Smart Agriculture

    Underlying the agri-food systems is the essential data and

    information on the natural resources that support all forms

    of farming. As shown in Figure 1, data and information ﬂow

    while products ﬂow from inputs to output through various

    value-adding stages as well as ﬁnancial ﬂow from output to

    inputs. Diﬀerent actors and stakeholders generate and manage

    data and information as per their needs and capacities. Smart

    agriculture is featured by the utilization of ICT, internet of

    things (IoT), and various modern data collection and analysis

    technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), sensors

    and machine learning. A key issue of establishing smart

    agriculture is developing a comprehensive security system that

    facilitates the use and management of data. Traditional ways

    manage data in a centralized fashion and are prone to inaccurate

    data, data distortion and misuse as well as cyber-attack. For

    example, environmental monitoring data is generally managed

    by centralized government entities that have their own interest.

    They can manipulate the decision-making related to data.

    The

    blockchain

    technology

    serves

    to

    store

    data

    and

    information that various actors and stakeholders generate

    throughout the entire value-added process, from seed to

    sale, of producing an agricultural product. It ensures that the

    data and information are transparent to the involved actors and

    stakeholders and all recorded data are immutable. Figure 1 shows

    how what type of blockchain (permissioned or permissionless)

    used on what kind of platform (Ethereum or Hyperledger)

    along with which consensus mechanism [Proof of Work/Proof

    of Stake and (Practical) Byzantine Fault Tolerance] might be

    suitable to collecting data and information at diﬀerent stages in

    crop agri-food systems. The blockchain technology generates

    security through decentralization rather “security of obscurity”

    that traditional technologies rely on (Ibm Institute for Business

    Value, 2015). Distributing data to stakeholders’ computers all

    is less vulnerable to data loss and distortion than storing data

    in servers centrally managed by administrators. A blockchain

    is a database that contains timestamped batches of transactions

    and activities related to a product. Storing data in servers

    centrally managed by administrators are more vulnerable to

    loss and distortion than distributing them to servers on the

    Internet. The database is incredibly helpful for developing

    data-driven mobile applications that help optimize farming.

    Moreover, the blockchain addresses the challenge of creating

    a comprehensive secure infrastructure for IoT and integrating

    numerous technologies used in ICT e-agriculture.

    Many smart farming models are proposed and implemented

    based on the joint application of IoT and blockchain technology.

    For example, Patil et al. (2017) propose “a lightweight

    blockchain-based architecture for smart greenhouse farms.” In

    the greenhouses, IoT sensors act as a private local blockchain

    that centrally managed by the owner. Lin et al. (2018) propose

    a blockchain and IoT based smart agriculture framework for

    general use. The core of the framework is a platform that

    helps establish trust among actors using blockchain. Agents

    related to products from its plantation to sale can access the

    data stored in the blockchain through smart mobile phones.

    Lin et al. (2017) propose a blockchain-based ICT e-agriculture

    model for the use at the local and regional scale, in which

    each actor has a piece of real-time water quality data stored

    in the blockchain. Many companies devote themselves to the

    blockchain application to smart agriculture. For example, the

    company Fliament provides devices for connecting physical

    objects and networks through smart farming technology. It

    developed penny-sized hardware that can handily be used with

    existing machines or devices through any connected USB port for

    securely transacting against a blockchain. Blockchain is also used

    by farm organizations to make their farming practice smarter.

    For example, farmland irrigation associations in Taiwan use

    blockchain to archive the data collectively and better interact

    with the public (Lin et al., 2017). Each association operates

    as a “public juridical person” and publish their own data and

    information about irrigation management to the blockchain that

    can be accessed by the public. The transparency evokes the

    public’s contribution to irrigation management and increases its

    eﬀorts to improve water resource use. Over time, the longitudinal

    database created using blockchain can be used to inform

    decision-making on such as the construction and maintenance

    of irrigation canals.

    Smart agriculture with blockchain does not lower, if not raise,

    the technological barrier for farmers to participate. Importantly,

    it is better motivated to collect trustworthy data from large

    farmers than from smallholders for uploading to the blockchain.

    Large farmers are more likely to be involved in blockchain-based

    smart agriculture and beneﬁt from it. This thus can create or

    increase the discrepancy between large farmers and smallholders.

    Food Supply Chain

    With increased globalization and intense competition in the

    market, food supply chains have become longer and more

    complex than ever before. There are some common problems

    in food supply chains such as food traceability, food safety

    and quality, food trust and supply chain ineﬃciency, which

    add additional risks on the entire society, economy and the

    health of human.

    From the producers’ perspective, the use of blockchain

    technology helps establish a trust relationship with consumers

    and build up the reputation of their products, by transparently

    providing individual product information in the blockchain.

    Enterprises can better achieve the value of their products

    and thus increase their competitiveness. This would make it

    diﬃcult for suppliers of fraud and low-quality products to stay

    in markets and force all suppliers to improve the quality of

    products in the whole agricultural and food sectors. From the

    consumers’ perspective, the blockchain makes true and reliable

    information about how food is produced and transacted available.

    It helps address consumers’ concern about the safety, quality and

    environmental friendliness of food (Ge et al., 2017). The use

    of blockchain provides the possibility for consumers to interact

    with producers because consumers can understand the food

    production process more conveniently and in more detail. It

    supports consumers by removing obstacles in the exchange of

    goods to tighten their relationship, and thus strengthen consumer

    trust and conﬁdence in food safety. From the regulatory agencies’

    perspective, blockchain makes reliable and accurate information

    available for them to carry out informed and eﬃcient regulations

    (Zhou et al., 2016; Chen, 2018).

    Blockchain is capable of recording the information of a

    product from its provenance to the retail store. It provides a

    secure and immutable way of storing data collected at the start

    of the supply chain, e.g., DNA of livestock animals, pesticide

    residues of grain or vegetables. Such information can be checked

    and veriﬁed by any party involved in the supply chain of the

    product. Collecting such data for all products can be very

    costly, but it can be done on samples. The transparence of such

    information can help detect, e.g., the containment of undeclared

    meat like happened in the 2013 horse meat scandal in Europe

    (Kamath, 2018; Montecchi et al., 2019).

    Many solutions facilitated by blockchain technology have

    been proposed to improve the traceability of agricultural

    products. Tian (2016) proposes an agricultural food supply

    Blockchain Technology for Agriculture

    chain traceability system using Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation

    (RFID), a non-contact automatic identiﬁcation communication

    technology. It can trace products with trusted information in

    the entire supply chain. The use of blockchain guarantees that

    the records of production, process, store and distribution in the

    system are reliable and genuine. Caro et al. (2018) proposed

    blockchain-based traceability system that is seamlessly linked

    with IoT devices, which provide digital data of production and

    consumption. The traceability is achieved using both Ethereum

    and Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain platforms.

    Many companies have committed to exploring the application

    of blockchain technology in food safety management and

    actively carrying out into practice. For example, Wal-Mart,

    Alibaba, and JD.com are actively implementing blockchain

    food traceability projects and using blockchain technology

    to track the entire process of food production, processing

    and sales. In October 2016, retail giant Wal-Mart, Tsinghua

    University

    and

    IBM

    applied

    the

    Hyperledger

    blockchain

    system to food supply chain management, exploring the

    Chinese pork supply chain and the United States mango

    supply chain as a pilot to explore the practical application

    methods and beneﬁts of blockchain technology. In March

    2017, Alibaba and Australia Post explored the blockchain

    to combat food adulteration. In August 2017, the world’s

    10 largest food and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)

    suppliers, including Wal-Mart, Nestle, Dole, and Golden Food,

    reached a partnership with IBM integrating the blockchain into

    its supply chain so that food suppliers’ misconduct can be

    detected more quickly. In this collaboration, IBM’s blockchain

    platform is designed to help food companies improve the

    visibility and traceability of their supply chains and make

    food safer.

    The current blockchain technology in the food supply

    chain is still in the early stages of development. At the

    same time, there are many immature and imperfect places

    in the process of blockchain technology implementation.

    Furthermore, the application of blockchain technology needs

    wide participation and collaboration of involving parties in

    the food supply chain, which is signiﬁcant to play its full

    role. Due to its characteristics of transparency, security and

    decentralization, blockchain technology makes it possible to track

    the information of food quality in the entire supply chain.

    This helps prevent fraud in food transaction and reduce the

    costs of food supply chain management. All parties, including

    producers, consumers and government regulatory bodies, can

    thus be beneﬁted.

    E-Commerce of Agricultural Products

    The e-commerce and trade of agricultural product face some

    crucial problems to solve. First, as Tiago et al. (2017) have

    demonstrated that consumer with high overall trust is more

    willing to purchase online, however, the basic information

    of agriculture products is not easy to be conﬁrmed and

    trusted by consumers. Meanwhile, Cash on delivery and

    Logistics service are the most crucial challenges faced by

    e-commerce companies, especially in developing countries

    (Reddy and Divekar, 2014). Besides, e-commerce retailers also

    need to handle time-demanding small orders with diverse items

    (Boysen et al., 2019), which causes high operating costs for

    e-commerce companies.

    Blockchain technology may provide proper solutions for many

    aspects of these problems: (1) information security. Blockchain

    technology provides private key encryption which is a powerful

    tool that provides the authentication requirements (Xu et al.,

    2016). It can thus link the data of all aspects of planting and

    harvesting of agricultural products safely and unchangeably. (2)

    Supply chain management. Blockchain technology could enable

    supply chain management more eﬃciently than traditional

    monitoring mechanisms by lowering signaling costs for each

    entity (Chod et al., 2019). Every link in the supply chain –

    the producer, the place of origin, the shipping company, the

    destination, the multimodal transport, the warehouse and the

    ﬁnal last mile – represents a “block” of information, with the

    advantage of visibility, aggregation, validation, automation and

    resiliency (Babich and Hilary, 2018). (3) Payment methods.

    The blockchain provides a digital payment solution with

    zero rates. Furthermore, application of cryptocurrency in the

    transaction of agricultural products will reduce transaction

    costs more substantially. (4) Consumer conﬁdence. Through

    the decentralized mechanism, the distributed accounting system

    of the blockchain is time-stamped, so that all information on

    the chain is transparent and unmodiﬁable. Consumers will

    be liberated from fakes and regain conﬁdence in e-commerce

    (Karame, 2016). (5) Reduce the cost of farmers. Many agricultural

    products are produced by households. Due to the low transaction

    volume and small scale, traditional e-commerce is neither

    willing nor able to provide services for them, thus excluding

    these participants from the market. Blockchain technology can

    greatly reduce transaction costs and incorporate them into

    the market again.

    Some companies are already using this technology for practice,

    although it may not be used in the whole process. For example,

    after using blockchain technology, all the goods in the Old

    Farmers’ Shopping Mall, an e-commerce company in Hubei

    Province of China, can be traced back to the source and all the

    production information can be queried by customers4. Before

    the goods are put into the platform, detail information has

    been recorded including seeding, watering, fertilization and de-

    worming5. They also provide basic knowledge of producers,

    transportation logistics, storage days, and storage temperature.

    Customers only need to scan the QR code on the goods, which

    is unique, and all the information will be available to visit.

    This method can eﬀectively avoid the forgery of bad merchants,

    and reconstruct consumers trust in agricultural products from

    e-commerce and its suppliers.

    The application of blockchain technology in e-commerce

    and trade of agricultural product is still in its infancy and

    the current case is not simply perfect. For example, how

    to ensure the authenticity of the uploading process of data

    into blockchain is still a problem. A potential solution in the

    Blockchain Technology for Agriculture

    future may be IoT. What’s more, blockchain’s characteristics of

    distributed, non-tamperable, traceable need to be more widely

    and deeply explored to improve the productivity and eﬃciency

    of agricultural production and trade.

    LIMITATIONS

    The blockchain technology enables the traceability of information

    in the food supply chain and thus helps improve food

    safety. It provides a secure way of storing and managing

    data, which facilitates the development and use of data-driven

    innovations for smart farming and smart index-based agriculture

    insurance. In addition, it can reduce transaction costs, which will

    beneﬁt farmers’ access to markets and generating new revenue

    streams. Despite enormous potential advantages, key limitations

    remain for applying the blockchain technology in agriculture

    and food sectors.

    First, further research is required on the transacting parties’

    motivation to provide genuine and precise information to the

    blockchain ledger. This might be especially important in the

    case of smallholder farming. The information generated in the

    farming process is scattered and owned by individual farmers.

    Blockchain technologies’ beneﬁts for farmers might be dependent

    on the size of the farm. On the one hand, smaller farms could

    easily participate in a blockchain-based insurance market. On

    the other hand, collecting and integrating on-farm data might be

    more convenient for larger farms. Thus, future research should

    try to anticipate which farms could beneﬁt an which could lose

    from the introduction of blockchain-based solutions.

    Second, obtaining the data uploaded to a blockchain

    can be very costly, which will be a barrier to the adoption

    of

    blockchain

    technology

    in

    the

    sector.

    The

    setup

    of

    distributed ledger itself may be relatively cheap, whereas

    collecting data required for making the ledger useful, e.g.,

    DNA of livestock animals could be expensive. Sampling

    can reduce the cost, but it requires that the population

    of products for data collection is large. This means the

    average cost of data collection is lower for larger farms than

    smaller ones, which raises the concern of increasing the

    income discrepancy.

    Third, blockchain does not directly seamlessly integrate

    with existing legacy systems. In order to be successfully

    implemented, the technology needs to be plugged into an

    existing

    database

    and

    legacy

    systems

    such

    as

    enterprise

    resource planning, warehousing management and manufacturing

    execution systems. Building an infrastructure to use the

    blockchain technology is often time-consuming. The middleware

    and communication protocol that can glue existing systems

    will be key.

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth
    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality
    of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning Applications for Precision

    increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end
    of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization,
    land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years.
    India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging
    the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the
    lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation
    techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced
    a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature
    of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic
    conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor
    farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse
    climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture
    [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world
    [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled
    data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of
    modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for
    decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture
    and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture
    revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution
    [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology
    in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning
    system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce
    the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture
    has been discussed. Performance comparison for various ML, DL algorithms in precision
    farming has been carried out based on the state-of-art literature. Assessment

    with its statistical and performance analysis. Comparison of performance parameters
    of sensors used in IoT applications in precision agriculture is presented. Integration
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) with IoT and artificial intelligence in precision
    agriculture is discussed. Challenges and future trends of artificial intelligence
    in precision farming are briefly outlined. Table 1 highlights the major differences
    of this review article with other articles published in this field. The paper

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    9 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Irrigation in the Central Valley of California
    is essential for successful wine grape production. With reductions in water availability
    in much of California due to drought and competing water-use interests, it is
    important to optimize irrigation management strategies. In the current study,
    we investigate the utility of satellite-derived maps of evapotranspiration (ET)
    and the ratio of actual-to-reference ET (fRET) based on remotely sensed land-surface
    temperature (LST) imagery for monitoring crop water use and stress in vineyards.
    The Disaggregated Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse (ALEXI/DisALEXI) surface-energy
    balance model, a multi-scale ET remote-sensing framework with operational capabilities,
    is evaluated over two Pinot noir vineyard sites in central California that are
    being monitored as part of the Grape Remote-Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration
    eXperiment (GRAPEX). A data fusion approach is employed to combine ET time-series
    retrievals from multiple satellite platforms to generate estimates at both the
    high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolution required for field-scale irrigation
    management. Comparisons with micrometeorological data indicate reasonable model
    performance, with mean absolute errors of 0.6 mm day−1 in ET at the daily time
    step and minimal bias. Values of fRET agree well with tower observations and reflect
    known irrigation. Spatiotemporal analyses illustrate the ability of ALEXI/DisALEXI/data
    fusion package to characterize heterogeneity in ET and fRET both within a vineyard
    and over the surrounding landscape. These findings will inform the development
    of strategies for integrating ET mapping time series into operational irrigation
    management framework, providing actionable information regarding vineyard water
    use and crop stress at the field and regional scale and at daily to multi-annual
    time scales. Similar content being viewed by others Improving the spatiotemporal

    in the California Central Valley Article 23 April 2022 Introduction Water management
    is a critical aspect of successful grape production in California’s Central Valley,
    which represents over 400,000 ha valued at approximately 6 billion dollars (California
    Department of Food and Agriculture and USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service
    2016). Despite competing water-use interests and a reduction in water availability
    over much of California due to recent long-term droughts, vineyard acreage and
    production continues to increase, with acreage devoted to wine grapes increasing
    by 12,950 ha between years 2013 and 2016 (California Department of Food and Agriculture
    and USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 2017). As such, there is significant
    interest in developing efficient water management strategies for these viticulture
    production systems. The adoption of an appropriate and efficient irrigation strategy
    for a specific vineyard is predicated on understanding and controlling the vine
    water stress throughout the season (Girona et al. 2009; van Leeuwen et al. 2009;
    Basile et al. 2011). Moderate vine water stress, achieved through the practice
    of deficit irrigation can improve the composition/quality of grapes used in wine
    production (Williams and Matthews 1990; Williams et al. 1994). The standard indicator
    for vine water stress is the leaf water potential (ΨL), commonly measured using
    a pressure chamber. In some cases, pressure bomb measurements are used in scheduling
    irrigation for commercial vineyards (Girona et al. 2006). However, this practice
    requires individual leaf measurements, limiting its suitability for application
    over large heterogeneous areas. Techniques for mapping ΨL have been developed
    using high-resolution thermal imagery to isolate plant canopy temperatures (Bellvert
    et al. 2016). This technique could be used for mapping variability in vine stress
    across vineyards; however, it would be challenging to provide this information
    on a routine basis over large regions and may require calibration for different
    climates and vine varieties. An additional tool for monitoring water stress and
    use in vineyards is measurement of evapotranspiration (ET), which quantifies water
    loss from the vine and surface to the atmosphere. Numerous studies have explored
    various methods and techniques to measure vineyard ET or water use, including
    lysimeters (Johnson et al. 2005; Azevedo et al. 2008; Netzer et al. 2009), eddy
    covariance (Spano et al. 2000; Ortega-Farias et al. 2010; Rodriguez et al. 2010),
    heat pulse or heat balance (Trambouze et al. 1998; Yunusa et al. 1997; Intrigliolo
    et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010), surface renewal energy balance (Castellvi and
    Snyder 2010; Moratiel and Martinez-Cob 2012), Bowen ratio energy balance (Yunusa
    et al. 2004; Teixeira et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2011), soil water balance (Singleton
    and Maudsley 1996; Fooladmand and Sepaskhah 2009; Cancela et al. 2012), and the
    most common and simplest approach, the FAO-56 method (Allen et al. 1998). However,
    like the leaf water potential measurement method, these approaches simply provide
    point measurements that are difficult to extrapolate over larger areas or fields,
    and fail to indicate in-field spatial variability (Teixeira et al. 2007). Such
    spatial variability limits the effective use of irrigation water. Uniform irrigation
    across a vineyard with variable biomass and soil texture, implying differences
    in plant growth and water requirements, will result in the over- or under-watering
    in these anomalous sections within the vineyard. This will result in variability
    in vegetative growth across the vineyard, and result in non-uniform yield and
    grape composition/quality (Bramley and Hamilton 2004; Bramley et al. 2005; Bellvert
    et al. 2012). Errors are further compounded when extrapolating to vineyards outside
    the area of in-situ ET data collection. Satellite remote-sensing technology offers
    the possibility of providing routine spatial information useful for determining
    sub-field and inter-field-scale heterogeneity in plant conditions and water use.
    Satellite retrievals of land-surface temperature (LST), derived from thermal infrared
    (TIR) imagery, have been shown to be particularly useful for estimating ET and
    plant stress due to the sensitivity of soil and canopy temperatures to variable
    soil moisture availability (Moran 2003). Several TIR-based ET mapping algorithms
    have been developed over the past few decades (e.g., Bastiaanssen et al. 1998,
    Su 2002; Allen et al. 2007; Anderson et al. 1997). Due to significant uncertainties
    associated with determining accurate atmospherically and emissivity corrected
    surface temperature data, most TIR-based models use relative measures of LST variability
    to parameterize ET estimates rather than the absolute LST values (Anderson et
    al. 1997, 2012). This is accomplished either through using an end-member pixel
    scaling method (spatial variability) or a time-differential method (temporal variability).
    For example, the Surface-Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL; Bastiaanssen
    et al. 1998) and the Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration
    (METRIC; Allen et al. 2007) methods use TIR end-member pixels within a satellite
    image to represent limiting (minimal ET; hot pixel) and non-limiting (potential
    ET; cold pixel) moisture conditions. The Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI;
    Anderson et al. 1997, 2007a, b) surface-energy balance model uses the time-differential
    approach, relating changes in morning LST derived from geostationary satellites
    to surface moisture availability and latent heat flux. ALEXI is based on the Two-Source
    Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation originally described by Norman
    et al. (1995). The TSEB can also be used to downscale ALEXI fluxes to finer, sub-field
    scales using an associated flux disaggregation technique (DisALEXI; Norman et
    al. 2003). Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of TIR-based ET approaches
    for monitoring water use and stress within vineyards (Semmens et al. 2016; Xia
    et al. 2016). Specifically, Semmens et al. (2016) applied the ALEXI/DisALEXI modeling
    system, integrated with a data fusion methodology (Gao et al. 2006), to estimate
    daily ET at 30 m spatial resolution over two Pinot noir vineyards near Lodi in
    the Central Valley of California for the 2013 growing season, demonstrating good
    agreement with ground-based flux measurements. Moreover, Xia et al. (2016) evaluated
    TSEB model performance over these two vineyards at high spatial resolution (≤ 1
    m) using thermal and multispectral remote-sensing data from low-altitude aircraft
    over the same two vineyards. Results indicate that the TSEB can derive reliable
    ET patterns at sub-field scale under a wide range of environmental conditions.
    The current study expands upon results presented in Semmens et al. (2016), extending
    the analysis to multiple years to promote a comprehensive understanding of seasonal
    flux dynamics within the unique canopy architecture of vineyards, especially during
    the early spring season when timing of the initiation of irrigation and subsequent
    water-use estimates can have significant errors. In this study, daily 30 m ET
    maps over the Lodi vineyard landscape are evaluated over the period 2013–2016,
    including an extended period of severe drought when water resources in the Central
    Valley became increasingly limited. An analysis is also included on the ratio
    of actual-to-reference ET (fRET), an indicator of crop moisture and stress conditions,
    and its linkages on both spatial and temporal scales to criteria used in irrigation
    decision making. The current study aims to demonstrate the utility of remotely
    sensed ET and fRET mapping time series in support of an operational irrigation
    management framework, supplying reliable spatiotemporal information on vineyard
    water use and crop stress at the field and regional scale and at daily to annual
    time scales. Materials and methods Study area The model study domain includes
    two vineyard sites located in the Central Valley of California near the town of
    Lodi, using data collected as part of the USDA-ARS Grape Remote-Sensing Atmospheric
    Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) (Kustas et al. 2018). Both
    the northern (site 1) and the southern (site 2) vineyards are planted with Pinot
    noir vines trained on quadrilateral cordons with drip irrigation installed. Both
    sites have vine heights that vary between 2 and 2.5 m, with space between rows
    of 3.3 m, space between vines of 1.5 m, and an east–west row orientation. The
    northern site has an area of 35 ha with vines planted in 2009. The southern site
    is smaller and less mature, with an area of 21 ha and vines planted in 2011, resulting
    in lower biomass/leaf area than the northern field. In these plots, vines typically
    leaf out in late March, grow through late August, with grape harvest occurring
    in early September. Flux tower were installed in 2013 approximately half-way north–south
    along the eastern edge of each field, located to maximize fetch as the predominant
    wind direction is from the west during the growing season. These towers continue
    to operate through the 2017 growing season. Field measurements Micrometeorological
    and biological field measurements collected during GRAPEX are designed to serve
    as validation data for models developed to estimate ET and component vine and
    inter-row fluxes, detect stress, and monitor biomass development and root zone
    soil water availability. Both vineyards are equipped with identical micrometeorological
    instrumentation and started recording in late March of 2013. Measurements include
    turbulence and mean profile measurements of wind, surface-energy balance flux
    estimates, temperature and water vapor, as well as ground-based biophysical measurements
    such as leaf area index (LAI). The eddy covariance (EC) systems include a Campbell
    Scientific, Inc. EC150 water vapor/carbon dioxide sensor and a CSAT3 three-dimensional
    sonic anemometer. Both instruments are mounted 5 m above local ground level (a.g.l.)
    facing due west, collecting data at 20 Hz producing 15 min averages. Additional
    instrumentation includes a four-component radiometer (CNR-1, Kipp and Zonen, Delft,
    Netherlands) mounted 6 m a.g.l., upward and downward facing quantum sensors (LI-190,
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) mounted 6 m a.g.l., a combined humidity and temperature
    sensor (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) mounted 5 m a.g.l., two thermal infrared
    thermometers (SI-111, Campbell Scientific) mounted 2.5 m a.g.l. used to measure
    both surface and canopy temperature, a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525, Texas
    Electronics, Dallas, Texas), and five soil heat flux plates (HFT-3, Radiation
    Energy Balance Systems, Bellevue, Washington) buried cross-row at a depth of 8
    cm. Each heat flux plate includes two thermocouples buried at depths of 2 and
    6 cm and a soil moisture sensor (HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring System,
    Portland, Oregon) buried at 5 cm depth. 1 Post-processing of the 20 Hz eddy covariance
    data for computing sensible and latent heat fluxes is described by Alfieri et
    al. (2018). Energy balance flux measurements used in this study were collected
    between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016. During this period, typical closure
    ratios were on the order of 0.91 for Site 1 and 0.88 for Site 2. Original and
    closure-adjusted latent heat flux (LE) measurements were compared to modeled LE
    estimates to determine degree of agreement between measured and modeled fluxes.
    Since daily totals are used for model validation, observed fluxes were corrected
    for closure errors using the residual (RE) method as opposed to Bowen Ratio (BR)
    method (which often yields spurious results for nighttime conditions) described
    in Twine et al. (2000). Measurements of water applied through irrigation began
    in 2015 and are made using an assemblage of pressure switches and Onset HOBO data
    loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA). Irrigation events are recorded
    as the time difference between the beginning and end of irrigation, with events
    lasting roughly 5 h on average between sites. The amount of irrigation applied
    in liters per vine is calculated using an average irrigation pump rate and vine/row
    spacing data provided by vineyard managers. Yield maps for 2013 through 2016 harvest
    in both north and south vineyards are provided by E&J Gallo Winery using Advanced
    Technology Viticulture (ATV, Joslin, Australia) yield monitoring systems and a
    cleanup script used to convert mass flow units into tons per hectare, eliminate
    outliers, and normalized across harvesters. Yield data greater than three standard
    deviations from the mean are omitted. Yield maps are interpolated to a 3 m grid
    using Vesper Spatial Prediction Software for Precision Agriculture (Whelan et
    al. 2002). Multi-scale ET modeling system ALEXI The multi-scale ET modeling system
    used here downscales regional coarse-scale fluxes from the ALEXI surface-energy
    balance model (Anderson et al. 1997, 2007a, b; Mecikalski et al. 1999) to finer
    spatial scales. ALEXI exploits the high temporal resolution afforded by geostationary
    satellites to measure the morning rate of land-surface temperature (LST) rise,
    which is used to guide partitioning of the surface-energy budget. Time-differential
    LST measurements provide the added benefit of being less sensitive to errors in
    temperature retrieval due to atmospheric and emissivity correction (Anderson et
    al. 1997). ALEXI is based on the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, first
    developed by Norman et al. (1995), and later refined through improved parameterizations
    in Kustas and Norman (1999). The TSEB model partitions surface temperature into
    soil and vegetation components, which are then used to solve the surface-energy
    budget for the soil, canopy and combined system associated with the mixed scene:
    $$(R{n_s}+R{n_c}) - G=\left( {{H_s}+{H_c}} \right)+(\lambda {E_s}+\lambda {E_c}),$$
    where Rn is net radiation (W/m2), H is the sensible heat flux (W/m2), G is the
    soil heat flux (W/m2) and λE is the latent heat flux (W/m2). Subscripts ‘s’ and
    ‘c’ represent fluxes associated with the soil and canopy scene components, respectively.
    The TSEB uses an estimate of local vegetation cover fraction to partition the
    composite surface temperature measurement into soil and canopy temperatures, which
    are used to constrain net radiation and sensible heat flux, defined by the surface-to-air
    temperature gradient. The G term is parameterized in as a fraction of the net
    radiation at the soil surface (Rns). Canopy transpiration, λEc, is estimated using
    a modified Priestley-Taylor approach (Priestley and Taylor 1972) which responds
    to signals of vegetation stress conveyed by the surface temperature measurement,
    while soil evaporation λEs is computed as the residual to the energy balance equation.
    The TSEB model is applied at two times during the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
    growth phase, at approximately 1.5 h after local sunrise (t1) and 1.0 h before
    local noon (t2). A simple slab model of ABL development (McNaughton and Spriggs
    1986) is used to provide a means for surface-energy closure by relating the rise
    in air temperature in the mixed layer over the time interval (t1 to t2) to the
    time-integrated influx of H from the surface (Anderson et al. 1997). This approach
    allows near-surface air temperature to be computed internally, eliminating the
    need for an a priori specification of air temperature boundary conditions to the
    sensible heat flux computation. Daily latent heat flux is derived using ALEXI-retrieved
    latent heat flux estimates at t2 and upscaled to 24 h using the ratio of instantaneous
    to daily insolation: $$\lambda {E_{{\text{day}}}}=\frac{{\lambda {E_{{t_2}}}}}{{{R_{{S_{t2}}}}}}\left(
    {{R_{s24}}} \right),$$ where \(\lambda {E_{{t_2}}}\) is the latent heat at t2,
    \({R_{{S_{t2}}}}\)is the insolation rate at t2, and \({R_{{s_{24}}}}\) is the
    time-integrated daily insolation rate. This insolation technique has proven generally
    reliable, with lower bias and sensitivity to errors in retrieval estimates when
    compared to other techniques (Cammalleri et al. 2014a). Daily net radiation (\({R_{{n_{24}}}}\))
    maps are derived using an approach described in Anderson et al. (2012), daily
    \(G\) maps are computed by integrating the Santanello equation over daylight hours
    (Santanello and Friedl 2003), and daily \(~H\) values are computed as the residual.
    All fluxes are expressed in MJ m−2 day−1 to retain consistency with prior publications.
    The daily latent heat is converted to daily ET (in units of mm day−1) by dividing
    by the latent heat of vaporization λ. Missing pixels within the ALEXI ET maps,
    due either to cloud cover or missing or low-quality input data, are gap filled
    by conserving the ratio of actual ET to daily insolation (fsun) over time at each
    pixel. The time series of clear-sky fsun is filtered, smoothed and gap-filled
    for each pixel using a Savitzky–Golay filter, designed to reduce noise while preserving
    signals associated with changes in surface moisture conditions. Missing pixels
    within the daily ET map are then recovered by multiplying the gap-filled fsun
    fields by the daily scaling flux (insolation) maps. ALEXI is run operationally
    by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) at 8 km spatial resolution
    over North America as part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
    (GOES) Evapotranspiration and Drought (GET-D) system. GET-D produces daily ET
    and an ET-based Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) using radiometric temperature data
    retrieved from GOES East and West thermal imagery. The ESI describes standardized
    anomalies in the actual-to-reference ET ratio (fRET), using the Penman–Monteith
    (FAO-56) reference ET for grass (1998). The ESI is an indicator of agricultural
    drought reflecting impacts on crop water use, and has been shown to provide early
    warning of deteriorating crop conditions (Anderson et al. 2011, 2013; Otkin et
    al. 2013, 2014). A 4 km resolution grid is also maintained for research purposes
    and allows assessment of ESI and ET at the regional scale over the continental
    U.S. (CONUS). DisALEXI Due to its reliance on high temporal frequency TIR imagery,
    here obtained from geostationary satellites, ALEXI is constrained to operate on
    coarser spatial scales on the order of a few kilometers. To map flux distributions
    at higher spatial resolution, an associated spatial disaggregation technique known
    as DisALEXI (Norman et al. 2003; Anderson et al. 2004, 2012) can be implemented
    using higher resolution TIR imagery from polar orbiting instruments or from airborne
    platforms. DisALEXI operates by running the TSEB model over each ALEXI pixel area
    within a given modeling domain using the higher spatial resolution vegetation
    cover and surface radiometric temperature information. For this application of
    TSEB, the air temperature boundary condition (set at a nominal blending height
    of 50 m), is iteratively adjusted at the ALEXI pixel scale until the DisALEXI
    daily ET fluxes converge to the ALEXI value on average over that pixel. This ensures
    consistency between the ALEXI and DisALEXI flux fields. Further description can
    be found in Anderson et al. (2012), and Cammalleri et al. (2013, 2014a). ET data
    fusion In this study, DisALEXI was used to generate ET map time series at moderate
    resolution (1 km) and near daily time steps using thermal and reflectance data
    from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Higher resolution
    (30 m) maps were created with periodic Landsat datasets, with thermal band data
    sharpened to the 30-m resolution of the reflectance bands using the Data Mining
    Sharpener tool developed by Gao et al. (2012a). These two time series were then
    fused using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM;
    Gao et al. 2006) to create daily maps of ET at 30-m resolution. In short, STARFM
    predicts Landsat-resolution ET maps on MODIS acquisition dates by developing spatially
    distributed weighting factors representing the spectral similarity and temporal
    difference between observed Landsat/MODIS maps collected on the same day. These
    weighting factors are then used in the disaggregation of MODIS images on days
    when Landsat is not available, resulting in daily Landsat-scale ET maps. For more
    information, the reader is referred to Gao et al. (2006), Cammalleri et al. (2013,
    2014a) and Semmens et al. (2016). Model inputs LST inputs for the 4-km ALEXI simulations
    over CONUS were obtained 11 µm brightness temperature observations from the GOES-EAST
    (at 75°W) and GOES-WEST (at 105°W) Imager instruments. Raw brightness temperature
    values are atmospherically corrected using atmospheric profiles of temperature,
    as described in French et al. (2003). Vegetation cover fraction, used to partition
    LST between soil and canopy temperatures, is computed from MODIS leaf area index
    (LAI) product (see below), aggregated to 4 km and interpolated to daily time steps.
    Landsat 8 (L8) data between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016 were collected
    over the study area, which is in the overlap of two scenes (path 44/row 33 and
    path 43/row 33). A total of 87 mostly clear scenes were processed. Landsat thermal
    band data at native resolution (100 m) were atmospherically corrected using MODTRAN
    (Berk et al. 1989) then sharpened to 30 m resolution to match Landsat optical
    bands using the data mining sharpener (DMS) approach (Gao et al. 2012a). Atmospherically
    corrected shortwave reflectance data were directly downloaded from the U.S. Geological
    Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer website (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). These reflectance
    products were used to derive 30-m maps of LAI using regression tree analysis trained
    by MODIS 1 km LAI data, as described in Gao et al. (2012b). MODIS daily LAI maps
    were generated from the 4-day composite (MCD15A3, Collection 5) products and a
    procedure outlined in Gao et al. (2008), where the 4-day products are smoothed
    and gap filled to daily time steps using the TIMESAT algorithm for analyzing satellite
    time-series data for seasonality and other temporally dynamic vegetation properties
    (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Input MODIS albedo maps were generated from the Solar
    Zenith Angle (SZN)-extended MODIS/Terra + Aqua 30 arc sec Global Gap-Filled Snow-Free
    Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) (MODIS BRDF/Albedo CMG
    Gap-Filled Snow-Free Product MCD43GF V005) parameters product (University of Massachusetts
    Boston, Dr. Crystal Schaaf). MODIS LST maps were generated using the Terra instantaneous
    swath product (MOD11_L2) and geolocation product (MOD03) to obtain correct georegistration.
    LST maps were sharpened using DMS (MODIS 1 km composite NDVI as input) to reduce
    the bowtie effect due to off-nadir pixel smearing (Cammalleri et al. 2014b; Semmens
    et al. 2016). Meteorological inputs to ALEXI/DisALEXI include hourly solar radiation,
    air temperature, wind speed and vapor pressure. These data were obtained from
    the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System
    Reanalysis (CFSR) data set (Dee et al. 2013). All fields were mapped to the 4
    km ALEXI grid and converted to each sensor’s projection at both daily and overpass
    times for ingestion into DisALEXI. ALEXI/DisALEXI also requires landcover class
    to specify surface roughness parameters and vegetation optical properties (Anderson
    et al. 2007a). The ALEXI model uses the University of Maryland (UMD) global land
    cover dataset at 1 km resolution, based on observations from the AVHRR (Hansen
    et al. 2000). Higher resolution MODIS and Landsat disaggregation requires the
    30 m National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) (Fry et al. 2011). For MODIS, the NLCD
    map was upscaled to 1 km resolution using the majority class within each MODIS
    pixel. Prior evaluation of ALEXI/DisALEXI over California vineyards indicate a
    small wet bias in modeled fluxes during the cold season (Semmens et al. 2016).
    The current study incorporates a generalized second order empirical correction
    factor based on the day of year (DOY) to adjust this bias (Anderson et al. 2018).
    Minimal correction is applied during the mid-season, with the largest corrections
    being applied during the beginning and ending of the year, causing minimal impact
    to seasonal total estimates. For more information, the reader is referred to Anderson
    et al. (2018). Results Model evaluation on Landsat dates The accuracy of the fused
    daily 30-m ET time series depends largely on the fidelity in energy balance partitioning
    achieved on dates of clear Landsat overpasses, while the MODIS ET data effectively
    serve to inform interpolation between Landsat dates (Fig. 1). To evaluate performance
    on these key tie-points, modeled daytime flux estimates derived using DisALEXI
    on Landsat overpass dates are compared to EC observations in Fig. 2, with statistical
    metrics of agreement, as provided in Table 1. The modeled flux estimates have
    been averaged over a 3-by-3 pixel area (90 × 90 m) shifted west from the tower
    center to avoid non-characteristic pixels over the adjacent road. Model estimates
    of latent heat flux (LE) have been compared to measured fluxes both as observed
    and closed using the RE method, as described in the “Field measurements” section.
    This enables an evaluation of closure impacts on the assessment of model performance.

    steps Full size table Simulated daytime fluxes derived from DisALEXI generally
    align along the one-to-one line (Fig. 2), indicating reasonable partitioning by
    the TSEB. Insolation and net radiation, defining energy available for partitioning,
    agree well with in-situ measurements. A few days with higher discrepancies reflect
    errors in the CFSR insolation inputs, related to misrepresentation of clouds in
    the reanalysis data. Future implementation over North America will test use of
    NOAA’s GOES Surface and Insolation Products (GSIP; Laszlo et al. 2008) as a near
    real time input data source. Preliminary investigation shows that these hourly,
    20-km satellite-derived estimates developed by Diak (2017) better capture local
    variability in solar irradiance over the northern vineyard (Anderson et al. 2018),
    although some regional calibration may be required. Model performance for the
    2013–2016 period is similar to that reported by Semmens et al. (2016), where MAE
    errors in daily LE of ~ 1.2 MJ m−2 day−1 were obtained for Landsat overpass dates
    during the 2013 growing season. The increase in MAE seen here is likely associated
    with evaluating over multiple years with varying climatic conditions and vineyard
    management decisions, and the extension of analysis to year-round in the current
    study (Semmens et al. 2016 was limited to the growing season only). Modeled LE
    indicates underestimation when compared to closed observed LE estimates at site
    1, yielding a negative MBE of − 0.46 MJ m−2 day−1 (Table 1). The negative bias
    is most prevalent at the highest values associated with peak growing season, and
    is not present at site 2 or in comparison with the unclosed LE measurements. Evaluation
    of daily ET from fused time series Scatter plots and associated time series of
    modeled 24-h ET from the fused daily time series and daily fluxes observed at
    tower sites 1 and 2 between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016 are shown in Figs.
    3 and 4, respectively. Daily ET estimates from the fused remote-sensing product
    follow the same general trend as the direct retrievals on Landsat overpass dates
    (Fig. 3). MAE for the full daily time series (closed) are 0.6 mm day−1 for both
    sites, comparable to the 0.7 mm day−1 errors reported by Semmens et al. (2016)
    for the 2013 growing season in isolation. Relative errors for both sites combined
    are 17% and 12% at daily and weekly time steps—the latter being more relevant
    for weekly irrigation scheduling. Fig. 3 Scatterplots of modeled vs. observed

    dates (red squares) and 24-h daily ET retrievals from the fused time series (red
    line) for site 1 (top panel) and site 2 (bottom panel). Daily precipitation measured
    at each site is indicated by the black vertical bars Full size image On both Landsat
    overpass dates (Fig. 2) and in the full daily time series from the data fusion
    methodology (Fig. 3), the modeled LE and ET underestimates the closed observed
    fluxes at site 1 at the very highest values. As seen in Fig. 4, these periods
    of underestimation occur between approximately mid-June and mid-August for each
    year and most notably for years 2013 and 2016. In both cases, the closure corrections
    using the residual method are relatively large, and the modeled ET is typically
    bracketed between closed and unclosed observed values. Such discrepancies are
    not observed at site 2. These large mid-season closure corrections and enhanced
    model-measurement discrepancies are likely related to advective conditions. In
    semiarid or arid regions, horizontal advection of hot, dry air, heated by the
    surrounding landscape, can significantly increase the localized evaporative demand
    over an irrigated field, driving large latent heat fluxes. In such cases, the
    additional energy required for evaporation is extracted from the surface itself,
    resulting in negative sensible heat and an increase in closure errors (Alfieri
    et al. 2012). A cursory analysis of the observed sensible heat fluxes at sites
    1 and 2 revealed signatures of advection during the periods of lower closure,
    suggesting the RE method may be overestimating the real evaporative flux during
    those intervals. Furthermore, the tower footprint may be impacted under advective
    conditions, effectively sampling surface conditions further upwind. Anderson et
    al. (2018) found that peak observed flux estimates are better correlated with
    model fluxes extracted over a more central region of the vineyard that has more
    vigorous vine growth and yield production. Moreover, the assumption of self-preservation
    to upscale instantaneous flux retrieved at the satellite overpass time to daily
    totals depreciates under advective conditions (Crago 1996; Tang et al. 2013).
    Ongoing work is addressing both modeling and observational issues under the specific
    condition of strong mid-season advection. Within-field variability in water use
    Routine remote sensing of daily ET at 30-m resolution will facilitate identification
    of areas of uneven ET/stress within vineyards due to variations in soil texture
    and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors. Figure 5 shows
    the variability in daily ET across both the northern and southern vineyards (sites
    1 and 2) during the entire period of investigation. Spatial variability in ET
    increases during the growing season, with maximum variation occurring in July,
    then decreasing to a near-homogeneous distribution during the winter season. The
    northern vineyard exhibits a higher degree of spatial variability in ET, both
    in standard deviation and range, when compared to the southern vineyard. In the
    northern vineyard, the ET observed at the flux tower persistently lies near the
    upper bounds in standard deviation and range during the growing season. In general,
    at site 2, the flux tower samples are near the spatial mean of the remotely sensed
    distribution (Fig. 5). Overall, modeled spatial mean estimates of ET over the
    northern and southern vineyard are similar, with the only discrepancy found during
    the late growing season of 2013 and 2015, where values over the southern vineyard
    are slightly lower than in the northern vineyard (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Fig.
    5 Time series of observed ET (black dots), spatial mean modeled ET with plus and
    minus standard deviation (dark red) and spatial range (maximum and minimum) modeled
    ET (light red) for the northern vineyard (top panel) and southern vineyard (middle
    panel). Also included is the time series of modeled spatial mean ET for both vineyards
    (bottom panel) Full size image The analyses in Fig. 5 highlight the challenges
    in using isolated in-situ measurements to infer field-scale states and fluxes.
    As noted by Semmens et al. (2016), the northern field has large variability in
    soil texture, with the northwestern corner of the northern vineyard containing
    a silt/gravelly loam, resulting in poor to moderate water storage capacities and
    subsequently lower ET rates than observed in other parts of both fields, dominated
    by a Kimball silt loam. As a result, the tower footprint in site 1 captures conditions
    that are not always representative of the field as a whole. This is consistent
    with analyses presented by Anderson et al. (2018), who investigated spatial variability
    in correlations between the observed fluxes and modeled ET time series extracted
    in a moving window sampling a 600 × 600 m area around the Lodi tower sites, as
    a metric of tower representivity. They found that on average over two full annual
    cycles, tower fluxes at site 1 were best correlated with modeled ET to the southwest
    of the tower location, shifting to the vineyard center when the analysis was limited
    to the peak of the growing seasons. The southern vineyard showed less spatial
    variability in terms of tower-model agreement. Local variability in water use
    Along with field ET estimates, spatial maps of ET over the local landscape can
    provide valuable context for irrigation decision makers. Vineyard managers often
    operate multiple vineyards, potentially with different varietals and irrigation
    management strategies. There may also be value in understanding irrigation and
    water-use patterns in neighboring fields. As an example, maps of monthly ET over
    a roughly 3 km by 3 km box including the GRAPEX study area, with the northern
    and southern vineyards near the center, are presented in Fig. 6. Over this 4-year
    period, some consistent seasonal patterns in water use are apparent. Beginning
    in March, localized ET enhancements in irrigated fields begin to emerge. Irrigation
    in the GRAPEX vineyards begins in early June and ends in early- to mid-October.
    Remnant evaporation of late season irrigation can be seen in these vineyards in
    October for each year. Fig. 6 Spatial time series (monthly) of ET (mm month−1)
    over a 3 × 3 km area including the northern and southern vineyards instrumented
    for GRAPEX. Boxes demarcate the new vineyard established west of the northern
    vineyard and an alfalfa field left fallow following the 2015 growing season Full
    size image Although seasonal patterns remain relatively consistent from year to
    year, some discernable changes in local water use can be seen over the 4-year
    period, particularly during the growing season. These changes are largely related
    to changes in land use. For example, evidence of irrigation in a new vineyard
    established just west of site one in early 2014 is manifested as a substantial
    increase between 2013 and 2014 and persisting through the 2015–2016 growing seasons
    (outlined in black; Fig. 6). In addition, ET in the field due south of the southern
    vineyard (also outlined in Fig. 6) decreases notably in 2016 due to fallowing
    of an alfalfa field after May of that year, possibly the result of grower response
    to long-term drought conditions and resulting water limitations (Anderson et al.
    2018). Spatial weekly or monthly maps of local ET at this scale provide vineyard
    managers with information about local land- and water-use changes, which may have
    bearing on in-field decision making and long-term strategic planning. Use of remote
    sensing for monitoring vineyard water stress and managing irrigation This study
    investigates two remote-sensing metrics that may be useful in vineyard irrigation
    management are total daily or weekly ET (relating to consumptive water use—water
    extracted from the soil profile requiring replacement), and the moisture stress
    factor fRET. Grape development is strongly dependent on vine water status, and
    strategies for optimizing wine grape quality are often associated with imposing
    some degree of water stress in the vine during specific phenological periods.
    This degree of stress is achieved through regulated deficit irrigation (RDI),
    estimated as a fraction of the full crop potential water use. Current operational
    practices utilize the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO-56) model to estimate
    crop potential water use based on the reference ET and a crop coefficient (commonly
    referred to as Kc) describing the average ratio of actual-to-reference ET for
    different crops under well-watered conditions. The fRET quantity used in the regional-scale
    ESI agricultural drought indicator effectively represents a dynamic crop coefficient,
    diagnostically retrieved via thermal remote sensing and responding to daily changes
    in localized crop stress and development. To illustrate the utility of a daily
    Landsat-scale fRET product for stress detection, Fig. 7 compares modeled values
    to observations derived from tower measurements of actual and reference ET. Reference
    ET is calculated in both cases using the Penman–Monteith formulation, as described
    in the FAO standard for a short grass (Allen et al. 1998), computed using tower
    data in the observed case and using regional meteorological data (NCEP CFSR data
    set; Dee et al. 2013) for the modeled case. Observed Actual ET is taken as the
    observed 24-h daily closed flux tower measurement, while the modeled ET values
    are extracted from the fused time series at the tower sites. Also shown are rainfall
    and irrigation amounts measured in-field, the latter only available for the 2015
    and 2016 growing seasons (see zoom-in in Fig. 7; bottom panel). Fig. 7 Time series
    of fRET derived from closed observations (black dots) and the fused ET time series
    (red line) derived from point estimates for site 1 (top panel) and site 2 (second
    from top panel) during the entire study period, along with daily rainfall (green
    bars). Also included is an enhanced view of 2015 and 2016 (bottom two panels),
    which includes daily irrigation totals (blue bars) presented in Liters/vine Full
    size image In general, the fused fRET time series reproduces observed seasonal
    patterns inferred from the tower observations with good fidelity. Small mid-season
    biases are observed in 2013 and 2015 at site 1, relating to localized advective
    issues discussed earlier. This bias is non-existent at site 2, where both modeled
    and observed fRET estimates are similar throughout the study period. Both modeled
    and measured fRET indicate lower peak season fRET values at site 2 during 2013
    and 2015 when compared to 2014 and 2015, consistent with the cyclical annual ET
    patterns in Fig. 4. During 2015–2016, when detailed irrigation information is
    available (Fig. 7; bottom panels), we can closely investigate relationships between
    fRET and daily irrigation amounts, expressed in in units of liters per vine. Observed
    and modeled fRET fluctuate rapidly during the non-growing season when canopy cover
    is sparse and no irrigation is occurring, reflecting the relative volatility in
    the soil evaporation and cover crop transpiration contributions that dominate
    total ET during this period. Once irrigation commences, fRET remains more stable
    and near target levels (0.8–1.0) until after harvest. Note that irrigation is
    suspended each year briefly (5–7 days) around harvest near the end of August,
    then resumed post-harvest until early-to-mid-October to maintain the canopy. After
    harvest, both observed and modeled fRET decay as the vines senesce. During the
    growing season, remotely sensed fRET values in both vineyards show response to
    seasonal irrigation amounts. In 2015, site 2 received about 60% of the daily irrigation
    amounts applied to site 1, while in 2016 the irrigation strategy was more uniform,
    with site 2 at 92% of site 1 (Fig. 8). Irrigation at site 1 varied by only 1%
    between the two years, while site 2 increased by 54% in 2016. These variations
    in irrigation management are reflected in the average remote sensing fRET retrieved
    during the irrigation season (pre-harvest), around 0.7 for site 2 in 2013 and
    0.8 in all other cases. Fig. 8 Total irrigation applied (liters/vine) over 2015
    and 2016 growing seasons in the site 1 and 2 vineyards Full size image Regional
    differences in applied irrigation can be seen in the spatiotemporal patterns of
    monthly average 30-m fused fRET (Fig. 9). After irrigation is initiated (beginning
    of June), there is a clear distinction in fRET between the vineyards in 2013 and
    2015, but less difference in 2014/2016, reflecting differentials in irrigation
    amounts applied to the two fields (Fig. 8). While the relative patterns in monthly
    fRET are similar to those in total ET shown in Fig. 6, normalization by reference
    ET serves to reduce dependence on the seasonal evaporative demand curve, focusing
    more specifically on variations in moisture conditions driving the evaporative
    fluxes. These maps also provide information on irrigation initiation in surrounding
    fields. The fRET maps for April in Fig. 9 emphasize wetter springtime conditions
    in 2014, as well as early initiation of irrigation in the fields to the southwest
    in 2014 and 2016. Fig. 9 Spatiotemporal time series (monthly) of fRET (top panel)
    and fRET anomaly (bottom panel) over a 3 × 3 km area including the northern and
    southern vineyards instrumented for GRAPEX Full size image Anomalies in monthly
    fRET, computed as the difference with respect to the long-term (here 4-year) mean
    fRET map for each month are useful for highlighting regions anomalous moisture
    stress and water use in real time (Fig. 9; bottom panel). In April, May and June
    of 2015 we see pronounced negative anomalies in the southern vineyard, which are
    also present, albeit to a smaller degree, during the remainder of the growing
    season. These anomalies indicate stress in the vineyard likely correlated to the
    lesser amount of irrigation applied during the 2015 growing season and subsequent
    reduced yield as discussed earlier. Regional precipitation in October of 2015
    may have helped to reduce the fRET anomaly signal from September to October. In
    some cases, reflect changes in land use and water management rather than stress.
    In 2013 we see strong negative anomalies in the areas where new vineyards were
    established in 2014, to the west and south of site 1. The alfalfa field fallowed
    in May of 2016 is clearly apparent. Drier than normal conditions are detected
    for the month of September in 2015 over the region just east of the GRAPEX vineyard
    sites. This may be related to management/harvest decisions in response to the
    multi-year drought conditions that prevailed in California during the study period,
    leading to increasing pressure on water availability for irrigation. Spatial fRET
    and fRET anomaly products such as these prove capable of monitoring dynamic crop
    coefficients and highlighting changing conditions, not only within a field of
    interest, but also on a regional scale. Relationships between vineyard water use,
    stress and yields The ultimate objective in this study is to motivate use of remote
    sensing toward meeting the dual goals of reducing water use while improving yield
    and grape quality. Figure 10 provides a more detailed view of annual water-use
    patterns and its relation to grape yield over the two GRAPEX vineyards, showing
    cumulative ET over the peak growing season (May–August) in the top panel and grape
    yield (tons ha−1) in the bottom panel. Fig. 10 Cumulative peak growing season
    (May–August) ET (mm) (top) and total yield in tons/ha (bottom) over the northern
    and southern vineyards for years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Full size image The
    cumulative ET maps show distinct spatial structure. Two low ET features in the
    south-central portion of the northern vineyard are associated with vernal pools
    - small areas having no vines and no irrigation because of protection by state
    and federal law from any cultivation activities (see also Semmens et al. 2016).
    These ephemeral wetlands emerge after rainfall events, but during most of the
    growing season are dry leading to persistently low values of seasonal ET. There
    is also the persistence in lower ET in the northwest corner of the northern (site
    1) vineyard, which is associated with poor vine growth due to soil properties.
    This corner of the field has silt loam and gravelly loam soils characteristic
    of poor to moderate water storage capacity (Semmens et al. 2016), while the center
    of the northern vineyard is Kimball silt loam and is characteristic of more vigorous
    vine growth. The latter is characterized by high rates of seasonal consumptive
    water use. The increased water use associated with the new vineyards established
    to the west and south of the north vineyard after the 2013 growing season can
    also be observed in Fig. 10. Total ET during the peak growing season increases
    from roughly 300 mm year−1 during 2013 to 520–550 mm year−1 during 2014 over this
    region due to irrigation applied to help establish the recently planted vines.
    Much of this spatial structure in seasonal ET is well correlated in patterns in
    yield maps, collected over the GRAPEX fields using GPS-enabled sensors on the
    harvesters. The cyclical ET dynamics in the southern vineyard (site 2), with relatively
    high cumulative water use in 2014 and 2016, reflects grower decisions in irrigation
    management in this field. In the northern vineyard (site 1), the cumulative water
    use is lower in 2013 than in 2014–2016. Similar spatial and temporal patterns
    are seen in the reported total yield for each site (Fig. 10). Specifically, total
    yield for 2015 in the southern vineyard is considerably lower than in the northern
    vineyard, while also being lower than both the north and south vineyards in 2016,
    corresponding to trends in both fRET and irrigation. This instance of decreased
    yield may be the result of increased stress imposed over the southern vineyard
    (shown in fRET) through restricted irrigation during the 2015 growing season (Fig.
    8). Despite the lack of irrigation data during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons,
    trends in fRET correspond to yield totals—most notably in the southern vineyard—where
    fRET values are lowest during the 2013 and 2015 growing season (Fig. 7). In the
    northern vineyard, yields are lowest in 2013—the year of lowest cumulative water
    use. The spatial distribution of cumulative growing season ET (Fig. 10) also roughly
    follows that of yield, with larger values of both reported near the center of
    the northern vineyard for all years. As noted above, spatial heterogeneity in
    the northern vineyard is associated with soil texture discontinuities and vine
    growth vigor. Low yields in the NW corner are spatially correlated with lower
    seasonal ET, while the center of the northern vineyard has persistently the highest
    yields and seasonal water use. A similar spatial correlation to yield is presented
    in Sun et al. (2017), where the biophysical parameters NDVI and LAI show a similar
    spatial correlation to grape yield over the same vineyards during 2013 and 2014,
    although the relationship is more variable from year to year. Ongoing work looks
    to expand upon research done in Sun et al. (2017) by examining the joint use of
    remotely sensed LAI/ET/fRET signals to predict yield variations over a larger
    dataset of vineyards and over an extended period. Summary and conclusions A remote-sensing
    approach for mapping daily ET at 30-m spatial resolution is evaluated over two
    vineyard sites in central California for the 2013–2016 growing seasons to investigate
    the utility for irrigation management. Mean absolute errors in comparison with
    in-situ eddy covariance measurements of daily ET were 0.6 mm day−1, or about 17%
    of the mean observed value. Errors reduced to 15% at the weekly time steps relevant
    to irrigation management. In comparison with eddy covariance fluxes forced for
    closure, the model tended to underestimate closed observations in the northern
    vineyard site during highly advective periods for the peak growing season in 2013
    and 2016. During this period, the closure errors in the observations were exacerbated,
    and therefore, the tendency to underestimate is partly attributed to issues with
    the flux measurements and closure technique and not the model alone. Model errors
    may be associated with the self-preservation assumptions in the daily upscaling
    technique, which may be less reliable under advective conditions. Monthly total
    ET maps and the spatial variation time series demonstrate strong seasonal water-use
    variability, both within the vineyards themselves and over the surrounding landscape.
    In the northern vineyard, the flux tower location was not representative of the
    field-scale mean properties in some years, highlighting challenges in managing
    irrigation decisions based on point-scale measurements. Time series of monthly
    ET maps revealed consistent seasonal dynamics year-to-year in water-use patterns
    over the GRAPEX study area, but with some notable variations due to changes in
    land use and water management. Within vineyard spatial variability of cumulative
    growing season ET and actual-to-reference ET (fRET) correlate well with yield
    totals, demonstrating the impact of potential stress on future yield prospects.
    Maps of fRET demonstrate utility for monitoring how consistently target values
    (between 0.8 and 1.0 in this case) are achieved for a given field, and could be
    useful for adaptive management of irrigation applications in real time. Maps of
    fRET anomalies highlight emerging areas of anomalous water use or stress that
    could alert needs for modified management or further investigation. The modeling
    approach described here can provide detailed and robust information on daily to
    seasonal crop water use and stress. Applied operationally, this ET mapping framework
    can be of great utility to irrigation managers, both for individual vineyard assessment
    and larger regional application. Improved spatial and temporal monitoring will
    improve water allocation and conservation efforts through an ability to identify
    areas of uneven productivity/stress due to variations in soil texture and composition
    and other environmental or anthropogenic factors. This will allow vineyard managers
    to identify areas in their blocks with water, nutrient or other environmental
    stressors as well as malfunctions in the irrigation systems. Moreover, with reliable
    daily 30-m ET, growers and irrigation managers have the potential to make use
    of variable rate irrigation systems that can apply appropriate amounts of irrigated
    water and nutrients to specific areas within a vineyard to achieve more uniform
    grape quality and yield goals. There is also potential to incorporate very fine
    resolution aerial imagery from UAVs or manned aircraft for identifying individual
    or groups of vines requiring intervention at critical periods during vine and
    grape development stages when stress conditions are detected at the coarser 30
    m satellite resolution. In ongoing work, this fusion-based ET mapping system is
    being applied over different vine varieties and climate regions within California
    as part of the continued effort of the GRAPEX project (Kustas et al. 2018). The
    ability to reliably monitor evaporative water loss and crop conditions at both
    the field and regional scale is imperative to viticulture and agricultural production
    systems alike, especially in regions with competing demands for limited water
    resources. Notes The use of trade, firm, or corporation names in this article

    Get rights and content Summary Quality control is a major prerequisite for using
    meteorological information. High quality data sources are vital to scientists,
    engineers and decision makers alike. Validation of meteorological data ensures
    that the information needed has been properly generated and that it identifies
    incorrect values and detects problems that require immediate maintenance attention.
    In this work, several quality assurance procedures based on different criteria
    are proposed and applied to meteorological data from the Agroclimatic Information
    Network of Andalusia (Southern Spain) to assess their integrity and quality. The
    procedures include validations of record structure data, range/limits, time and
    internal consistency, persistence and spatial consistency tests. Quality assurance
    tests consist of procedures or rules against which data are tested, setting data
    flags to provide guidance to end users. The proposed system is capable of identifying
    several types of errors and is used as a tool that allows one to make decisions
    such as sensor replacement and to remove data prior to their application. Highlights
    ► We propose several quality assurance methods for meteorological information.
    ► The procedures include validation of structure data, and range, step, persistence
    and spatial consistence tests. ► The developed system is an useful tool for providing
    guidance to end users. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords
    Quality controlValidationAgrometeorologyWeather network 1. Introduction Meteorological
    observations and related environmental and geophysical measurements are necessary
    for a real-time preparation for weather analyses, forecasts and severe weather
    warnings, for the study of climate, for local weather-dependent operations, for
    hydrology and agricultural meteorology, and for research in meteorology and climatology
    (WMO, 2008). Some of the applications for meteorological data include: risk assessments,
    hydraulic structures design, crop water-use estimates, irrigation scheduling,
    input variables of climate change and hydrological models, active and passive
    renewable energy uses, etc. (Weiss and Robb, 1986, Meyer and Hubbard, 1992, Del
    Greco et al., 2005, Flores et al., 2005, Younes et al., 2005). During the last
    two decades, the number of automated weather station networks has greatly increased
    throughout the world. This rapid development has been the consequence of the need
    to provide meteorological data in near-real time and the great evolution of automatic
    data acquisition systems (Miller and Barth, 2003). Irrigation Agroclimatic Information
    System (SIAR in Spanish language) is the most important automated meteorological
    network in Spain. It was installed in the period 1999–2000, covering the majority
    of irrigated areas of Spain. SIAR was established across all the Spanish regions
    for agronomic purposes (Pérez de los Cobos et al., 2003). The climate networks
    of many National Meteorological Services only provide temperature and precipitation
    data (Gázquez et al., 2003). Nevertheless, these data are not easily available
    with the frequency required (Meyer and Hubbard, 1992), in spite of World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) resolutions requesting free and unrestricted exchange of climate
    information between National Organizations including the private sector (Cuadrat
    et al., 2002). Nowadays, the improvement and strengthening of meteorological observation
    networks to support data collection for operational applications and applied research
    in hydrological processes, agricultural meteorology or climate change models are
    required (WMO, 2006). For purposes of scientific research and resource management,
    meteorological data from weather stations are recorded in large databases. All
    these efforts are enhanced by quality checking the data; however, no consistent
    methodologies are employed in many cases. Questionable results have been attributed
    to poor data quality as a consequence of non-existing or mixed quality control
    methods (Meek and Hatfield, 1994). There are three important reasons for applying
    quality control procedures to meteorological data: (i) to ensure that meteorological
    information is properly generated; (ii) to identify erroneous data involving inadequate
    decision making; and (iii) to detect and solve problems for a correct maintenance
    of the stations and periodic calibration of sensors (Doraiswamy et al., 2000).
    Quality control of data is the best known component of quality management systems.
    It consists of the examination of data at weather stations and data centers with
    the aim of detecting errors (WMO, 1993). Different methods can be applied to ensure
    quality of meteorological data: periodic maintenance of stations and field sensor
    checks, validation of data using statistic procedures and, finally, sensor calibration.
    O’Brien and Keefer (1985) proposed a set of three computer-based rules, which
    were applied by Meek and Hatfield (1994) to validate meteorological data. These
    rules include computation of fixed or dynamic high/low bounds for each variable,
    use of fixed or dynamic rate of change limits for each variable and a continual
    no-observed-change in time limit. In the validation process, data of a doubtful
    quality must be detected and appropriately flagged. These quality control flags,
    which supplement but do not alter the data, are employed to describe which test
    the data failed. All archived meteorological data must be coupled with flags (“good”,
    “suspect”, “warning” or “failure”) that indicate the level of confidence that
    network managers place upon their observations (Fiebrich and Crawford, 2001).
    Quality control flags are grouped into two main categories, “informative” and
    “severe”, such as the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS)
    (Snyder and Pruitt, 1992). In some cases, algorithms can be applied to correct
    erroneous data or to fill gaps, but both original and corrected data should always
    be archived in the databases (Reek et al., 1992). Finally, meteorological data
    considered as potentially erroneous should be verified and manually inspected
    by qualified personnel. This paper presents some guidelines for applying quality
    control procedures to meteorological measurements according to several tests that
    use data from a single site (Meek and Hatfield, 1994, Shafer et al., 2000) and
    others that use data from multiple sites, comparing a station’s data against neighboring
    stations (Reek et al., 1992, Hubbard, 2001). These validation methods have been
    applied to the Agroclimatic Information Network of Andalusia (RIAA), belonging
    to Spanish SIAR Network, using data from 1999 to 2006. The impact of error measurements
    in climate data on reference evapotranspiration (ET0) has been recently studied
    for this network (Estévez et al., 2009). In general, valid meteorological data
    are required to make climate assessments and to make climate-related decisions.
    In semiarid regions, with a structural water deficit, the integrity and quality
    of these data are crucial to improving ET0 estimates and precipitation, ensuring
    an adequate irrigation water management. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Data Meteorological
    data used in the analysis were obtained from the RIAA. This network is currently
    composed of 99 automatic weather stations with the aim of providing ET0 values
    and other meteorological data to improve irrigation water management (Gavilán
    et al., 2008). Daily data can be obtained from the Web at www.juntadeandalucia.es/agriculturaypesca/ifapa/ria.
    Automatic weather stations are controlled by a programmable CR10X datalogger (Campbell
    Scientific Inc., CSI, Logan, Utah) and are equipped with sensors for measuring
    temperature and relative humidity of the air (HMP45C probe, Vaisala, Helsinky,
    Finland), solar radiation (pyranometer SP1110, Skye, Llandrindod Wells, United
    Kingdom), wind speed and direction (wind monitor RM Young 05103, Traverse City,
    Mich.), and rainfall (tipping bucket rain gauge ARG 100). The measurement heights
    and more details have been outlined in Gavilán et al. (2006) and are not repeated
    here, although specifications of the sensors are reported in Table 1. Daily and
    semihourly values are stored for each meteorological variable. Meteorological
    data from 1999 to 2006 were used in this study. Variables validated were: daily
    and semihourly solar radiation (Rs and Rssh, respectively), daily mean, maximum
    and minimum air temperatures (Tm, Tx and Tn, respectively), semihourly air temperature
    (Tsh), daily mean, maximum and minimum relative humidity of the air (RHm, RHx
    and RHn, respectively), semihourly relative humidity (RHsh), daily mean and maximum
    wind speed (Um and Ux, respectively), semihourly wind speed (Ush), daily amount
    of precipitation (P) and semihourly amount of precipitation amount (Psh). The
    geographical distribution of the stations is shown in Fig. 1. The stations are
    evenly distributed throughout the irrigated areas. Site elevations range from
    4 to 1212 m above mean sea level, longitude, from 1769 to 7246W and latitude,
    from 36,286 to 38,255N (Table 2). Table 1. Specifications of sensors installed

    applied to identify erroneous data from sensor measurements are described in this
    section. Initially, they are necessary to verify that all possible data have been
    collected and that the record structure is correct, complete and without any gaps
    in the data files. Meteorological data not fulfilling the above requirements are
    flagged as erroneous. However, the automated analysis is not sometimes capable
    of recognizing subtle problems in meteorological observations, such as instrument
    drift. Furthermore, some localized phenomena (e.g. thunderstorms, heatbursts)
    may be erroneously flagged by these automatic quality control algorithms (Shafer
    et al., 2000). Visual analysis is the last step in the validation process and
    it must be carried out by well-trained technicians or meteorologists, helping
    to identify problems in the climate dataset. Usual methods of visual inspection
    of meteorological observations are real-data monitoring, mapping extreme values
    or cumulative totals during the period of interest. Also, time-series graphs depicting
    data from the site and parameter in question can be created or a long-term analysis
    such as “double mass analysis” technique can be conducted (Allen et al., 1998)
    Obviously, depending on the availability of long-term series and qualified personal,
    and on the infrastructure of the network itself, some methods could be appropriately
    applied and some not. Procedures recommended for assessing quality of net radiation,
    soil heat flux and vapor pressure (Allen et al., 1998), sunshine duration (Allen
    et al., 1994), barometric pressure (Meek and Hatfield, 1994) or pan evaporation
    (Feng et al., 2004) are not described in the next sections. The quality control
    methods applied in this work are: range/limit (fixed or dynamic) test, step test,
    internal consistency test, persistence test and spatial consistency test. Meteorological
    data which do not pass the fixed range test should be flagged as erroneous. Data
    rejected by the other tests should be flagged as suspect, and they should be validated
    by manual inspection. 2.2.1. Range test The range test is based upon a combination
    of performance specifications for each sensor and physical/climate extremes for
    each location and variable. Limits of different meteorological variables may depend
    on climate conditions at the station’s site and on a season. Any observation that
    occurs outside the maximum or minimum allowable value is properly flagged. Measured
    data should be inside this upper and lower threshold in order to be considered
    valid (Reek et al., 1992, Meek and Hatfield, 1994, Shafer et al., 2000, Feng et
    al., 2004). There are two types of ranges: fixed (physics and instrumental) and
    dynamic ranges. The fixed range test compares the value of a meteorological variable
    with established extreme values. Any observation that occurs outside the acceptable
    range is flagged as erroneous and is not validated by the next tests. The fixed
    limits proposed for different variables are based on Table 1 and on ranges proposed
    by some authors (Table 3). Table 3. Quality control procedures applied to RIAA

    semihour before three hours, etc. σRHsh: standard deviation of semihourly relative
    humidity data. Dynamic bounds for each meteorological variable are based on extreme
    values measured for each location or on the theoretical possible extreme for each
    site and time period, as Allen (1996) proposed for solar radiation. Variable high/low
    extreme values recorded for temperature and precipitation used in this test were
    reported by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET, 2008) and they were obtained
    from long-term meteorological observatories closer to each station. Data rejected
    by the dynamic range test are flagged as suspect and they should be verified by
    manual inspection. If a suspected measured datum (potential outlier) is correctly
    verified, it is stored as a new extreme value for the corresponding location.
    Daily or semihourly solar radiation data (Rs and Rssh, respectively) can be validated
    by applying the dynamic test described by Moradi (2007), where measured data are
    compared with extraterrestrial solar radiation values (Ra) for each location,
    according to: (1) 0.03 R a ⩽ Rs ( or Rs sh ) ⩽ R a The low dynamic bound is the
    same as that proposed by Geiger et al. (2002) for the atmospheric transmittance
    coefficient, defined as the ratio of measured solar radiation to extraterrestrial
    radiation. A more restrictive test, and a very useful one as a quality control
    procedure, is based on the comparison of measured solar radiation with solar radiation
    expected under clear sky conditions (Rso), This procedure was suggested by Allen
    (1996), plotting both curves at daily, hourly or shorter periods. Geiger et al.
    (2002) proposed the same high bound incremented in 10%, according to: (2) Rs (
    or Rs sh ) < 1.10 R so Rso can be computed as (3) R so = K T R a where KT is a
    “clearness” index, which may range from 0.7 to 0.8, depending on atmospheric clarity
    (dust, pollution, humidity, etc.) and elevation and sun angle. Both Ra and KT
    can be estimated with the method proposed by Allen (1996). A simple prediction
    for KT, where only site elevation is considered, was developed by Allen et al.
    (1994) by regression of the integrated Beer’s radiation extinction function (Monteith
    and Unsworth, 1990) with an elevation between sea level and 3000 m (4) K T = 0.75
    + 2 · 10 - 5 z where z is the station elevation above mean sea level (m). Improved
    estimates of Rso can be used and have been outlined in Allen et al. (1998) and
    are not repeated here. Fig. 2 shows examples of using (2), (3), (4) for validating
    Rs data using estimated Rso envelopes in two different locations for daily time
    steps. Fig. 2a and b show daily Rs data measured at “Las Cabezas de San Juan”
    (Sevilla) and Córdoba, respectively, both from 2001 to 2006. Rs measurements on
    clear-sky days in Córdoba followed the calculated clear-sky envelopes estimated
    using equations 3 and 4 during all seasons (Fig. 2b). Only two solar radiation
    data were below the dynamic bound, maybe as a consequence of pyranometer conditions
    not being clean. Comparison of Rso curve with measured solar radiation from “Las
    Cabezas de San Juan” (Sevilla) station indicates that the pyranometer was measuring
    about 20% high on clear-sky days from spring 2002 to summer 2006. Outliers detected
    increased due to an incorrect calibration of the pyranometer. Generated alarms
    allowed the replacement of the sensor with a new one. Measurement data decreased
    and remained very close to the computed clear-sky envelope after replacement of
    the pyranometer (Fig. 2a). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Application
    of dynamic range test to daily solar radiation data for “Las Cabezas de San Juan
    (Sevilla)” (a) and for “Córdoba (Córdoba)” stations (b). Rs: Measured daily solar
    radiation; Rso: solar radiation expected under clear sky conditions. 2.2.2. Step
    test Quality control procedures based on time consistency (step test) compare
    the difference between successive measurements. If the difference exceeds an allowed
    value, a different one for each parameter, both observations are flagged as suspect
    (Shafer et al., 2000). Therefore, this test checks the excessive rate of change
    of two consecutive values. For validating semihourly global radiation data, a
    modified step test proposed by Meek and Hatfield (1994) can be applied as (5)
    0 ⩽ | Rs sh - Rs sh - 2 | ⩽ 555 Wm - 2 where Rssh is the solar radiation measured
    at hour h, and Rssh-2 the solar radiation measured one hour before (Table 3).
    This test was used for validating hourly temperature and relative humidity data
    in some USA networks (Graybeal et al., 2004a) and it has proven to be useful for
    detecting erroneous readings due to loose wires or datalogger problems (Shafer
    et al., 2000). Recent works used this test with data recorded at a higher sample
    rate (Schroeder et al., 2005). An adaptation of this test was proposed by Lanzante
    (1996) for temperature, requiring ten years of data. DeGaetano (1997) proposed
    some specific algorithms to validate wind speed and direction data based on time
    consistency, requiring instantaneous values or 1-min, 2-min average. Verifications
    of temporal consistency of meteorological data are based on information redundancy
    of successive observations at a given weather station. In this sense, the World
    Meteorological Organization (WMO, 1993) proposed some recommendations of tolerance
    for temperature (Table 3), dew point temperature and atmospheric pressure. Zahumensky
    (2004) recommended a possible limit of a maximum variability of 10-min relative
    humidity values. A modified step test for RIAA network is proposed for semihourly
    RH data (Table 3). The procedures based on time consistency that were applied,
    according to the available meteorological data from RIAA, are summarized in Table
    3. 2.2.3. Internal consistency test This test is based on the verification of
    physics or climatologic consistency of each observed parameter or on the relation
    between two measured variables (Grüter et al., 2001). Several meteorological variables
    measured at the same location and time should be meteorologically consistent with
    each other. Otherwise, both observations would be flagged as suspect. For example,
    an average value will always be lower than the maximum instantaneous value, or
    the amount of precipitation occurring in 6 h will always be lower or equal to
    the amount of precipitation in 24 h (Vejen et al., 2002). Therefore, similar algorithms
    to Equation 6 for several variables are summarized in Table 3. Semihourly data
    in RIAA network is the average of three instantaneous values and extreme (maximum
    or minimum) daily values are the lowest or highest of the instantaneous data of
    a whole day. In Equation 6, Ux is the daily maximum instantaneous wind speed value
    and max(Ush) is the semihourly maximum value from 48 wind speed records from a
    specific day. (6) U x > max ( U sh ) Also, it is usual to use checks such as Tx(d)
    > Tm(d) > Tn(d) or Tx(d) > Tn(d−1) for a given day d (Reek et al., 1992, Feng
    et al., 2004). Another check is to verify that wet bulb temperature does not exceed
    dry bulb temperature (Graybeal et al., 2004a), and that it does not exceed dew
    point temperature (Graybeal et al., 2004b). For manual stations, a limit for the
    daily range temperature (Tx–Tn) can be used for temperature validation data (Reek
    et al., 1992, Feng et al., 2004) or its relation to the dewpoint depression to
    check both parameters (Graybeal et al., 2004b). To validate wind speed and direction
    data, the following conditions will be true: wind speed = 0 and wind direction
    = 0; wind speed ≠ 0 and wind direction ≠ 0 (DeGaetano, 1997, Zahumensky, 2004).
    Relationships between peak-gust, fastest-mile and 5-min wind speeds can be used
    to validate daily wind speed data (Graybeal, 2005). The problem is that these
    kinds of records are not measured in the majority of automated weather stations.
    Maximum wind speed data, if available, can assist in the assessment of daily wind
    speed data. Gust factor (ratio of maximum wind speed to mean daily wind speed)
    is a useful index for checking anemometers measurements (ASCE-EWRI, 2005). This
    factor often increases as contamination increases the friction in the bearings.
    As an example, this factor is represented in Fig. 3 for two different locations
    for several years. At the “Santaella” (Córdoba) station (Fig. 3a) the gust factor
    values showed good behavior, but the data from “Conil de la Frontera” (Cádiz)
    station showed some anomalies at the end of 2006 (Fig. 3b). This short period
    of excessively large values indicate that the anemometer may be malfunctioning.

    of daily maximum wind speed to daily mean wind speed) for “Santaella (Córdoba)”
    (a) and “Conil de la Frontera (Cádiz)” (b) stations. For precipitation, Estévez
    (2008) reported -using SIAR network data in Southern Spain- that in semiarid regions
    like Andalusia the majority of diurnal rainfall events occurs with high relative
    humidity values (higher than 75–80%) and low “clearness” index values (KT). This
    index was introduced by Allen (1996) and Estévez (2008) proposed that a diurnal
    event would be true if, on average, KT < 0.5 and RH > 80% during the event time
    period. This test is very useful in agrometeorological networks, where the weather
    stations are located covering irrigation areas, because rain gauges can receive
    water from sprinkler irrigation systems or can register pulses because of some
    farm work machinery being near the station. Fig. 4 shows the evolution of several
    meteorological parameters on a typical irrigation day, when precipitation records
    occurred between 7 h and 10.30 h, under clear-sky conditions (KT > 0.5) and when
    relative humidity values were lower than 60%. This false rainfall event was due
    to an irrigation event. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Semihourly
    evolution of relative humidity (RHsh), global radiation (Rssh), expected global
    radiation under clear sky conditions (Rso), precipitation (Psh) and “clearness”
    index (KT) at “Córdoba” station during an irrigation day. 2.2.4. Persistence test
    or time series consistency test This test checks the variability of the measurements.
    When a sensor fails it will often report a constant value, thus the standard deviation
    will become low. When the sensor is out for an entire reporting period, its standard
    deviation will be zero. In Shafer et al. (2000), the persistence test checks an
    entire day’s data from one station, one parameter at a time. The mean and standard
    deviation for that parameter are computed. If the standard deviation is below
    an acceptable minimum, the corresponding data values are flagged as suspect. Because
    the persistence test uses aggregate statistics, it cannot discern which observations
    within the time period are responsible for this alert. So, all data for that period
    are flagged as suspect or warning. A “delta test” is also used to check the largest
    difference between any pair of observations within a selected time range, usually
    24 h (Shafer et al., 2000, Fiebrich and Crawford, 2001, Schroeder et al., 2005).
    If the difference is less than a minimum acceptable change, all data for the corresponding
    day are flagged. A test called “flatliner check” has been used for temperature,
    which analyzes data values of five consecutive days (Reek et al., 1992, Kunkel
    et al., 1998). For the rest of meteorological measurements, excluding precipitation,
    Meek and Hatfield (1994) proposed a continual no-observed-change in time limit
    and it was applied in this work for different variables (Table 3). A specific
    test for relative humidity is proposed by Zahumensky (2004), checking on a minimum
    required variability of instantaneous values during a certain time period. A possible
    limit for 30 min period is proposed as (7) σ RH sh > 0.01 where σRHsh is the daily
    standard deviation of semihourly data of relative humidity. 2.2.5. Spatial consistency
    test These tests are designed to detect gross errors in individual observations.
    They are based on the comparison of data from one station with corresponding values
    of surrounding stations (Wade, 1987, Gandin, 1988, Eischeid et al., 1995, Hubbard,
    2001). More subtle errors are identified through manual inspection. In the test
    proposed by Shafer et al. (2000), observations are weighted according to their
    distance from the station being evaluated. The difference between the observed
    and estimated value is compared to the standard deviation, flagging as being suspect
    any observation whose difference exceeds twice the standard deviation. To apply
    this test properly, at least six weather stations are necessary. This procedure
    is based on the Barnes algorithm (Barnes, 1964), also used for meteorological
    variables measured as a higher sample rate (Schroeder et al., 2005). The majority
    of algorithms employed to estimate values at a station from data of neighboring
    stations are based on the inverse distance weighting technique. This technique
    weights the values at surrounding stations according to the inverse of the distance
    separating the locations (Isaaks and Srivastava, 1989). The problem is that the
    nearest station does not always register the closest value. It depends on terrain
    topography and the particular variability of each meteorological parameter (Wade,
    1987, Guttman et al., 1988). Recently, Hubbard et al. (2005) developed a new test
    called the spatial regression test. It is based on weighting data of each station
    according to the root-mean-square error, improving the results of those based
    on distance for variables like maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation
    (Hubbard and You, 2005). This test checks that the variable falls inside the confidence
    interval formed from estimates based on N “best fit” neighboring stations during
    a time period of length n, which was taken as 24 days for this study, and N was
    set to 8. The algorithm applied to temperature data is shown in Table 3. Feng
    et al. (2004) applied a similar spatial consistency test for several climate variables.
    3. Quality control The results of running the procedures on the dataset for each
    climate variable are reported below and they are summarized in Table 4. A previous
    analysis of meteorological database for detecting gaps was necessary before applying
    quality control tests. In this sense, no trend is observed, 2005 and 2006 being
    the years with fewer gaps. Table 4. Percentage of flagged meteorological data

    “Puebla de Cazalla” (Sevilla) was the only one weather station where the fixed
    range test detected a daily value outside the range. Therefore, only this solar
    radiation datum was rejected by this test, representing approximately 0.05% of
    the fraction errors caught by this procedure in that station, and 0.001% on average.
    The rest of the daily solar radiation data (89 stations) were not flagged. Similar
    results were obtained after applying this test to semihourly data. Only 14 values
    were flagged for “Tíjola” (Almeria) station, corresponding to 0.016% of solar
    radiation data at this station. The average percentage of flagged daily solar
    radiation data after application of dynamic range test was 0.34%, with a maximum
    of 11.80% for “Las Cabezas de San Juan” (Sevilla) station. 30 of the 90 stations
    do not generate any alert using this test. The majority of values out of range
    were detected in 2005, due to the non calibration of pyranometers as a consequence
    of silicon photocell aging. The average percent for semihourly solar radiation
    data flagged by dynamic range test was 0.80%, with a maximum of 7.04% for the
    same station as in daily validation. All stations had flagged semihourly values,
    with a standard deviation of 1.10%. The majority of flagged data, as in the daily
    validation process, was detected in 2005. These results indicate that the percentage
    of semihourly flagged data detected by this test was more than twice those found
    in the daily dataset. The increase in measured semihourly solar radiation data
    to above the Rso envelope is caused by the reflection of direct beam radiation
    from nearby clouds (Allen, 1996, ASCE-EWRI, 2005). This phenomenon and the model
    mismatch to estimate this envelope (especially at sunrise and sunset) caused that
    semihourly flagged data fraction to be higher than the daily fraction. This dynamic
    test has been frequently used to verify the integrity of solar radiation data
    before use them to estimate other variables. Jensen et al. (1997) and Allen (2000)
    remarked on the usefulness of this test to check pyranometers measurements before
    estimating ET0. Other authors reported some limitations caused by uncertainty
    atmosphere turbidity (Irmak et al., 2003) or the degree of cloudiness during summer
    months (Yoder et al., 2005), especially in humid climates. Nevertheless, these
    authors point out draft its great utility as a previous step to estimate net radiation.
    In quantitative terms, there are no similar studies that apply this kind of test
    to a wide weather station network. Geiger et al. (2002) applied a similar procedure
    for daily data to only one station, resulting in 0.11% of flagged data, a similar
    percentage to many stations analyzed in this work. Meek and Hatfield (1994) applied
    a test based on a different envelope solar radiation for clear-sky conditions
    (Howell et al., 1984), obtaining 7% of flagged data for hourly data and no daily
    flagged data for two stations. A step test applied to semihourly data was able
    to detect 0.1% of anomalous values, with a maximum of 0.24% in “Jerez del Marquesado”
    (Granada) station. On average, 0.01% of daily solar radiation data were flagged
    by a persistence test. Only four stations had flagged data, “Almonte” (Huelva)
    being the weather station with the highest percentage of flagged data (0.82%).
    Finally, no semihourly data were flagged by the persistence test (Table 4). These
    percentages are similar to those obtained by Meek and Hatfield (1994) after analyzing
    two stations. In their work, the persistence test for hourly data did not detect
    flagged data either, and fewer records were flagged by step test, like the present
    study. Similarly, all daily data correctly passed the persistence test, like 86
    of the 90 stations analyzed in this paper. 3.2. Relative humidity The fixed range
    test flagged only RHx data, no errors for RHn, RHm and RHsh data were detected
    (Table 4). These flagged data fell between 100% and 103%, indicating an incoherent
    meteorological record, but a correct functioning of the HUMICAP probe sensor (Table
    1). These values were corrected to the maximum physic value of relative humidity
    (100%). As expected in a semiarid region, only a few RH data were flagged by this
    test. The average percentage of RHx data flagged was 0.07%, “Lepe” (Huelva) being
    the location with the maximum percentage (1.63%). No outliers were found in 69
    weather stations. The greatest percentage of flagged data by internal consistency
    tests was detected for RHx (0.044% on average), “Padul” (Granada) being the station
    with the highest percentage (0.649%). There were 43 weather stations without RHx
    flagged data after applying internal consistency tests. The average percentage
    of RHn flagged data was 0.007%, with a maximum (0.240%) found in “Guillena” (Sevilla)
    station, and there were 83 locations without flagged data. The percentages of
    RHm flagged data were lower, with only 2 stations with alerts. These results are
    in accordance with Feng et al. (2004) for RHm, in which the total of flagged data
    for the network studied by this kind of procedure was 0.0039%. Throughout the
    time period analyzed, no trend was observed for percentages of flagged data. The
    highest percentage of data flagged by persistence test was obtained for RHx, with
    an average equal to 0.252% corresponding to all stations and the highest value
    detected in “Isla Mayor” (Sevilla) station (16.019%). All RHx flagged data ranged
    from 90% and 100%. In this range, the sensor response is low due to hysteresis
    phenomena. In this case, there is a slight increasing trend of flagged data percentage
    through the years. Results obtained for RHn and RHm were similar and only data
    from four weather stations were flagged. In addition, this persistence test flagged
    0.09% RHsh data, with the highest percentage detected in “Puebla de Guzmán” (Huelva)
    station (1.53%). No errors were detected in 32 stations of the network. These
    results, on average, are similar to those reported by Graybeal et al. (2004a)
    for hourly data (0.1%). Finally, results obtained after applying the step test
    were the lowest percentages, 0.002% on average and 0.021% of flagged data as the
    maximum in “Higuera Arjona” (Jaén) station. No records were flagged by this test
    in 55 weather stations, the majority of errors being associated with rain events,
    and, consequently, to high values of relative humidity, of over 90%. 3.3. Wind
    speed No data were flagged applying the range test defined by fixed limits. Nevertheless,
    internal consistency routines together with step and persistence tests were able
    to detect anomalous data (Table 4). For maximum wind speed (Ux) values, the average
    percentage of flagged data by an internal consistency test was 0.32%, with the
    highest percentage (2.79%) detected in “Almuñécar” (Granada) location and there
    were 11 stations with no errors found. The average percentage of flagged data
    for daily wind speed was 0.01%, with the highest percentage (0.65%) detected in
    “Padul” (Granada) station. Results obtained for semihourly data were similar to
    percentages of detected errors described by DeGaetano (1997) for hourly data.
    In general, the percentages of daily flagged data for wind speed are higher than
    those reported by Feng et al. (2004) and Schroeder et al. (2005). On average,
    all wind speed data passed the step test satisfactorily, only some daily data
    from “Jimena de la Frontera” (Cádiz) station were flagged (0.09%). These results
    obtained for the step test are similar to those reported by Meek and Hatfield
    (1994). Only 0.12% of semihourly wind speed data were flagged by persistence test,
    with no errors found in 40 stations. Percentages of flagged data for maximum and
    mean daily wind speed were, on average, 0.05% and 0.04% respectively, with the
    highest percentages being detected in “Almuñécar” (Granada) station. Visual inspection
    applied to wind speed data from this station showed a constant value for a time
    period corresponding to maintenance routines of technicians. Meek and Hatfield
    (1994) reported no errors detected by this test for daily data and 0.3% of flagged
    data for hourly values. However, Schroeder et al. (2005) described similar results
    to the present study (0.07%). 3.4. Air temperature The application of the range
    test to air temperature data did not flag any values, as can be seen in Table
    4. However, results from the internal consistency test showed, on average, 0.012%
    of anomalous daily maximum data and 0.091% as the highest percentage of flagged
    data in “La Puebla del Rio II” (Sevilla) station, no errors being identified in
    69 stations. These results are slightly higher than those reported by Feng et
    al. (2004) in 726 weather stations and very similar to those obtained by Reek
    et al. (1992) in 138 stations (0.019%). The average percentage of flagged minimum
    air temperature data was 0.005%, with the maximum percentage obtained in “Adra”
    (Almería) station (0.175%) and no errors detected in 85 stations. For semihourly
    temperature data, 0.11% of them, on average, were flagged by step test, with the
    maximum percentage detected in “Úbeda” (Jaén) station. Similar results for this
    test were reported by different authors (Eskridge et al., 1995, Kunkel et al.,
    1998 and Graybeal et al., 2004a), the percentages described by Meek and Hatfield
    (1994) being nearly equal in two stations (0.1%). This last work reported the
    same results for the persistence test as those obtained in the present study (no
    erroneous data detected). The spatial consistency procedure conducted for air
    temperature data (Tx, Tm and Tn) in this study was the spatial regression weighted
    estimate (Hubbard et al., 2005), with characteristics that make it possible to
    build statistical confidence intervals for testing data at the target station.
    Results from the application of this test at two stations are shown in Fig. 5a
    and b. The spatial analysis at “Los Molares” (Sevilla) station indicated that
    approximately 1% of the data would be flagged for maximum, minimum and average
    temperature if f values ranged from 1.7 to 2.5. However, at “Belmez” (Córdoba)
    station, f should be higher than 3.5 to detect the same percentage of potential
    errors. This different behavior is due to “Los Molares” (Sevilla) station being
    surrounded by nearby stations with similar characteristics, all of them located
    in the lower region of Guadalquivir valley. The reverse occurs at “Belmez” (Córdoba)
    station, mainly for being an isolated station, the only one located in the Northern
    Province of Córdoba. A more detailed explanation of the methodology and parameters
    employed in the spatial consistency test are reported by Estévez (2008) and its
    application to other climate data (Estévez and Gavilán, 2006). Nevertheless, percentages
    of flagged data (at f = 3) by this test are reported in Table 4. These results,
    on average, are similar to those reported by Hubbard et al. (2005) for maximum
    and minimum temperature under a variety of climate conditions. Download : Download

    fraction of all data flagged for maximum, minimum and mean temperature for the
    values of f shown at “Los Molares (Sevilla)” (a) and “Belmez (Córdoba)” (b) stations.
    3.5. Precipitation The range test applied to precipitation data for daily and
    semihourly values only identified erroneous values in “Tíjola” (Almería) station,
    for both types of records (Table 4). Only three values from more than seven million
    records were flagged for semihourly data. For the daily time step, only one precipitation
    datum was identified as being erroneous, corresponding to the same date of semihourly
    data flagged. Fig. 6 shows the evolution of some variables at this station for
    the date marked after range test application. Visual inspection and information
    from routine maintenance schedule were very useful for checking some alerts generated
    by the quality control system. In this case, the outliers detected by the range
    test were due to operational procedures to check whether the rain gauge was working
    properly during the maintenance works. Similar results were reported by Reek et
    al. (1992) and some works with no data flagged by this test were reported by Meek
    and Hatfield (1994) and Feng et al. (2004). Download : Download full-size image

    on 2002/04/26. Results obtained from internal consistency test showed a maximum
    percentage of errors (0.372%) at the Córdoba station, where the sprinkler irrigations
    frequently causing these “false positives” is a well known fact, due to irrigation
    water being received by the rain gauges. In addition, 0.015% of data were flagged
    on average by this test, with no erroneous values identified in 36 weather stations.
    Vibration of farm machinery near the station can also record accidental pulses
    in the rain gauge. These input values are stored as precipitation data, although
    they do not correspond to rain, so it is necessary to correct them in order to
    prevent their inclusion in the soil water balance. 4. Summary and conclusions
    A growing number of climate change and variability studies, as well as applied
    research towards improving engineering design climatographies, require high-quality
    meteorological data. It is known that long-term and extreme-value climate data
    sets are necessary for accurate and reliable estimates and assessments, being
    the validation of these data necessary for present and future uses. Several quality
    assurance procedures have been introduced for assessing integrity of meteorological
    data from automated weather station networks for hydrological, agricultural and
    other applications. Range, step, internal consistency, persistence and spatial
    consistency tests have been applied to the 1999–2006 dataset in the Andalusia
    region (southern Spain). The results of applying different validation tests reveal
    the existence of erroneous and potentially inaccurate data in the two databases
    validated (daily and semihourly). The temporal analysis of flagged data identified
    by these procedures and the use of dynamically generated control charts have allowed
    the making of such important decisions as the replacement of sensors or debugging
    of flagged records before being made available to users. Moreover, these guidelines
    have been presented for assessing quality of climate data, in science, as a prerequisite
    to their use for the estimation of environmental parameters or their introduction
    as baseline data in climate change or hydrological models. High quality data sources
    are vital to scientists, engineers, and decision makers alike. All the recommended
    guidelines are simple and straightforward to use and serve as preliminary filters
    with which to scrutinize weather measurements. The purpose of using quality assurance
    flags is to provide guidance to those who use data from the Agroclimatic Information
    Network of Andalusia. Because no data are altered, the user can make the final
    judgment as to their quality. Finally, constant improvement of the quality assurance
    procedures is necessary according to the latest available technology and techniques
    in data analysis, this validation data being only part of the quality management
    system, also composed of sensor calibration, field maintenance routines and manual
    inspection. Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Spanish National Institute

    Citations Explore all metrics Abstract Jojoba Israel is a world-leading producer
    of Jojoba products, whose orchards are covered with sensors that collect soil
    moisture data for monitoring plant needs at real-time. Based on these data, the
    company’s agronomist defines a weekly irrigation plan. In addition, data on weather,
    irrigation, and yield are recorded from other sources (e.g. meteorological station
    and irrigation-plan records). However, so far, there has been no attempt to use
    the entire set of collected data to reveal insights and interesting relationships
    between different variables, such as soil, weather, irrigation characteristics,
    and resulting yield. By integrating and utilizing data from different sources,
    our research aims at using the collected data not only for monitoring and controlling
    the crop, but also for predicting irrigation recommendations. In particular, a
    dataset was constructed by integrating data collected over almost two years from
    22 soil-sensors spread in four major plots (which are divided into 28 subplots
    and eight irrigation groups), from a meteorological station, and from actual irrigation
    records. Different regression and classification algorithms were applied on this
    dataset to develop models that were able to predict the weekly irrigation plan
    as recommended by the agronomist. The models were developed using eight different
    subsets of variables to determine which variables consistently contributed to
    prediction accuracy. By comparing the resulting models, it was shown that the
    best regression model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees, with 93% accuracy,
    and the best classification model was the Boosted Tree Classifier, with 95% accuracy
    (on the test-set). Data that were not contributing to the model prediction success
    rate were identified as well. The resulting model can significantly facilitate
    the agronomist’s irrigation planning process. In addition, the potential of applying
    machine learning on the company data for yield and disease prediction is discussed.

    2020 Introduction Recent developments in the fields of wireless sensor networks,
    satellite imagery technology, smart agricultural machinery, and ubiquitous mobile
    communication, together forming the Internet of things (IoT), have led many farms
    to adopt precision agriculture (PA) and become ‘smart farms’ (Castle et al. 2015;
    Zhang et al. 2002). Nevertheless, it seems that still, in many of these smart
    farms, data gathered from different sources are analyzed separately and the potential
    of value extraction from existing data is not fully realized (Sørensen et al.
    2010). In addition, collected data are mainly used for purposes of monitoring
    and controlling crops, e.g., by responding to soil moisture levels or disease
    symptoms (Damas et al. 2001; de Miranda 2003; Evans and Bergman 2007; Yunseop
    et al. 2008; Vellidis et al. 2016). Against this background, the present study
    shows that data integrated from different sources could be also exploited for
    predicting agronomist irrigation recommendations. This study was conducted in
    collaboration with Jojoba Israel, one of the world’s leading producers of Jojoba
    oils, as well as a leader in the use of sensor-based agriculture. The orchards
    of Jojoba Israel are covered by sensors that collect soil and plant-related data,
    which are used for monitoring the state of plants at real-time. Additionally,
    the company’s agronomist (hereinafter, the agronomist) uses these data, while
    also considering meteorological data collected from a meteorological station and
    weather forecasts, to construct a weekly irrigation plan for each plot. A common
    approach for deciding on irrigation amounts is to use the Penman–Monteith equation,
    which approximates net evapotranspiration (ET), given daily mean temperature,
    wind speed, relative humidity, and solar radiation, as defined by the Food and
    Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the FAO-56 standard (Allen 1998). However, since
    all the equation parameters are measured by the meteorological station for the
    entire plantation (rather than for each plot), the agronomist can calculate a
    single ET value for all plots, which would lead to a single irrigation recommendation
    for all plots. The agronomist combines this ET value with other measured parameters
    and plot-related characteristics to determine plot-specific irrigation quantities,
    resulting in different irrigation quantities for different subplots. The decision
    process is conducted ‘manually’, i.e. it is based on no explicit irrigation model
    but rather on the tacit knowledge of the agronomist, who examines the plant and
    soil conditions, as reflected in the sensor-based data, and decides accordingly.
    In fact, there is no recommended model for Jojoba irrigation in the literature
    and the irrigation decision process in Jojoba Israel has changed significantly
    over the years, resulting in a steady increase of yield. The goal of this study
    was to develop a model that captures the unstructured decision process of the
    agronomist. This objective was achieved by applying machine learning (ML) on an
    integrated dataset, comprising sensor-based moisture data, meteorological data,
    and actual irrigation plans defined by the agronomist in the past, in order to
    learn his irrigation decision-making process. Various models for irrigation decision
    support exist in the literature. These models are used for different purposes,
    such as optimizing the allocation of water under different constraints (e.g. Lilburne
    et al. 1998), determining irrigation needs (e.g. Thysen and Detlefsen 2006; Jensen
    et al. 2000), scheduling (e.g. Vellidis et al. 2013), and recording water consumption
    (e.g., Mateos et al. 2002). Only few of the irrigation decision-support models
    use ML. For example, Liu et al. (2006) used a genetic algorithm to optimize water
    allocation for a single crop in different growing periods and for numerous types
    of crops, given the water cost, market price of the crops, additional costs of
    irrigation, crop expenses, and expected yield reduction because of under-irrigation
    or over-irrigation in the entire growing period. The resulting optimization models
    were incorporated in a decision support system (DSS) for precision irrigation.
    These models, however, did not account for plot-specific characteristics. The
    literature also includes models for determining irrigation needs based on plot-specific
    data. For example, Hedley et al. (2013) used ML to predict soil water status and
    water table depth based on electromagnetic mapping. Smith and Peng (2009) used
    ML to classify soil textural composition based on soil-sensor data to inform a
    deficit irrigation control system. Another approach to infer plant water status
    is based on infographics. For example, Murase et al. (1995) used a layered neural
    network to identify plant water status based on the textural features of the pictorial
    information of the plant canopy. In many of the existing models (whether they
    use ML or not), decision support is based on providing the farmer with simple
    water balance models (e.g. based on the Penman–Monteith equation) that are subjected
    to capacity constraints and allowing the farmer to simulate different irrigation
    alternatives and assess their implications. The support of these models is also
    based on displaying the farmer information on plant and soil status that is required
    for irrigation decision making. A different approach, found in the literature,
    is to model the actual decision-making process of the farmer. For example, Labbé
    et al. (2000) modeled the irrigation decision making process of farmers for limited
    water allocation and irrigation scheduling for corn. The model consisted of irrigation
    management rules for different irrigation-related tasks that were derived from
    surveys of farmers and based on monitoring their irrigation practices during a
    period of 2 years. This model was incorporated in a simulator engine that, given
    the decision context, was able to predict irrigation schedules and irrigation
    volumes with average error ranging between 6 and 13 mm for different farmers,
    reflecting an error below 6.7%. Instead of manually developing a model that captures
    the farmer’s decision process using surveys and observations, in this study, ML
    was used to capture the agronomist’s irrigation decision process. The potential
    of using ML to forecast future farmer decisions was identified by Andriyas and
    McKee (2013). In particular, they tried to model the farmer’s decision of whether
    or not to irrigate for three crops: alfalfa, barley, and corn. Whereas their work
    focused on whether to irrigate or not, our work is aimed at predicting the required
    irrigation quantities. As mentioned above, a model that captures the unstructured
    decision process of the agronomist was developed in this study. To find the best
    model, various models, developed using different ML techniques and different subsets
    of the independent variables, were compared. Thus, the model can automatically
    recommend an irrigation plan (the dependent variable) and can be therefore used
    to support irrigation decisions and increase the efficiency of the irrigation
    planning process. Achieving the objective of this study would potentially contribute
    to the literature in three ways. First, the study offers an irrigation recommendation
    model that is able to automatically recommend irrigation quantities similar to
    the expert agronomist, while accounting for plot-specific data. Automating the
    irrigation planning process of the agronomist can reduce his workload and increase
    his efficiency. Thus, the irrigation planning process can be effortlessly replicated
    to additional orchards or be carried out more often. In addition, the agronomist
    can use the model to fine-tune and validate his irrigation decisions. Second,
    the study may provide insights into the variables that contribute to the irrigation
    recommendation prediction model and should, therefore, be collected and accounted
    for in similar analyses. Third, the study may provide insights into the ML techniques
    that are most suitable for constructing irrigation recommendation models. The
    rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section, the data
    sources and research method employed to develop the prediction models are presented.
    In addition, background on the relevant ML methods is provided. Then, the resulting
    models are presented, followed by a discussion of the results and comparison of
    the models. Finally, conclusions are provided and opportunities for developing
    other prediction models (for disease and yield prediction) based on an integrated
    dataset are discussed. Materials and methods The following subsections describe
    the data sources analyzed in this study, followed by the various steps comprising
    the research method. The study followed a typical data mining process (Fayyad
    1996), which included the stages of dataset definition, extraction-transformation-loading
    (ETL), application of ML algorithms to the dataset to train recommendation models,
    evaluation of the trained models, and selection of the best prediction model.
    Figure 1 presents the steps of the research method, which are elaborated in the
    following subsections. Fig. 1 Research process Full size image Data sources Data
    from various sources were integrated in this study. Soil moisture data were collected
    from uMANAGE™ 1—a real-time, web-based crop management system, connected to different
    types of sensors. As shown in Fig. 2, the study focused on four major plots, in
    which data had been collected since 2014. Each plot was characterized by the planting
    year (age), the type of planting (seeds or clones), whether the planting was organic
    or not, and the soil type. Each plot was further divided into 4–10 subplots that
    were separately irrigated. There were eight groups of subplots that were irrigated
    together, and each subplot was part of a specific group (the borders of each irrigation
    group are highlighted). Each subplot was also associated with one of eleven transmission
    stations, which transmitted data from two moisture sensors, located at two depths,
    shallow (less than 0.4 m underground) and deep (more than 0.4 m underground).
    In total, data were collected from 28 subplots of land, covered by 22 moisture
    sensors. Fig. 2 Jojoba Israel - plots divided into irrigation groups and subplots,
    transmission stations (each with two sensors), and meteorological station Full
    size image Apart from sensor-based moisture data, meteorological data were also
    gathered from a nearby meteorological station (marked by a blue star in Fig. 2),
    namely, data on air temperature, solar radiation, and air humidity. The plots
    were all within 1–2 km away from the meteorological station. Forecast archives
    were not available to provide the forecasting data available at the time of decision-making;
    instead, weekly average forecasts of temperature, humidity, and radiation were
    estimated by averaging the actual temperature, radiation, and humidity measured
    in the following week. Using actual data was considered satisfactory for our purpose
    because weather forecasts in this area (the city of Be’er-Sheva) are considered
    accurate (e.g. the standard error in temperature forecasts is 1 °C, according
    to the Israel Meteorological Service). Weekly irrigation plans, created by the
    agronomist and recorded in excel sheets, were also used. The dataset contained
    data that were gathered from March 2014 until the end of 2015. Dataset definition
    In this step, the structure of the dataset for model training and testing was
    defined. The dataset combined data from the sources listed above. The variables
    characterizing the dataset observations, commonly referred to as ‘observation
    features’, are presented in Table 1. Features that were gathered from uMANAGE
    (every 15 min) and from the meteorological station (every 20 min) were averaged
    or summed to represent a granularity of one week. Table 1 Dataset features Full
    size table Data extraction, transformation, and loading After the dataset structure
    was defined, the relevant data were processed following the ETL process—they were
    extracted from their sources, cleaned and transformed into the required features,
    and finally were loaded to a flat table. This ETL process is summarized next.
    Sensor data When sensors are used, noisy data is often a problem. To clean the
    data, following guidelines provided by the agronomist, moisture values smaller
    than 17 or higher than 39%, considered abnormal, were filtered out. In the complete
    dataset, such anomalies, likely to be caused by a faulty or uncalibrated sensor
    or transmitter, occurred only twice. In these two instances, the values were replaced
    by using spatial mean imputation (Kennedy and Tobler 1983), i.e. by the average
    of the values gathered from the two nearest sensors. Weekly soil moisture averages
    were then calculated for each irrigation group. Moisture sensors were located
    in two depths: deep (deeper than 0.4 m) and shallow (less than 0.4 m deep). Thus,
    two weekly moisture averages were calculated—one for each depth. In addition,
    for each irrigation group at each depth, the duration (in days), in which the
    soil was saturated (moisture level was higher than 27%, as determined by the agronomist)
    and drought-stressed (moisture level was lower than 20%, as determined by the
    agronomist) over the preceding week were calculated. These durations were represented
    as integers (1–7 days). The reason for aggregating data on a weekly basis was
    that the irrigation planning process was carried out once a week, based on data
    collected over the previous week. Meteorological data Average air temperature,
    humidity, and radiation over the preceding week and during the preceding day were
    calculated based on data that were gathered from the nearby meteorological station
    (Fig. 2), which measured these values every 20 min. Averages were calculated over
    the entire day. Additionally, these data were used to estimate the weekly average
    forecasts of temperature, humidity, and radiation by averaging the actual temperature,
    radiation, and humidity that were measured in the week for which the irrigation
    plan was prepared. Other attributes Each row of the dataset captured the above
    week-level data for a particular irrigation group (there were eight groups) in
    a particular week and year. Each row also included the characteristics of the
    irrigation group: the plot it belonged to (determining the soil type), whether
    it was organic or not, and the actual irrigation quantity in millimeters (mm),
    which served as the dependent variable. The resulting dataset included 695 records,
    representing a period of 98 weeks. This dataset was then segmented into training
    and validation sets: 70% of the records (randomly selected) were defined as the
    training-set and used to train the models, and the remaining records (30%) were
    defined as the test-set and used to evaluate the performance of the model. Machine
    learning methods The field of machine learning (ML) is concerned with the question
    of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience
    (Mitchell 1997). A primary goal of ML is the construction of algorithms that can
    learn from data and make predictions using data. Usually, these algorithms use
    a large set of input observations, called a training-set, in order to tune the
    parameters of an adaptive model (Bishop 2006, p. 2). ML algorithms aim at various
    tasks, including Regression—a process for estimating the relationships between
    a dependent variable and one or more independent variables; Classification—a process
    of identifying to which category, out of a given set of categories (classes),
    an observation belongs to, based on a training-set of previously classified observations;
    Clustering—a process of dividing a set of observations into a number of groups
    (clusters), such that observations grouped in the same cluster are more similar
    to each other than to those in other clusters (according to a given similarity
    function); and Association rule learning—a statistical process of identifying
    strong interesting relationships (rules) between variables based on large sets
    of observations (Liu 2011). In the present study, regression and classification
    models were developed to predict the irrigation volumes recommended by the agronomist
    (in the case of classification models, observations were classified into five
    irrigation level classes). In the following subsections, these types of models
    are presented. Regression models A regression task can be defined as follows:
    Given a training set comprising N observations of an input variable X, written
    X ≡ (X1,…, XN)T, together with corresponding observations of the values of a target
    variable t ≡ (t1,…, tN)T, the goal is to exploit the training set in order to
    make predictions of the value t’ of the target variable for some new value X’
    of the input variable. X is in fact a vector of D features (x1,…,xD) characterizing
    each observation. A simple approach for handling this task is to use linear regression
    (Mitchell 1997, p. 237; Bishop 2006, p. 5), where a function \(y\left( {X,W} \right)
    = w_{0} + w_{1} x^{1} + w_{2} x^{2} + \ldots + w_{D} x^{D} = \mathop \sum \limits_{i
    = 1}^{D} w_{i} x^{i}\) is fitted to the training set, by finding the W that minimizes
    a loss function that measures the misfit between the function y(X,W) and the training
    set data points. The root-mean-squared error (RSME) is commonly used to measure
    the misfit. The advantage of the linear regression model is that it can be used
    to explain the effect of different factors (feature values) on the target (dependent)
    variable. A more advanced approach to regression is regression trees. Regression
    trees models (Loh 2011), similar to linear regression, are used to predict the
    value of the dependent variable, given a new data sample. However, different from
    linear regression, regression trees algorithms do not try to capture a linear
    relationship between the model features and the target variable. Instead, they
    are based on decision trees. A decision tree is a tree-graph, in which each internal
    node (i.e. a vertex with outgoing edges) is labeled with an input feature and
    the edges coming from the node are labeled with each of the possible values of
    that feature. Observations are sorted according to their feature values from the
    root of the tree downwards to the leaves. While in decision tree classifiers,
    each leaf (i.e. a vertex without outgoing edges) is labeled with a name of a class
    to which observations may belong, in regression trees, each leaf is labeled with
    a target value, which is the average of target-variable values of observations
    assigned to that leaf. For additional information on regression tree see (Loh
    2011; Bishop 2006, p. 663). In this study, a regression tree model, called gradient
    boosted regression trees (GBRT), is used. The GBRT is a type of additive model
    that makes predictions by combining decisions from a sequence of base regression
    tree models (Elith et al. 2008). Unlike random forest (Breiman 2001), a ML approach
    that constructs a multitude of decision trees independently, each using a subsample
    of data, and returns the mean prediction of the individual trees, GBRT uses a
    particular model ensemble technique called gradient boosting, which iteratively
    builds a model, while improving the performance of the previous iteration model.
    This model ensemble can be written formally as g(x) = f 0 (x) + f 1 (x) + f 2
    (x) + …, where regression tree g(x) is a sum of base regression trees f i . The
    name Gradient Boosting comes from the association of this method with Gradient
    Descent optimization (Elith et al. 2008), commonly used to solve linear regression
    problems by finding a local minimum of the linear regression loss function (Bishop
    2006). Similarly, let \(g_{t} \left( x \right) = \mathop \sum \limits_{i = 0}^{t
    - 1} f_{i} \left( x \right) = g_{t - 1} \left( x \right) + f_{t} \left( x \right)\)
    be the regression tree trained at iteration t, L[y i ,g(x i )] be the loss function,
    and N be the number of observations, at each gradient boosting iteration, the
    algorithm finds a regression tree f t , which moves g t towards the negative gradient
    direction −∂L/∂g by η (step-size) amount. Hence, f t is chosen to be \(f_{t} =
    \mathop {\text{argmin}}\limits_{f} \mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{N} \left\{ {\frac{{\partial
    L\left[ {y_{i} ,g\left( {x_{i} } \right)} \right]}}{{\partial g\left( {x_{i} }
    \right)}} - f(x_{i} )} \right\}^{2}\) and the algorithm sets g t+1 = g t  + ηf
    t . Since for regression problems with sum-squared loss function ∂L/∂g = y i  −
    g(x i ), f t can be written as follows: $$f_{t} = \mathop {\text{argmin}}\limits_{f}
    \mathop \sum \limits_{i = 1}^{N} [y_{i} - g\left( {x_{i} } \right) - f(x_{i} )]^{2}.$$
    GBRT is considered as one of the most effective and popular models for prediction
    (Cai et al. 2016). However, as opposed to linear regression or simple decision
    trees, which are easy to interpret, GBRT-based regression trees are more difficult
    to interpret, being a collection of many regression trees. Classification models
    Unlike regression tasks, in which the output variable is continuous, the output
    of classification tasks is one of a finite number of discrete categories. A classification
    task can be defined as follows: Given a training set comprising N observations
    of variable X, written X ≡ (X1,…, XN)T, where Xi is a vector of D features (x1,…,xD),
    together with corresponding observations of the values of a target variable t
    ≡ (t1,…, tN)T, where ti may take one of |C| discrete values [C1, C2,.., C|C|],
    our goal is to use the training set to train a model that correctly predicts the
    class of some new observation X’. There are many types of classification models,
    including decision trees (Mitchell 1997, pp. 52–59), support vector machines (SVM)
    (Liu 2011, pp. 109–116), logistic regression (Mitchell 1997, pp. 205–207), and
    Bayesian procedures (Mitchell 1997, pp. 154–164). In this study, a particular
    classification algorithm, called boosted trees classifiers (BTC), is used. This
    algorithm is an extension of GBRT, discussed above, to classification problems
    (Mease et al. 2007). That is, instead of iteratively improving a regression tree
    model, a decision tree classifier is iteratively improved, by combining base-decision
    tree classifiers using the gradient boosting technique. Development of ML models
    Platform For the data analysis and model development, graphLab create of the Turi
    2 machine learning platform was used. GraphLab create is a python-based ML framework,
    which enables the development and deployment of intelligent applications and services.
    It includes libraries for data transformation and manipulation, as well as scalable
    ML toolkits for creating, evaluating, and visualizing ML models. It is built to
    handle large volumes of data (terabytes) efficiently and quickly. Selection of
    ML models For the development of the irrigation recommendation prediction model,
    different types of ML algorithms were examined: linear regression, regression
    trees, and classification algorithms. To select the particular algorithms for
    use in this study, a basic comparison process was carried out: First the integrated
    dataset was divided into training (70%) and test (30%) sets; Second, different
    ML algorithms were applied (with their default settings) on the training set to
    train different ML models; Finally, the performance of the resulting models were
    examined on the test-set and compared to one another. For regression trees, the
    following models were considered: Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression,
    and GBRT. The best model among these, in terms of RSME, was GBRT. Linear regression
    was selected as well due to its high interpretability and prevalence in the literature.
    For classification, the following classification models were compared: logistic
    classifier, decision tree classifier, random forest cassifier, and BTC. The best
    classier among these, in terms of classification accuracy, was BTC. Thus, three
    ML models were developed: Linear regression, BTC, and GBRT. Each of these models
    was developed on eight different subsets of the feature-set in order to find the
    best model. Using the entire set of features to develop a single model may lead
    to overfitting (Mitchell 1997, p. 67) and to models that are more difficult to
    explain. In addition, because of correlations among many of the features, it was
    necessary to search for the best subset of features, as described in the following
    section. Feature selection In ML, feature selection is the process of selecting
    a subset of the relevant features (i.e. the variables listed in Table 1) for use
    in model construction. For feature selection, the correlation between each pair
    of variables was first estimated. As could be expected, correlations among the
    different meteorological features were very high (for example, weekly averages
    and preceding-day averages were correlated for each of the measures, with correlation
    values exceeding 0.85), as were the correlations among sensor-related features
    (e.g. the correlations between saturation/drought durations and soil moisture
    levels were higher than 0.7). By contrast, the correlations between sensor- and
    meteorology-related features were relatively low (lower than 0.1). Thus, three
    groups of optional variables were defined: (1) IPPD weather (including average
    temperature, radiation, and humidity measured on the day preceding irrigation
    planning); (2) weather forecast (predicted temperature, radiation, and humidity
    for the following week); and (3) saturation/drought durations over the preceding
    week. Because each of these three variable groups could be either included or
    not in the feature set, eight (23) feature subsets were defined, as shown in Table
    2. Of the variables listed in Table 1, those that are not listed in Table 2 were
    included in all subsets. Each of the three ML models mentioned above was developed
    for each of the eight feature-subsets. Table 2 Feature sets for which ML models
    were developed Full size table Model evaluation measurements In the next section,
    the resulting models are presented and their ability to predict irrigation quantities
    (i.e. their ability to recommend a suitable irrigation plan) is evaluated. For
    the evaluation of regression models (linear regression and GBRT), successful predictions
    were defined as those in which the predicted value was not more than 0.2 mm below
    or above the actual value. To use classification (BTC), the dependent variable
    has to be categorical. The continuous irrigation variable was therefore binned
    into five classes, described in Table 3, which best captured the variance in this
    variable. These classes were then used as the predicted variable in BTC models.
    Successful prediction were defined as those in which classification was made to
    the correct irrigation class. Table 3 Irrigation classes Full size table Results
    Linear regression Linear regression was used with the eight datasets defined in
    Table 2. Each dataset was randomly divided into training and test sets, such that
    the training set contained 70% of the samples. Table 4 summarizes the performance
    of the eight linear regression models, showing for each the RSME, maximal error,
    maximal deviation rate (error/true value), and rate of successful predictions
    (those within a 0.2 mm deviation), in total and for each plot. Table 4 Performance
    of the simple linear regression models for the different datasets Full size table
    As can be seen in Table 4, Set 2 achieved the best results in terms of RSME (although
    RSME values for other models were quite similar), and Set 6 achieved the highest
    overall success rate (although a value of 52.3% success is considered relatively
    low). Table A1 (Appendix) presents the learned coefficients of the model developed
    for Set 2, which had the lowest RSME. Due to the relatively low success rates
    of the simple linear regression models, regression models that aimed at capturing
    non-linear relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable
    were also developed. For example, when plotting irrigation amounts against the
    temperature measured on the day preceding irrigation planning (Fig. 3), it can
    be seen that a square root function (√x) may better describe the relationship
    between irrigation and IPPD temperature. As another example, when plotting irrigation
    amounts against the week number, as shown in Fig. 4, it is easy to see that a
    quadratic function (x2) would be more suitable to describe the relationship. Fig.
    3 Irrigation against temperature measured on IPPD Full size image Fig. 4 Irrigation
    against week number Full size image Therefore, for each numeric feature x in the
    dataset, four new features were added: √x, x2, x3, and x4. The corresponding eight
    feature subsets were defined as before, but each subset was extended with the
    polynomial features. The linear regression algorithm was applied on each subset,
    resulting in eight new polynomial regression models. The performance measures
    of these models are summarized in Table 5. Table 5 Performance measures of the
    polynomial regression models Full size table Adding polynomial features improved
    the ability of the models to predict irrigation levels. The model for Set 5 (no
    drought/saturation data) achieved the lowest RSME value (0.38), which was superior
    to the lowest RSME value achieved without polynomial features (0.47 for Set 2).
    The highest total success rate with polynomial features was 62.8%, compared to
    52.3% without them, and the smallest maximal error without polynomial features
    was 2.02, compared to 2.32 without them. While adding polynomial features improved
    the prediction ability of the models to some extent, it had the negative implication
    of increasing the complexity of the model due to the addition of features (e.g.
    the model for Set 5 had 63 features). LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection
    operator), a method that performs both feature selection and regularization to
    enhance both the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the regression model
    (Zou 2006), was employed to eliminate variables. Its use, however, did not improve
    the performance of any of the models in terms of RSME and success rate. Gradient
    boosted regression trees Eight GBRT models were trained on the eight feature-sets
    (Set1–Set8), defined in Table 2. Each dataset was randomly divided into training
    and test sets, such that the training set contained 70% of the samples. Each model
    comprised a sequence of decision tree models. An example of one such tree appears
    in Fig. 5, which depicts one sub-tree of a collection of 50 trees that were learned
    for Set 2. The performance measures of GBRT models are summarized in Table 6.
    Fig. 5 An exemplary decision tree model, which was part of a GBRT model Full size
    image Table 6 Performance measures of GBRT models Full size table Compared to
    the linear regression models, GBRT models achieved considerably better results:
    the model for Set 1 achieved the lowest RSME (0.11), and the models for Set 1
    and Set 5 achieved the best success rate (92.7%). In other words, GBRT models
    were able predict the correct irrigation levels in 92.7% of the cases. The model
    for Set 1 also achieved the lowest maximal error, 0.64, with a maximal deviation
    rate of 21.5%. Set 2, which included no previous-day weather features, and Set
    4, which included no weather forecast features, had the lowest success rates.
    Boosted trees classifier The BTC, provided by GraphLab Create, was used with the
    different feature sets. Again, the training set included 70% of the samples, which
    were randomly selected. Each of the resulting models comprised a collection of
    trees that were learned on the basis of the corresponding set of features. Five
    classes were defined, corresponding to the five irrigation classes in Table 3.
    Table 7 summarizes the performance measures of the different classification models.
    The table includes measures that are different from those of the regression models:
    accuracy—the number of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions;
    precision—the average percentage of correctly classified items for all classes;
    recall—the average percentage of items classified as x out of the actual x items;
    F1-Score—a score that combines recall and precision, such that \(F1 = \frac{2
    \cdot precision \cdot recall }{precision + recall}\); and the precision and recall
    of each class separately (rate of correctly classified items). Table 7 Performance
    measures of BTC models Full size table The results show that the model for Set
    1 (based on the entire feature-set) outperformed the other models in almost all
    performance measures. Table 8 presents the performance of the classifier for this
    set, by showing the distribution of predicted labels against actual labels (confusion
    matrix). Table 8 Confusion matrix of the model for Set 1 Full size table Figure
    6 depicts the average success rates of GBRT and BTC models in each week. In can
    be seen in this figure that between weeks 34 and 40, there was a period of five
    weeks in which the success rate dropped for both models. The agronomist confirmed
    that the land was deliberately and forcefully dried during that period, because
    the Jojoba fruits were being collected around that time by combines that were
    unable to operate efficiently unless the soil was dry. Fig. 6 Average success
    rate of GBRT and BTC models per week Full size image The success rate values of
    linear regression (polynomial), GBRT and BTC models for each feature-set (Set
    1–Set 8) are summarized in Fig. 7. The best success rates among the BTC models
    (95% for Set 1) and among the GBRT models (92.7% for both Set 1 and Set 6) were
    significantly higher than the best success rate among the linear regression models
    (62.8% for ‘Set 5’). Fig. 7 Success rate of different models Full size image Discussion
    Comparing the results for the three ML techniques reveals that the non-parametric
    techniques, GBRT and BTC, achieve significantly better performance measures than
    linear regression, even after the inclusion of polynomial features as predicting
    variables. While it may be more difficult to interpret the non-parametric techniques,
    they are found in this study to be better for predicting irrigation. In general,
    tree-based models perform better than linear regression models when the relationship
    between the independent variables and the dependent variable is non-linear and
    non-monotonic. Therefore, it can be assumed that GBRT models would outperform
    linear regression models in predicting the recommended irrigation amounts of other
    crops, for which these amounts are affected by similar independent variables.
    These results conform to previous results by Hedley et al. (2013), who showed
    that random forest models (similar to GBRT and BTC, these are ensembles of decision
    trees) achieved superior predictions of soil moisture and water table depth than
    linear regression models. The results received in this study also conform to results
    by Andriyas and McKee (2013), who used different tree-based models for predicting
    a farmer’s decision of whether to irrigate or not, and showed that tree-based
    models were suitable for prediction farmer’s decisions of whether to irrigate
    or not with above 97% success rates for all decision tree models used. While BTC
    models achieve slightly better results than GBRT models (95 compared to 92.7%,
    respectively), GBRT models are recommended for predicting irrigation amounts because
    of their ability to provide accurate values (BTC models can only classify into
    classes). Reflecting on the results of GBRT models, it is interesting to see that
    while Set 1 achieved the best results in general (minimal RSME of 0.113, maximal
    error of 0.645, and success rate of 92.7%), Set 5, which included no saturation/drought
    data, achieved almost as good results (RSME of 0.116 and maximal error of 0.675).
    The same is true for the polynomial linear regression, where Set 5 achieved the
    best RSME. These findings raise questions about the importance of incorporating
    drought/saturation data in the model. When examining success rates, it is also
    interesting to see that Set 6, with included neither drought/saturation data nor
    IPPD weather data, achieved success rates that were similar to those of Set 1
    (92.7%). Questions on the importance of the different variables become even more
    interesting when considering the results for particular plots. For example, it
    can be seen in Table 6 that for plot ‘2004 east’, which is organic, Set 6 achieved
    the best prediction success rate. Set 1 achieved the best results for plot ‘2002’,
    and Sets 3 and 5 achieved the best results for plot ‘1999 seeds’. These findings
    imply that a contingency approach, by which different feature-sets are used for
    different plots, may prove to be the most valuable. Examining the success rates
    of GBRT and BTC models for Set 1 along the weeks of the year (Fig. 6) reveals
    that while both models achieved 100% accuracy in most weeks (more than 40 weeks
    of the year), there were a few occasional weeks, in which the accuracy of one
    of the models dropped. This finding suggests that it is beneficial to consider
    the results of both models when deciding on irrigation. When the results of one
    model contradict those of the other, it is worthwhile to involve an agronomist
    in resolving the discrepancies. In addition, there was a period of time (5 weeks
    starting at the end of August) in which the accuracy of both models dropped to
    50–80% due to deliberate and forceful soil drying, as noted above. It is expected
    that if data are collected over a longer period of time, this deliberate drying
    will be taken into account by the models. The high prediction success rates of
    GBRT and BTC models (93 and 95%, respectively) suggest that they indeed can serve
    to facilitate and even automate irrigation decisions. The agronomist can use the
    models developed in this study instead of analyzing data from different plots
    and subplots, including weather data and forecasts, on a weekly basis. With time,
    as more data samples are collected, the prediction errors are expected to decrease
    and the models are expected to produce decisions that are identical to those of
    the agronomist. For the agronomist to be able to effectively use these models
    for irrigation planning, they should be incorporated in a DSS that receives inputs
    from the uMANAGE system and from the meteorological services, that processes the
    inputs to fit the dataset structure described in Table 1 (this could be done on
    a daily basis—every day an observation that represents data of the previous seven
    days is added to the dataset), and that uses the models to predict the required
    irrigation quantities for the latest observation. Such a DSS would enable to increase
    the frequency of irrigation decisions so that decisions are based on more recent
    and accurate data and are able, for example, to better handle unexpected changes
    of weather. As discussed in the " Introduction" sect., the literature includes
    various models for irrigation decision support. While many of the existing models
    support farmers’ decisions by providing the farmer with simple water balance models
    (e.g. based on the Penman–Monteith equation) subjected to capacity constraints
    and by allowing the farmer to simulate different irrigation alternatives and assess
    their implications, the models developed in this study follow a different approach—they
    capture the actual decision-making process of the farmer. This approach has been
    used for example by Labbé et al. (2000), who modeled the decision making process
    of farmers for limited water allocation and irrigation scheduling for corn, based
    on surveys of farmers and based on monitoring their irrigation practices during
    a period of two years. Instead of manually modeling the decision making process
    of farmers by surveying them and observing their behavior, in this study, ML was
    used to automatically learn their decision-making process from past irrigation
    decisions. The development of ML-based models requires considerably less effort
    than manually modeling the decision-making process, without compromising prediction
    accuracy. In fact, the GBRT models provided even better results in terms of average
    prediction error (the GBRT model for Set 1 achieved an RSME of 0.113 mm, which
    reflected an average error rate of 5.3%—less than an error rate of 6.7% achieved
    by Labbé et al. 2000). This study also advances the literature by taking into
    account farmer considerations that are plot-specific, suggesting that plot-specific
    data allows for plot-specific decisions. As noted above, a similar approach to
    ours was taken by Andriyas and McKee (2013), who used tree-based classification
    models for modeling the farmer’s decision of whether or not to irrigate alfalfa,
    barley, and corn. The models developed in this study advance the state-of-the-art
    by predicting irrigation amounts and not only the binary irrigation decision.
    This study demonstrated how in-field sensor data can be used not only for monitoring
    and control, but also for developing ML-based prediction models for Jojoba irrigation
    decisions. Irrigation prediction is just one area in which in-field sensor data
    can be used for prediction. Other areas are yield prediction and disease prediction,
    which, so far, have been mainly predicted using remote sensing and image processing.
    In the future, the development of a Jojoba yield prediction model is planned,
    using an approach similar to the one presented in this paper, but with yield as
    the target variable. To accomplish that, however, data describing subplots at
    a seasonal granularity, along with the yield per subplot, should be collected
    for at least ten years. In addition, application of ML techniques may reveal disease-potential
    situations and may assist in their prevention. For example, by analyzing in-field
    sensor data, it was already discovered that when the air temperature equals to
    the dew point temperature for several continuous hours, there is a high chance
    for fungal infection development in the following days. Thus, when such situations
    are identified they are immediately treated with pesticides to prevent disease
    development. The last two examples demonstrates the potential advantages of applying
    ML on in-field sensor data, together with additional data, for prediction purposes.
    As opposed to remote sensors, which can be seen as direct proxies of symptoms
    (e.g. plant disease or decrease in yield), soil and plant sensors serve as proxies
    of the actual state of the plant and soil, and they can reflect the causes for
    symptoms at real time. Consequently, models that are based on such data can predict
    diseases or yield decrease at earlier stages. Conclusions The objective of this
    study was to develop a model that captures the agronomist’s irrigation planning
    process and that predicts his irrigation recommendations. This objective was achieved
    by applying ML on a dataset that integrated data from different sources. The dataset
    captured various sensor-based features, weather features, and features describing
    plots, in addition to irrigation levels that were determined by the agronomist.
    Based on this comprehensive dataset, different irrigation recommendation prediction
    models were developed, using three ML approaches: the traditional linear regression
    and two non-parametric approaches, GBRT and BTC. The models were trained against
    eight different feature subsets (as described in Table 2). The results showed
    that non-parametric models, namely GBRT and BTC models, were more accurate in
    predicting irrigation decisions than linear regression models, with success rates
    of 93 and 95%, respectively. In addition, GBRT and BTC models, compared to linear
    regression, required fewer transformations to capture non-linear relations among
    variables. The models they provided, however, were more difficult to interpret,
    as they included fifty decision trees. Although the GBRT and BTC models developed
    for the entire feature set (Set 1) provided the best results, it was shown that
    the GBRT model for Set 6 had the same success rate as that for Set 1, possibly
    indicating that drought/saturation and IPPD weather data could be excluded from
    the dataset with little loss in accuracy. In addition, it was shown that different
    sets of features achieved the best results for different plots, suggesting that
    more fine-grained data can improve decision making by providing the infrastructure
    for more fine-grained decisions on irrigation. The contribution of this study
    is threefold. First, the study explicates the tacit knowledge that guides the
    abstract decision-making process of the agronomist. The resulting model can serve
    to automate the irrigation decision-making process. A common approach by farmers
    to decide on irrigation amounts is to use the Penman–Monteith equation (Allen
    1998), which approximates net evapotranspiration (ET). However, since all the
    equation parameters are measured by the meteorological station for the entire
    land, the agronomist can calculate a single ET value for all plots, which would
    lead to a single irrigation recommendation for all plots. The agronomist of Jojoba
    Israel combines this ET value in his irrigation decision process with other measured
    parameters and plot-related features to define plot-specific irrigation quantities,
    resulting in different irrigation quantities for different subplots. This decision
    process is now captured by the developed models, which may increase the efficiency
    of the agronomist by automating or semi-automating the irrigation planning process
    and by obviating the need to analyze plant and soil data, plot by plot, on a weekly-basis.
    Modeling the decision-making process of the agronomist enables to replicate it
    to additional orchards or to perform it more frequently without additional effort.
    Second, by developing models with different subsets of features, it was possible
    to derive insights about the different features and their contribution to the
    prediction model. In particular, it was shown that feature sets that included
    no data on drought/saturation and IPPD weather performed at least as well as feature
    sets that included all available data, calling into question the value of these
    data for predicting irrigation amounts. Additionally, it was shown that different
    feature sets were optimal for different plots, suggesting that it might be useful
    to develop unique models for different plots. Third, this work generated insights
    on the suitability of different ML models for the irrigation planning problem,
    showing that non-parametric models, based on gradient boosting, achieved much
    better results than the traditional linear regression. Altogether, these three
    contributions represent an approach that can be applied to additional crops, as
    well as to additional decision-making processes in agriculture (e.g. fertilization
    and pest-control decisions). Notes https://www.netafim.com/product-category/umanage.

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    [66] 4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of
    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies
    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    \ agricultural activities in the world, which has\nbeen increasing over time.\
    \ Choosing an optimal irrigation management plan depends on having\navailable\
    \ data in the monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers data from several\
    \ sources;\nhowever, the data are not guaranteed to be free of discrepant values\
    \ (i.e., outliers), which can\ndamage the precision of irrigation management.\
    \ Furthermore, data from different sources must ﬁt\ninto the same temporal window\
    \ required for irrigation management and the data preprocessing\nmust be dynamic\
    \ and automatic to beneﬁt users of the irrigation management plan.\nIn this\n\
    paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart irrigation,\
    \ such as data\nmonitoring, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization, storage, and\
    \ irrigation management enriched\nby the prediction of soil moisture. Outlier\
    \ removal techniques allow for more precise irrigation\nmanagement. For ﬁelds\
    \ without soil moisture sensors, the prediction model estimates the matric\npotential\
    \ using weather, crop, and irrigation information. We apply the predicted matric\
    \ potential\napproach to the Van Genutchen model to determine the moisture used\
    \ in an irrigation management\nscheme. We can save, on average, between 56.4%\
    \ and 90% of the irrigation water needed by applying\nthe Zscore, MZscore and\
    \ Chauvenet outlier removal techniques to the predicted data.\nKeywords: IoT;\
    \ smart agriculture; soil moisture prediction\n1. Introduction\nAgricultural activities\
    \ presently use 70% of the withdrawn freshwater in the world [1]. Therefore,\n\
    it is of fundamental importance that we apply irrigation management, especially\
    \ in semiarid regions\nwith a scarcity of rainfall. Irrigation management is a\
    \ part of precision agriculture, in which the correct\namount of water artiﬁcially\
    \ delivered to a ﬁeld to satisfy the crop needs and the real production of the\n\
    users is analyzed [2].\nThe irrigation must supply the crop water needs at different\
    \ developmental stages in a given\nlocal. Irrigation management is used to detect\
    \ when to irrigate, the amount of water needed, and the\nirrigation frequency,\
    \ based on the monitoring of crop evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions.\n\
    Crop evapotranspiration measures the water consumption by crops, according to\
    \ the developmental\nSensors 2020, 20, 190; doi:10.3390/s20010190\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n2 of 25\nstage of the crop and the weather conditions [3].\
    \ The soil moisture impacts the amount of irrigation\nwater given to the crop,\
    \ as irrigation management takes into account the level of water retention in\
    \ the\nsoil. Therefore, precision agriculture can reduce water consumption in\
    \ irrigation by considering the\ngroundwater available to the crop [2].\nThe choice\
    \ of the best irrigation management plan depends on the data available from the\n\
    monitoring ﬁeld. A smart agriculture system gathers and processes data for irrigation\
    \ management\nfrom several sources using computer science and information technology\
    \ [4]. Users can provide\nthe features of different types of crop, soil, and irrigation\
    \ system, as well as the readings of analog\ntensiometers. Tensiometers are soil\
    \ sensors that detect the matric potential, which are used to estimate\nthe moisture\
    \ at different depths and monitoring points in a ﬁeld. Automatic weather stations\
    \ [5] can\nprovide public data through the Internet. Moreover, the ﬁeld may have\
    \ sensors and actuators which\ncan interact with each other as objects of the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) in order to provide services\ntransparently to the\
    \ users [6]. Such services are related to irrigation management for monitoring\n\
    (i.e., water, soil, and air) and prediction (weather and soil conditions).\nHowever,\
    \ data are not free of discrepant values (i.e., outliers), which can negatively\
    \ affect the\nprecision of irrigation management. Furthermore, data from different\
    \ sources must ﬁt into the\nsame temporal window required for the irrigation management\
    \ and the data preprocessing must be\ndynamic and automatic for researchers, engineers,\
    \ and owners or farmers to beneﬁt from the irrigation\nmanagement plan. Data fusion\
    \ is required to improve the quality of soil data in the case where several\n\
    sources provide the same type of data (e.g., moisture) from the ﬁeld [7]. Data\
    \ fusion also informs the\ndecision whether to start irrigation or not in irrigation\
    \ management that makes use of other types of\ndata (such as weather or crop data).\n\
    In this paper, we propose the Smart&Green framework to offer services for smart\
    \ irrigation,\nsuch as data monitoring and control, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization,\
    \ storage, and irrigation\nmanagement enriched by the prediction of soil moisture.\
    \ The Smart&Green services are modular\ncomponents which facilitate the reuse\
    \ and customization of code, which are challenges/limitations to\napplying IoT\
    \ in the smart agriculture context [8]. Our framework allows users to set the\
    \ data sources:\nThe nearest weather station, the moisture sensors (analog or\
    \ digital), the type of crop, and the features\nof the irrigation system in the\
    \ monitored ﬁeld. Therefore, Smart&Green also contributes to the solution\nof\
    \ another challenge in applying IoT for the purpose of smart agriculture: The\
    \ integration of the actual\ninfrastructure of the users (i.e., devices, machines,\
    \ and software) [9].\nSmart&Green recommends the best irrigation management plan,\
    \ according to the conﬁguration\nof the monitored ﬁeld. The framework also synchronizes\
    \ weather and soil data, as well as the crop\nstage for the chosen irrigation\
    \ management plan. The Fusion service allows for the deﬁnition of outlier\nremoval\
    \ criteria for the weather and soil data. The fusion service also applies the\
    \ outlier removal\ntechniques Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD before data aggregation,\nin order to obtain general information about the\
    \ soil conditions of a ﬁeld. Our results show that it\nmakes irrigation management\
    \ more precise, therefore saving water.\nFor ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ the prediction module estimates the soil moisture to\nmake the amount of water\
    \ irrigated more precise. In this work, we propose a computational model to\n\
    predict the matric potential based on weather data available at public stations\
    \ [5], crop information,\nand the amount of irrigation water used. As another\
    \ contribution, we provide to the scientiﬁc\ncommunity a public data set containing\
    \ the matric potential and irrigation data for cashew cultivation\nin an experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. The matric potential is the critical variable in measuring the soil moisture.\n\
    The computational model reduces the cost of equipment and energy, as the model\
    \ allows farms\nto estimate the moisture without soil sensors for the same soil\
    \ type. We evaluate the performance\nof a set of popular machine learning techniques\
    \ which have been widely applied to solve regression\nproblems. We measure the\
    \ quality of the models without feature selection using the RMSE (Root Mean\n\
    Squared Error) and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) as metrics. Our results show\
    \ that the combination\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n3 of 25\nof predicted data and\
    \ the outlier removal techniques can save an average between 56.4% and 90% of\n\
    irrigation water, estimated by water balance management.\nThe rest of the paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, a literary review of IoT platforms for\n\
    Smart Agriculture is presented. Section 3 describes the structure and services\
    \ of the Smart&Green\nframework. Section 4 relates the materials and method of\
    \ the implementation of Smart&Green,\nespecially for the soil moisture prediction\
    \ evaluation. The results are given in Section 5, and we\ndiscuss our contributions\
    \ in Section 6. Appendix A gives details about irrigation management using\nSmart&Green,\
    \ and we formalize the problem of soil moisture prediction in Appendix B.\n2.\
    \ Related Work\nWe carried out a systematic literature review to ﬁnd the works\
    \ which have answered the following\nresearch questions:\n1.\nWhat software exists\
    \ for agricultural management that automates the process of gathering,\npreprocessing,\
    \ fusing, and synchronizing the data used in irrigation management?\n2.\nDoes\
    \ the software implement the well-known irrigation management approaches of matric\n\
    potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3))?\n3.\nDoes the software\
    \ forecast the soil moisture?\n4.\nCan users conﬁgure the software using information\
    \ about their crops, irrigation system, soil\nsensors, and weather stations close\
    \ to the monitored ﬁeld?\nMost of the discovered papers have partially answered\
    \ the research questions above. To our best\nknowledge, there have been almost\
    \ no Internet of Things (IoT) platforms introduced that provide the\nservices\
    \ required for smart irrigation, such as the gathering, preprocessing, synchronization,\
    \ and fusion\nof data; the planning and execution of irrigation management; or\
    \ soil moisture prediction.\nSeveral studies have only addressed the gathering\
    \ and visualization of weather and soil data\n(Section 2.1). Some works focused\
    \ on data preprocessing by applying outlier detection algorithms\n(Section 2.2).\
    \ Some approaches used speciﬁc methods to decide when to irrigate, whereas others\
    \ have\nimplemented water balance and matric potential (Section 2.3). Soil moisture\

    \ images, and irrigation management information\nhas been investigated (Section\
    \ 2.4). In addition, IoT platforms have been studied, which should be\nﬂexible\
    \ enough to allow users to conﬁgure them for different monitoring cases in smart\
    \ agriculture\n(Section 2.5).\n2.1. Data Gathering\nIn general, most of the sensor\
    \ nodes used to monitor soil data (such as temperature, humidity,\nand matric\
    \ potential) and weather data (such as temperature and relative humidity) are\
    \ operated\nusing open, low-cost hardware platforms such as the Arduino [10–14]\
    \ or Raspberry Pi [15–17].\nZigbee [11,17–19], LoRa [16], Wiﬁ [20], Bluetooth\
    \ [14], GSM [12], and GPRS [21] are the predominant\nwireless technologies used.\n\
    Our proposal allows users choose between the CoAP [22] and MQTT [23] protocols\
    \ for sending\ndata to Smart&Green framework storage and later irrigation management.\
    \ For devices that we can not\nturn into a sensor node, such as analog tensiometers,\
    \ our framework has a mobile application with\nwhich users can gather data manually.\
    \ The framework also allows users to choose, as a weather data\nsource, the Brazilian\
    \ automatic weather station nearest to the monitored ﬁeld, from which data can\
    \ be\ngathered via HTTP.\n2.2. Data Preprocessing\nOther approaches have processed\
    \ soil data to detect outliers [24,25] and treat data using noise\nﬁltering techniques\
    \ [26]. One system applied an EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) to the soil moisture\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n4 of 25\ndata before the execution of irrigation management,\
    \ in order to avoid the actuators inappropriately\nstarting the irrigation [27].\n\
    The pattern recognition of water consumption by a crop radicular system, presented\
    \ in [28],\nis an outlier detection technique based on a time-series analysis\
    \ of soil moisture gathered at several\ndepths before, during, and after irrigation.\
    \ This technique allows for the identiﬁcation of sensors with\npoor operation,\
    \ which indicates the need for calibration or change.\nOur proposed framework\
    \ allows users to deﬁne criteria for outlier removal for each type of\nweather\
    \ and soil data used in irrigation management. Our framework also gives the option\
    \ to execute\nsuch algorithms as Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed Z-Score, and Generalized\
    \ ESD (Extreme Studentized\nDeviation) to remove outliers and fuse soil moisture\
    \ data, in the case when a ﬁeld has several soil\nsensors monitoring at different\
    \ depths.\n2.3. Irrigation Management\nOther works have automatically started\
    \ irrigation by implementing algorithms for analyzing the\ndata gathered by a\
    \ wireless sensor node. In one study, an algorithm based on decision trees used\
    \ the\nsoil temperature and moisture to determine the irrigation time and the\
    \ needed amount of water [29].\nCrisp rules (IF-THEN) were used to compare threshold\
    \ values with the soil moisture gathered by\nsensors, in order to decide whether\
    \ to turn on the sprinklers of an irrigation system, in [30,31].\nDecision support\
    \ platforms for the execution of traditional irrigation management, such as\n\
    the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water balance (Equation (A3)), have been\
    \ introduced.\nThese systems allow agronomists and farm owners to manage Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) components\nfor ﬁeld monitoring. The matric potential management\
    \ uses soil data gathered by sensor nodes and\nimages captured by unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles to correctly estimate the irrigation water need [32].\nWeb systems\
    \ have been used for the planning and execution of irrigation management. Beyond\
    \ the\nvisualization of soil moisture and weather data gathered by wireless sensor\
    \ nodes, these systems\nuse crisp rules for data analysis and, when it is necessary,\
    \ the systems send messages to their users\nin order to notify about irrigation\
    \ times [33] or activate the irrigation system automatically [34,35].\nIn other\
    \ approaches, the system takes the rainfall forecast (available on the Internet)\
    \ into account when\ndeciding whether to activate the irrigation system [36].\
    \ A wireless sensor network can also plan and\nexecute irrigation management [37].\
    \ In this case, the sensor nodes gather and analyze soil moisture\ndata and turn\
    \ the irrigation system on until the moisture achieves the ﬁeld capacity.\nA SCADA\
    \ (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system can automatically carry out\
    \ the data\ngathering, planning, and execution of the water balance management\
    \ (see Equations (A3) and (A4)).\nThe soil sensor nodes are also actuators, which\
    \ control the irrigation and send data continually to\na management system. The\
    \ system receives data from a weather station on the farm to estimate the\nreference\
    \ evapotranspiration ETo. The system also utilizes the curve of the crop coefﬁcient\
    \ kc, choosing\nits value according to the current developmental stage of the\
    \ crop [38].\nThe water balance and matric potential approaches often must take\
    \ data synchronization into\naccount. Therefore, some applications have synchronized\
    \ the data of previously registered crops,\nas well as soil and weather data,\
    \ to precisely determine the irrigation water need for the current\ndevelopmental\
    \ stage of the crop [39–42].\nThe existing systems described in this section are\
    \ not ﬂexible enough to allow users to set the\nfeatures of a monitored ﬁeld,\
    \ such as the type of crop, the type and number of soil sensors, and irrigation\n\
    system parameters used. The systems usually work with a predeﬁned conﬁguration\
    \ and infrastructure.\nTherefore, code reuse is impracticable for the irrigation\
    \ management of agricultural ﬁelds which do not\nﬁt to the existing system conﬁguration.\
    \ Our proposal allows users to register relevant information for\nirrigation management:\
    \ Different types of crops, soil features, irrigation systems, data sources (weather\n\
    or soil), and outlier removal criteria. In this work, the framework plans the\
    \ irrigation management\nusing the matric potential (Equation (A2)) and water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)) approaches.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n5 of 25\nFurthermore,\
    \ none of the systems could forecast the moisture levels in ﬁelds without soil\
    \ sensors.\nOur proposal implements computational models to predict soil moisture\
    \ based on weather data, crop\ninformation, and irrigation water need (IWN) (see\
    \ Appendix B). In this work, we include the predicted\ndata in the water balance\
    \ management, obtaining between 56.4% and 90% of IWN savings over six\nmonths\
    \ (Section 5.3).\n2.4. Soil Moisture Prediction\nIn [43], the Linear Regression,\
    \ Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting with\nRegression Tree (GBRT)\
    \ machine learning (ML) techniques were applied to weather and soil sensor\ndata\
    \ (moisture and drought stress) to predict the best irrigation plan for a jojoba\
    \ crop. The GBRT\nmodel outperformed the others and, so, the decision support\
    \ service incorporated it as a module of\nthe system. A model based on support\
    \ vector regression (SVR) and k-means ML techniques which\nused weather data and\
    \ forecasts, as well the soil data (temperature and moisture), to forecast the\
    \ soil\nmoisture has also been investigated [44].\nIn [45], an integrated system\
    \ to monitor drought in northern China using satellite images (NOAA,\nMODIS, and\
    \ FY3A), weather stations, and soil data has been discussed. The drought forecasting\n\
    used the matric potential at the depth of the crop root, the water balance model,\
    \ depletion indices,\nand measurements of crop stress to estimate the soil moisture\
    \ and the water quantity needed for\nan extended period.\nIn this work, we apply\
    \ weather data, crop information, and the amount of irrigation water used\nin\
    \ a computational model, in order to estimate the daily matric potential of the\
    \ most superﬁcial soil\nlayer (Appendix B), which signals when the crop needs\
    \ irrigation [2]. We apply the predicted value in\nthe Van Genutchen model (Equation\
    \ (A1)) to obtain the soil moisture used in irrigation management\n(Equations\
    \ (A2) and (A3)) for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (i.e., Field 1 of Figure\
    \ A1).\nWe present two different approaches: Local and global prediction models.\
    \ In the local method,\nwe create a prediction model for each monitoring point\
    \ in an experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2). In the\nglobal approach, we create a\
    \ single model which can be generalized to any monitoring point. We have\nevaluated\
    \ the performance of a set of popular ML techniques which have been widely applied\n\
    to solve regression problems: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5\
    \ Model Trees and\nRules [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], RepTree, and\
    \ GBRT [51,52]. Our results show that\nGBRT outperforms the other evaluated techniques\
    \ in both approaches.\n2.5. IoT Platforms for Smart Agriculture\nSWAMP (Smart\
    \ Water Management Platform), introduced in [53], is one of the related methods\n\
    which is most similar to our proposal. SWAMP has components to allow for the implementation\
    \ of\ndifferent IoT applications for irrigation management, based on the crop\
    \ and soil moisture approaches.\nUsers can customize the services for the gathering\
    \ (MQTT or LoRa), processing, and synchronization\nof data with different types\
    \ of crops, weather, and country. Therefore, different ﬁeld conﬁgurations\ncan\
    \ reuse these services for data analysis and storage, highlighting the excellent\
    \ ﬂexibility of SWAMP.\nHowever, their techniques for the processing and the fusion\
    \ of data have not been detailed, and no\napplication or service for the prediction\
    \ of soil moisture has been provided.\nThe Agro-IoT framework, introduced in [54],\
    \ is also related to our proposal, which provides\nusers real-time data gathering,\
    \ aggregation (fusion), and analysis in the context of smart farming.\nAgro-IoT\
    \ reuses several components to implement IoT applications, according to the needs\
    \ of the\nmonitored ﬁeld. Agro-IoT provides similar services to our proposed method;\
    \ that is, it also provides\nthe management of devices (i.e., registration of\
    \ sensors and actuators) and event detection through\ndata analysis. However,\
    \ it does not contain modules for data synchronization and outlier removal or\n\
    soil moisture prediction.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n6 of 25\n3. Proposal\nIn this\
    \ paper, we propose Smart&Green: An Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the\
    \ smart\nagriculture domain. A framework consists of “a speciﬁc implementation\
    \ of a skeleton of infrastructure used\nfor the conception of a work” [55]. Work\
    \ is any activity performed by users or software. In this proposal,\nthe work\
    \ consists of the planning of irrigation management (Appendix A). In ﬁelds where\
    \ there are\nno soil moisture sensors, a computational model can estimate the\
    \ soil moisture for the same soil type\nusing weather, crop, and irrigation data.\
    \ Agronomists, researchers, and farmers conduct irrigation\nmanagement through\
    \ software which uses Smart&Green. Figure 1 presents the conceptual architecture\n\
    of Smart&Green, divided into four layers: Application, Services, Communication,\
    \ and Physical.\nFigure 1. Conceptual architecture of the Smart&Green IoT Framework\
    \ for Smart Agriculture.\nIn software engineering, a framework can also be “a\
    \ mini architecture that can be reused and that\nprovides behavior and a generic\
    \ structure for a family of software abstractions in a context that speciﬁes the\n\
    collaboration and use of them into a given domain” [56]. Therefore, given the\
    \ smart agriculture domain and\nthe context of smart irrigation, the Smart&Green\
    \ framework speciﬁes the structure of a set of concrete\nand abstract classes\
    \ to implement modules for the gathering, storage, synchronization, and fusion\
    \ of\ndata, as well as mathematical models (Appendix A) which describe irrigation\
    \ management. Irrigation\nmanagement determines the behaviors of the classes and\
    \ modules. As a mini architecture, the proposed\nframework can be reused with\
    \ different smart agriculture software with the generic functionalities of\nirrigation\
    \ management.\n3.1. Application Layer\nThe application layer provides facilities\
    \ for the automatization of irrigation management\n(Appendix A) and soil moisture\
    \ prediction. Through this layer, users of an agriculture management\nsystem can\
    \ insert information about the farm infrastructure: The types of crops and irrigation\
    \ system\nto each monitored ﬁeld, the monitored soil layers, and the weather stations\
    \ closest to the farm.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n7 of 25\n3.1.1. Irrigation Management\
    \ Automatization\nThe Matric Potential and Water Balance modules implement well-known\
    \ irrigation management\nmethods (Appendix A). These modules use information registered\
    \ by users as well as that from\nweather and soil data sources. Smart&Green selects\
    \ the best irrigation management based on the data\navailable. The principal functions\
    \ of the Register Module are as follows:\n1.\nUser register: Smart&Green framework\
    \ allows two types of users: Specialist and regular. Specialist\nusers can provide\
    \ agronomic information, such as different types of crops, soil, and irrigation\n\
    system features. They can also register outlier removal criteria for weather and\
    \ soil data and\nchoose algorithms for the fusion service. Regular users can register\
    \ farms and ﬁelds.\n2.\nFarm Register: Users provide information about the farm,\
    \ such as address and geographical\nco-ordinates (i.e., latitude and altitude)\
    \ for the Smart&Green framework, and select the weather\nstation closest to the\
    \ farm.\n3.\nCrop register: A specialist user can create types of crops using\
    \ information such as a description,\nthe curve of the crop coefﬁcient, and the\
    \ critical moisture condition.\n4.\nSystem Irrigation Register: A specialist user\
    \ inserts the type of irrigation systems, such as\n“micro-sprinkler”.\n5.\nWeather\
    \ Station Register: Smart&Green automatically selects the weather station closest\
    \ to the farm\nusing the geographical co-ordinates. Users can conﬁrm this or choose\
    \ another one.\n6.\nSoil Sensor Register: The user can insert the types of soil\
    \ sensors used. Smart&Green already has\nanalog and digital tensiometers.\n7.\n\
    Field Register: Users set the ﬁeld conﬁguration features (Figure A1), such as\
    \ the type of crop,\nirrigation system, soil, and if there are soil monitoring\
    \ points. The developmental stage of the crop\nrepresents the number of days since\
    \ the initial cultivation. Effective precipitation (mm/h) and\nefﬁciency of the\
    \ irrigation system are necessary for irrigation management, in order to compute\n\
    the irrigation time. In the case of monitoring points, users can register the\
    \ type of soil moisture\nsensor (analog or digital) and the depth z monitored\
    \ for each monitoring point in the ﬁeld.\n8.\nField Communication register: In\
    \ the case where the monitored ﬁelds have sensor nodes that\nautomatically gather\
    \ soil data, users can deﬁne the type of communication to send the data to the\n\
    framework. Users set the IP address and speciﬁc conﬁguration (CoAP or MQTT).\n\
    9.\nOutlier Removal Criteria Register: Specialist users can create a threshold\
    \ for minimum and\nmaximum values of each type of weather and soil moisture data\
    \ used in irrigation management.\nThe Smart&Green framework suggests an irrigation\
    \ management plan, according to the data of\na registered ﬁeld. For ﬁelds without\
    \ soil moisture sensors (Field 1 of Figure A1), Smart&Green indicates\nthe water\
    \ balance without soil moisture data (i.e., without the term ∆A in Equation (A3))\
    \ or the water\nbalance with the soil moisture data created by the soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 3.1.2).\nFor ﬁelds with soil moisture sensors (see\
    \ Fields 2 and 3 of Figure A1), the framework calculates the\nmatric potential\
    \ (Equation (A2)) or water balance using the soil moisture data.\n3.1.2. Soil\
    \ Moisture Prediction\nIn this work, we address a large ﬁeld (over 7500 m2) to\
    \ produce one type of crop on a large scale,\nin which the soil is monitored by\
    \ a hundred tensiometers (i.e., soil moisture sensors) at three different\ndepths.\
    \ To investigate this scenario, we present the local and global approaches, which\
    \ can be used to\nlearn a prediction function ˆf (Appendix B).\nThe local approach\
    \ creates a different prediction function ˆfi for each tensiometer at the superﬁcial\n\
    soil layer of the ﬁeld. For this, it uses the observations recorded by a tensiometer\
    \ bi and a weather\nstation ms, as well the water amount wi given to the crop\
    \ and the crop coefﬁcient kc related to the\ncurrent life stage of the crop. The\
    \ local approach deﬁnes the prediction ˆf in terms of n different\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 190\n8 of 25\nfunctions ˆfi for local predictions. However, if a ﬁeld has\
    \ a large number of tensiometers, a large\nnumber of distinctive prediction models\
    \ must be trained.\nThe global approach creates only one prediction function ˆfi\
    \ using the information from all\ntensiometers. Therefore, the global prediction\
    \ model might not ﬁt some individual tensiometers.\nThe Smart&Green framework\
    \ implements the prediction model as a modular service (Figure 2)\nto complement\
    \ the irrigation management of ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors (e.g., ﬁeld\
    \ 1 in\nFigure A1). The framework automatically retrieves and stores the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms\npublished on the Internet by weather stations. We deﬁned Mms in\
    \ Appendix B.\nFigure 2. Smart&Green Module for soil moisture prediction.\nThe\
    \ framework daily preprocesses the Mms data to remove possible outliers. The module\
    \ of soil\nmoisture prediction estimates the matric potential ψp of a ﬁeld, based\
    \ on (M′\nms, W, kc) (Appendix B).\nThe irrigation management module computes\
    \ the current soil moisture θc by applying ψp on the Van\nGenutchen [57] model,\
    \ following Equation (A1). Then, the obtained θc is applied to Equation (A2)\n\
    or (A3) to calculate the irrigation water need (IWN).\nIn the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) context, the framework sends the IWN value to an actuator to\nstart the\
    \ irrigation system. The irrigation system stops when the ﬁeld receives the amount\
    \ of water\nspeciﬁed by the IWN. Although this present work does not handle an\
    \ automatic irrigation system,\nthis issue is a concern for the full implementation\
    \ of an IoT system for smart farms.\n3.2. Service Layer\nThe Service layer supports\
    \ the Application layer by storing data provided by Smart&Green users\nand synchronizing\
    \ crop, weather station, and soil data when required by any irrigation management\n\
    module. The Service layer also carries out fusion tasks for data of soil moisture\
    \ sensors (e.g., ﬁelds 2\nand 3 of Figure A1) or the soil moisture prediction.\n\
    The Storage service provides centralized data persistence for the monitoring of\
    \ weather, crop,\nand soil data in the ﬁelds. The Synchronization service selects\
    \ the crop coefﬁcient kc which is\nappropriate to the current development stage\
    \ of the crop and retrieves the weather data Mms for\nthe period needed for irrigation\
    \ management. The service also requests the Communication layer for\nnew data\
    \ from the Internet, if needed.\nIn the case of soil data, the Synchronization\
    \ service selects data from all monitoring points\nBTc in the ﬁeld, taking into\
    \ account the period of irrigation management. If there are no data\navailable,\
    \ the service requests new data from the user (ﬁeld 2 of Figure A1) or the Communication\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 190\n9 of 25\nlayer (Field 3 of Figure A1). Finally, the Synchronization\
    \ service makes the data set composed of\n{kc,current, Mms,period, BTc,period}\
    \ available.\nThe Irrigation Management Modules use the Fusion service if there\
    \ is a ﬁeld with monitoring\npoints, each with one or more soil moisture sensors\
    \ (e.g., tensiometers) at different depths z (e.g.,\nﬁelds 2 and 3 of Figure A1).\
    \ The Fusion service can also treat data created in soil moisture prediction\n\
    when irrigation management is required for ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors.\
    \ Data fusion consists\nof processing the data to detect and remove outliers (DRO)\
    \ and submitting data to a co-operative\nfunction (CF), according to a multilevel\
    \ data fusion architecture [58].\nDRO tasks apply criteria and algorithms deﬁned\
    \ by specialist users to immediately detect and\nremove outliers. The Register\
    \ module of the Application layer allows for the creation of threshold\nvalues\
    \ for soil data. DRO algorithms are speciﬁc to the soil layer monitored. According\
    \ to [58],\nthe Z-score is more efﬁcient for data series at the most superﬁcial\
    \ soil layer (e.g., z = 15 cm). In contrast,\nthe Generalized ESD (Extreme Studentized\
    \ Deviate) algorithm works well with data at depth of\nz = 45 cm. The Smart&Green\
    \ framework has implementations of the Chauvenet, Z-Score, Modiﬁed\nZ-Score, and\
    \ Generalized ESD algorithms.\nA co-operative function (CF) [59] aggregates one\
    \ type of data gathered at different monitoring\npoints of a ﬁeld. Smart&Green\
    \ uses the mean function as the CF to aggregate soil moisture data at the\nsame\
    \ depth. For example, Field 2 of Figure A1 has six monitoring points at two depths.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe framework calculates the mean of each set of six samples gathered\
    \ at a given depth z. After fusion,\nthe data are ready for irrigation management\
    \ at the Application layer, which decides whether irrigation\nshould be started.\n\
    3.3. Communication Layer\nThe Communication Layer has a set of software to gather\
    \ weather and soil data through network\nprotocols. This includes a weather client,\
    \ four soil clients, three soil servers, and a gateway (see\nFigure 3). The weather\
    \ client consists of an HTTP client which downloads weather station data from\n\
    the Internet and stores them. Smart&Green offers an API to gather data from Brazilian\
    \ automatic\nweather stations [5].\nFigure 3. Interaction between the Communication\
    \ Layer and the Physical and Services Layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n10 of 25\n\
    The soil client gathers the matric potential data ψm if the ﬁeld has tensiometers\
    \ installed. If the\ntensiometers are analog, users have to manually collect the\
    \ ψm data, using a mobile application that\nsends it to the framework via HTTP.\
    \ If the tensiometers are digital, they are integrated into sensor\nnodes that\
    \ send the data to a gateway near the ﬁeld. The gateway hosts CoAP and MQTT clients,\n\
    which forward the ψm data to the servers of the framework.\n4. Materials and Method\n\
    In this section, we list the principal software components used in the implementation\
    \ of our\nproposed framework (Section 4.1). We describe what we use for soil moisture\
    \ prediction, in terms of\n(1) the weather, crop, and soil moisture information;\
    \ (2) the criteria for outlier detection and removal;\nand (3) the tested machine\
    \ learning techniques (see Section 4.2).\n4.1. Smart & Green Framework Implementation\n\
    We implemented the Smart&Green framework using the Python 3 Language. In the Application\n\
    layer (Section 3.1), irrigation management by the water balance module uses PyETo\
    \ [60] to calculate the\nreference evapotranspiration for a crop, with reference\
    \ to the Penman-Monteith Model [61]. The crop\nevapotranspiration measures the\
    \ water consumption by crops, according to the developmental stage\nof the crop\
    \ and weather conditions [3]. The Service Layer uses the MySQL database [62] to\
    \ support the\nStorage service. The PyAstronomy library [63] provides the implementation\
    \ of the Generalized ESD\n(Extreme Studentized Deviate) algorithm for the Fusion\
    \ Service.\nThe aiocoap package [64] supports the implementation of the CoAP client\
    \ and server of the\nCommunication layer (Section 3.3). The MQTT client uses the\
    \ Eclipse Paho MQTT client library [65],\nand we used Mosquito as the MQTT server\
    \ [66]. Our API for the acquisition of weather data operates\nby scraping the\
    \ web page of the automatic Brazilian weather stations [5] using the libraries\
    \ requests [67]\nand beautifulsoup4 [68], as well the frameworks Django [69] and\
    \ Django rest [70]. We implemented\nthe mobile application for soil moisture gathering\
    \ from ﬁelds with analog tensiometers (e.g., ﬁeld 2 of\nFigure A1) in the Javascript\
    \ language through the Firebase platform [71], React Native framework [72],\n\
    Realm [73], and React Native Firebase [74] libraries.\nWe also provide a web interface\
    \ for the\nSmart&Green Framework developed using Django [69]. Smart&Green was\
    \ run on a machine with\n2 GB of RAM, 20 GB of hard disk storage, and the Ubuntu\
    \ 18.04LTS OS.\nFor farm ﬁelds with sensor nodes, such as ﬁeld 3 of Figure A1,\
    \ we used an Arduino Pro Mini and\nthree Irrometer Watermark 200SS [75] digital\
    \ tensiometers to implement a sensor node which gathers\nsoil moisture data at\
    \ 15, 45, and 75 cm. The watermark measures the soil water tension (i.e., matric\n\
    potential), which ranges from 0 to 200 CBar/KPa. The sensor nodes use four AA\
    \ alkaline batteries of\n1.5 v as the power source. We modify the Arduino removing\
    \ the voltage controller and LEDs to the\nnode has a longer operating life. Sensor\
    \ nodes send soil data through an nRF24L01 with an external\nanthem and power\
    \ ampliﬁer. The nRF24L01 is a single-chip radio transceiver for the 2.4–2.5 GHz\
    \ ISM\nband. After data transmission, the sensor node hibernates for an hour to\
    \ save power [58]. We used\na Raspberry Pi 3 with the Raspbian OS as the gateway\
    \ to receive soil moisture data and send them by\nthe CoAP or MQTT client to storage.\n\
    4.2. Soil Moisture Prediction\n4.2.1. Raw Data Set\nWe obtained a data set of\
    \ soil moisture from an experimental cashew ﬁeld with other tropical\nraw materials\
    \ in the city of Paraibapa, Brazil [76]. The ﬁeld had approximately 250 cashew\
    \ trees with\nnine monitoring spots. Each spot had three tensiometers that allowed\
    \ manual reading of the matric\npotential at depths of 15, 45, and 75 cm. Figure\
    \ 4 shows the details of the analog tensiometers (soil\nmoisture sensors), which\

    We also analyzed the soil particle composition of the experimental ﬁeld. The soil\
    \ has a medium\nsandy texture in the layer from 0 to 30 cm (805 g kg−1 of sand,\
    \ 76 g kg−1 of clay and 119 g kg−1 of silt)\nand the medium texture in the other\
    \ layers, presenting the characteristics of a red-yellow Argisol [77].\nThe maximum\
    \ organic matter content was 6.4 g dm−3; the pH varied from 5.6 to 6.3 between\
    \ the\nlayers; the capacity of cations exchange, from 31.3 to 64.8, and the sum\
    \ of maximum bases was 62% in\nthe most superﬁcial layer.\n4.2.2. Outlier Detection\
    \ and Removal\nFirst, the instances that presented Tmax, Tmin < 20, Tmax, Tmin\
    \ > 39, RHmax, RHmin < 20, and Ri >\n250 were removed, as these feature ranges\
    \ are uncommon in the city of Paraibapa. After that, the mean\nµ and the standard\
    \ deviation σ were computed for the variables P, Rn, and U2 for each month.\n\
    Afterward, we ﬁltered out data instances with anomalies; that is, the instances\
    \ with distance to µ\ngreater or equal than 3 × σ were removed, as performed in\
    \ [78].\n4.2.3. Machine Learning Methods\nWe decided to build the prediction model\
    \ using algorithms which have been widely applied to\nsolve regression problems:\
    \ Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump [47], M5 Model Trees and Rules\n(M5P)\
    \ [48,49], Random Tree, Random Forest [50], and RepTree. Weka [79] provided all\
    \ of these.\nAnother widely used algorithm is the Gradient Boosting Regression\
    \ Tree (GBRT) [51,52] method and\nits implementation XGBoost [80].\nLinear regression\
    \ is a linear model of the relationship between a scalar response (in this work,\n\
    the matric potential ψm) and one or more explanatory variables (see Table 1).\
    \ The linear model consists\nof linear predictor functions which use the data\
    \ to estimate the unknown parameters [46]. Decision\nstump models a one-level\
    \ decision tree. The tree has one root (an internal node) which connects the\n\
    leaves (terminal nodes). The model uses the value of one single feature to make\
    \ predictions [47].\nM5P produces a tree with a multilinear regression model for\
    \ each node. A greedy algorithm\nremoves the insigniﬁcant features in the model\
    \ ﬁtted to each node. Then, the terminal node computes\nnew predicted values,\
    \ considering the predicted values of other intermediate nodes between the\nterminal\
    \ node and the root node [48,49].\nRandom Tree (RT) uses if-then conditions for\
    \ answering questions in a sequential order to achieve\na speciﬁc result. The\
    \ depth of the tree consists of the number of questions needed to reach a prediction\n\
    value. Random Forest (RF) is a collection of decision trees that can use a random\
    \ subset of the features.\nTherefore, the number of trees impacts the number of\
    \ features used and limits the number of errors\ndue to bias or variance [50].\n\
    RepTree is a fast decision tree algorithm in Weka which uses information gain/variance\
    \ to build\na regression tree. Reduced-error pruning takes into account the method\
    \ backﬁtting [79]. GBRT is a\npredictive model based on a weak learner, a loss\
    \ function, and an additive model. The weak learner is\na decision tree that can\
    \ be modiﬁed to achieve better results. The additive model adds weak learners\n\
    to correct for the residual errors of all previous trees. The loss function consists\
    \ of the mean squared\nerror for regression problems [51,52].\nWe set some hyperparameters\
    \ required by RT, RF, RepTree, and GBRT with the default values\nof Weka [79]\
    \ and XGboost [80]. We set the maximum tree depth (max_depth) to 3 for GBRT and\
    \ to\nwithout restriction for the RT, RF, and RepTree methods. The number of trees\
    \ (n_estimators) was\n100 for all methods. Finally, GBRT required a third hyperparameter,\
    \ the learning rate (learning_rate),\nwhich we set to 0.1.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 190\n13 of 25\nThe training and test sets included, respectively, 80% and 20%\
    \ of the data from each soil moisture\nsensor at a depth of 15 cm. Overall, for\
    \ each possible combination, we generated a model and\npicked the model which\
    \ gave the lowest MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square\nError)—metrics\
    \ which have been widely used to measure the quality of a prediction model (see\n\
    Equations (A6) and (A7) in Appendix B).\n5. Results\nFirst, we employed the outlier\
    \ removal techniques of Fusion Service (Section 3.2) on the real\nsoil moisture\
    \ data in order to analyze the inﬂuence of these techniques on irrigation management\n\
    (Section 3.1.1) in the Smart&Green framework (Section 5.1). Then, we analyzed\
    \ the MAE and RMSE of\nthe machine learning techniques tested with the local and\
    \ global approaches (Section 3.1.2) proposed\nfor the Smart&Green soil moisture\
    \ prediction module (Section 5.2). Finally, we applied the soil moisture\ndata\
    \ created by the best prediction models for irrigation management to analyze the\
    \ water savings\n(Section 5.3).\n5.1. Impact of Outlier Removal Techniques on\
    \ Real Moisture Data by Irrigation Management\nFrom the raw data set (Section\
    \ 4.2), we selected data from from April to October/2017, since\nthere was no\
    \ salvation irrigation in the experimental ﬁeld, which could affect the irrigation\
    \ water need\n(IWN) estimated by water balance and matric potential management.\
    \ Then, we set Fusion Service\n(Section 3.2) to use an outlier removal technique\
    \ to process the matric potential ψc provided by the nine\ntensiometers (soil\
    \ moisture sensors) at 15 cm of depth in the experimental ﬁeld (Section 4.2).\
    \ Second,\nthe Fusion Service aggregated ψc data using the co-operative function\
    \ mean. After this, the modules\nof water balance and potential matric (Section\
    \ 3.1) applied the aggregated ψc to Van Genutchen\nModel (Equation (A1)) to estimate\
    \ the current soil moisture θc at the crop root zone (z = 30 cm) and\ncompute\
    \ IWN.\nWater balance management (Equation (A3)) can depend only on the crop evapotranspiration\
    \ ETc\n(Equation (A4)) and rainfall R to estimate the IWN of a crop. Therefore,\
    \ we can only use weather data\nand the crop coefﬁcient (Table 1) to plan water\
    \ balance for n days. However, the IWN estimation is\nmore precise when we can\
    \ incorporate the current soil moisture data θcz since the water storage in\n\
    the crop root zone can contribute to the crop water supply. We set water balance\
    \ to estimates IWN\nevery three days (n = 3) over six months (26 samples of n\
    \ intervals), and the results in Table 3 indicate\nthat the use of θcz saved an\
    \ average of 90.4% of the IWN estimated, as compared to that using only\nweather\
    \ and crop data.\nTable 3.\nPercentage of water saved over six months by irrigation\

    \ to 89.3%. Zscore and MZscore data treatment led to an increment of the moisture\
    \ θc values\n(Figure 5a), and, consequently, a reduction of the term ∆A of water\
    \ balance (Equation (A3)). GESD and\nChauvenet did not affect the moisture θc\
    \ data enough (Figure 5b), as well as IWN saving (Table 3).\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    \ Moisture Data used in Water Balance—the points outside of the dashed lines are\
    \ the\ncurrent moisture data θcz modiﬁed by an outlier removal technique.\nThe\
    \ matric potential approach depends exclusively on the soil moisture data (Equation\
    \ (A2)),\nand we planned this irrigation management to estimate the daily IWN\
    \ over six months (121 samples of\ndays) using the current moisture θc data at\
    \ the shallowest crop root zone (e.g., z = 30 cm). In the matric\npotential approach,\
    \ irrigation occurs only when θc is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition\n\
    θcr, which is the ideal moisture for irrigation and signals when the crop productivity\
    \ is starting to\ndecline. Table 3 presents the IWN saving of matric potential\
    \ management that used an outlier removal\ntechnique when compared to the one\
    \ that did not use them. Figure 6 shows that there were several\ndays where θc\
    \ was equal to θcr (day 1 to 13). However, all outlier remotion techniques treated\
    \ various\noutliers that reduced the current moisture (e.g., 14th and 15th; 18th\
    \ and 19th; 26th days), improving\nthe water savings, on average, by 4.3% to 20.7%\
    \ (Table 3). Zscore and MZscore (Figure 6a) contributed\nmore to the tradeoff\
    \ between IWN saving and healthy crop development because they increased the\n\
    current moisture θc above the critical condition θcr in more days(e.g., the 40th\
    \ to 43th; 64th; 104th days)\nthan GESD and Chauvenet (Figure 6b).\n(a) Zscore\

    \ Models for Soil Moisture Prediction\nThe main goal of this analysis is to evaluate\
    \ and establish the best machine learning (ML)\ntechnique among those tested for\
    \ each approach (local and global prediction models). In this context,\nwe considered\
    \ analog soil sensors (tensiometers) distributed throughout a large ﬁeld (Figure\
    \ 4).\nWe compared the following ML techniques: Linear Regression, Decision Stump,\
    \ M5P, Random Tree,\nRandom Forest, RepTree, and Gradient Boosting. Through the\
    \ metrics MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\nand RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), we evaluated\
    \ the local and global approaches for the estimation\nof the matric potential\
    \ ψm—the primary variable for soil moisture prediction (Appendix B). Finally,\n\
    we used the 99% conﬁdence intervals to determine the best-performing model.\n\
    Table 4 presents the MAE and RMSE retrieved by the local approach for each prediction\
    \ algorithm.\nThe results of the local approach are the mean of the MAE and RMSE\
    \ achieved by the nine models\nbuilt for each monitoring point of the experimental\
    \ ﬁeld. Considering all the analyzed errors, Gradient\nBoosting outperformed all\
    \ the other techniques, followed by Random Forest. Both approaches\npresented\
    \ acceptable errors, according to a specialist agronomic engineer.\nTable 4. Evaluation\

    \ approach for each algorithm. Again,\nthe Gradient Boosting algorithm achieved\
    \ the best results, compared to all other evaluated models.\nIt can be noticed\
    \ that the MAE and RSME of the Gradient Boosting model did not vary as much as\
    \ the\nother evaluated models; this means the global model generalizes well for\
    \ any data from any sensor in\nthe ﬁeld. The Local Gradient Boosting approach\
    \ outperformed the global one. However, even though\nthe global model error had\
    \ an average MAE error increase of 58.9% and average RMSE error increase\nof 45.7%,\
    \ the errors were still acceptable, according to the specialist agronomic engineer.\n\
    We also analyzed the relevance of the features of Table 1, in the context of the\
    \ local and global\napproaches. We employed Gradient Boosting as, according to\
    \ the results of this section, it has proved\nto be the best ML technique for\
    \ our purposes. XGboost [80] estimates the relevance of each feature by\ncounting\
    \ the number of times it is used in a split node of any decision tree in the Gradient\
    \ Boosting\nforest. Figure 7 presents the results. The more an attribute is used\
    \ in a decision tree, the higher its\nrelative importance is. The most-used variables\

    \ of Predicted Data of Soil Moisture\nWe used the local and global models based\
    \ on Gradient Boosting to predict the matric potential\nψm for a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors over six months. The local approach estimated daily ψp\n\
    at a depth of 15 cm, as the ﬁeld had nine monitoring points. Therefore, we could\
    \ apply the outlier\nremoval techniques to treat this data set of nine daily values.\
    \ The global approach estimated one daily\nvalue for the ψp at a depth of 15 cm\
    \ in the ﬁeld. In this case, there was no need for preprocessing the\ndata using\
    \ the outlier removal techniques. We use ψp to compute predicted soil moisture\
    \ data for the\ncrop root zone (z = 30 cm) through the Van Genutchen Model (Equation\
    \ (A1)).\nFor water balance (Equation (A3)), executed every three days (n = 3)\
    \ for six months (26 samples\nof n), we compared the beneﬁts of our computational\
    \ models by analyzing how much they saved,\nin terms of the irrigation water need\
    \ (IWN) estimated using only weather and crop data. Table 6 shows\nthat the use\
    \ of global approach data saved an average of 56.4% and that the local approach\
    \ without\ndata preprocessing saved 100% of the IWN on average.\nThe Zscore and\
    \ MZscore methods tended to treat outliers by removing values that decreased the\n\
    current moisture θc (Figure 8a). Therefore, they reduced the result of the local\
    \ predicted data by 90%\nand 75.6%, respectively, for water balance. The employment\
    \ of Chauvenet for the local approach data\nalso saved 90% of IWN on average since\
    \ it almost achieved the performance of Zscore (Figure 8b).\nThe use of GESD did\
    \ not affect the local approach predicted data (Figure 8b), such that it had almost\n\
    the same water savings as when no outlier removal technique was employed (Table\
    \ 6). We consider\nthe global approach and local approach using Zscore, MZscore\
    \ and Chauvenet techniques optimized\nthe tradeoff between IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development, and they did not outweigh the IWN\nsavings of water balance\

    For the matric potential (Equation (A2)) executed daily, irrigation occurs when\
    \ the current\nmoisture θc is minor or equal to the critical moisture condition\

    Smart Agriculture presently lacks an Internet of Things (IoT) platform for the\
    \ gathering,\npreprocessing, and storage of data used in irrigation management,\
    \ which also allows for the reuse of\ncode to different sets of crops, soil, irrigation\
    \ system, and weather data sources. In this paper, we have\nproposed the Smart&Green\
    \ IoT framework which executes an irrigation management plan using the\nwater\
    \ balance and potential matric approaches according to the crop, as well as irrigation\
    \ system\ninformation provided by users and the weather and soil moisture data\
    \ available close to the monitored\nﬁelds. Smart&Green can be used to preprocess\
    \ soil moisture data with outlier removal criteria and\ntechniques of Zscore,\
    \ MZscore, GESD, and Chauvenet to provide a more precise irrigation water need\n\
    (IWN) in irrigation management.\nFor large ﬁelds without soil moisture sensors,\
    \ we have considered the problem of predicting the\nsoil moisture by analyzing\
    \ the weather data, crop coefﬁcients, and amount of irrigation water. We have\n\
    formally introduced the problem of soil prediction and designed a methodology\
    \ which uses training\nmodels according to two different approaches: Local and\
    \ global. These approaches determine the\nimplementation of prediction models\
    \ based on supervised machine learning techniques.\nThe local approach trains\
    \ a model for each soil sensor in the ﬁeld, achieving high performance.\nHowever,\
    \ this approach can lead to a high cost of data management if there are a large\
    \ number of\nsensors, as it requires the training and maintainence of a large\
    \ number of distinctive prediction models.\nOn the other hand, the global approach\
    \ trains a single prediction model over the observations of all\nthe sensors.\
    \ Our results show that gradient boosting with regression trees (GBRT) outperformed\
    \ the\nother evaluated techniques in both approaches. The local approach had the\
    \ best results with gradient\nboost, although the results using the global prediction\
    \ model were also acceptable.\nFurthermore, we have designed a module to support\
    \ irrigation management with our prediction\nmodels, based on GBRT. We evaluated\
    \ irrigation management using the water balance and matric\npotential approaches\
    \ with real and predicted data of soil moisture, as well as the impact of preprocessing\n\
    data with outlier removal techniques. The real data was part of a data set collected\
    \ from an experimental\nfield for research in the city of Paraipaba, Brazil, in\
    \ which cashews and other raw materials were grown.\nWe also report that the dataset\
    \ will be made publicly available to ensure the reproducibility of our results\n\
    and promote research developments in this field (see Supplementary Materials).\n\
    The use of real soil moisture data from the data set in the water balance approach\
    \ saved as\nmuch as 90.4% of the IWN obtained for the water balance when using\
    \ only weather and crop data.\nZscore and MZscore applied to the real moisture\
    \ data saved 89.3% of IWN, optimizing the tradeoff\nbetween IWN saving and healthy\
    \ crop development. For the matric potential approach, Zscore and\nMZscore obtained\
    \ (on average) 20.7% and 14.1% of the IWN savings obtained by matric potential\n\
    without the use of any outlier removal technique. Considerating a ﬁeld without\
    \ soil moisture sensors,\nwe obtained a reduction between 56.4% and 90% of the\
    \ water balance IWN based on only weather\nand crop data, when we use our global\
    \ and local approaches to predict the soil moisture data. Zscore,\nMZscore, and\
    \ Chauvenet preprocess the predicted data to optimize the tradeoff without outweighing\n\
    the performance of water balance using real moisture data. We do not recommend\
    \ the use of predicted\ndata in the matric potential approach, as the computational\
    \ models (with errors) outperform mostly\nthe same approach using real data in\
    \ terms of water savings, according to our results.\nSupplementary Materials:\

    \ some examples of conﬁgurations composed of a crop, soil, weather,\nand an irrigation\
    \ system. The house is next to the entrance of the farm and has a connection to\n\
    the Internet. The house also hosts devices that connect sensor nodes in the ﬁeld\
    \ to the Internet.\nAutomatic weather stations make weather data available on\
    \ the Internet.\nIn this work, we address ﬁelds with one type of crop whose soil\
    \ has analog (Field 2) or digital\ntensiometers (Field 3) monitoring the moisture\
    \ at more than one depth z. Tensiometers installed\nat different points b of the\
    \ ﬁeld gather readings of the matric potential ψm. Mathematical models\nuse ψm\
    \ to measure the soil moisture θ as the level of water retention in the type of\
    \ soil. We use the\nVan Genuchten Model [57] to express θ as the volume of water\
    \ by the volume of soil (cm3/cm3),\nas Equation (A1) shows:\nθ(ψm) = θr +\nθs\
    \ − θr\n[1 + (α × |ψm|)n]1− 1\nn\n,\n(A1)\nwhere θr is the residual water content,\
    \ θs is the saturated water content, α is related to the inverse of\nthe air entry\
    \ suction, and n is a measure of the pore-size distribution in the soil (e.g.,\
    \ Table 2 has these\nVan Genutchen constants for the experimental ﬁeld soil).\n\
    The management of matric potential estimates the irrigation water need (IWN) for\
    \ a ﬁeld with\nsoil sensors (e.g., Field 3 of Figure A1) taking into account the\
    \ soil moisture at the monitored depths zi,\nas Equation (A2) shows:\nIWN = (θ\
    \ f c,z1 − θcr,z1) × z1 + (θ f c,z2 − θc,z2) × z2 + (θ f c,z3 − θc,z3) × z3\n\
    E f\n,\n(A2)\nwhere:\n•\nzi represent the thickness of soil along the proﬁle (monitored\
    \ depth);\n•\nθ f c represents the ﬁeld capacity at a depth z after the drainage\
    \ of water excess, which is a constant\nobtained by a laboratory soil analysis;\n\
    •\nθcr is the ideal moisture for irrigation, signaling when the crop productivity\
    \ starts to decline;\n•\nθc is the current soil moisture. In matric potential\
    \ management, we initialize the irrigation by\nθc,z1 ≤ θcr; and\n•\nE f is the\
    \ efﬁciency of the irrigation system used in the ﬁeld.\nWater balance management\
    \ computes the IWN for an interval of n days, comparing the inputs and\noutputs\
    \ of water in the soil by using the daily crop evapotranspiration ETc, the rainfall\
    \ R, and ∆A =\n(θ f c − θc)z which represents the soil moisture at the crop root\
    \ zone z through Equation (A3).\nIWN = ∑n\ni=1(ETc,i − Ri) − ∆A\nE f\n.\n(A3)\n\
    The value Ef is the efficiency of the irrigation system placed in the field. The\
    \ crop evapotranspiration\nETc represents the water consumption by a type of crop\
    \ at its current life development stage, which is\ngiven by:\nETc = ETo × kc.\n\
    (A4)\nThe Penman-Monteith model [61] estimates the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ ETo using weather\ndata. Each type of crop, without hydrological restriction,\
    \ has a speciﬁc coefﬁcient curve in which the\ncrop coefﬁcient kc varies from\
    \ 0 to 1.5 with the number days since the planting of the crop.\nSensors 2020,\

    \ Problem of Soil Moisture Prediction\nLet B = {b1, . . . , bn} be the set of\
    \ tensiometers monitoring the soil moisture of a ﬁeld at n different\npoints.\
    \ A tensiometer bj gathers the sample (ψj,15, ψj,45, ψj,75), which consists of\
    \ the matric potential\nψ readings at 15, 45, and 75 cm depths, respectively,\
    \ at a point j. Let W = {w1, . . . , wn} be the set of\nwater amount given to\
    \ the crop at n different points by an irrigation system. Irrigation management\n\
    calculates W using the Equations (A2) and (A3), for example.\nThe weather data\
    \ are required, as the climatic conditions affect a crop’s need for soil water\
    \ and\nrainfall can increase the soil moisture. Therefore, we assume that there\
    \ is a weather station ms close to the\nfield which provides the meteorological\
    \ data set Mms = {Tmin, Tmax, RHmin, RHmax, Rn,U2, P, Ri}, where:\n•\nTmin and\
    \ Tmax are the minimum and maximum air temperature, respectively;\n•\nRHmin and\
    \ RHmax are the minimum and maximum relative humidity, respectively;\n•\nRn is\
    \ the net radiation;\n•\nU2 is the wind speed;\n•\nP is the atmospheric pressure;\
    \ and\n•\nRi is the rainfall.\nWithin a daily time interval, there are several\
    \ observations about the weather and ﬁeld. We denote\nby O the collection of observations,\
    \ which consists of (t, B, Mms, W, kc), recorded within a time t over\na day.\
    \ The irrigation scheduling methods presented in Appendix A decide to start precise\
    \ irrigation\nwhen the current moisture θc,z1 is low at the superﬁcial layer of\
    \ soil (z1 = 15 cm). Therefore, the matric\npotential ψi,15 is analyzed daily\
    \ to achieve θc,z1 using the Van Genutchen model (Equation (A1)). In this\nwork,\
    \ we wish to monitor the level of soil moisture without soil sensors (i.e., tensiometers).\n\
    Let y(i, Mms, wi, kc) be a function that, given the monitoring point i, the meteorological\
    \ variables\nMms, the irrigation water amount wi at the point i, and the crop\
    \ coefﬁcient kc returns ψi,15 (the matric\npotential at a depth of 15 cm). Then,\
    \ y(i, Mms, wi, kc) = ψi,15. We deﬁne the problem of soil moisture\nprediction\
    \ as the problem of ﬁnding an accurate function f for predicting y(i, Mms, wi,\
    \ kc), given all\nthe observations recorded in O.\nSensors 2020, 20, 190\n21 of\
    \ 25\nDeﬁnition A1. The problem of soil moisture prediction requires ﬁnding a\
    \ predictive function ˆf over the class\nof all possible predictive functions\
    \ H, such that\nˆf = argmin∆( f ),\n(A5)\nwhere f ∈ H and ∆ is a loss function\
    \ assessing the quality of a candidate predictive function f over the\nobservations\
    \ in O. In this work, we use the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute\
    \ Error\n(MAE) loss functions, deﬁned as:\n∆RMSE( f ) =\nv\nu\nu\nt 1\n|O′|\n\
    ∑\n(i,Mms,wi,kc)∈O′\n( f (i, Mms, wi, kc) − y(i, Mms, wi, kc))2, and\n(A6)\n∆MAE(\
    \ f ) =\n1\n|O′|\n∑\n(i,Mms,wi,kc)∈O′\n| f (i, Mms, wi, kc) − y(i, Mms, wi, kc)|,\n\
    (A7)\nwhere O’ is the set of observations used to assess the quality of the prediction\
    \ and f (i, Mms, wi, kc) is the estimate\nreturned by function f for y(i, Mms,\
    \ wi, kc). The smaller the value yielded by the above loss functions, the better\n\
    the predictive performance of f.\nWe employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to\
    \ address the problem of soil moisture prediction.\nMore speciﬁcally, we aim at\
    \ learning, from the observations in O, some function ˆf that minimizes the\n\
    error measured by ∆. We train the prediction models on a data set containing examples\
    \ built from\npast sensor observations (see Section 4.2). The ML techniques for\
    \ regression tasks used in this work\nare: Linear Regression [46], Decision Stump\

    Get rights and content Abstract The problem of real-time irrigation scheduling
    under limited water supply is considered. The goal is to develop an irrigation
    operation policy which maximizes crop yields and is responsive to current season
    changes in weather and other variables. Because irrigation decisions are sequential
    and dependent on crop and soil water status, and also because crop yields can
    only be known at the end of the season, the decisions are arrived at by a two-stage
    process. In the first or the design stage, irrigations are planned for the entire
    season at weekly intervals using historical data and an optimal irrigation scheduling
    model. In the second stage, the decisions for the subsequent weeks are revised
    each week after updating the status of the system with real time data up to that
    week and solving the irrigation optimization model once again for the new conditions.
    Thus, each week an irrigation decision is made, the entire planning horizon is
    kept in view. The procedure is illustrated by application to a case study. References

    stochastic mathematical programming methods were proposed for agricultural water
    management (Alaya et al., 2003; Du et al., 2012; Fu et al., 2014; Huang et al.,

    methods, interval stochastic programming is effective for solving problems where

    or probability distributions. Show abstract Irrigation control based on model

    methods have considered and actual weather data are used instead of forecasts

    and intra-seasonal water allocations subject to seasonal water limitations (Bras
    and Cordova (1981); Dudley et al. (1971); Yaron and Dinar (1982); Rao et al. (1992);
    Protopapas and Georgakakos (1990); Sunantara and Ramirez (1997)). Nonetheless,
    getting no feedback on crop soil conditions during the calculation stages, could
    lead to large propagation errors. Show abstract Land and water management planning

    Abstract [1] Estimation of evapotranspiration using satellite sensors offers the
    potential for improved water management in irrigated areas. However, previous
    applications of remote sensing to estimate crop water use have been retrospective
    in nature, whereas the spatial resolution of sensors that provide information
    in real time has been thought to be too coarse for such purposes. We describe
    application of a variation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) standard evapotranspiration algorithm for near-real-time method for estimation
    of actual evapotranspiration based entirely on satellite data. The latency of
    the approach is typically 3 days to 1 week, although the lag could be reduced.
    The method works best over areas where there is substantial diversity in vegetation
    types within the remote sensing window; the contrast in vegetation between irrigated
    and adjacent unirrigated areas meets this requirement well. The satellite sensors/products
    are MODIS land cover (MOD12Q1), surface reflectance (MOD09GQ), vegetation indices
    (MOD13Q1), land surface temperature/emissivity (MOD11A1), and albedo (MCD43A3)
    and NOAA/NESDIS surface radiation budget (SRB) products derived from the Geostationary
    Operational Environmental Satellites. The MODIS/SRB evapotranspiration estimates
    agree favorably with ground flux tower observations and evapotranspiration estimates
    from a much higher resolution Landsat-based (METRIC) method over irrigated areas
    of the Klamath River Basin, with instantaneous evapotranspiration biases less
    than 10% and daily evapotranspiration biases less than 15%. There is a tendency
    for the MODIS/SRB approach to underestimate, and for the METRIC-based algorithm
    to overestimate, seasonal evapotranspiration relative to the tower flux observations.
    1. Introduction [2] Over most of the global land area, evapotranspiration (ET)
    is the second largest (after precipitation) component of the water cycle. It is
    a product of complex interactions among atmospheric demand, and soil and vegetation
    conditions which control supply. In general, ET is poorly observed as compared
    with the other major terms in the surface water balance, and for this reason,
    it is often estimated either by difference in land surface and atmospheric water
    budgets, or through use of predictive models. From the standpoint of water management,
    irrigation is by far the largest human consumptive use of water globally [e.g.,
    Döll and Siebert, 2002], however its estimation is often complicated by the fact
    that irrigation return flows are poorly observed. Implementation of improved irrigation
    practices requires high-quality observations of crop water use, and analytical
    tools for developing feasible alternative scenarios [Prajamwong et al., 1997;
    Cai et al., 2003; Lecina and Playan, 2006]. To date, the former has been based
    mostly on in situ observations. Furthermore, most water management models assume
    that the consumptive use of water for irrigation is fixed and ignore interannual
    variations, instead taking estimates from, for instance, water rights allocations
    [e.g., Hamlet and Lettenmaier, 1999; Christensen et al., 2004]. Better estimation
    of ET presumably could lead to more efficient use of water, especially in arid
    and semiarid areas [Budyko, 1974; Sala et al., 1992; Milly, 1994; Reynolds et
    al., 2000; Bouwer et al., 2007]. [3] Crop water use depends on surface atmospheric
    conditions, crop characteristics, and the type of irrigation (e.g., sprinkler
    versus flood), as well as soil moisture where ET is not occurring freely. Traditionally,
    crop water use has been computed from meteorological data and pan evaporation
    measurements [Allen et al., 1998]. Because point measurements are generally valid
    only locally, ET so computed is usually relative to reference crops transpiring
    freely (that is, at the potential rate), rather than actual ET, which can vary
    spatially over fairly short length scales, especially in the presence of topographic
    and/or soil variations. For these reasons, it is difficult using traditional methods
    to estimate space-time variations in crop water use based on point observations
    of meteorological quantities. [4] Satellite remote sensing provides a promising
    alternative to estimation of crop water use as it represents directly the spatial
    variation in ET at spatial scales ranging from local to regional. A number of
    different methods have been developed to use satellite remote sensing data for
    ET estimation [Carlson et al., 1995; Bastiaanssen et al., 1998a, 1998b, 2005;
    Courault et al., 2005; Nagler et al., 2005; Allen et al., 2007a, 2007b; Cleugh
    et al., 2007; Mu et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2007]. Most of these studies have
    used some combination of remote sensing estimates of surface radiation, temperature,
    and vegetation properties, and ground-based surface and atmospheric observations
    to estimate latent heat flux as a residual in a surface energy balance. Some of
    these schemes have been used successfully for estimation of ET from irrigated
    areas and to infer net groundwater pumping for irrigation [see, e.g., Tasumi et
    al., 2005; Allen et al., 2005; Consoli et al., 2006]. A major drawback of most
    of these schemes is that they require some surface meteorological data, the availability
    of which is often limited especially in near real time. The resulting estimates
    of ET, while useful for planning studies for which retrospective estimates are
    sufficient, do not have the potential for use in near-real-time water management
    decision making. [5] A method known as the VI-Ts method can be implemented in
    a way that avoids the requirement for surface meteorological data. It is based
    on the combination of vegetation index (VI) and surface temperature (Ts), both
    of which can be retrieved from satellite remote sensing [Nemani and Running, 1989;
    Carlson et al., 1995; Gillies et al., 1997; Jiang and Islam, 2001]. In the VI-Ts
    method, a scatterplot of VI versus Ts shows a linear or triangular form with a
    negative correlation between VI and Ts. Dense vegetation with higher VI has lower
    Ts. Bare soil and sparse vegetation becomes warmer relative to vegetation with
    higher VI values as the surface becomes drier. The VI-Ts diagram algorithm can
    be applied in a way that avoids the requirement for in situ observations of surface
    temperature by using remotely sensed radiative surface temperature rather than
    in situ measurements. An important requirement of the VI-Ts method is that adequate
    contrast in conditions (that is, variations in VI and Ts) exist over the area
    to which the algorithm is to be applied [Roerink et al., 2000; Courault et al.,
    2005]. The VI-Ts method is problematic if the vegetation and/or surface temperature
    variations over the remote sensing window have a small range of variation. This
    limits the use of the method over relatively homogeneous surfaces such as desert
    and some forest types. Tang et al. [2007] tested the VI-Ts method using AmeriFlux
    tower observations in California. Their results show that while there are substantial
    discrepancies in instantaneous estimation of ET at sites in savanna and forest
    ecosystems, the long-term biases can be significantly reduced for long averaging
    times. In any event, the VI-Ts method is expected to work best over areas where
    there is substantial diversity in vegetation types within the remote sensing window.
    One condition where this restriction is well met is the substantial contrast in
    VI and Ts across the interface between irrigated cropland and surrounding areas;
    hence in principle the method should be well suited for estimation of irrigated
    crop water use. [6] This paper uses a variation of the VI-Ts algorithm of Nishida
    et al. [2003], applied using MODIS-based VI and Ts, with particular attention
    to irrigated areas and near-real-time estimation. The method does not require
    surface meteorological data. The satellite sensors/products are MODIS land cover
    (MOD12Q1), surface reflectance (MOD09GQ), vegetation indices (MOD13Q1), land surface
    temperature/emissivity (MOD11A1), and albedo (MCD43A3), and NOAA/NESDIS surface
    radiation budget (SRB) products derived from the Geostationary Operational Environmental
    Satellites (GOES). The NOAA/NESDIS SRB data have a latency of 2 days from real
    time. The effective latency of our approach is determined by the MODIS products
    which typically are available within 3 days to 1 week of real time, although this
    could be reduced by use of MODIS Rapid Response data. The details of the implementation
    are described in the following section. 2. Methodology [7] Figure 1 summarizes
    the VI-Ts method as we have implemented it. A key assumption of the method is
    that the evaporative fraction (EF [Shuttleworth et al., 1989]), defined as the
    ratio of ET to available energy Q, is nearly constant. The constant EF hypothesis
    is robust although variably cloudy weather and proximity to surface discontinuities
    or fronts may cause significant variability in the EF [Sugita and Brutsaert, 1991;
    Brutsaert and Sugita, 1992; Nichols and Cuenca, 1993; Crago, 1996]. Hoedjes et
    al. [2008] found that EF is almost constant under dry conditions, but has a pronounced
    concave upward shape under wet conditions in semiarid Morocco. Gentine et al.
    [2007] showed that EF is almost independent of the major forcing factors, namely,
    incoming solar radiation and wind speed, due to compensating effects that are
    traced to the elements of EF itself, although these compensating effects can have
    strong dependence on soil moisture availability and canopy cover. They also find
    that the soil component of EF is less variable than is the vegetation component.
    The constant EF hypothesis allows instantaneous estimates of the evaporative fraction
    at MODIS overpass times to be extrapolated to estimate daily average ET, if Q
    can be estimated. By energy conservation, Q equals net radiation (Rn) minus soil
    heat flux (G). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flowchart of the processes
    (rectangles) and variables (italics) in the ET estimation algorithm. [8] The landscape
    is simplified as a mixture of vegetation and bare soil. The proportion of vegetation,
    fveg whose value is between 0 and 1, is related to normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI): where NDVI is defined as a ratio of red reflectance (Rred) and near-infrared
    reflectance (Rnir): NDVImax and NDVImin are the NDVI of full vegetation and bare
    soil. Intercalibration of NDVI from MODIS and AVHRR by Steven et al. [2003] resulted
    in the estimate MODIS NDVI = 1.103 × NOAA/AVHRR NDVI + 0.004 [Sun et al., 2007].
    We therefore used NDVImax of 0.83 and NDVImin of 0.22 for MODIS data, based on
    NDVImax of 0.75 and NDVImin of 0.2 for NOAA/AVHRR data [Nishida et al., 2003].
    For near-real-time implementation, we calculated NDVI from MODIS daily surface
    reflectance data (MOD09GQ) using an 8-day maximum compositing method, while the
    16-day maximum compositing vegetation index product (MOD13Q1) is used as auxiliary
    data for retrospective estimation [Huete et al., 1994; Vermote and Vermeulen,
    1999]. NDVI evolves over time scales that are slow enough that use of the 8-day
    (lagging) composite rather than a central 8-day window, which would be used for
    retrospective analysis, dues not make much difference. Assuming a negligible coupled
    energy transfer between vegetation and ET from bare soil, ET from a pixel is estimated
    as a linear combination of ET from vegetation and ET from bare soil: where ETveg
    and ETsoil are ET from vegetation and ET from bare soil, respectively. Combining
    the definition of EF and equation (3), the EF of a pixel is: where the subscripts
    “veg” and “soil” denote vegetation and bare soil, respectively. Evaporation fraction
    for vegetation is calculated as: where α is the Priestley-Taylor parameter, which
    we set to 1.26 [De Bruin, 1983]; Δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure
    in term of temperature (Pa K−1); and γ is the psychometric constant (Pa K−1).
    rc is surface resistance of the vegetation canopy (s m−1), estimated following
    Jarvis [1976] as: where Ta is air temperature (°C); PAR is photosynthetic active
    radiation (μ mol m−2 s−1); VPD is the vapor pressure deficit (Pa); ψ is leaf water
    potential (Pa); rcMIN is the minimum resistance (s m−1). rcuticle is the canopy
    resistance related to diffusion through the cuticle layer of leaves which we set
    to 100,000 (s m−1) following the Biome-BGC model [White et al., 2000]. In equation
    (6), only temperature and PAR can be estimated from satellite data and radiative
    transfer calculations, leaving terms in VPD, ψ and CO2 to be estimated from other
    sources. Following Nishida et al. [2003], we drop the terms in VPD, ψ and CO2
    (f2, f4 and f5), which avoids the need for data sources other than satellite.
    PAR data were taken from the NOAA/NESDIS SRB product, as was downward solar radiation.
    Following Jarvis [1976]: where Tn, To, Tx are minimum, optimal and maximum temperatures
    for stomatal activity, and set to be 2.7, 31.1, and 45.3°C respectively. A is
    a parameter related to photon absorption efficiency at low light intensity which
    we set to 152 (μ mol m−2 s−1). Aerodynamic resistance ra was calculated following
    empirical formulae [Kondo, 2000]: where U50m and U1m are wind speed at 50 m and
    1 m heights, respectively (m s−1). Wind speed was inferred from the aerodynamic
    resistance of bare soil (1/ra soil = 0.0015U1m) which in turn was estimated using
    methods outlined below. The land cover for bare soil, forest, grassland, and cropland
    was obtained from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land
    cover in the MODIS Land Cover Classification products (MOD12Q1) [Belward et al.,
    1999]. The classification schemes used in that data set are multitemporal classifications
    describing land cover properties as observed during 2004. The evaporative fraction
    for bare soil was estimated as: where Tsoil max is the estimated maximum possible
    bare soil surface temperature; Tsoil is bare soil surface temperature, Qsoil 0
    is the available energy when Tsoil is equal to Ta (W m−2); Qsoil is available
    energy over bare soil surface (W m−2). The temperatures Tsoil max, Tsoil, and
    Ta are estimated using the VI-Ts diagram [Nemani and Running, 1989; Nishida et
    al., 2003]. The surface temperature Ts is obtained from MODIS land surface temperature
    (LST) product MOD11A1. For days when the retrieval LST is unavailable (mostly
    because of cloudy conditions), the LST for the closest available day is used instead.
    About one third of the LST data are unavailable during the study period. This
    may introduce errors because the surface temperature can have large day-to-day
    variations. However, small day-to-day variations of EF and energy conservation
    effectively constrain errors from this source. Although the MODIS LST product
    has a latency of 3 days to 1 week, The MODIS Rapid Response (RR) System provides
    LST within a few hours of satellite overpass. The biases of MODIS RR LST are generally
    small despite the presence of some larger outliers [Pinheiro et al., 2007]. Therefore,
    although we used the MODIS standard products, the time lag of the approach could
    be significantly reduced. Tsoil max is assumed to occur when ET is zero, in which
    case: where ρ is the air density (kg m−3); CP is the specific heat of air under
    constant pressure (J kg−1 K−1) [Allen et al., 1998]. Equation (11) was used to
    retrieve aerodynamic resistance of bare soil (ra soil) and in turn the inferred
    wind speed [Kondo, 2000; Nishida et al., 2003]. [9] In our application, VI and
    Ts come from twice daily EOS Terra overpasses at around 1100 and 2130 local time
    (LT). Rather than estimating instantaneous downward shortwave radiation from MODIS-based
    cloud data (MOD09GA), we use hourly NOAA/NESDIS surface radiation budget (SRB)
    products derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES),
    in particular, the hourly NOAA/NESDIS SRB product [Pinker and Laszlo, 1992; Menzel
    and Purdom, 1994]. The instantaneous radiation data are provided hourly at 15
    min after the hour (e.g., 0115, 0215 UTC…). The closest instantaneous radiation
    to the MODIS overpass time is used for the instantaneous ET estimation. Reflected
    solar radiation was based on the MODIS albedo product MCD43A3 [Jin et al., 2003a,
    2003b; Wan et al., 2004]. Emitted longwave radiation was computed using the MODIS
    surface temperature interpolated to hourly values using a sine-cosine fit as in
    the work by Allen [1976], which was applied also to the MODIS surface emissivity
    product MOD11A1 [Jin and Liang, 2006]. Downward longwave radiation was computed
    by assuming the effective atmospheric temperature for emitted longwave radiation
    is 20 K lower than air temperature following Kondo [2000]. On a daily scale, the
    soil heat flux (G) can be neglected and was set to zero [Seguin and Itier, 1983].
    For purposes of instantaneous available energy estimation, G over the full vegetated
    part of the pixel was assumed to be small, and G for bare soil part was computed
    as a proportion (CG) of the net radiation where CG is an empirical coefficient
    of 0.4 [Idso et al., 1975]. 3. Study Area and Data [10] Our study area is a cropland
    area (part of which is irrigated and part of which is nonirrigated) of the Upper
    Klamath River Basin (Figure 2). The Klamath River drains an arid interior basin
    along the Oregon-California border in its upper reaches, and then passes through
    a gorge in the Coast Range before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The Klamath
    River Basin has become a focal point for local and national discussions on water
    management and water scarcity [Powers et al., 2005] following well publicized
    controversies over the last several years associated with competition among water
    users, mostly irrigators, Native Americans, and fish and aquatic habitat interests.
    Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Upper Klamath River Basin study area
    showing irrigated fields (IFs) and nonirrigated fields (NIFs) and locations of
    observation sites KL03 and KL04. [11] Two Bowen ratio measurement systems were
    operated by the second, third and fourth authors at sites designated KL03 and
    KL04 within the study domain from April to October 2004. KL03 (42°37′43.4″, −121°57′17.8″)
    is situated in a nonirrigated field, whereas KL04 (42°43′11.9″, −122°0′41.3″)
    is in irrigated cropland (Figure 2). The stations are located so as to have uniform
    vegetative conditions in the predominant upwind direction, i.e., on the order
    of 500 to 1,000 m. Thus the vertical gradients of air temperature and relative
    humidity tend to be stable at any point in time. Both sites also include soil
    heat flux plates (HFP01SC, Huskeflux, Delft, The Netherlands), net radiometers
    (Q7.1, REBS, Portland, OR), fine wire thermocouples (TCBR-3, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., Logan, UT), soil temperature sensors (TCAV, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    UT), soil moisture sensors (CS616, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) and infrared
    gas analyzers (LI-6262, LI-COR Inc, Lincoln, NE). (See Cuenca and Mahrt [2004]
    for a more complete description.) The data were aggregated to 20-min intervals
    for all components of the energy balance. We acquired the data required to run
    the Nishida et al. [2003] algorithm as described in 2 for the same period (1 April
    to 31 October 2004) for which the field observations were available. [12] For
    comparison purposes, we implemented a slight modification of the METRIC algorithm
    of Allen et al. [2007b], which is in turn based on the SEBAL algorithm of Bastiaanssen
    et al. [1998a]. Both SEBAL and METRIC use VI and Ts information from high-resolution
    Landsat data (typically order of 30 m, as contrasted with 250 to 1,000 m for MODIS),
    but they do not use the VI-Ts relationship as does the Nishida et al. [2003] algorithm.
    Instead, NDVI is used to estimate surface emissivity and Ts is used for estimation
    of outgoing longwave radiation, soil heat flux, momentum roughness length and
    Monin-Obukov stability length scale using semiempirical and theoretical relationships.
    Although Landsat data are not available in near real time, and the revisit time
    is much longer than for MODIS (16 days in the case of Landsat 7 versus daily for
    MODIS), they do provide a useful basis for comparing the MODIS-based algorithm
    that we apply in near real time. [13] Landsat images were used for the METRIC-based
    ET estimates. The study area is located in Path45/Row30 of the Landsat images.
    The images were collected in Scan Line Corrector (SLC)–off mode on 22 April, 25
    June, 27 July and 28 August 2004. The image on 22 April was partially impaired
    by snow cover. The seasonal ET in the crop growth period from 11 April to 7 October
    was estimated by linearly interpolating the reference ET fraction values (ETcrop/ETref)
    for periods between consecutive satellite images, and multiplying by observed
    ETref. [14] Our strategy for evaluation of the near-real-time approach was (1)
    to compare the MODIS/SRB approach with the Bowen Ratio ET observations by extracting
    the MODIS grid cell within which the observation sites lie from the seasonal (daily)
    ET estimates for summer 2004 and (2) to compare the spatial variability of ET
    estimates at the MODIS spatial resolution for the MODIS/SRB estimates and the
    METRIC-based estimates on the days during summer 2004 for which there were Landsat
    retrievals. On these days, we compared both the inferred instantaneous ET estimates
    from the MODIS/SRB approach with METRIC-based, as well as the inferred daily averages.
    The MODIS AM overpass is usually at about 1100 LT whereas the Landsat overpass
    is at 1139 LT; therefore direct comparison of the two instantaneous estimates
    is feasible. 4. Results [15] We first compared the downward shortwave radiation
    (Rd) at the KL03 and KL04 tower sites with the NOAA/NESDIS SRB product at the
    Terra overpass times. The shortwave radiation from NOAA/NESDIS SRB product is
    generally in agreement with the flux tower measurements, especially in the seasonal
    mean. The biases are −4% and −3% of the averaged downward shortwave radiation
    (data not shown) at the KL03 and KL04 sites, respectively. The root mean squared
    errors, however, were quite large (181 and 164 W m−2, or 25% and 23% of the mean
    values at each site, respectively). Relatively large differences in the instantaneous
    values are not surprising given the 0.5 degree spatial resolution of the SRB product,
    which is being compared with point observations. Figure 3 compares the daily mean
    downward shortwave radiation from the NOAA/NESDIS SRB products and observations
    at KL03 and KL04 sites. The fact that the daily root mean square errors (RMSEs)
    are much lower as a fraction of the mean (13% and 12% for KL03 and KL04, respectively)
    confirms that the agreement is much better as the averaging time increases, and
    implies that agreement of the MODIS/SRB and observed ET should improve with averaging
    time as well. Figure 4 compares the daily mean net radiation from the MODIS/SRB
    estimates and observations at KL03 and KL04 sites. The RMSEs are 15% and 14% of
    the mean of KL03 and KL04, respectively. The net radiation is slightly overestimated.
    The correlation coefficient (R2) between the flux tower observation and MODIS/SRB
    estimates are 0.87 and 0.90 for KL03 and KL04, respectively. Figure 3 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of daily downward shortwave radiation from
    the NOAA/NESDIS SRB products and observations at KL03 and KL04 sites from 1 April
    to 31 October 2004. (a and b) KL03 and (c and d) KL04. Mean values and RMSEs over
    the period are given in the plots. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison
    of daily net radiation from the MODIS/SRB estimates and observations at KL03 and
    KL04 sites from 1 April to 31 October 2004. (a and b) KL03 and (c and d) KL04.
    Mean values and RMSEs over the period are given in the plots. [16] Figure 5 compares
    instantaneous ET observations with the MODIS/SRB estimates at the MODIS overpass
    times and for the MODIS pixels within which the measurement sites lie. Observed
    ET values are similar for both the KL03 (nonirrigated) and KL04 (irrigated) sites
    at the beginning of the crop growth season because the soil is close to saturation
    in the spring and the groundwater table is close to the surface. The observations
    begin to diverge through the summer as the nonirrigated site dries out. Figures
    5a and 5c show that the MODIS/SRB approach compares favorably with the ET observations
    over most of the evaluation period. Figure 5a indicates, however, that the MODIS/SRB
    approach does not match the ET observations in mid-April, which may in part have
    to do with some remaining snow cover, and/or locally standing water during that
    time. METRIC-based results (when available) agree favorably with the instantaneous
    ET observations. In general, the error statistics reported in Figure 5 show that
    performance of the satellite-based method is similar for both clear-sky and cloudy
    conditions at both sites. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparisons
    of instantaneous ET (at MODIS overpass times at around 1100 LT) estimated using
    the MODIS/SRB approach with observations. METRIC-based estimates are also shown
    on dates for which Landsat imagery was available. (a and b) KL03 and (c and d)
    KL04. The blue dots in Figures 5b and 5d indicate clear-sky conditions as specified
    by the NOAA/NESDIS SRB products. Mean values and RMSEs over the period are given
    in the plots. [17] Figure 6 compares daily mean ET from observations, and the
    MODIS/SRB approach and METRIC-based estimates (when available). The daily mean
    ET is calculated from daily mean available energy and instantaneous EF at the
    time of satellite overpasses using the constant EF hypothesis. The RMSE of the
    MODIS/SRB approach is generally less for the daily mean ET than for the instantaneous
    ET. The performance for clear-sky and cloudy conditions is similar, suggesting
    that cloud effects on radiation partitioning are reasonably well accounted for
    by the NOAA/NESDIS SRB products. The results also imply that the lack of remote
    sensing land surface temperature under cloudy conditions does not detract much
    from the ET estimation performance. As expected, the estimated ET rate at the
    irrigated site KL04 is generally larger than that at the nonirrigated site KL03,
    especially following the dry-down of the nonirrigated site from wet spring conditions.
    The performance of ET estimates at the irrigated site is similar as that at the
    nonirrigated site. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparisons of daily
    mean ET from observations, MODIS/SRB approach, and METRIC-based estimates (when
    available). The time series and scatterplot comparison at (a and b) KL03 site
    and (c and d) KL04. The blue dots in Figures 6b and 6d indicate clear-sky conditions.
    Mean values and RMSEs over the period are given in the plots. [18] Figure 7 shows
    the measured instantaneous EF (20 min interval during which the satellite overpass
    occurred) and daily mean EF at the KL03 and KL04 sites. The mean instantaneous
    EF is 0.51 and the mean day EF is 0.58 at the KL03 site. The day EF is 14% larger
    than the instantaneous EF, which suggests that the MODIS/SRB approach, which applies
    an instantaneous EF to the entire day, may result in a downward bias in its daily
    ET estimates. Figure 6 shows that the averaged ET values from the MODIS/SRB approach
    are less than observations for both KL03 and KL04 sites, and therefore the assumption
    of constant daily EF should have contributed to underestimation of daily ET in
    the MODIS/SRB approach. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Measured instantaneous
    and daily mean EF at the KL03 and KL04. The time series and scatterplot comparison
    at (a and b) KL03 and (c and d) KL04. Mean values and RMSEs over the period are
    given in the plots. [19] The daily mean ET maps from the MODIS/SRB approach and
    METRIC-based approach are shown in Figure 8. The MODIS/SRB and METRIC-based estimates
    show similar spatial and temporal variations for both irrigated and nonirrigated
    fields at a broad level; for instance, estimated ET at nonirrigated site KL03
    is less than that irrigated site KL04 for both methods and all three dates. On
    25 June, the MODIS/SRB approach gives higher ET values in the irrigated field.
    On 27 July, the MODIS/SRB shows similar patterns as the METRIC-based map in the
    irrigated and nonirrigated fields. Both maps show lower ET values in the southern
    nonirrigated field although the lowest value of METRIC-based ET is lower than
    the MODIS/SRB ET in this region. The lower ET values in the southern nonirrigated
    field are captured by the MODIS/SRB approach and METRIC-based approach on 28 August.
    METRIC-based ET is generally larger than from MODIS/SRB in the irrigated fields
    on 28 August. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial distribution of
    daily ET and difference between MODIS/SRB and METRIC-based approach for the region
    shown in Figure 2 on 25 June, 27 July, and 28 August 2004. Irrigated and nonirrigated
    areas are as shown in Figure 2. [20] Table 1 summarizes the seasonal ET at the
    two Bowen ratio stations, as compared with METRIC-based (linearly interpolated
    to the season) and MODIS/SRB. The estimation using the METRIC-based approach was
    made by maintaining the crop ET (satellite-based) to reference ET (ground-based)
    ratio (ETcrop/ETref) constant until the next satellite overpass, multiplying by
    the daily ETref and summing the results. The ETcrop/ETref ratio was adjusted at
    the time of the next satellite overpass and the procedure repeated until the end
    of the growing season. The METRIC-based approach overestimates ET by 20% at the
    KL03 station relative to the Bowen ratio observations and 5% at the KL04 site.
    The MODIS/SRB approach underestimates evapotranspiration by about 14% at both
    the KL03 and KL04 sites. The underestimation of the MODIS/SRB approach appears
    to be the result primarily of downward bias in EF resulting from the assumption
    of constant EF throughout the day, and to a lesser extent, downward bias in downward
    shortwave radiation. Overestimation by the METRIC-based approach occurs because
    of the small number of satellite images used, which are for clear sky conditions.

    sky dates relative to MODIS/SRB, there is no obvious difference in the results,
    which have differences in the absolute mean of around 1 mm d−1. Figure 9 Open

    5. Application to Regional Near-Real-Time ET Monitoring [22] The approach outlined
    above was extended into a regional near-real-time ET estimation system for the
    crop areas and grassland of northern California and southern Oregon, specifically
    the region between 37.5 N to 44 N latitude and west of longitude 119.5 W. We define
    the cropland and grassland areas according to the IGBP land cover from MODIS Land
    Cover Classification products MOD12Q1. Our rationale for including both cropland
    and grassland is that there is some likelihood of misclassification between croplands
    and grasslands, but less so between these categories and forest, or related classifications
    such as woodland. [23] For this purpose, near-real-time MODIS data products were
    extracted from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC)
    at the USGS EROS Data Center. NCEP surface downward shortwave radiation data were
    obtained from NOAA/NESDIS SRB data set which are archived and distributed at the
    University of Maryland. We used NDVI calculated from MODIS surface reflectance
    data (MOD09GQ) which is available with a lag of about 3 days from real time. [24]
    The temporal and spatial variability of ET in the crop areas and grassland is
    of particular interest. Figure 10 shows the evaporative fraction EF, instantaneous
    evapotranspiration (ETins) at the Terra AM overpass time of about 1100 LT, and
    daily mean evapotranspiration (ETday) estimates for 20 May 2008, 25 May 2008,
    2 June 2008, and 20 June 2008. There were summer storms over the region around
    25 May and little precipitation before 20 May and after 2 June. The ETins and
    ETday on 25 May were observed to be smaller than those on 20 May before storms
    in the southern part of the region. The ETins and ETday rates became large again
    on 2 June after the storm, although the evaporative fraction EF did not show significant
    changes. This implies that the available energy was reduced during the storms
    because of the cloud effects. The relatively high ET persists over the southern
    part of the domain and extends to northeast highlands on 2 June. The lower ET
    rate in the northeast highlands before the storm is likely due to the small evaporative
    fraction. The small evaporative fraction probably was the result of soil moisture
    stress. Soil moisture stress should have been reduced by the storm and the higher
    ET rate over the northeast highlands is the result. The spatial distribution of
    the final products of ETins and ETday are fairly similar to the distribution of
    the evaporative fraction EF at the regional scale. This implies that the spatial
    distribution of available energy has less impact on regional-scale ET spatial
    variability. However, there are considerable anomalies in ET patterns in comparison
    to the evaporative fraction EF in the southern part of the domain on 25 May. The
    anomaly indicates that the spatial pattern of available energy can substantially
    affect prestorm and poststorm ET spatial variability. Figure 10 Open in figure

    and daily evapotranspiration (ETday) for 22 May 2008, 25 May 2008, 30 May 2008,
    and 17 June 2008 over cropland and grassland. 6. Summary and Conclusions [25]
    We have illustrated a satellite-based method for near-real-time estimation of
    actual ET appropriate for application at regional scales which uses MODIS land
    cover, surface reflectance, vegetation indices, land surface temperature/emissivity,
    and albedo. Downward shortwave radiation is taken from a satellite based insolation
    algorithm, NOAA/NESDIS SRB product, with reflected shortwave radiation computed
    using MODIS albedo, and downward and emitted longwave radiation based on MODIS
    surface temperature and emissivity. ET is computed on a pixel by pixel basis for
    the instantaneous time of the satellite image and is scaled to daily averaged
    ET using an assumption of constant (daily) evaporative fraction. [26] In comparisons
    with surface Bowen ratio station observations at the time of satellite overpasses,
    the instantaneous ET differences between the MODIS-based system and ground observations
    are less than 10% on average. Daily mean ET differences between the operational
    system and the ground observations are less than 15%. The time series of daily
    ET is captured by the MODIS/SRB approach. [27] For both instantaneous and daily
    mean estimates, the MODIS/SRB approach agrees favorably with a Landsat-based model,
    METRIC. METRIC-based results overestimate seasonal ET by about 19% at the nonirrigated
    site and 5% at the irrigated site, whereas MODIS/SRB underestimates ET by about
    14% at both the nonirrigated and irrigated sites relative to Bowen ratio station
    observations. The reason for the underestimate of the MODIS/SRB approach appears
    to be related primarily to downward bias in the estimated evaporative fraction
    resulting from the assumption of constant EF over the day; this source of bias
    could be corrected. [28] The MODIS/SRB approach offers substantial potential for
    operational application given that both the MODIS and GOES based products are
    available in near real time. The latency of the approach (typically 3 days to
    1 week) is controlled by release of the MODIS products, but could be reduced substantially
    through use of MODIS Rapid Response products, in which case latency would be controlled
    by the lag of about 2 days in the SRB products. The approach is well suited to
    use in irrigated areas where the contrast in vegetation and surface temperature
    across the irrigated-unirrigated interface results in the VI-Ts plot being well
    populated, and hence a key assumption of the method being met. It is less useful
    in regions with relatively homogeneous vegetation/land cover surfaces such as
    desert and some forest conditions. Furthermore, as we have applied the method,
    no surface observations are required. The near-real-time spatially distributed
    maps of crop water use produced by a quasi-operational version of the system (http://www.hydro.washington.edu/forecast/rset_ca/)
    are expected to be useful in operational hydrological applications such as regional-scale
    water resources and irrigation management. Acknowledgments [29] The work described

    \ (ET) data for scheduling irrigations on vegetable farms is\nchallenging due\
    \ to imprecise crop coefﬁcients, time consuming computations, and the need to\n\
    simultaneously manage many ﬁelds. Meanwhile, the adoption of soil moisture monitoring\
    \ in\nvegetables has historically been limited by sensor accuracy and cost, as\
    \ well as labor required for\ninstallation, removal, and collection of readings.\
    \ With recent improvements in sensor technology,\npublic weather-station networks,\
    \ satellite and aerial imaging, wireless communications, and cloud\ncomputing,\
    \ many of the difﬁculties in using ET data and soil moisture sensors for irrigation\n\
    scheduling of vegetables can now be addressed. Web and smartphone applications\
    \ have been\ndeveloped that automate many of the calculations involved in ET-based\
    \ irrigation scheduling.\nSoil moisture sensor data can be collected through wireless\
    \ networks and accessed using web browser\nor smartphone apps. Energy balance\
    \ methods of crop ET estimation, such as eddy covariance\nand Bowen ratio, provide\
    \ research options for further developing and evaluating crop coefﬁcient\nguidelines\
    \ of vegetables, while recent advancements in surface renewal instrumentation\
    \ have led\nto a relatively low-cost tool for monitoring crop water requirement\
    \ in commercial farms. Remote\nsensing of crops using satellite, manned aircraft,\
    \ and UAV platforms may also provide useful tools\nfor vegetable growers to evaluate\
    \ crop development, plant stress, water consumption, and irrigation\nsystem performance.\n\

    1.1. Water Scarcity and Commercial Vegetable Production\nMost economically important\
    \ vegetable production regions of the world have Mediterranean,\nsemi-arid, or\
    \ desert climates in which supplemental irrigation is required to maximize yield\
    \ and\nquality. Efﬁcient irrigation management has become a major concern for\
    \ vegetable farmers in these\nareas as water supplies have become more restricted\
    \ and environmental impairments to ground and\nsurface water from agricultural\
    \ run-off and drainage has received more attention from regulatory\nagencies.\
    \ Agricultural water resources have become increasingly stressed in the vegetable\
    \ producing\nregions of Australia, Southern Europe, Chile, the Middle East, North\
    \ Africa, China, and the western\nUnited States. California has been under severe\
    \ drought conditions for four years since 2012 [1,2],\nand ground water supplies\
    \ have been depleted to historically low levels on the central coast, where\n\
    most of the salad vegetables are grown for the US and export markets. Lowering\
    \ of the ground\nwater table below sea-level through agricultural pumping has\
    \ caused salt water to intrude into\ncoastal aquifers and threatened the sustainability\
    \ of thousands of hectares of prime farmland used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28;\
    \ doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020028\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 28\n2 of 20\nfor vegetable production [3]. Australia also experienced\
    \ a severe decade-long drought during the\nearly 2000’s that impacted vegetable\
    \ farmers in the Murray-Darling Basin in New South Wales and\nQueensland [4].\
    \ The vegetable production regions of Chile [5] and Spain [6] have also experienced\n\
    recurring multiyear droughts.\nSince many vegetables require high rates of nitrogen\
    \ fertilizer and have shallow root systems,\nleaching of nitrate during the irrigation\
    \ season and during periods of heavy precipitation has resulted\nin nitrate contamination\
    \ of aquifers in many key vegetable production regions [7–9]. Irrigation run-off\n\
    from vegetable ﬁelds also contaminates surface water bodies such as rivers, creeks,\
    \ estuaries, and lakes\nwith nutrients and pesticides [10–12]. Growers in California\
    \ and Europe must report on the amount\nof fertilizer nitrogen that they apply\
    \ to their crops to comply with environmental regulations [13,14].\nThey are also\
    \ required to implement best practices to minimize nitrate losses, which will\
    \ require\nimproving irrigation management.\n1.2. Challenges for Irrigation Scheduling\
    \ in Modern Vegetable Operations\nVegetable production poses several unique challenges\
    \ in managing irrigation water efﬁciently.\nOne of the major challenges for growers\
    \ is the number of ﬁelds that must be concurrently managed\nin a medium to large\
    \ size vegetable operation. Fields sizes for vegetable crops tend to be small\n\
    (<5 ha) relative to agronomic crops, especially ﬁelds planted with leafy green,\
    \ crucifer, and other\nsalad vegetables. Large vegetable growing operations in\
    \ the Salinas valley of California manage\n1–2 thousand ha of vegetables, with\
    \ an average ﬁeld size of just 4 ha. Small ﬁelds permit intensive\nmanagement,\
    \ allowing plantings to be staggered so that a steady supply of vegetables can\
    \ be delivered\nto buyers and shippers. However, smaller ﬁeld sizes means that\
    \ farming decisions must be coordinated\nfor many ﬁelds that may vary with respect\
    \ to maturity, soil texture, cultural practices, microclimate,\nor other site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions.\nIn addition to ﬁeld size, the diversity of vegetables and number\
    \ of crop rotations per season\nincreases management complexity. Most diversiﬁed\
    \ operations will produce more than 30 types of\nvegetables, each with unique\
    \ nutrient and water requirements. Many vegetables are grown over short\ncropping\
    \ cycles. Leafy green salad mixes like leaf and crisphead lettuce, for instance,\
    \ reach maturity\nover just 30–65 day intervals during the summer. As a result,\
    \ farmers in Mediterranean climates often\ngrow two to three rotations of vegetable\
    \ crops per year. Fields often are intensively tilled between\ncrops to remove\
    \ compacted zones caused by trafﬁc from harvest machinery and to prepare raised\
    \ beds\nfor seeding or transplanting the next crop. These activities require that\
    \ crews retrieve drip tape or\nsprinkler pipe after each crop is harvested.\n\
    Another irrigation scheduling challenge is the number of ﬁeld operations that\
    \ must be coordinated\nduring a crop cycle. Fields are typically sprayed to protect\
    \ against insect and disease pests several\ntimes per crop cycle, and must be\
    \ periodically cultivated to control weeds. Fertilizer applications\nare made\
    \ several times during the growth cycle to satisfy the nutrient requirements of\
    \ vegetables.\nIrrigations must be timed to accommodate access for tractor and\
    \ hoeing crews so that activities can\nbe completed on schedule. There may be\
    \ several extended periods when a vegetable crop cannot be\nirrigated to permit\
    \ the soil to dry sufﬁciently to allow tractor access. Irrigation equipment, such\
    \ as\nsprinkler and mainline pipes, may need to be moved before each pass of a\
    \ tractor through a ﬁeld.\nIrrigation scheduling is also complicated by the numerous\
    \ methods that vegetable growers use\nto supply water to their crops. Depending\
    \ on the crop type, plant density, development stage, water\nsource, and ﬁeld\
    \ and soil characteristics, growers may choose to irrigate using overhead sprinklers,\n\
    drip, furrow, or a combination of methods. In California, leafy green vegetables\
    \ harvested for salad\nmixes are seeded at high densities (8.5 million plants\
    \ per hectare) [15] on 2 m wide raised beds and are\nirrigated almost exclusively\
    \ with sprinklers. Small seeded vegetables such as crisphead and romaine\nlettuce\
    \ are typically germinated with sprinklers, and after several weeks, irrigated\
    \ with surface drip\nuntil harvest. Celery transplants may be established using\
    \ overhead sprinklers, then drip irrigated,\nand occasionally ﬂood irrigated to\
    \ rewet the shoulders of raised beds.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n3 of 20\nSince\
    \ vegetable production is frequently characterized by short crop cycles, intensive\
    \ crop\nrotations, and numerous small ﬁelds at different stages of maturity, farm\
    \ managers are challenged\nto schedule and coordinate all the ﬁeld activities\
    \ while taking time to carefully schedule irrigations\nto optimize water use.\
    \ Consequently, many farm managers may follow predetermined irrigation\nschedules\
    \ to simplify water management and make small adjustments during the cropping\
    \ season\ndepending on their observations of the crop, soil, and weather conditions.\
    \ Usually the amount of\nwater applied to high value vegetables exceeds crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) to avoid water stress.\nIn the Salinas Valley of California, for example,\
    \ applied water amounts on broccoli, cauliﬂower, and\ncabbage averaged >200% of\
    \ the estimated crop evapotranspiration (ETc) requirement [16]. While these\n\
    applications rates may avoid water stress so that yield and quality are maximized,\
    \ over-irrigating may\nstrain water supplies and result in the leaching of nitrate\
    \ and/or generate run-off that degrades the\nquality of receiving surface water\
    \ bodies.\nConsidering the numerous challenges and limitations of managing vegetables,\
    \ growers, farm\nmanagers, and irrigators need convenient methods to schedule\
    \ irrigations so that they can better\ndetermine how much water to apply to match\
    \ the requirements of their crops. During the past few\ndecades, signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ and lower costs for wireless communications, computing power,\nsensor technology,\
    \ and aerial and satellite imagery have increased the potential to develop accurate\n\
    and intuitive approaches for scheduling irrigations in vegetables.\n2. Advances\
    \ in Soil Moisture Sensor Technology\n2.1. Recent Developments in Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensing\nThe monitoring of soil moisture has long been a standard way to determine\
    \ when crops need to\nbe irrigated. Growers and farm managers typically evaluate\
    \ soil moisture by probing with a shovel or\nauger or monitoring with sensors.\
    \ Sensors for volumetric moisture content and soil water tension have\nbeen commercially\
    \ available for more than 40 years but were originally used more in research than\
    \ for\ncommercial crop production. Volumetric soil moisture sensors provide readings\
    \ in units of m3·m−3,\nand tension-based sensors readings are typically in units\
    \ of kPa, where a greater absolute value\ncorresponds to drier soil conditions\
    \ [17]. In the past, the primary barriers to more widespread use of\nsoil moisture\
    \ sensors in irrigation management have included both cost as well as labor required\
    \ for the\ninstallation, removal, and collection of readings [18]. In recent years,\
    \ there has been a proliferation of\ncommercially available soil moisture monitoring\
    \ systems for agriculture. Many sensors interface with\ndataloggers and wireless\
    \ communication systems to provide near real-time status of soil moisture from\n\
    several depths and locations within a ﬁeld. Data are automatically uploaded by\
    \ radio or cell phone\ncommunications to cloud-based computer servers and are\
    \ accessible through apps on smartphones\nand tablet computers. These communication\
    \ advancements greatly improve the convenience of\naccessing data and can be conﬁgured\
    \ to provide timely alerts when crops require irrigation. Many of\nthese wireless\
    \ communication systems for soil moisture sensors also support on-farm weather\
    \ stations,\ndigital ﬂow meters, and control valves, which facilitates the monitoring\
    \ of irrigation system operations.\nSoil moisture sensors have also evolved during\
    \ the last few decades in terms of size, cost,\nand accuracy. Electromagnetic\
    \ (EM) soil moisture sensors, used to determine volumetric soil moisture\ncontent,\
    \ include time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) and capacitance sensors. These were once\
    \ bulky and\nexpensive instruments. With improvements in electronic manufacturing\
    \ and better designs, current\nEM sensors (Figure 1A,B) are generally much smaller,\
    \ cheaper, and more accurate than earlier models.\nSome versions are integrated\
    \ with soil temperature and salinity sensors (e.g., Model 5TE, Decagon\nDevices\
    \ Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Others are integrated with dataloggers and radio communications\n\
    (e.g., Model gStake, gThrive Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) to facilitate ﬁeld installation\
    \ and removal.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n4 of 20\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28 \n\

    \  \nTension‐based soil moisture sensors have been considered the best method to determine if a crop \n\
    needs  water  since  most  vegetables  experience  reductions  in  yield  and \
    \ quality  under  prolonged \nperiods  of  high  soil  water  tensions.  Tension \
    \ thresholds  that  optimize  production  have  been \ndetermined for many vegetable species [17,19], including broccoli [20], cabbage[21], cauliflower [22], \n\
    lettuce [23,24], potato[25], and tomato [26]. An advantage of tension thresholds is that they are less \n\
    influenced by soil texture than volumetric moisture thresholds. Tensiometers can accurately measure \n\
    soil water tension in a range of 0–85 kPa using a mechanical vacuum gauge attached to a water filled \n\
    tube with a porous ceramic cup [17] (Figure 1C). Tensiometers must be installed without air gaps \n\
    between the ceramic cup and soil to function properly. To reduce labor for collecting readings, several \n\
    recent models have sensitive electronic pressure transducers that measure vacuum pressure and can \n\
    be interfaced to dataloggers and wireless communication services (Figure 1D,E) so that data may be \n\
    monitored remotely (Figure 2) (e.g. Hortau Inc., Lévis, QC, Canada). Though tensiometers do not \n\
    need  calibration,  they  usually  require  periodic  maintenance  to  assure \
    \ that  they  are  functioning \nproperly. Entrapped air that develops at high tensions must be replaced with de‐aired water. Adding \n\

    which may potentially clog the ceramic cup [26]. \nGranular matrix sensors (GMS) (Figure 1F) indirectly measure soil water tension using electrical \n\
    resistance  and  are  often  used  as  an  alternative  to  tensiometers  (e.g. \
    \ Model  watermark  200SS, \nFigure 1. Examples of various soil moisture sensors:\

    \ and radio communications; (E) tensiometer integrated with pressure transducer,\n\
    datalogger, and radio communications; (F) granular matrix sensor and reader.\n\
    Tension-based soil moisture sensors have been considered the best method to determine\
    \ if a crop\nneeds water since most vegetables experience reductions in yield\
    \ and quality under prolonged periods\nof high soil water tensions. Tension thresholds\
    \ that optimize production have been determined for\nmany vegetable species [17,19],\
    \ including broccoli [20], cabbage [21], cauliﬂower [22], lettuce [23,24],\npotato\
    \ [25], and tomato [26]. An advantage of tension thresholds is that they are less\
    \ inﬂuenced by\nsoil texture than volumetric moisture thresholds. Tensiometers\
    \ can accurately measure soil water\ntension in a range of 0–85 kPa using a mechanical\
    \ vacuum gauge attached to a water ﬁlled tube with\na porous ceramic cup [17]\
    \ (Figure 1C). Tensiometers must be installed without air gaps between the\nceramic\
    \ cup and soil to function properly. To reduce labor for collecting readings,\
    \ several recent\nmodels have sensitive electronic pressure transducers that measure\
    \ vacuum pressure and can be\ninterfaced to dataloggers and wireless communication\
    \ services (Figure 1D,E) so that data may be\nmonitored remotely (Figure 2) (e.g.,\
    \ Hortau Inc., Lévis, QC, Canada). Though tensiometers do not need\ncalibration,\
    \ they usually require periodic maintenance to assure that they are functioning\
    \ properly.\nEntrapped air that develops at high tensions must be replaced with\
    \ de-aired water. Adding a weak\nsolution of algaecide or bleach can prevent biological\
    \ growth inside the tensiometer tube, which may\npotentially clog the ceramic\
    \ cup [26].\nGranular matrix sensors (GMS) (Figure 1F) indirectly measure soil\
    \ water tension using electrical\nresistance and are often used as an alternative\
    \ to tensiometers (e.g., Model watermark 200SS, Irrometer\nHorticulturae 2017,\
    \ 3, 28\n5 of 20\nCompany Inc., Riverside, CA, USA). Most GMS can be interfaced\
    \ to dataloggers and wireless\ncommunications [26]. An advantage of GMS compared\
    \ to tensiometers is that they do not require\nregular servicing. These sensors\
    \ retain sensitivity at higher soil moisture tensions (up to 200 kPa) but\nare\
    \ less accurate at low soil moisture tensions (0–15 kPa) than tensiometers [17,26].\
    \ GMS readings are\nalso affected by ﬂuctuations in soil temperature [17]. Another\
    \ limitation of GMS is that the response\ntime to wetting and drying cycles is\
    \ slower compared to tensiometers [26,27].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28 \n5 of 20 \n\
    \ \nIrrometer  Company  Inc.,  Riverside,  CA,  USA).  Most  GMS  can  be  interfaced \
    \ to  dataloggers  and \nwireless communications [26]. An advantage of GMS compared to tensiometers is that they do not \n\
    require regular servicing. These sensors retain sensitivity at higher soil moisture tensions (up to 200 \n\
    kPa) but are less accurate at low soil moisture tensions (0–15 kPa) than tensiometers [17,26]. GMS \n\
    readings are also affected by fluctuations in soil temperature [17]. Another limitation of GMS is that \n\
    the response time to wetting and drying cycles is slower compared to tensiometers [26,27]. \
    \  \n \nFigure 2. Fifteen minute readings (kPa) from tensiometers installed in a lettuce field at 8 (20 cm) and \n\
    18 inch (46 cm) depths are displayed in an online irrigation scheduling application. \n\
    A number of studies have evaluated automated irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture \n\
    readings for improving the water use efficiency of vegetables irrigated with drip tape. Automatic \n\
    controllers used in these studies irrigated crops for short durations several times per day when soils \n\
    dried below a predetermined threshold [28,29]. Some control systems have relied on tension based \n\
    sensors  [26,28],  while  others  have  used  volumetric  soil  moisture  sensors \
    \ [28,30–34]  to  determine \nwhen to irrigate. The use of TDR soil moisture sensors for triggering irrigations in sub‐surface drip \n\

    \ similar  yields  compared  to  a \nstandard  sprinkler  irrigated  treatment \
    \ [30].  Small  plot  trials  have  demonstrated  water  savings, \nreduced nitrate leaching, and improvements in yield in drip irrigated fresh market tomatoes, bell \n\
    peppers, and zucchini squash using capacitance soil moisture sensors to trigger irrigations [31–35]. \n\
    Using tensiometers, Mũnoz‐Carpena et al. [26] were able to reduce water use in fresh market tomato \n\
    by 67% compared to the grower standard practice without significant reductions in marketable yield. \n\
    Most of the water savings were during the early crop stages when evapotranspiration rates were low. \n\
    Capacitance soil moisture sensors were generally found to be more reliable for automated irrigation \n\
    scheduling  than  tensiometers  and  GMS.  As  discussed  earlier,  tensiometers \
    \ require  regular \nmaintenance, and the GMS response to changes in soil moisture was too slow to use these sensors for \n\
    triggering irrigations. While these studies have demonstrated the potential for water savings in small \n\
    plots, automated irrigation scheduling may have several limitations in commercial vegetable fields. \n\
    The  optimal  volumetric  soil  moisture  threshold  for  triggering  an  irrigation \

     \n \nFigure 2. Fifteen minute readings (kPa) from tensiometers installed in a\
    \ lettuce ﬁeld at 8 (20 cm) and\n18 inch (46 cm) depths are displayed in an online\
    \ irrigation scheduling application.\nA number of studies have evaluated automated\
    \ irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture\nreadings for improving the water\
    \ use efﬁciency of vegetables irrigated with drip tape. Automatic\ncontrollers\
    \ used in these studies irrigated crops for short durations several times per\
    \ day when soils\ndried below a predetermined threshold [28,29]. Some control\
    \ systems have relied on tension based\nsensors [26,28], while others have used\
    \ volumetric soil moisture sensors [28,30–34] to determine\nwhen to irrigate.\
    \ The use of TDR soil moisture sensors for triggering irrigations in sub-surface\n\
    drip irrigated sweet corn resulted in an 11% savings in water use with similar\
    \ yields compared to\na standard sprinkler irrigated treatment [30]. Small plot\
    \ trials have demonstrated water savings,\nreduced nitrate leaching, and improvements\
    \ in yield in drip irrigated fresh market tomatoes, bell\npeppers, and zucchini\
    \ squash using capacitance soil moisture sensors to trigger irrigations [31–35].\n\
    Using tensiometers, Mũnoz-Carpena et al. [26] were able to reduce water use in\
    \ fresh market tomato\nby 67% compared to the grower standard practice without\
    \ signiﬁcant reductions in marketable yield.\nMost of the water savings were during\
    \ the early crop stages when evapotranspiration rates were\nlow. Capacitance soil\
    \ moisture sensors were generally found to be more reliable for automated\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling than tensiometers and GMS. As discussed earlier, tensiometers require\
    \ regular\nmaintenance, and the GMS response to changes in soil moisture was too\
    \ slow to use these sensors\nfor triggering irrigations. While these studies have\
    \ demonstrated the potential for water savings in\nsmall plots, automated irrigation\
    \ scheduling may have several limitations in commercial vegetable\nﬁelds. The\
    \ optimal volumetric soil moisture threshold for triggering an irrigation would\
    \ need to be\nempirically determined for different soil types. Pressurized water\
    \ would need to be continuously\navailable to accommodate frequent short irrigations.\
    \ In large ﬁelds, short irrigation cycles could lead\nto signiﬁcant drainage at\
    \ the lower end of a ﬁeld when drip lines depressurize.\n2.2. Limitations of Soil\
    \ Moisture Sensors for Irrigation Scheduling in Vegetables\nWhile much progress\
    \ has been made in improving the accuracy and utility of soil moisture\nsensors,\
    \ several factors still limit their use for irrigation scheduling of vegetables.\
    \ Though costs for\nindividual sensors may be less than in the past, the addition\
    \ of dataloggers, cell phone modems,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n6 of 20\nand\
    \ radio communications, which facilitate real-time monitoring, has added to the\
    \ total costs. Labor\nfor installation and removal of sensors remains a signiﬁcant\
    \ cost, especially in vegetable crops with\nshort production cycles. Considering\
    \ labor and capital costs, many growers elect to use soil moisture\nmonitoring\
    \ equipment in a small percentage of their vegetable ﬁelds.\nThough soil moisture\
    \ sensors are useful for determining when to irrigate vegetables,\nthey are less\
    \ useful for estimating how much water to apply. Soil moisture tension readings\
    \ must\nbe converted to volumetric moisture to estimate soil water depletion since\
    \ a previous irrigation\nor rain event.\nVolumetric soil moisture sensors may\
    \ also need calibration.\nMost capacitance\nsensors use the manufacturer’s calibration\
    \ equations to convert readings to volumetric water content.\nClay content, organic\
    \ matter, salinity, bulk density, and temperature can affect the accuracy of\n\
    capacitance sensors [36–40]. The effect of these factors on water content readings\
    \ can vary in different\nsoil types. For example, Kargas and Soulis [38] evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of the 10HS capacitance\nsensor, and found that temperature had\
    \ a larger effect on soil water content readings in clay than\ncourse textured\
    \ soils. They concluded that calibration for speciﬁc soil types was needed to\
    \ achieve\naccurate readings.\nEven with accurate sensors, spatial variability\
    \ can limit the reliability of soil moisture estimates if\nreadings are collected\
    \ from only a few locations, especially if soil hydraulic properties vary within\n\
    a ﬁeld or the irrigation system applies water unevenly. Soil maps can be useful\
    \ for guiding the\nplacement of soil moisture sensors in locations that represent\
    \ the dominant soil properties of ﬁelds.\nIn drip-irrigated ﬁelds, determining\
    \ the optimal location to accurately monitor soil moisture depletion\ncan be particularly\
    \ challenging. Soil moisture is typically higher under drip tape than adjacent\n\
    to the plants, where root activity is concentrated. Placing sensors too close\
    \ to a drip line may\nlead to under-irrigating a crop, and placing sensors too\
    \ far away may result in over-irrigating [41].\nThrough computer modeling experiments,\
    \ Soulis et al. [42] concluded that the optimal positioning\nof soil moisture\
    \ sensors in drip-irrigated crops was inﬂuenced by soil hydraulic properties,\
    \ crop\nevapotranspiration rate, and the conﬁguration of the irrigation system.\
    \ An additional consideration is\nthe ideal depth at which to place sensors relative\
    \ to the crop root zone. Broccoli roots can reach depths\ngreater than 1.2 m at\
    \ maturity [16], while roots of many leafy greens such as spinach may reach less\n\
    than 0.5 m by harvest [43].\n3. ET-Based Approaches to Scheduling Irrigations\
    \ in Vegetables\nWater\nrequirements\nof\nvegetable\ncrops\ncan\nalso\nbe\ndetermined\n\
    from\nestimates\nof\ncrop evapotranspiration (ETc).\nUsing Penman-Monteith [44,45],\
    \ or similar equations [46],\nevapotranspiration (ET0) of a well-watered reference\
    \ crop, such as grass, or alfalfa, is commonly\nestimated from measurements of\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar\nradiation [47]. The\
    \ evapotranspiration of a well-watered vegetable crop can be estimated relative\
    \ to a\nreference crop by multiplying ET0 by a crop coefﬁcient (Kc). Crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for most major vegetable\ncrops were summarized by Allen et al. [48], Guerra\
    \ et al. [49], and Grattan et al. [50].\nNetworks of public weather stations to\
    \ monitor reference ET have been established in many\nvegetable production regions\
    \ of the world where irrigation is commonly used. The California Irrigation\n\
    and Information System (CIMIS) is operated by the Department of Water Resources\
    \ in California and\nconsists of more than 145 weather stations sited on reference\
    \ crops throughout the state. ET0 and other\nmeteorological data, including precipitation,\
    \ air and soil temperature, wind speed, solar radiation,\nand relative humidity,\
    \ are available for users to download from the state operated website. Similar\n\
    networks have been developed for other states including Arizona (AZMET), Colorado\
    \ (CoAgMet),\nFlorida (FAWN), Nevada (NICENET), Oklahoma (MesoNet), Oregon (AgriMet),\
    \ and Washington\n(AgWeatherNet). Most European countries also have weather station\
    \ networks that provide daily ET0\ndata through public websites (e.g., Spain [51],\
    \ Italy [52]). In addition, CIMIS offers a satellite based\nproduct that estimates\
    \ ET0 at a 2 km resolution based on data from the Geostationary Operational\n\
    Environmental Satellite [53].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n7 of 20\nMany commercial\
    \ companies also offer affordable weather stations (e.g., ET107, Campbell Sci.\
    \ Inc.,\nLogan, UT, USA; WatchDog 2900ET Weather Station, Spectrum Technologies,\
    \ Aurora, IL, USA; HOBO\nU30-NRC Weather Station, Onset Computer Corp. Bourne,\
    \ MA, USA) that can be used to estimate\nET0 on a farm. These systems offer a\
    \ way to monitor ET0 in regions not covered by a public network,\nor for farms\
    \ that are not located reasonably near an established station. However, in practice,\
    \ few\ngrowers site or maintain stations in accordance with World Meteorological\
    \ Organization standards for\nreference evapotranspiration measurements. Many\
    \ growers site weather stations near trees, buildings,\nor parking lots, which\
    \ limits the fetch and can inﬂuence the micro-climate, and potentially bias\n\
    estimates of ET0. Stations are infrequently sited on a suitable well-watered reference\
    \ crop. Most\nfarmers do not allocate time to regularly maintain and calibrate\
    \ meteorological instrumentation on\ntheir stations. Commercially available atmometers\
    \ (ETgage Co., Loveland, CO, USA) can be used to\nmonitor ET0 but must also be\
    \ sited over a reference crop.\nAlthough ET0 data have been useful for water agencies\
    \ to estimate the seasonal water use of crops\nat a regional scale, growers have\
    \ generally considered this approach to be impractical for scheduling\nirrigations\
    \ in vegetable systems. A major difﬁculty is that the Kc value can change daily\
    \ as vegetables\ngrow and leaf area increases. During the establishment phase,\
    \ when crop foliage covers a small\npercentage of the soil surface, ET is mostly\
    \ from soil evaporation rather than from crop transpiration.\nFor many vegetable\
    \ crops, such as leafy greens and brassicas, the canopy cover is less than 10%\
    \ until\nhalfway through the crop cycle. The Kc during this early stage will depend\
    \ on factors inﬂuencing\nevaporative losses from the soil, such as method and\
    \ frequency of irrigations, and soil physical\nproperties [48]. Later, in the\
    \ rapid growth phase, Kc values increase daily as the canopy cover develops\n\
    and covers the soil.\nSolutions for calculating a daily Kc for lettuce were proposed\
    \ by Gallardo et al. [54] in which soil\nevaporation from unshaded soil (E) is\
    \ estimated separately from the water lost by transpiration and soil\nevaporation\
    \ under the crop canopy (T). Using this approach, Kc is proportional to the fractional\
    \ cover\n(Fc) of the leaf canopy shading the soil, and E is related to the hydraulic\
    \ properties of the soil and the\ntime since the crop was irrigated. The general\
    \ approach is consistent with Allen et al. [48,55], who also\nproposed separating\
    \ the Kc of crops that have a signiﬁcant period of minimal canopy cover into dual\n\
    components consisting of a basal crop coefﬁcient (Kcb) that represents water loss\
    \ by transpiration and\nan evaporation coefﬁcient (Ke), representing loss from\
    \ soil evaporation. Direct relationships between\nFc and Kcb have been reported\
    \ for several crops such as broccoli [56], wheat [57], cotton [58], sugar\nbeets\
    \ [58], and grapes [59].\nBoth Gallardo et al. [54] and Allen et al. [48] describe\
    \ calculations for estimating soil evaporation,\nwhich divide Ke into stage 1\
    \ and stage 2 periods. Stage 1 occurs immediately following an irrigation\nor\
    \ rain event that saturates the soil to ﬁeld capacity. During stage 1, water loss\
    \ is limited by the\nenergy available for evaporation. Stage 2 occurs after the\
    \ soil is visibly dry and water loss is limited\nby soil hydraulic properties.\
    \ The Stage 2 rate of evaporation diminishes with time as the soil water\ncontent\
    \ declines.\n4. Software for ET Based Scheduling of Vegetables\n4.1. Overview\
    \ of Sofware Tools\nEven with publicly available ET0 data and accurate Kc models,\
    \ the implementation of ET-based\nirrigation scheduling at the scale of a commercial\
    \ vegetable farm may be difﬁcult for growers. Daily ET0\nvalues need to be retrieved\
    \ from a location representative of the ﬁeld of interest. An estimate of canopy\n\
    cover is needed to determine the average Kc for each irrigation event. Soil evaporation\
    \ calculations\nrequire knowledge of the soil properties of the ﬁeld, irrigation\
    \ method, and interval between irrigations\nor rainfall events. To convert crop\
    \ ET into an irrigation recommendation, the application rate and\ndistribution\
    \ uniformity of the irrigation system, and in some cases the leaching fraction,\
    \ also needs to\nbe integrated into the calculations.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3,\
    \ 28\n8 of 20\nRecognizing that most growers have limited time to dedicate to\
    \ making decisions on water\nmanagement, several universities and public institutions\
    \ have developed computer programs to\nfacilitate ET based scheduling. Spreadsheet\
    \ and Windows-based irrigation scheduling programs,\nsuch as CROPWAT [60], KanSched\
    \ 2.0, Basic Irrigation Scheduling (BIS) [61], and consumptive\nuse program (CUP)\
    \ [62] automate the irrigation scheduling calculations but require users to\n\
    retrieve and enter daily ET0 values.\nSince separate spreadsheet ﬁles maybe needed\
    \ for each\ncrop, these programs may be difﬁcult to implement in large growing\
    \ operations that manage\nmany ﬁelds. Washington Irrigation Scheduling Expert\
    \ (WISE) [63,64] is a downloadable JavaScript\napplication that runs on personal\
    \ computers. More recently developed web-based applications\nsuch as Irrigation\
    \ Scheduler mobile (Washington State University) [65], Irrigation Management\n\
    Online (Oregon State University) [66], Wateright (Fresno State University) [67,68],\
    \ and CropManage\n(University of California, Division of Agriculture and Natural\
    \ Resources) [69,70] were developed to\nautomatically retrieve ET0 data from weather\
    \ station networks such as AgWeatherNet and CIMIS\nand support irrigation scheduling\
    \ of multiple ﬁelds. These applications are accessed through web\nbrowsers, some\
    \ of which automatically resize the user interface to smartphone screens. Colorado\n\
    State University WISE Irrigation Scheduler [71] and SmartIrrigation (University\
    \ of Florida, University\nof Georgia) [72–74] have similar capabilities but can\
    \ operate exclusively on smartphones through\ndownloadable applications. Outside\
    \ of the United States, several public agencies have developed\nonline irrigation\
    \ scheduling services including IRRINET in Italy [75], ISS-ITAP in Spain [76],\
    \ IRRISA\nin France [77], and IrriSatSMS [78] in Australia. In addition, a growing\
    \ number of ET-based software\ntools are commercially available.\nTwo examples\
    \ are Probe Schedule (IRRinet LLC, Dalles, OR,\nUSA) and Irrigation Advisor (PowWow\
    \ Energy Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA). Further details of these\ncommercial products\
    \ are not provided here since they are proprietary and usually not documented\
    \ in\nthe scientiﬁc literature.\nMost online irrigation scheduling tools have\
    \ cloud-based databases that retain information\nassociated with each planting,\
    \ such as soil type, planting and harvest dates, weather station name,\nand irrigation\
    \ system application rate, so that the user does not need to reenter critical\
    \ information\nfor each irrigation event. After entering the information required\
    \ to initiate a new planting, users\ncan quickly look up how long to irrigate\
    \ their crops. Some scheduling software provides weekly or\ndaily summaries of\
    \ how much water to apply (e.g., IrrigationScheduler, Wateright, SmartIrrigation,\n\
    etc.), while others such as CropManage enable the user to input speciﬁc dates\
    \ for each irrigation [70].\nThe online format facilitates automated retrieval\
    \ of current and forecasted weather data in advance\nof planned irrigation events,\
    \ so that growers can be alerted when a ﬁeld will need water. In addition\nto\
    \ linking with weather station networks, decision support tools can also incorporate\
    \ other online\nservices such as UC Davis SoilWeb for identifying the soil physical\
    \ properties of a ﬁeld using the\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database [79]\nor Google Maps, which can be\
    \ customized for determining the longitude and latitude of a ﬁeld or\nviewing\
    \ locations of nearby weather stations. CropManage can also be customized to automatically\n\
    retrieve ﬂowmeter and soil moisture data from internet-accessible dataloggers.\n\
    While many of these irrigation-scheduling programs will provide recommendations\
    \ for multiple\ncommodities, few have been developed or tested speciﬁcally for\
    \ vegetables. Most irrigation scheduling\napplications use single Kc values for\
    \ the four crop growth stages described by Doorenbos and Pruitt [80]\nto simplify\
    \ calculations of ETc. CropManage was initially developed for vegetable irrigation\
    \ and\nemploys a dual crop coefﬁcient approach for estimating crop ET similar\
    \ to Gallardo et al. (1996),\nas described in Johnson et al. [81] and Smith et\
    \ al. [16]. The vegetable crops currently supported\ninclude broccoli, cabbage,\
    \ cauliﬂower, lettuce, and spinach. Since the user enters the date of each\nirrigation\
    \ event, CropManage adjusts watering recommendations for the frequency and method\
    \ of\nirrigation. Empirical models of fractional cover are included for each supported\
    \ vegetable crop so that\nthe user can customize the Kcb curves for a speciﬁc\
    \ season, bed width, and planting conﬁguration.\nReplicated ﬁeld trials demonstrated\
    \ that the CropManage irrigation recommendations using the ET\nHorticulturae 2017,\
    \ 3, 28\n9 of 20\nbased algorithm with a dual crop coefﬁcient optimized water\
    \ use and yield in crisp head lettuce and\nbroccoli [81].\n4.2. Achieving Widescale\
    \ Adoption of Irrigation Software\nDespite signiﬁcant progress in developing ET-based\
    \ irrigation scheduling software for commercial\nvegetable farms, many challenges\
    \ exist that will need to be addressed to achieve large-scale adoption\nby growers.\
    \ Although public ET weather station networks have been established in many vegetable\n\
    producing regions of the US and Europe, they are less common in other regions\
    \ such as India, China,\nand Latin America. In areas where ET0 data are available,\
    \ the density or siting of weather stations may\nnot provide sufﬁcient resolution\
    \ to fully capture regional variation in microclimates. In these instances,\n\
    growers may choose to install and operate their own weather stations, as described\
    \ above.\nAnother challenge is to deliver accurate irrigation recommendations\
    \ without requiring users\nto provide excessive details about their crop, irrigation\
    \ system, and ﬁeld conditions. Morrison [82]\nfound that time constraints and\
    \ concerns about data entry errors were factors that deterred grower\nadoption\
    \ of the irrigation scheduling software. Irrigation scheduling apps also need\
    \ to be intuitive for\nirrigators and farm managers to use in the ﬁeld. The user-interface\
    \ displayed on smartphones and\ntablet computers must be easy to read and to understand,\
    \ while providing sufﬁcient detail for the\nuser to verify that the values for\
    \ ET0, Kc, and other variables used in the scheduling calculations are\naccurate.\
    \ Also, since the principal language of many irrigators in the western US is Spanish,\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling applications need to support multiple languages.\nThe\
    \ cost of computer programming services is also a major barrier to developing\
    \ and maintaining\nirrigation scheduling software. As software has become more\
    \ sophisticated, and needs to be compatible\nwith personal and tablet computers\
    \ and smartphones, the complexity and consequently costs of\ndevelopment have\
    \ increased. Software products will incur annual costs associated with updating\n\
    to new technology, introducing new features, and troubleshooting identiﬁed errors.\
    \ Most publicly\navailable irrigation scheduling applications were initially developed\
    \ under research grants, and need\neither continued grant funding or income generated\
    \ from user subscriptions to support updating\nand maintenance costs. Several\
    \ online irrigation scheduling services that were initially funded by the\nEuropean\
    \ Union became inactive after grants ended [83]. It may be cost-effective for\
    \ institutions to\ncollaborate on the development of software products that are\
    \ sufﬁciently ﬂexible to be customized\nfor different growing regions and commodities.\
    \ SmartIrrigation is an example of such collaboration\nbetween the University\
    \ of Florida and University of Georgia. There also may be opportunities for public\n\
    agencies, commodity boards, and commercial companies to partner on the development\
    \ of commercial\nirrigation scheduling software. For instance, SureHarvest Inc.\
    \ (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) recently\ndeveloped an online irrigation-scheduling tool\
    \ for almonds in collaboration with the University of\nCalifornia and the Almond\
    \ Board of California.\n5. Field Measurements of Crop ET\nField measurements of\
    \ crop ET are needed to develop and verify crop coefﬁcients as well as\nto investigate\
    \ the interaction of water stress on crop yield and quality. Several reviews detail\
    \ the\nadvantages and disadvantages of various methods of measuring crop ET [84,85].\
    \ Weighing lysimeters\nhave often been used to measure crop water use [85,86].\
    \ While considered the most accurate ET\nmeasurement method, the expense of these\
    \ instruments limits their use to research stations and\nconstrains the range\
    \ of sites, crops, and management practices that can reasonably be evaluated.\n\
    Energy balance methods such as Bowen ratio [85], eddy covariance [85], and surface\
    \ renewal [87] are\nmore affordable alternatives to lysimetry for evaluating crop\
    \ ET and can be deployed in commercial\nﬁelds for evaluating crop water use under\
    \ a wide range of growing conditions. Instrumentation\ncosts for these methods\
    \ can exceed $10,000 USD per station, which has limited their use primarily\n\
    to research studies. Energy balance methods involve monitoring of net radiation,\
    \ soil heat ﬂux,\nand sensible heat ﬂux to estimate the latent heat ﬂux (Wm−2),\
    \ which can be converted to water ﬂux\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n10 of 20\nor\
    \ evapotranspiration rate through the latent heat of vaporization. Generally,\
    \ the sensors used for\nenergy balance measurements have become more reliable,\
    \ cheaper, and more accurate in recent years.\nThe capabilities of dataloggers\
    \ used for operating the instrumentation have also improved, with\nmore memory\
    \ and faster computation speeds, while post-processing software modules have become\n\
    more accessible. Energy balance methods have been used for evaluating the water\
    \ use of vegetable\ncrops in commercial ﬁelds, including artichokes, broccoli,\
    \ beans, lettuce, onions, and processing\ntomatoes [50,88–92]. These methods have\
    \ been useful for reevaluating existing crop coefﬁcients, as\nproduction practices\
    \ and varieties have improved during recent years [93]. However, considering the\n\
    diversity of vegetables and production methods, relatively few ET studies have\
    \ been published using\nthese techniques during the last decade. Surface renewal,\
    \ which uses thermocouples to measure rapid\nchanges in air temperature, has greatly\
    \ reduced the costs of estimating sensible heat ﬂux and may\nbe well suited to\
    \ vegetable ﬁelds due to a smaller fetch requirement compared to eddy covariance.\n\
    Advances in surface renewal methodology [94] have culminated in a commercial service\
    \ that provides\ngrowers with ET estimates and irrigation recommendations via\
    \ a web application (Tule Technology\nInc., Oakland, CA, USA). However, this tool\
    \ has primarily been used in perennial crops such as trees,\ngrapes, and strawberries.\n\
    6. Satellite-Based Crop ET Determination\n6.1. Energy Balance\nResearchers have\
    \ developed satellite-based energy balance models to estimate ET at\nvarious spatial\
    \ and temporal scales (e.g., reviews of Courault et al. [95]; Kalma et al. [96];\n\
    Gonzalez-Dugo et al. [97]). The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL)\
    \ and the Mapping\nEvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration\
    \ (METRIC) are two widely used\napproaches [98,99]. Optical and thermal band data\
    \ from Landsat or other satellites is used to help\nparameterize the energy balance\
    \ equation [100]. At the moment of satellite overpass, latent heat\nﬂux (LE) is\
    \ retrieved through the calculation of surface energy balance that is based on\
    \ radiative,\naerodynamic, and energy balance physics. LE is converted to ET for\
    \ the corresponding hour and\nsubsequently to reference ET fraction (ETrF) by\
    \ comparison with the measured reference ET for the\nhour. Finally, daily (2)\
    \ ET is derived as the product of ETrF and reference ET for the day, under the\n\
    assumption that ETrF approximates the average daylight evaporative fraction. The\
    \ energy balance\napproach accounts for the effects of ET reduction in water-stressed\
    \ crops, due to stomatal regulation\nand increased ET due to bare-soil evaporation.\
    \ Linear or spline interpolation can be used to estimate\nETrF (hence daily ET)\
    \ between satellite overpasses, which occur every eight days in the case of\n\
    Landsat, assuming clear-sky conditions. Manual intervention is used to calibrate\
    \ the sensible heat\nﬂux computation by identifying portions of the image (hot\
    \ and cold ‘anchor’ pixels) that represent\nextreme ET conditions, where ET can\
    \ be estimated and assigned a priori. In a typical agricultural\nsituation, cold\
    \ pixels are associated with well-irrigated agricultural ﬁelds with high Fc and\
    \ hot pixels\nwith bare dry ﬁelds. Overall the ET retrieval error for the satellite-based\
    \ energy balance is typically\n5–15%, when estimates are produced by an experienced\

    \ the ﬁelds of hydrologic science, environmental physics, remote sensing,\nor\
    \ agricultural systems [85]. An automated calibration method has been recently\
    \ developed to facilitate\nand improve operation by non-specialists [101].\n6.2.\
    \ Vegetation Index\nHybrid approaches estimate fractional cover (Fc) from remote\
    \ sensing and use ground-based ET0\ndata. Fc is a good indicator of light interception,\
    \ which is a strong driver of ETc [48]. Weighing lysimeter\nobservations by Bryla\
    \ et al. [102] revealed a strong relationship between Fc and ETc for vegetable\n\
    crops in California’s San Joaquin Valley, and the potential for using satellite-based\
    \ Fc to estimate ETc\nin vegetable crops was demonstrated by Johnson and Trout\
    \ [103]. Fc can be estimated from various\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n11 of 20\n\
    spectral visible-region bands, where chlorophyll absorption dominates, combined\
    \ with near-infrared\n(NIR), where vegetation is highly reﬂective. A common formulation\
    \ is the normalized difference\nvegetation index, or NDVI, which is derived as\
    \ (NIR − red)/(NIR + red) [104]. Trout et al. [105] and\nJohnson and Trout [103]\
    \ found a strong relationship between NDVI and Fc for vegetables and other\ncrop\
    \ types in California’s San Joaquin Valley. NDVI began to lose sensitivity above\
    \ 80 percent cover, a\npoint generally regarded as effective full cover for water\
    \ management applications [106]. As above,\ninterpolation can be applied to estimate\
    \ NDVI, and hence ETc, for days between satellite overpasses\nas needed.\n7. Satellite\
    \ Based Irrigation Management Services\n7.1. Prototype Systems\nBy furnishing\
    \ ﬁeld scale estimates of Fc, a key factor for estimating Kcb and basal ETc (ETcb),\n\
    optical remote sensing may potentially improve the accuracy of ET estimates in\
    \ vegetables. Several\nsatellite-based models have been developed for irrigation\
    \ management. An early proof-of-capability\nsatellite demonstration on wheat and\
    \ corn was undertaken by the DEMETER project in Europe,\nwhich involved timely\
    \ delivery of Landsat-based crop coefﬁcients to agricultural end-users, with\n\
    available online visualization and analysis capabilities [107].\nMore recently,\
    \ the fully-automated Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) [108] uses\n\
    atmospherically corrected Landsat data to map NDVI, Fc, and Kcb for multiple crop\
    \ types, including\nvegetables across about eight million acres of California\
    \ irrigated farmland [109]. These variables are\nupdated every eight days at 30\
    \ m spatial resolution (cloud cover and data availability permitting) from\n2010\
    \ to the present. The SIMS uses daily 2 km ET0 statewide grids produced by the\
    \ California Irrigation\nManagement Information System [53] to generate basal\
    \ crop ET. Web data services allow users to\ndisplay annual time-series graphs\
    \ and download data for any given location (Figure 3). An application\nprogramming\
    \ interface (API) enables on-demand transfer of SIMS data products to support\
    \ external\nirrigation advisory services such as CropManage and also allows the\
    \ user and other software tools to\nspecify the crop type via the API and retrieve\
    \ crop-speciﬁc Kcb data from SIMS. Where information is\navailable on applied\
    \ water, an FAO56 based soil water balance model can be used to adjust for soil\n\
    evaporation and crop stress and to retrospectively derive agricultural water use\
    \ fractions at the ﬁeld\nscale for the evaluation of irrigation management and\
    \ system performance [110].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28 \n11 of 20 \n[106]. As above, interpolation can be applied to estimate NDVI, and hence ETc, for days between \n\

    available online visualization and analysis capabilities [107].   \nMore recently, the fully‐automated Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) [108] uses \n\
    atmospherically corrected Landsat data to map NDVI, Fc, and Kcb for multiple crop types, including \n\
    vegetables across about eight million acres of California irrigated farmland [109]. These variables are \n\
    updated every eight days at 30 m spatial resolution (cloud cover and data availability permitting) \n\
    from 2010 to the present. The SIMS uses daily 2 km ET0 statewide grids produced by the California \n\
    Irrigation Management Information System [53] to generate basal crop ET. Web data services allow \n\
    users to display annual time‐series graphs and download data for any given location (Figure 3). An \n\
    application  programming  interface  (API)  enables  on‐demand  transfer  of \

    Figure 3. SIMS map of fractional cover of vegetable crops near Salinas, California\
    \ as of mid-July 2016.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n12 of 20\nIrriSAT [111] is\
    \ a weather based irrigation management and benchmarking technology that uses\n\
    satellite remote sensing to generate crop water management information in Australia,\
    \ primarily for\ngrape and cotton growers at present [112,113]. As with SIMS,\
    \ Landsat is used to estimate Kc at a\n30 m resolution. Unlike SIMS, Kc is derived\
    \ directly from a single linear relationship with satellite\nNDVI. Daily crop\
    \ water use is determined as the product of Kc and ET0 observations from nearby\n\
    weather stations, and a seven-day ET0 forecast is also produced. The delivery\
    \ platform, which is built\non the Google App Engine helps irrigators track soil\
    \ moisture and better manage irrigation schedules.\nIn addition, IrriSAT facilitates\
    \ the calculation of seasonal agronomic performance metrics, including\nthe irrigation\
    \ water use index and gross production water use index.\nAdditional satellite-based\
    \ services have been implemented Europe and Australia [114]. These\ninclude IRRISAT-Italy\
    \ (as distinct from IrriSAT-Australia described above), EO4Water (Austria),\n\
    and IrriEye (southern Australia). These services generally involve the use of\
    \ optical DEIMOS 20 m\nsatellite imagery to generate and deliver leaf area index\
    \ with derived Kc and related map overlays\nwithin a browsing and querying toolbox\
    \ [115]. Personalized irrigation guidance regarding crop water\nrequirement is\
    \ dispensed through a secure website, SMS, and email. End-users are able to provide\n\
    evaluative feedback. A variety of crops are being tested, including vegetables,\
    \ sugar beet, corn, alfalfa,\nand orchards.\nEarth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux\
    \ (EEFlux) [116] is a METRIC implementation on the Google\nEarth Engine cloud\
    \ computing platform [117]. Landsat scenes from 1984 to the present are combined\n\
    with gridded weather data to allow the analysis of most land areas worldwide.\
    \ The products\ninclude maps of ET, associated energy balance ﬂux components,\
    \ and land cover. A time-series\ncan be constructed by processing several scenes\
    \ and interpolating between image dates. Automated\nimage calibration for anchor\
    \ pixels is offered in a Level 1 version to accommodate operation by\nnon-experts,\
    \ with some sacriﬁce in accuracy. A Level 2 version, which allows custom calibration\
    \ by\nthe operator, requires an annual license fee. EEFlux is a general tool that\
    \ operates on both agricultural\nand non-agricultural land cover types.\n7.2.\
    \ Satellite Remote Sensing Considerations for Irrigation Scheduling\nSatellite\
    \ observation is recognized as a useful tool that will continue to support crop\
    \ coefﬁcient\ndevelopment and ET monitoring for new types and varieties of crops,\
    \ as facilitated by the wider\navailability of gridded weather data and continued\
    \ advancement in convenient and user-friendly\nmapping technologies [118]. The\
    \ use of public domain satellites with open-data policies, i.e., the data\nsource\
    \ is available at no charge, is an advantage of this approach, as is the capability\
    \ to collect data\nfor many ﬁelds simultaneously. Vegetable crops, however, do\
    \ present some unique challenges for\nsatellite-based evaluation. The frequency\
    \ of satellite overpasses, presence of cloud cover, and added\ntime needed to\
    \ perform custom atmospheric correction (e.g., Vermote and Saleous [119]) may\n\
    limit the use of remote sensing for real time irrigation scheduling of fast-growing\
    \ vegetable crops.\nAs more satellite platforms become available, such as the\
    \ European Space Agency Sentinel-2 system,\nthe observation interval between images\
    \ may soon decrease to four to ﬁve days for NDVI-based ET\nmodels. Also, upon\
    \ further testing, it may be shown that use of a simpliﬁed atmospheric correction\n\
    approach (e.g., Tasumi et al. [120]) may be adequate for application in some or\
    \ most regions. Where\nreal-time irrigation scheduling operations are unsupported,\
    \ remote sensing may still prove useful\nfor the retrospective evaluation of irrigation\
    \ system performance or compilation of water use metrics.\nAnother challenge is\
    \ the typically small ﬁeld size for vegetables as noted above (4–5 ha), which\
    \ is near\nthe minimum land area recommended for evaluation by Landsat or other\
    \ public Earth observation\nsatellites. An additional challenge is posed by leaf\
    \ color, especially for crops such as red lettuce\nthat depart widely from the\
    \ green-leaf norm. A recent study has also shown that while NDVI was\nstrongly\
    \ related to Fc in both leafy greens (r2 = 0.88) and cole crops (r2 = 0.93), the\
    \ relationships were\ndifferent [121]. Thus, the development of customized relationships\
    \ between NDVI and Fc by crop\ncategory is recommended to increase the accuracy\
    \ of Fc estimates.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n13 of 20\n8. Remote Sensing Using\
    \ Manned Aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)\nThe use of manned aircraft\
    \ and UAVs for monitoring vegetables has become a viable alternative or\ncomplement\
    \ to satellite observation. Image resolution is generally much ﬁner than that\
    \ of Landsat or\nother open-data satellites, and passes over ﬁelds can be scheduled\
    \ on a more frequent and ﬂexible basis.\nHowever, data calibration to assure image\
    \ consistency in support of time-series observations may be\nlacking. Several\
    \ commercial companies offer NDVI and thermal spectrum images at <1 m resolution\n\
    taken at weekly intervals using small planes in California and elsewhere (e.g.,\
    \ CERESimaging Inc.,\nOakland, CA, USA; TerrAvion Inc., San Leandro, CA, USA).\
    \ Images can be accessed from the web\ngenerally within 24 h of collection.\n\
    The high resolution of these scenes can provide enhanced\ninformation about within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability in crop growth and water stress and for determining\nFc\
    \ used to parameterize ET equations. Patterns can show when a crop is under-irrigated\
    \ such as in\nFigure 4, where the NDVI values for a romaine lettuce crop are lowest\
    \ midway between sprinkler\nlines, presumably caused by poor irrigation distribution\
    \ uniformity.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28 \n13 of 20 \nresolution  taken  at  weekly \
    \ intervals  using  small  planes  in  California  and  elsewhere  (e.g. \nCERESimaging \
    \ Inc.,  Oakland,  CA,  USA;  TerrAvion  Inc.,  San  Leandro,  CA,  USA).  Images \
    \ can  be \naccessed from the web generally within 24 h of collection. The high resolution of these scenes can \n\
    provide enhanced information about within‐field spatial variability in crop growth and water stress \n\
    and for determining Fc used to parameterize ET equations. Patterns can show when a crop is under‐\n\
    irrigated such as in Figure 4, where the NDVI values for a romaine lettuce crop are lowest midway \n\
    between sprinkler lines, presumably caused by poor irrigation distribution uniformity. \n\
     \nFigure 4. NDVI image of a romaine lettuce field irrigated with sprinklers on lateral pipes (a) spaced \n\

    values were low. Photo credit: CERESimaging Inc., Oakland, CA, USA. \nThe acquisition costs of UAVs and the training needed for mission planning, flight operation, \n\
    and  image  processing  have  diminished  significantly  during  recent  years. \
    \ A  number  of  studies \ndescribe the use of UAVs for monitoring water stress [122,123] and vegetative cover [124,125] of \n\
    crops, though few have specifically focused on vegetables. Due to the ease of operation, arranging \n\
    flights at specific times and locations with UAVs may be simpler than with manned aircraft, which \n\
    usually need to image a minimal number of fields to justify flight costs. This flexibility may be useful \n\
    in vegetables when timely field scouting is needed to make decisions or diagnose a problem with a \n\
    fast‐growing crop. UAVs can fly at very low altitudes and carry sensor packages that can provide \n\
    high‐resolution imagery in the order of a few centimeters. A disadvantage of UAV operation, in the \n\
    case of an owned system, would be a higher up‐front cost than the engagement of a manned aircraft \n\
    provider and additional time required for data retrieval and image processing. \

    \ CERESimaging Inc., Oakland, CA, USA.\nThe acquisition costs of UAVs and the\
    \ training needed for mission planning, ﬂight operation,\nand image processing\
    \ have diminished signiﬁcantly during recent years. A number of studies describe\n\
    the use of UAVs for monitoring water stress [122,123] and vegetative cover [124,125]\
    \ of crops, though\nfew have speciﬁcally focused on vegetables. Due to the ease\
    \ of operation, arranging ﬂights at speciﬁc\ntimes and locations with UAVs may\
    \ be simpler than with manned aircraft, which usually need to\nimage a minimal\
    \ number of ﬁelds to justify ﬂight costs. This ﬂexibility may be useful in vegetables\n\
    when timely ﬁeld scouting is needed to make decisions or diagnose a problem with\
    \ a fast-growing\ncrop. UAVs can ﬂy at very low altitudes and carry sensor packages\
    \ that can provide high-resolution\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 28\n14 of 20\nimagery\
    \ in the order of a few centimeters. A disadvantage of UAV operation, in the case\
    \ of an owned\nsystem, would be a higher up-front cost than the engagement of\
    \ a manned aircraft provider and\nadditional time required for data retrieval\
    \ and image processing.\n9. Conclusions\nWater scarcity will most likely continue\
    \ to be a signiﬁcant problem in many of the important\nvegetable production regions\
    \ of the world [126]. Improving water use efﬁciency through more\naccurate scheduling\
    \ of irrigation can conserve water and address water quality impacts associated\n\
    with commercial vegetable operations. However, irrigation scheduling in vegetables\
    \ presents some\nunique challenges due to the diversity of crop types, intensive\
    \ rotations, and number of ﬁelds\nthat must be managed, as well as competing cultural\
    \ operations that are involved in growing\nmarketable crops. Advances in soil\
    \ moisture sensors, wireless communications, ET measurements,\nremote sensing,\
    \ computer technology, and cloud computing offer many potential opportunities\n\
    to develop robust irrigation advisory tools to help farmers accurately determine\
    \ and meet crop\nwater needs. While much progress has already been made in soil\
    \ moisture sensing and ET-based\nirrigation scheduling, achieving wide-scale adoption\
    \ in the vegetable industry will require continued\ninnovation. Continued collaboration\
    \ between public research institutions, universities, commodity\nboards, and commercial\
    \ ﬁrms will likely be needed to develop simple-to-use tools that will be broadly\n\
    accepted by vegetable growers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors wish to thank Forrest\

    SHARE Abstract Soil moisture (SM) is a key hydrologic state variable that is of
    significant importance for numerous Earth and environmental science applications
    that directly impact the global environment and human society. Potential applications
    include, but are not limited to, forecasting of weather and climate variability;
    prediction and monitoring of drought conditions; management and allocation of
    water resources; agricultural plant production and alleviation of famine; prevention
    of natural disasters such as wild fires, landslides, floods, and dust storms;
    or monitoring of ecosystem response to climate change. Because of the importance
    and wide-ranging applicability of highly variable spatial and temporal SM information
    that links the water, energy, and carbon cycles, significant efforts and resources
    have been devoted in recent years to advance SM measurement and monitoring capabilities
    from the point to the global scales. This review encompasses recent advances and
    the state-of-the-art of ground, proximal, and novel SM remote sensing techniques
    at various spatial and temporal scales and identifies critical future research
    needs and directions to further advance and optimize technology, analysis and
    retrieval methods, and the application of SM information to improve the understanding
    of critical zone moisture dynamics. Despite the impressive progress over the last
    decade, there are still many opportunities and needs to, for example, improve
    SM retrieval from remotely sensed optical, thermal, and microwave data and opportunities
    for novel applications of SM information for water resources management, sustainable
    environmental development, and food security. Key Points Recent soil moisture
    measurement and monitoring techniques and estimation models from the point to
    the global scales and their limitations are presented The importance and application
    of soil moisture information for various Earth and environmental sciences disciplines
    such as forecasting weather and climate variability, modeling hydrological processes,
    and predicting and monitoring extreme events and their impacts on the environment
    and human society are presented 1 Introduction Soil moisture (SM) is a key hydrologic
    state variable that links land surface and atmospheric processes (Robinson et
    al., 2008). Detailed knowledge about the state of SM and its spatial and temporal
    dynamics is of crucial importance for numerous meteorological, climatologic, and
    hydrologic applications and to improve our understanding of the water, energy
    and carbon cycles, as well as for forecasting of extreme climate events (Li et
    al., 2007; Robock & Li, 2006; Seneviratne et al., 2010; Vereecken et al., 2014).
    In general, in situ gravimetric measurements and electromagnetic (EM) sensor networks
    are considered as the most reliable means for direct and accurate determination
    of moisture within the soil profile. However, in situ measurements may be prone
    to uncertainties due to, for example, high salinity levels, loss of intimate contact
    between sensors and the surrounding soil because of shrinkage or biological activity,
    or lack of calibration, especially for soils with high specific surface areas.
    In addition, implementation of such methods is destructive, expensive, and laborious
    (Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014) and they only provide localized
    information about SM dynamics and are not always representative of the larger
    surrounding area (Petropoulos et al., 2013). Because of the high spatial and temporal
    SM variability due to spatiotemporal variations of associated meteorological (precipitation,
    temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity) and biogeophysical (soil
    properties, topographic features, and vegetation characteristics) parameters,
    measurement, and monitoring of large-scale SM dynamics is challenging. During
    the last decade numerous noninvasive techniques have been developed and employed
    to analyze SM patterns and dynamics across various spatial and temporal scales.
    For example, at the field and catchment scales, noninvasive proximal sensing techniques
    have been successfully applied to measure profile SM dynamics (Huisman et al.,
    2003; Kiseleva et al., 2014; Loijens, 1980; Moghadas et al., 2010). Today, ground-based
    and airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (RS) techniques provide an exceedingly
    powerful means for characterization and monitoring of large-scale near-surface
    soil properties and processes at reasonable temporal and spatial resolutions.
    Numerous studies have provided surface and near-surface SM estimates based on
    reflectance and/or emission of EM radiation within the optical (Sadeghi et al.,
    2015; Schnur et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014), thermal (Lei et al., 2014; Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran
    et al., 2013; Verstraeten et al., 2006), active (Bartalis et al., 2018; Ulaby
    et al., 1982; Vinnikov et al., 1999; Wagner et al., 2012), and passive (Chen et
    al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2010; Kerr et al., 2016; Koike et al., 2004; Njoku
    & Entekhabi, 1996) microwave frequency ranges at various spatial scales that include
    the field scale (Jonard et al., 2011; Wigneron et al., 2007), the catchment scale
    (Baatz et al., 2014; Rosenbaum et al., 2012; Western et al., 2004), the regional
    scale (Louvet et al., 2015; Romshoo, 2004; Zhao et al., 2013), and the continental/global
    scale (Entin et al., 2000; Li & Rodell, 2013; Renzullo et al., 2014). Because
    of the limited measurement depth of microwaves, novel data assimilation techniques
    have been developed and implemented in hydrological models to establish links
    between remotely sensed near-surface and root-zone SM (Das et al., 2008; Draper
    et al., 2012; Dumedah et al., 2015; Montzka et al., 2011). Accurate monitoring
    of large-scale SM status is essential for the management of agricultural water
    resources to not only improve knowledge of plant water availability, water use
    efficiency, and water productivity but also to reduce the risks of detrimental
    anthropogenic environmental impacts. SM is an effective indicator for drought
    conditions and flood risks, two major meteorological hazards, and thus plays a
    unique role in their prediction (e.g., under drought conditions the SM anomaly
    typically proceeds the anomaly of the vegetation indices). Saturated soils are
    not able to absorb additional water, which leads to an increase in surface runoff
    and subsequently to flooding. Detailed information about the soil water status
    aids in improving flood prediction accuracy and provides means for near-real-time
    (NRT) flood forecasting. Continuously monitoring the root-zone SM status of agricultural
    crops aids in detection of plant water stress and the onset of drought conditions
    as well as provides the basis for precision irrigation management for provision
    of a water stress-free rhizosphere environment, while preventing leaching of agrochemicals
    and potential groundwater contamination. SM also influences precipitation patterns
    by controlling evapotranspiration, which affects the development of the daytime
    atmospheric boundary layer and thereby the initiation and intensity of convective
    rainfall events. Feedbacks between SM and precipitation are of significant importance
    for weather forecasting (Koster et al., 2004) and the regional hydroclimatic variability
    (Ines & Mohanty, 2008; Mahmood & Hubbard, 2007). Because of the significance and
    wide-ranging applicability of SM information, related research and technological
    advances have gained substantial scientific and public attention in recent years.
    Of late, SM has been included in the list of the 50 most essential climate variables
    (Dorigo et al., 2015) in order to support international organizations with the
    assessment of climate change impacts. In 2010, the Global Climate Observing System
    initiative has defined SM as a fundamental climate variable (Global Climate Observing
    System, 2010). This has prompted the European Space Agency (ESA) to incorporate
    SM in the climate change initiative (CCI; Hollmann et al., 2013). During the past
    decade, several instruments such as the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)
    Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E on the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration''s [NASA] Aqua satellite and Advanced Microwave Scanning
    Radiometer 2 [AMSR-2] on the Global Change Observation Mission-Water [GCOM-W1]
    satellite), the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites
    (EUMETSAT) Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
    (SMOS), the NASA Aquarius, the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and the
    ESA Sentinel-1 that operate in the microwave frequency range are dedicated to
    the measurement of land surface SM (Entekhabi et al., 2010; Kerr et al., 2001;
    Njoku et al., 2003; Paloscia et al., 2013; Wagner et al., 2013). Seneviratne et
    al. (2010) have discussed the role of SM in climate and atmospheric processes
    with focus on SM-temperature and SM-precipitation feedbacks. Dobriyal et al. (2012)
    have provided an overview of landscape-scale SM estimation methods with emphasis
    on water resources sustainability and management. Vereecken et al. (2014) have
    discussed the state of the art of characterizing spatiotemporal field-scale SM
    dynamics and provided an overview of advanced measurement techniques. Petropoulos
    et al. (2015) have provided a comprehensive overview of efforts invested over
    the last 20 years in surface SM retrieval from microwave sensors. Noninvasive
    techniques for characterization of SM dynamics at the field to basin scales have
    been presented in Bogena et al. (2015). This review is aimed at (1) an inclusive
    presentation and discussion of recent advances in ground, proximal, and airborne
    and spaceborne RS techniques that provide novel means for characterization and
    continuous monitoring of SM dynamics across various spatial scales and (2) summarizing
    the available SM data resources and rapidly expanding repositories to promote
    and stimulate future research about novel applications of SM information. The
    review is organized in 10 sections. After introducing the importance and wide-ranging
    impact of SM information, section 2 provides a definition of SM and its relationship
    to various spatial scales. Section 5 presents ground-based point measurement techniques
    and SM sensor networks. Section 13 is devoted to proximal sensing techniques for
    SM retrieval. In section 18, an overview of RS techniques for SM retrieval from
    optical, thermal, and microwave RS information is provided. Section 27 describes
    available data and monitoring resources such as global sensor networks and microwave
    satellite and airborne RS missions and provides an evaluation of microwave satellite
    retrievals. After a discussion of the basic principles of analytical and numerical
    root-zone SM derivations from remotely sensed SM information and data assimilation
    in section 42, spatial and temporal variability inherent to RS of SM applications
    is presented in section 48. In section 52, potential applications of SM information
    are presented and an outlook for future research opportunities is provided. Finally,
    a summary and conclusions are provided in section 59. 2 Definition of SM The SM
    or soil water content, which may be expressed on a gravimetric, θ m , or volumetric,
    θ v , basis represents the amount of water present in the soil at a given matric
    potential (Tuller & Or, 2005). The matric potential, Ψ m (or matric head, h),
    is synonymous with the combined capillary and adsorptive surface forces that hold
    water within the solid soil matrix and are uniquely related to SM under hydrostatic
    conditions. The highly nonlinear relationship between SM and Ψ m is termed the
    soil water characteristic and exhibits a very distinctive shape for each individual
    soil texture (Figure 1). A comprehensive discussion about the origin of, Ψ m ,
    and the measurement and modeling of the soil water characteristic are provided
    in Tuller and Or (2005) and Tuller et al. (1999). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Soil water characteristics for different soil textures. The gravimetric
    SM, θ m (g/g), which can be directly determined by oven drying a wet bulk soil
    sample at 105 °C, is defined as the ratio of the mass of water within the soil
    sample and the mass of the oven-dry solid material. The volumetric SM, θ v (cm3/cm3),
    defined as the volume of water within a given soil volume may be expressed in
    terms of θ m as (Robinson, Campbell, et al., 2008) (1) where ρ b is the dry bulk
    density (g/cm3) of the soil and ρ w is the density of water (g/cm3). When all
    pores are filled with water, θ v is termed saturated water content, θ s . In some
    instances, it is advantageous to express SM in terms of relative saturation, S
    e = θ v /θ s , which is the volumetric SM content normalized to θ s (i.e., pore
    volume; Wagner et al., 2013). In theory, S e ranges from zero, when the soil is
    completely dry, to 1, when all soil pores are completely filled with water. In
    practice, however, it is not possible to attain complete dry or saturated conditions.
    There is always a residual moisture content, θ r , present under dry conditions,
    and it is virtually impossible to completely de-air soil as air bubbles remain
    entrapped in dead-end pores and cavitation nuclei are held tightly in crevices
    of rough particle surfaces (Sadeghi et al., 2018). To account for residual moisture,
    relative saturation is commonly defined as (2) Under wet conditions, due to air
    entrapment in the soil pores, the maximum attainable S e ranges from about 0.94
    to 0.97 (−) for fine-textured (i.e., clay) and coarse-textured (i.e., sand) soils,
    respectively. For agricultural applications, a plant available (or extractable)
    soil water content, θ PAW, is often defined as the difference between the water
    content at field capacity, θ FC, and the water content at the permanent wilting
    point, θ PWP (see Figure 1; Kabat & Beekma, 1994). The θ FC is defined as the
    water content after internal redistribution of water within the soil matrix due
    to gravity (free drainage) and for practical purposes is often assumed to coincide
    with a matric potential of −330 cm. This definition is not entirely correct as
    θ FC is dependent on the soil texture. For example, θ FC for a sandy soil more
    likely coincides with Ψ m = −100 cm. Below the permanent wilting point that is
    defined as the water content at −15,000 cm matric potential, water is so tightly
    bound within the soil matrix that plants are no longer able to recover their turgidity
    and irreversibly wilt. Again, this is only an approximation, as the permanent
    wilting point is dependent on plant physiology. Desert plants, for example, can
    withstand significantly lower matric potentials (drier conditions; Hupet et al.,
    2005). For water balance calculations it is convenient to express SM in length
    units to be consistent with other variables such as precipitation or evapotranspiration.
    This so-called equivalent depth of wetting is obtained by multiplying θ v with
    the depth of the soil layer of interest. 2.1 SM and Measurement Depth of EM Radiation
    Dependent on the penetration depth of EM radiation as well as within the context
    of land surface modeling, the SM content is commonly referred to as (1) skin or
    surface SM, (2) near-surface SM, (3) root-zone SM, or (4) vadose zone SM. Skin
    or surface SM is commonly used within the context of optical and thermal RS and
    describes the water content in the uppermost, very thin soil layer (~z ≤ 1 mm)
    at the interface between the land and the atmosphere. The term near-surface SM
    is usually related to the maximum measurement depth of microwave remote sensors
    (i.e., X-band, C- band, and L-band) and is defined as the average water content
    within the top few centimeters (~1 < z ≤ 10 cm) of surface soil. Root-zone SM
    (RZSM) defines the amount of water stored within the plant root-zone and is available
    for transpiration and biomass production (i.e., photosynthesis). While from a
    terrestrial hydrology point of view, the RZSM is highly variable in space and
    time, it is commonly assumed as the water content of the top 1-m soil layer. It
    can be directly measured with weighing lysimeters or determined with P-band microwave
    remote sensors, cosmic ray sensors (section 8), profiling EM sensors (section
    13), or via modeling approaches (section 42). The vadose or unsaturated zone is
    defined as the soil compartment that extends from the land surface to the depth
    of the unconfined groundwater table. Vadose zone SM can be measured with deep
    penetrating EM radiation such as applied in airborne EM surveys (section 36).
    The measurement depth of EM radiation is dependent on its frequency (wavelength).
    Optical RS techniques measure changes in surface reflectance that are associated
    with a change in soil color (i.e., moist soil appears darker than a dry soil).
    The spectral soil surface reflectance within the visible (Vis, 400–700 nm), near-infrared
    (NIR, 700–1,400 nm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1,400–2,500 nm) EM range decreases
    with increasing SM content (Sadeghi et al., 2015). Thermal infrared techniques
    monitor changes in skin soil temperature that is intimately related to SM. In
    contrast to optical and thermal methods, microwave RS measures bulk dielectric
    soil properties (i.e., bulk dielectric permittivity) that are governed by SM content
    (section 6). Table 1 summarizes the measurement depths of microwave bands (C-band,
    L-band, and P-band) for various land surface covers. While short wavelengths (C-band)
    are applicable for SM retrieval for bare soils or sparse vegetation cover (Baghdadi
    et al., 2012; Prigent et al., 2005), longer wavelengths (L-band and P-band) are
    less (partially) attenuated by vegetation canopies and are amenable for near-surface
    and RZSM determination (Jackson & Schmugge, 1995; Jonard et al., 2011; Moghaddam
    et al., 2000). Jackson and Schmugge (1995) pointed out that the depth of the soil
    layer that contributes to the measured microwave signals (e.g., brightness temperature)
    increases with wavelength. They also discussed that for vegetated surfaces the
    attenuation of the microwave signal increases, affecting the soil layer depth
    contributing to SM retrieval. Table 1. Approximate Microwave Measurement Depths
    for Bare Soil and Different Land Surface Covers Land surface cover X-band (2.5–3.75
    cm) (8–12 GHz) C-band (3.75–7.5 cm) (4–8 GHz) L-band (15–30 cm) (1–2 GHz) P-band
    (30–100 cm) (0.3–1 GHz) Bare soil ~1.25–1.87 cm ~1.87–3.75 cm ~7.5–15 cm ~15–50
    cm Agriculture and rangeland ~0.5–0.75 cm ~0.75–1.5 cm ~3–6 cm ~6–20 cm Forest
    ~0.25–0.37 cm ~0.37–0.75 cm ~1.5–3 cm ~3–10 cm Note. The measurement depth ranges
    for each microwave band were calculated based on one tenth (λ/10), one fifth (λ/5),
    and one half (λ/2) of the wavelength ranges (Karthikeyan et al., 2017; Wilheit,
    1978) assumed for bare soil and sparsely and fully vegetated surfaces, respectively.
    It should be noted that soil moisture content, soil texture, and surface roughness
    also affect the measurement depth of microwave signals. 2.2 Spatial Scales of
    SM SM can be defined for different spatial scales that range from point measurements
    (Miralles et al., 2010; Teuling et al., 2006) all the way to the global scale
    (Kerr et al., 2001; Naeimi et al., 2009). Point observations are commonly directly
    obtained with in situ techniques such as simple gravimetric sampling, various
    EM sensors (time domain reflectometry [TDR], amplitude domain reflectometry [ADR],
    and frequency domain reflectometry [FDR]; see section 6) or application of neutron
    radiation (Famiglietti et al., 1999; Fares et al., 2016; Grayson & Western, 1998;
    Wang et al., 2016) with sensing volumes ranging from about 2 to 40 cm. The significant
    spatial variability of SM, even over a distance of only a few meters (Vereecken
    et al., 2014), creates challenges for accurate determination of larger-scale SM
    with point measurement techniques, unless a large number of sensors are deployed.
    This in many cases is prohibitively expensive and laborious. If spatially averaged
    large-scale SM is of interest, airborne or spaceborne microwave RS sensors with
    spatial resolutions on the order of tens of meters to tens of kilometers are applied.
    To bridge the gap between point and satellite observations, proximal sensing techniques
    can be applied. Figure 2 shows a classification of the SM retrieval techniques
    presented in this review. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification
    of soil moisture (SM) measurement methods: spaceborne and airborne remote sensing
    techniques (top left), static and mobile proximal sensing methods (top middle),
    and in situ/ground sensor measurements (top right) for continuous monitoring of
    SM dynamics (bottom scatterplot, illustrating an example of Soil Moisture Active
    Passive (SMAP) surface SM vs. in situ data for the Arizona Walnut Gulch site).
    A unique definition of the spatial scales of SM measurements has been provided
    by Western and Bloschl (1999). They proposed a scale definition based on spacing,
    extent, and support that applies to both SM measurements and models. The term
    “spacing” refers to the distance between measurement points or model elements,
    the term “extent” to the overall coverage, and “support” refers to the measurement
    or model integration volume or area. As an example, for a network of TDR SM sensors
    deployed in a field, the scale may be defined based on 101-m spacing (distance
    between sensors), 102-m2 extent (area of the field), and 103-cm3 support (volume
    of the soil sampled with a TDR sensor). Similarly, for a satellite image (e.g.,
    Landsat-8) the scale would be defined based on 30-m spacing (distance between
    the centers of two neighboring pixels), 170 km × 185 km extent (the footprint
    area), and 302-m2 support (the pixel size for bands 1 to 9; Figure 3). The major
    application of such spatial terms is to study spatial variability of SM with respect
    to the effect of geophysical and climate parameters. An overview of spatial scale
    in terms of support and extent of existing SM measurement instruments and networks
    is provided in Table 2. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Definition of
    spatial scales based on “support,” “spacing,” and “extent” as related to (a) in

    is devoted to novel and evolving SM measurement techniques ranging from neutron
    scattering, EM, and heat pulse probe (HPP) point-scale methods to larger-scale
    cosmic ray neutron and other EM-based methods. In addition, other recent technologies
    such as (wireless) SM networks (WSMN) are introduced and their potential to improve
    our understanding of hydrologic processes is evaluated. 3.1 Neutron Scattering
    The neutron scattering technology was first introduced by Brummer and Mardock
    (1945) for laboratory applications. Underwood et al. (1954) and Holmes (1955)
    were the first to develop and deploy portable neutron probes (NP) for in situ
    SM measurements for agricultural applications. The theory at the core of the neutron
    scattering technique is based on the tendency for hydrogen nuclei to slow (thermalize)
    high-energy (2–4 MeV) neutrons to approach the characteristic speed of particles
    at ambient temperature with corresponding energies of about 0.03 eV. A typical
    NP consists of a radioactive neutron source (americium-241 and beryllium) and
    a detector to determine the flux of thermalized neutrons that form a cloud of
    nearly constant density near the probe. Neutrons lose different amounts of energy
    when colliding with various atomic nuclei. The greatest energy loss is due to
    collisions with particles of similar mass, such as hydrogen. The quantity of hydrogen
    in the soil is largely dependent on the amount of water and to a lesser extent
    on the amount of organic matter and clay minerals. Therefore, a calibration function
    that relates the number of detected slow neutrons to soil water content can be
    developed. The sphere of influence (measurement volume) of a NP depends on the
    SM content and chemical composition and on the strength of the radioactive source
    (Figure 4). Note that reliable measurements cannot be obtained close to the soil
    surface (i.e., top 20 cm) as neutrons escape into the atmosphere. Ideally, the
    NP should be calibrated for each soil type (soil-specific calibration) and access
    tube material (Vachaud et al., 1977). Prior to the terrorist attacks on 9/11,
    NPs utilizing a radioactive source and detector were widely used for SM profile
    assessment as part of irrigation management owing to the ability to monitor water
    content in bore holes. The subsequent increase in regulations and paperwork related
    to radioactive devices has made NPs impractical for most users. Additional information
    about the practical and theoretical aspects of neutron scattering for SM measurements
    are provided in Sadeghi, Babaeian, et al. (2018). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Schematic of a portable neutron probe. The cosmic ray neutron probe
    (CRNP) for recording the neutrons that are generated by cosmic rays within air
    and soil and other materials is a newer method for noninvasively measuring area-averaged
    (effective) SM within the top soil (Zreda et al., 2008). Similar to the NP method,
    a calibration function is commonly developed to relate the change in low-energy
    neutrons to the change in hydrogen content for SM determination. For instance,
    a common theoretical function has been developed by Desilets et al. (2010) relating
    SM to relative neutron counts (3) where N is the neutron count rate (count per
    hour) normalized to a reference atmospheric pressure and solar activity level
    and N 0 is the counting rate (count per hour) over dry soil under the same reference
    conditions. A detailed description of the cosmic ray technique can be found in
    Zreda et al. (2012). Due to the higher propagation of cosmic rays in thin air,
    the lateral footprint extent is inversely proportional to the atmospheric (vapor)
    pressure and is up to 300 m in diameter, while the penetration depth strongly
    depends on the SM content and ranges from 15 cm in wet soils to approximately
    70 cm in dry soils (Franz et al., 2012; Zreda et al., 2008). Figure 5 shows simulations
    with the Ultra Rapid Adaptable Neutron-Only Simulation (URANOS) code that was
    tailored by Köhli et al. (2015) to simulate neutron transport for environmental
    science applications. The figure illustrates the simulated interactions of cosmic-ray
    neutrons in the ground (black dots), the estimated footprint radius and penetration
    depth within which 86% of the detected neutrons originated, and the respective
    histograms over distance and depth. The shown values are exemplary, while the
    exact CRNP footprint volume and sensitivity depend on soil moisture, bulk density,
    and atmospheric conditions and are still an active area of research. At present,
    most research is being conducted to interpret the measured signals, as the sensors
    measure not only SM but also the presence of water in vegetation, subsurface biomass
    and organic matter, surface water, atmospheric vapor, and clay lattices water
    (Baatz et al., 2015, Andreasen et al., 2017). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    to detection in a central virtual CRNP sensor at (x = 0, y = 0, z = 2 m). The
    top panels show a birdseye view in a 320 × 320 m2 domain, an estimated footprint
    radius within which 86% of neutrons originated, and a corresponding histogram
    over radius (in m). The bottom panels show a slice through the ground, the estimated
    footprint depth (in cm) over radius (in m), and the corresponding histogram over
    depth (in cm). Real values depend on soil moisture, bulk density, and atmospheric
    conditions. The figure was extracted from the supporting information of Köhli
    et al. (2015), http://www.ufz.de/cosmosfootprint. SM derived from CRNP is frequently
    validated using local-scale wireless SM networks (Franz et al., 2012). Comparison
    of CRNP measurements with TDR SM data at 10 test sites in Germany (catchment of
    the river Rur) demonstrated reliable measurements of SM with root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) of 0.032 cm3/cm3 (Baatz et al., 2014). Baatz et al. (2014) installed
    a catchment-wide network consisting of 10 cosmic ray sensor systems at the Terrestrial
    Environmental Observatories (TERENO) Rur site in Germany in order to compare three
    different parameterization methods: (1) the N-O method, (2) the hydrogen molar
    fraction method (hmf method), and (3) the Cosmic method. All three methods were
    found to perform well after calibration. The hmf and Cosmic methods showed more
    similar calibration curves than the N-O method. First attempts are now being undertaken
    to establish networks of CRNP at larger scales. The COsmic ray Soil Moisture Observing
    System (COSMOS) network (Zreda et al., 2012) is presently being installed in the
    United States with the aim to install 500 cosmic ray sensors (see section 27).
    Currently, there are approximately 194 permanent CRNP stations worldwide (Andreasen
    et al., 2017) including 109 COSMOS stations in the United States (Zreda et al.,
    2012), 20 TERENO stations in Germany (Baatz et al., 2015), 13 CosmOz stations
    in Australia (Hawdon et al., 2014), and 32 COSMOS-UK stations in the United Kingdom
    (Evan et al., 2016). Also, mobile CRNP rover systems have been developed (Dong
    et al., 2014). Due to its large footprint, the CRNP could potentially fill the
    spatial gap between SM ground point data and satellite estimates; hence, it can
    serve as a reference for the validation of satellite SM products. The CRNP SM
    has been recently used for validation of spaceborne SM products such as SMAP,
    SMOS, and ASCAT in the United States, Australia, Europe and Africa (Akbar & Moghaddam,
    2015; Babaeian et al., 2018; Fascetti et al., 2016; Montzka et al., 2017; Van
    der Schalie et al., 2016). One important limitation of the CRNP in humid climates
    and wooded regions is that it is significantly influenced by various sources of
    hydrogen in environment (e.g., water vapor in the atmosphere, litter water, organic
    matter, and root biomass), which in some cases yield volumetric SM contents that
    exceed soil porosity. Thus, CRNP data need some additional adjustments to remove
    the effect of additional hydrogen contained in these pools. Adjustment methods
    have been presented in Franz, Zreda, Ferre, et al. (2012) and Bogena et al. (2013).
    Figure 6 shows an example of CRNP data adjustment for the Arizona Walnut Gulch
    site after subtracting the contribution of additional hydrogen pools during converting
    neutron counts into SM content. It is obvious that corrected CRNP data better
    capture in situ SM data from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). Figure

    Walnut Gulch site in Arizona. Uncorrected and corrected data after removing the

    and lattice water) are shown. The colored lines represent Soil Climate Analysis
    Network (SCAN) soil moisture data at different depths. CRNP = Cosmic Ray Neutron
    Probe. 3.2 EM SM Sensors Topp et al. (1980) revolutionized soil water content
    sensing with the introduction of TDR. At that time, the first TDR instruments
    were very expensive and only deployable for laboratory measurements. Since then,
    the costs of TDR devices have decreased by several orders of magnitude, while
    other EM sensors based on capacitance or impedance circuits have also been developed.
    As a result, over the last decade, numerous companies have developed a variety
    of sensors based on EM measurements of soil permittivity (Bogena et al., 2007;
    Jones et al., 2005; Seyfried & Murdock, 2004; Vaz et al., 2013). Permittivity,
    also called dielectric constant, is a measure of the electrical potential energy
    of a substance under the influence of an EM field. The EM sensor electric field
    is generally directed into the soil along 2-, 3-, or 4-parallel electrodes or
    an adjacent pair of rings. For example, the Hydra Probe (Stevens Water Monitoring
    Systems Inc.) uses one central and three outer electrodes based on an impedance
    circuit operating at 50 MHz. The Hydra Probe is the only EM water content sensor
    offering both real and imaginary permittivity output (Figure 7a). While there
    is potential to extract additional information from complex permittivity, few
    have attempted to fully utilize these measurements (Kelleners et al., 2005; Peplinski
    et al., 1995). The Hydra Probe is widely used by the U.S. federal agencies in
    weather and snow monitoring stations (e.g., SCAN; SNOwpack TELemetry, and SNOTEL).
    The measurement of permittivity provides a highly accurate determination of water
    content in soil because the permittivity of water is about 80, while permittivities
    of solids and air are around 4 and 1, respectively. Interestingly, the most accurate
    water content determination method remains the original TDR method operating at
    around 1-GHz frequency, despite a larger number of low-cost low-frequency (<100
    MHz) water content sensors being marketed today (Blonquist et al., 2005; Vaz et
    al., 2013). In general, TDR does not require soil-specific calibration and is
    less susceptible to secondary effects such as electrical conductivity, temperature
    and relaxation (from high clay or organic matter content) than lower-frequency
    EM sensors. This immunity to secondary effects comes in part because of the higher
    measurement frequency (~1 GHz) and the use of travel time as the measurement method.
    The travel time, t, of the EM signal is proportional to the relative permittivity,
    K r , of the substance through which it travels according to (4) Figure 7 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Examples of electromagnetic water content sensors
    are (a) the Stevens Water impedance-based Hydra Probe measuring at 50 MHz, (b)
    the Acclima True TDR measuring in the range of 1000 MHz, and (c) the Sentek capacitance-based
    EnviroSCAN sensor, which employs frequency domain resonance, that is, the water
    content determines the resonant frequency in the range from 100 to 150 MHz. (Please
    note that sensor manufacturers are only named for the convenience of readers,
    which does not imply an endorsement of specific sensors by the authors). where
    l is the length of the TDR electrodes and c is the speed of light (3 × 108 m/s)
    (Robinson et al., 2003). Once K r is measured, the relationship between the volumetric
    moisture content (θ) of the substance and K r is given from a general mixing model
    (Dobson et al., 1985; Jones et al., 2002), written as (5) where n is the soil
    porosity and subscripts s, a, and w refer to permittivities of constituent solids
    (minerals), air, and water, respectively. The exponent β summarizes the geometry
    of the substance and has a range −1 < β < 1, with β = 0.5 representing an isotropic
    mixed medium. Recently, gigahertz frequency TDR (Figure 7b) has been developed
    and reduced in size using low-cost cellular phone components, facilitating production
    of TDR sensors that are competitively priced with more common lower-frequency
    sensors. Limitations of the TDR method include restricted applicability under
    highly saline conditions due to signal attenuation and the requirement of soil-specific
    calibration for soils with high clay or organic matter (OM) contents. Severe attenuation
    of TDR waveforms in the presence of high salinity and/or some clays having high
    surface area and surface charge may interfere with, or even preclude, water content
    measurements. In soils with an abundance of 2:1 clay minerals that commonly exhibit
    large specific surface areas, the bulk dielectric permittivity is more susceptible
    to temperature fluctuations due to the release of bound water under very dry conditions
    (Escorihuela et al., 2007; Wraith & Or, 1999). In organic matter rich soils, the
    amount of bound water is commonly higher due to the large specific surface are
    and associated higher adsorptive surface forces, which is manifested in lower
    bulk permittivity values when compared to soils with low OM contents (Bircher
    et al., 2016). Further limitations include the inability to measure the frozen
    water content due to the similarity of the permittivities of ice and the mineral
    soil constituents (Jagdhuber et al., 2014) and restricted applicability in highly
    structured soils with an abundance of large pores that prevent a close contact
    between the sensor electrodes and the soil matrix. In recent years, several EM-based
    borehole or downhole solutions, most employing parallel rings and capacitance
    circuitry to estimate water content in the vicinity of the cylindrical sensor
    (Figure 7c), have been developed. A growing trend for environmental sensors in
    general is to employ SDI-12 communication, which uses addressing to facilitate
    multiple sensors connected to a single digital port of a data logger. With options
    for addressing with single digit numbers and both uppercase and lowercase letters,
    more than 60 sensors can be connected to each available port on a data logging
    device. Given these advances, deployment of water content sensors for RS calibration
    has become more user friendly with lower costs. In general, EM-sensors are well
    suited for monitoring SM profiles, but seemingly few if any were developed specifically
    for near-surface moisture monitoring. In order to calibrate optical RS measurements
    from satellites or drones, the soil “skin” moisture content is needed, but common
    practice has the closest sensor to the surface at just 5 cm below the surface.
    This leads to a great deal of uncertainty since the soil typically wets and dries
    from the surface downward. There are certainly times when the surface has been
    wetted by rainfall, but the wetting did not penetrate to the sensor, and similarly,
    when the surface has air dried while the soil 5 cm below the surface is still
    quite moist. For these scenarios and others, novel and improved EM-based sensors
    are desired to address the growing need for accurately calibrating soil surface
    RS data using ground measurements more focused on the soil skin. Recently, a novel
    sensing instrument has been developed for more accurate measuring surface and
    near-surface SM content. Sheng et al. (2017) designed and tested a TDR array sensor
    that provides centimeter-resolution measurements of near-surface SM (0–8 cm) with
    high accuracy (±1 permittivity unit). 3.3 HPPs The use of heat as a tracer for
    thermal property determination in soil was pioneered several decades ago, but
    technological limitations hindered application of this method (Al Nakshabandi
    & Kohnke, 1965; De Vries, 1958). HPP were miniaturized, and their measurements
    automated in the early 1990''s (Bristow et al., 1993; Campbell et al., 1991),
    and a growing body of literature attests to the many applications for which they
    are well suited owing to the water content dependence of soil thermal properties
    (Hopmans et al., 2002; Kamai et al., 2008; Y. Lu et al., 2014, Lu et al., 2016;
    Ochsner et al., 2003; Ren et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2013). Probes generally consist
    of one heater needle (typically 18 Ga or 1.27-mm diameter) and one to five thermistor
    needles spaced approximately 6 mm from the heater needle, which makes them ideally
    suited to small sample interrogation (Figure 8). Various algorithms have been
    developed and applied to infer thermal conductivity (λ, W·m−1·K−1), thermal diffusivity
    (k, m2/s), or heat capacity (C, J·m−3·K−1) from HPP temperature rise measurements.
    The interrelationship between these three thermal properties means that only two
    of the three parameters must be determined for calculation of the third. The heat
    capacity can be computed from (6) Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Heat
    pulse probes used for thermal property assessment: (a) a commercial dual-needle
    probe for heat capacity determination (METER Group Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) and
    (b) the Utah State University-developed penta-needle heat pulse probe yielding
    thermal conductivity and diffusivity in addition to heat (and water) velocity
    in two directions. (Please note that sensor manufacturers are only named for the
    convenience of readers, which does not imply an endorsement of specific sensors
    by the authors). A heat pulse of 8 s is generally applied resulting in a temperature
    rise of about 1 °C at the sensing needles. This translates to 5% precision in
    heat capacity estimation if temperature measurements are on the order of 0.05
    °C accuracy (Kluitenberg et al., 1993). These measured temperature rise data are
    used to fit one or more thermal properties as functions of analytical or numerical
    solutions. One estimate of k is given as (Bristow et al., 1994) (7) where r is
    the mean heater needle to thermistor needle spacing, t m is the time from the
    initiation of heating to the occurrence of the maximum temperature, T max, and
    t 0 is the heating duration (8 s). To estimate λ, an expression for C from Knight
    and Kluitenberg (2004) is multiplied with the thermal diffusivity (8) where e
    is the Naperian constant (≈2.718) and ε = t 0 /t m . The soil volumetric heat
    capacity is an important link between thermal properties and volumetric moisture
    content of soil (θ). The soil heat capacity describes the amount of heat stored
    in the soil, which can be summed as the heat capacities of individual constituents
    according to (De Vries, 1963) (9) where ρ is constituent density (kg/m3), c is
    constituent specific heat (J·kg−1·K−1), ϕ is total porosity, and subscripts s,
    w, and a indicate the soil''s solid, water, and air phases, respectively. If the
    air phase is neglected and the solid phase is assumed to exhibit typical soil
    mineral density and heat capacity, we can substitute C w  = (ρc) w and C s = (ρc)
    s resulting in a simplified relationship written as (Campbell, 1985) (10) Estimates
    of C can ultimately be used to estimate the soil volumetric water content, θ,
    using the expression (11) where ρ b is soil bulk density (kg/m3) and c s is the
    specific heat capacity of the soil solids (J·kg−1·°C−1). Heat pulse sensor needles
    are generally short, and needle spacing is several millimeters apart because of
    the interest in minimizing energy input to the soil while maximizing the signal
    to noise ratio. This makes heat pulse measurements well suited for near-surface
    determination of soil properties including SM content (Mori et al., 2003). 3.4
    Other SM Sensors A potential new source of information about continental-scale
    SM is observations of temporal changes in gamma radiation. It has long been recognized
    that airborne gamma radiation surveys with low-flying planes can be used to determine
    SM content (Carroll, 1981) and snow water equivalent (SWE) for flood forecasting
    applications (Peck et al., 1971). The GAMMA instrument on the NOAA AC690A Turbo
    Commander aircraft has been used operationally by NOAA''s National Weather Service
    since 1979 to measure the mean areal SWE and SM along the flight path (Peck et
    al., 1980). Attenuation of natural terrestrial gamma radiation by water in air,
    snow, soil, and vegetation between the ground and the aircraft is the basis of
    SWE and SM measurements. After the nuclear reactor accident in Chernobyl in 1986,
    most countries of the European Union established in situ monitoring networks measuring
    outdoor gamma radiation for early warning. The data are composite gamma radiation
    measurements over a broad energy spectrum, and the sources of gamma radiation
    can be separated into terrestrial, cosmic, and artificial origin. These gamma
    radiation measurements are published in near-real time and archived by the EUropean
    Radiological Data Exchange Platform. As a result of this network of networks,
    measurements of more than 4,600 monitoring stations are made accessible to the
    public at least once a day. The footprint of a typical EUropean Radiological Data
    Exchange Platform gamma ray monitoring station has a radius of about 7 m and 90%
    of the sensor response originates from the top 12 to 25 cm of the soil (Bogena
    et al., 2015; Mao et al., 2015). The gamma ray intensity measured near the soil
    surface has been shown to be related to soil water content (Mao et al., 2015),
    but it is also known to depend on cosmic rays that enter and interact with the
    atmosphere, anthropogenic Cs137 from nuclear tests and accidents, and atmospheric
    Rn222. For accurate SM estimation from gamma radiation measurements, all interfering
    time variable, anthropogenic, and nonterrestrial signals have to be removed from
    the data (Bogena et al., 2015). If this can be achieved, SM of the top 25 cm of
    the soil can be determined with an expected accuracy of 0.025 g/g (Loijens, 1980).
    Recently, the potential of gamma ray sensors for measuring SM has gained popularity,
    especially in Europe where these sensors have been deployed in the aftermath of
    the Chernobyl nuclear accident to monitor the spread and fate of radionuclides.
    A comprehensive review of these methods is provided in Bogena et al. (2015). Another
    promising technology for SM determination at larger scales is the utilization
    and analysis of signals that are recorded on the ground through Global Navigation
    Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers (Katzberg
    et al., 2006; Larson et al., 2008; Rodriguez-Alvarez et al., 2009) that have initially
    been established for geodynamic (navigation and positioning) applications. In
    this technique, also called GPS interferometric reflectometry (GPS-IR or GNSS-IR),
    SM retrieval is based on the analysis of power variations of the GNSS signals,
    where the direct signal from the GNSS satellite and the signal reflected by the
    land surface are simultaneously received by the antenna (Figure 9). Considering
    their phase difference due to the motion of the GNSS satellites, the simultaneously
    received direct and coherently reflected signals cause an interference pattern
    in the signal power. This interference pattern is dependent on the height differences
    between the GNSS antenna and the reflection level (Vey et al., 2016). The interference
    between the direct and reflected signals produces a modulation that can be observed
    in temporal variations of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) recorded by the GPS
    receiver. A change in the soil permittivity (due to change in moisture content)
    affects all three GPS interferogram parameters, including the effective reflector
    height, amplitude, and phase (Larson et al., 2008), where the phase of the SNR
    is the most sensitive parameter for SM determination. If the soil is wet, the
    active L-band microwave GNSS signal (~1.2 and 1.5 GHz) is reflected from a layer
    just below the land surface, while for dry soil the signal penetrates deeper into
    the soil and is reflected within a surface layer of up to 7-cm thickness (Bogena
    et al., 2015). It has been shown that the changes in SNR are highly correlated
    with near-surface SM in the top 5 cm of soil (Larson et al., 2010; Rodriguez-Alvarez
    et al., 2009, 2010). It has been also demonstrated that GPS-based SM estimates
    are independent of the soil type (Chew et al., 2014). Figure 9 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Sketch illustrating the geometry of a multipath signal for antenna
    height ha and satellite elevation angle θE. Black and gray arrows represent the
    Global Positioning System signal transmitted from the satellite and the reflected
    signal from the ground, respectively. The solid circle represents the gain pattern
    of the antenna, and the dashed circles indicate power levels of the receiving
    antenna gain pattern. When the satellite is approaching the horizon, the reflected
    signal is associated to a larger distance to the Global Positioning System antenna.
    The GNSS-IR has been shown to have great potential for SM estimation using ground-based
    receivers (Chew et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018). However, variables such as
    snow depth and vegetation water over land may affect SM retrieval accuracy (Larson
    et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2017). The GNSS-IR footprint can cover up to thousands
    of square meters, depending on antenna height and satellite elevation angle (Larson
    et al., 2010). For a GPS antenna installed at heights of 1 and 50 m, the footprint
    area radius varies from 50 to 330 m (Bogena et al., 2015). In this technique,
    the current temporal resolution of SM retrievals is daily because each GPS satellite
    has a 1-day revisit time at any antenna location. Numerous studies have been conducted
    in different regions of the World indicating the good accuracy of SM retrievals
    from GNSS data (Chew et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Alvarez et al., 2009; Sanchez et
    al., 2015). Recently, Zhang et al. (2018) analyzed GNSS-IR data over a dense grassland
    site in southwestern France and compared the GNSS SM retrievals to in situ observations
    at 5-cm depth and reported RMSE values of 0.035 cm3/cm3 (for grass covered surfaces)
    and 0.018 cm3/cm3 (after grass has been cut). We also compared the GPS SM inferred
    over a Savana site in California to the SMAP L4 surface SM values and obtained
    a very similar pattern with R 2 and RMSE values of 0.52 and 0.09 cm3/cm3, respectively
    (Figure 10). Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture content
    inferred with GPS-IR (circles) compared to SMAP L4 surface soil moisture (black
    line) over California (Calaveras GPS site with Savanna vegetation cover) and daily
    precipitation (blue bars) from April 2015 to October 2017. The green symbols represent
    standard deviation (SD). GPS = Global Positioning System; SMAP = Soil Moisture
    Active Passive. The NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CyGNSS) that
    has been designed for tropical ocean surface wind sensing is also capable to record
    GNSS reflections over land and thus has potential for large-scale SM estimations.
    In a study by Kim and Lakshmi (2018), they used the CyGNSS in conjunction with
    SMAP SM and provided improved SM estimates with higher temporal resolution (five
    times per day). Chew and Small (2018) related L-band CyGNSS signals to SMAP SM
    and found a strong positive linear correlation between the change in CyGNSS reflectivity
    and the change in SMAP SM with a daily averaged RMSE of 0.045 cm3/cm3. Yet direct
    applications of this technology to improve our understanding of hydrological processes
    need to be documented in literature. The value of these larger-scale networks
    resides less in their potential to directly study hydrological processes but rather
    in their ability to provide spatially averaged data for the calibration and validation
    of remotely sensed data and their use in data assimilation methods to improve
    predictions of hydrological fluxes and states. The GPS SM data are available publicly
    through the National Science Foundation Plant Boundary Observatory (NSF''Topps
    Plant Boundary Observatory) at http://xenon. colorado. edu/portal/. 3.5 Wireless
    Network Technology 3.5.1 Network Structure The development of WSMNs has gained
    a strong momentum in the last few years due to the development of low-cost SM
    sensors and transmitting technologies, offering the potential to determine spatiotemporal
    SM dynamics at the field to catchment scales (Bogena et al., 2015; Vereecken et
    al., 2014) and permitting real-time data access to distributed SM sensors through
    a centralized communication architecture. Most WSMNs consist of five basic elements,
    including (1) a series of SM probe/sensor nodes, (2) a series of infrastructure
    nodes or routers, (3) an end node (gateway or coordinator) for data gathering
    and transfer, (4) a datalogger or PC, and (5) an internet server with a web interface.
    SM probes which are installed below the soil surface should be low cost, reliable,
    low power, and easy to install (Robinson, Campbell, et al., 2008). The most promising
    sensors are those that measure soil electrical permittivity, as described above
    in section 6. The routers are commonly installed above the ground. They receive
    data from SM probe nodes and other infrastructure nodes and transfer to the coordinator.
    Each network has only a single coordinator which controls and keeps the network
    running and streams information from the sensor network to the user and vice versa.
    ZigBee Alliance (ZigBee Alliance, 2010) is a low-cost mesh networking property
    standard that has been widely used for communication in wireless control and monitoring
    applications (Bogena et al., 2010; Kuorilehto et al., 2008; Valente et al., 2006).
    Two main topologies for wireless sensor networks have been proposed: (i) underground
    topology and (ii) hybrid topology (Akyildiz & Stuntebeck, 2006). In underground
    topology all sensor units are deployed below the soil surface except for the coordinator
    unit (Ritsema et al., 2009). Whereas in hybrid topology a combination of underground
    and aboveground devices is considered. It has been pointed out that a hybrid topology,
    which is composed of a mixture of underground sensors and aboveground router devices,
    is preferable to achieve longer transmission ranges (Bogena et al., 2009). The
    basic structure of hybrid topology is illustrated in Figure 11. Figure 11 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint An example for a hybrid topology wireless soil moisture
    network (adapted from Bogena et al., 2010). Since WSMNs mainly operate on battery
    power, overall power consumption becomes a critical constraint. Thus, it is important
    to design WSMNs that minimize retransmissions. Underground topologies require
    considerable power to overcome soil attenuation. Hybrid topologies on the other
    hand allow data to be routed from the underground in a few steps, thus reducing
    underground travel distance to conserve power (Bogena et al., 2010). 3.5.2 WSMN
    Applications Many WSMNs have been used to study spatiotemporal dynamics of SM
    at the field (Vereecken et al., 2014), catchment (Graf et al., 2014; Schröter
    et al., 2015) and landscape (Qu et al., 2015) scales. Earlier work has focused
    on the identification of SM patterns and their temporal stability (Brocca, Tullo,
    et al., 2012; Mittelbach & Seneviratne, 2012; Western et al., 1999). The seminal
    work of Western et al. (1999) about the Tarrawarra catchment where they deployed
    an array of SM sensors showed that SM in catchments exhibits dry and wet states
    that switch in function due to the interplay between local and nonlocal hydrological
    controls. This finding has been further corroborated in other catchment studies
    such as at the TERENO Wüstebach site in Germany (Graf et al., 2014). Brocca et
    al. (2014) used data from six SM networks around the Earth to study absolute versus
    temporal anomaly and percentage of global SM saturation. One major application
    of WSMNs is the validation of SM products from microwave RS missions. Recently,
    Wiekenkamp et al. (2016) used wireless SM networks to identify the occurrence
    and controls of preferential flow in a forested catchment. Their approach is based
    on the work of Graham and Lin (2011), who based on the changes in SM observed
    at different depths after rainfall events identified three major flow regimes:
    preferential flow, sequential flow, and nondetectable flow. Preferential flow
    refers to out of sequence SM changes where deeper locations respond earlier to
    an increase in soil water than locations closer to the surface. The SM measurements
    indicated that preferential flow occurred throughout the catchment. No clear controls
    triggering the spatial occurrence of preferential flow could be identified. Wiekenkamp
    et al. (2016) used the WSMN at the Wüstebach site to analyze catchment-wide controls
    of preferential flow. Based on the sensor response times, they identified four
    different flow regimes: (1) nonsequential preferential flow, (2) velocity-based
    preferential flow, (3) sequential flow, and (4) no response. Different potential
    factors that may control preferential flow and its spatial occurrence were analyzed:
    hydrological, topographical, and soil physical and chemical parameters as well
    as temporal factors such as precipitation events and antecedent SM status were
    studied. None of these factors were found to control preferential flow. Apparently,
    occurrence of preferential flow was governed by small-scale soil and biological
    processes. During storm events, the preferential flow occurred across the whole
    catchment. Blume et al. (2009) used a combination of sparse SM measurements in
    space, but with high temporal resolution, and rainfall simulation experiments
    and dye tracing to study the controls of preferential flow. They found that hydrophobicity
    in combination with small-scale variability in rainfall and strong heterogeneity
    in hydraulic conductivity were the main drivers controlling preferential flow.
    Stockinger et al. (2014) used the WSMN in combination with stable δO18 isotope
    measurements in water to study travel time distributions in the Wüstebach catchment.
    They showed that the presence of wet and dry states is reflected in the stream
    flow discharge pattern. Under the dry state, the uphill regions of the headwater
    catchment are disconnected from the river system and were found not to contribute
    to discharge. Only the riparian part of the catchment is contributing to river
    discharge under this state. Under the wet state both the uphill and riparian part
    of the catchment supply water for river discharge. The change from wet to dry
    state was found to occur at a mean water content of 0.35 cm3/cm3, which corresponds
    to the maximum spatial variation of soil water. SM data obtained from wireless
    sensor networks can be coalesced to produce the mean water content (σ θ ) function
    (i.e., the relationship between the spatial mean of SM and its standard deviation)
    for the observation area. The interpretation and analysis of this function has
    been the focus of various studies (Qu et al., 2014; Rosenbaum et al., 2012). Vereecken
    et al. (2007) was the first to use a closed form analytical expression based on
    stochastic perturbation theory to predict this function. Rosenbaum et al. (2012)
    observed the presence of hysteretic behavior in the σ θ with drying events leading
    to a decrease in the spatial variability and wetting events to an increase for
    identical mean water content values. Qu et al. (2014) applied inverse optimization
    of the observed SM content values using the Hydrus-1D model at 102 points at the
    German TERENO Rollesbroich site to link temporal stability of measured locations
    with key soil hydraulic properties (SHPs). Qu et al. (2015) expanded the work
    of Vereecken (2007) by deriving a closed form expression for the van Genuchten
    (1980) equation. Using pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to generate the input parameters
    for the closed form expression, they were able to predict the σ θ function for
    different sites. This approach has been applied at the global scale by Montzka
    et al. (2017). 4 Proximal Sensing Methods Because of high costs and laborious
    installation of point-scale SM sensors, they are not well suited to provide spatially
    continuous profile SM distributions at larger scales. In recent years, several
    geophysical proximal sensing methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), ground-based
    radiometer and radar systems, electromagnetic induction (EMI), and magnetic resonance
    imaging (MRI) techniques have been developed for field-scale SM determination
    (Robinson et al., 2008; Robinson, Campbell, et al., 2008). It should be noted
    that CRNP and GPS methods (section 8) may be considered as proximal sensing techniques.
    However, here we classify them as ground-based techniques as they provide temporally
    continuous SM measurements and have been used in SM networks for calibration and
    validation of remotely sensed SM estimates. This section provides an overview
    of the basic principles and recent advances of proximal sensing techniques. 4.1
    GPR GPR, also known as georadar, subsurface radar, and ground probing radar, is
    a promising proximal soil sensing technique that has proven to be applicable for
    high-resolution profile SM mapping in two or three dimensions at the field scale.
    The GPR technique can be used to bridge the present scale gap between small-scale
    invasive sensors (e.g., TDR sensors) and large-scale airborne or satellite RS
    observations. GPRs transmit high-frequency (1 MHz to 1 GHz) EM signals into the
    subsurface in a noninvasive manner. The travel time associated with an EM signal
    traveling between a radar transmitter and receiver is measured and used to estimate
    the dielectric permittivity of the soil (Huisman et al., 2002, 2003). GPR-derived
    dielectric bulk permittivity is then transformed to volumetric SM content using,
    for example, Topp''s empirical relationship (Topp et al., 1980) or other dielectric
    mixing models (Sihvola, 1999). Three GPR types including cross-borehole, airborne
    or off-ground, and surface-based or on-ground systems are commonly deployed for
    SM determination (Huisman, Hubbard, et al., 2003). Cross-borehole systems are
    used to monitor SM dynamics in the vadose zone. The transmitting and receiving
    antennas are located in two parallel boreholes and generate a two-dimensional
    velocity image between the boreholes, which can then be converted to dielectric
    permittivity and consequently to SM (Binley et al., 2002; Looms et al., 2008).
    The borehole GPR has been successfully applied to reconstruct two-dimensional
    images (tomographs) of SM distributions between borehole locations (Binley et
    al., 2001; Looms et al., 2008), but it remains limited to smaller-scale (a few
    meters) applications, as it requires the installation of vertical boreholes for
    transmitter and receiver deployment. Although borehole GPR performs well (van
    der Kruk, 2006), the systems are time consuming to operate, effectively limiting
    their suitability for larger-scale spatial investigations. Alternatively, off-ground
    and on-ground GPR systems have been deployed to map SM variability at the field
    scale (Ardekani, 2013; Jonard et al., 2011; Minet et al., 2012; Serbin & Or, 2003).
    Off-ground GPR configurations are installed at distinct heights above the soil
    surface and in many cases mounted on mobile platforms to rapidly move over the
    soil surface. Such systems are also used for airborne and spaceborne applications
    (Ulaby et al., 1986). Using full-waveform GPR signal modeling, field-scale SM
    mapping is feasible (Lambot et al., 2004; Minet et al., 2012; Weihermüller et
    al., 2007). Combined with a vector network analyzer, off-ground systems commonly
    use the surface reflection coefficient for soil characterization and SM estimation
    (Jonard et al., 2011; Serbin & Or, 2003). The main challenge for off-ground GPR
    is its sensitivity to surface roughness (Lambot et al., 2006; Van der Kruk et
    al., 2010) and the shallow measurement depth of the signal as compared to on-ground
    GPR techniques (Vereecken et al., 2014). However, the effect of surface roughness
    may be alleviated by operating at low frequencies (0.2–0.8 GHz; Jonard et al.,
    2011). The off-ground GPR may be used for validation of microwave RS SM products
    (Koyama et al., 2017). On-ground GPR systems represent a perfect alternative for
    mapping of profile SM because of their ability to measure direct ground wave propagation
    velocity (Grote et al., 2003; Huisman et al., 2002, 2001), which allows for deeper
    signal penetration when compared to the off-ground systems due to ground coupling.
    On-ground GPR measurements are performed with a fixed separation distance between
    transmitting and receiving antennas (Figure 12). The combination of GPR signals
    with other sensors/data such as EMI (Moghadas et al., 2010) and seismic (Ghose
    & Slob, 2006) has become more common for providing better estimates of SM. However,
    GPR has limitations such as poor performance in clay or electrically conductive
    soils, contact issues in dense shrubs, and soils with rock fragments (i.e., on-ground
    GPR), as well as requiring more sophisticated data interpretation (Robinson et
    al., 2012). A detailed review about the application of GPR for measuring SM is
    provided in Klotzsche et al. (2018). Figure 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Sketch illustrating the on-ground Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) basic principle
    and reflection profiling, where Tx is the transmitting and Rx is receiving antenna.
    Reflections at interfaces arise from changes in subsurface velocity (v) and dielectric
    constant (ε). 4.2 EM Induction SM determination with EMI sensors relies on the
    strong correlation between soil water content and the EMI measured apparent soil
    electrical conductivity (EC a ; Moghadas et al., 2010). Applications of EMI for
    SM variability mapping and monitoring at intermediate (hillslope to catchment)
    scales are discussed in, for example, Sheets and Hendrickx (1995), Allred et al.
    (2005), and Huth and Poulton (2007), Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell (2009),
    and Shanahan et al. (2015). EMI sensors apply current to the soil through EMI;
    hence, no direct contact with the soil surface is required (Corwin & Lesch, 2003).
    Common instruments consist of a transmitter coil that, when energized with alternating
    current (AC) at audio frequency, produces an EM field (Figure 13). The time-varying
    EM field emitted from the transmitter coil induces weak circular eddy current
    loops in the conducting soil, which in turn generate a secondary EM field that
    differs in amplitude and phase from the primary field (McNeill, 1980). The magnitude
    of amplitude and phase differences between primary and secondary fields primarily
    depends on soil properties including moisture content, type, and concentration
    of ions in the soil solution, the amount, and type of clay minerals in the soil
    matrix, the temperature, and the phase of soil water (Brevik & Fenton, 2002; Carroll
    & Oliver, 2005; Kachanoski et al., 1990; Reedy & Scanlon, 2003) as well as spacing
    between the transmitter and receiver coil, the distance between coils and soil
    surface, and coil orientation (parallel or perpendicular to the soil surface).
    The effect of magnetic permeability of the soil seems to be negligible according
    to De Jong et al. (1979). The primary and secondary fields are sensed as apparent
    conductivity at the receiver coil in Siemens per meter (S/m; McNeill, 1980). A
    detailed description of the theoretical background of EMI is provided in Tuller
    and Islam (2005). Figure 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sketch illustrating
    the propagation of electromagnetic fields in soil for an electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) sensor. EMI sensors commonly used for soil investigations include monofrequency
    (e.g., DUALEM-1, DUALEM-2, EM31, EM38, EM38-DD, EM38-MK2, and EMP-400) and multifrequency
    (e.g., GEM-300) sensors. EMI has been also thoroughly tested for estimating soil
    salinity (Williams et al., 2006), soil texture (White et al., 2012), clay content
    (Harvey & Morgan, 2009), cation exchange capacity (Triantafilis et al., 2009),
    soil compaction (Sudduth et al., 2010), soil pH (Van Meirvenne et al., 2013),
    soil organic carbon (Martinez et al., 2009), leaching rates of solutes (Slavich
    & Yang, 1990), herbicide partition coefficients (Jaynes et al., 1994), groundwater
    recharge (Williams et al., 2006), and for estimation of the leaf area index (Rudolph
    et al., 2015). An excellent review by Doolittle and Brevik (2014) details EMI
    applications for soil studies. Monofrequency instruments have been recurrently
    used to estimate SM, yielding R 2 values ranging from 0.11 to 0.99 (Robinson,
    Binley, et al., 2008; Tromp-van Meerveld & McDonnell, 2009). Recently, several
    studies have shown that multifrequency EMI sensors can be effectively used for
    measurement of SM distributions within soil profiles (Tromp-van Meerveld & McDonnell,
    2009). For example, Calamita et al. (2015) used a multifrequency sensor with eight
    frequencies between 7 and 2 KHz for the retrieval of shallow SM at four sites
    in Italy and indicated a linear relationship between SM and EC a with R 2 between
    0.46 and 0.69 and RMSE between 0.064 and 0.077 cm3/cm3. Tromp-van Meerveld and
    McDonnell (2009) tested a multifrequency sensor with four frequencies (7–14 KHz)
    to monitor SM for a 9-month period over an upland forested hillslope and found
    a better relationship between EC a and SM at depths ~>30 cm (R 2~0.84–0.87) than
    at a depth <15 cm (R 2~0.78-0.83). Combining GPR and EMI data in an integrated
    inverse modeling scheme that increases the information extracted from geophysical
    data has become more common. Moghadas et al. (2010) investigated the joint analysis
    of GPR and EMI synthetic data to reconstruct the electrical properties of a two-layer
    medium and reported that the GPR-EMI inversion approach can accurately estimate
    the soil electrical parameters when the values of conductivity and permittivity
    of the first layer are low. 4.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Nuclear magnetic resonance
    imaging (NMRI; also called magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) is another proximal
    sensing technique for noninvasive SM determination. It is based on the sensitivity
    of the MRI signal intensity (echo) to SM content. Paetzold et al. (1985) first
    applied this concept to monitor SM. Guillot et al. (1989) then recorded the first
    images of a porous medium during moisture depletion. The most fundamental MRI
    principle for SM is spin-echo imaging (Merz et al., 2016), in which an echo is
    created by a 180° radiofrequency pulse following an initial 90° radio frequency
    pulse. The echo intensity depends on the proton density, which is proportional
    to the water content of the medium and the relaxation times. Since relaxation
    times also change with water content, the echo intensity is not necessarily proportional
    to the water content (Barrie, 2000). Because echo intensity itself is also affected
    by experimental parameters like echo time and repetition time, it is preferable
    to record an entire series of echoes and extrapolate to zero to obtain a quantity
    that is proportional to the water content if the relaxation time is sufficiently
    long (Edzes et al., 1998). In most natural porous media that include high content
    of silt or clay, the relaxation time might be quite short. In this case the so-called
    single point imaging (SPI) technique, originally developed to monitor water in
    saturated rocks, may provide more reliable estimates (Balcom et al., 2003). Merz
    et al. (2014) tested three MRI methods (unilateral NMR, spin echo multiscale (SEMS),
    and SPI3D) for estimating near-surface moisture based on equation (12) (12) with
    θ α,MR = M(0,r)/M(0,r)saturated in which M(0,r) and M(0,r)saturated denote the
    signal amplitude at partial and initial saturation, respectively, θ r,MR is the
    relative magnetic resonance (MR) signal at dry (residual) soil condition. The
    assumption of this model is the linear relationship between MR signals and the
    moisture content. Figure 14 depicts high-resolution near-surface moisture profiles
    of medium sand monitored over time with the three MRI methods. Figure 14 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Temporal near-surface soil moisture profile evolution
    measured by Spin Echo Multi Slice (SEMS), Single Point Imaging 3D (SPI3D), and
    unilateral Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques.
    The crosses at the abscissa represent the gravimetric water content (Merz et al.,
    2014). 4.4 ELBARA/JULBARA and ComRAD Ground-Based Radiometer and Radar Systems
    The Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich L-Band Radiometer (ELBARA)
    is a passive system operating at a frequency of 1.4–1.427 GHz. It was constructed
    by the University of Bern in collaboration with ETH to infer SHPs from the SM
    dynamics of top soil. The radiometer consists of a dual-mode conical horn antenna
    mounted on a back of a truck (mobile) or a tower (fixed) with 4–17 m elevation
    at zenith angle between 30 and 330°. It measures the brightness temperature at
    the soil surface for SM retrieval. The radiometer is equipped with internal cold
    (273°K) and hot (338°K) loads for measurement calibration (Jonard et al., 2011).
    The ELBARA II system has been designed by ESA as part of SMOS, and it is used
    for ground-based campaigns in Europe for calibration of SMOS and SMAP SM algorithms
    and for validation of SM retrievals (Miernecki et al., 2014; Schwank et al., 2010;
    Wigneron et al., 2012). Miernecki et al. (2014) used ELBARA II SM estimates for
    evaluation of SMAP and SMOS SM retrieval algorithms and demonstrated that SMAP
    single channel (Single Channel Algorithm [SCA]-H and SCA-V) and dual channel (DCA)
    algorithms and the SMOS land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) provide results
    very close (RMSEs 0.035–0.056 cm3/cm3) to those obtained from L-band Microwave
    Emission of the Biosphere (L-MEB) model-based multi-angular ELBARA II measurements.
    The JULBARA system at the Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany is a Dick-type L-band
    (1.414 GHz) radiometer that has been used for SM retrieval at the field scale
    with RMSEs of 0.062 (horizontal polarization) and 0.054 cm3/cm3 (vertical polarization)
    (Jonard et al., 2011). The Combined Radar and Radiometer (ComRAD) ground-based
    L-band simulator (O''Neill et al., 2007) developed jointly by NASA/GSFC and George
    Washington University has been used to refine SMAP SM retrieval algorithms under
    controlled conditions (Srivastava et al., 2015) and to develop new radiative transfer
    based SM retrieval models for vegetated terrain and small tree canopies (Kurum
    et al., 2011). It consists of a quad-polarized radar (1.25 GHz) and a dual-polarized
    radiometer (1.4 GHz) sharing the same 1.22-m parabolic dish antenna with 12° field
    of view and mounted on a 19-m hydraulic boom truck for field deployment. Before
    field measurements, the radiometer is calibrated with cold sky and ambient microwave
    absorber targets. In a study by Srivastava, et al. (2015), ComRAD data were used
    for evaluation of the SCA-H algorithm integrated with Mironov/Dobson dielectric
    mixing models for SM retrieval at a USDA field site covered with corn and soybeans.
    Results indicated that SCA-H is promising for L-band SM retrieval with a RMSE
    of 0.04 cm3/cm3. 5 RS Methods for SM Retrieval RS approaches for SM estimation
    have been applied since the 1970s. These promising methods produce spatially explicit
    measurements of SM. This section provides an overview of progress and constraints
    of optical, thermal, and microwave RS techniques for skin and near-surface SM
    measurements and monitoring. A brief overview of these RS techniques for SM retrieval
    and associated pros and cons is provided in Table 3. Table 3. Overview of Remote

    infrared. 5.1 Optical RS In optical RS, the Vis, NIR, and SWIR EM radiation bands
    with wavelengths ranging from 350 to 2,500 nm are used to provide SM estimates
    from spectral surface reflectance information. Optical RS systems are classified
    into multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems, depending on the number
    of spectral bands used in the imaging process. In this section, we discuss optical
    imagery and reflectance spectroscopy techniques that are deployed for SM retrieval
    at large and small (laboratory) scales. 5.1.1 Optical Imagery Optical RS methods
    have been proposed to quantify skin SM from broadband and narrowband optical satellite
    and airborne remote sensors such as Landsat (Profeti & Macintosh, 1997; Vincente-Serrano
    et al., 2004), MODIS (Zhang & Wegehenkel, 2006), Hyperion (Song, Ma, et al., 2014),
    HyMap (Haubrock et al., 2008) and simulated satellite bands (Castaldi et al.,
    2015; Muller & Decamps, 2000). Despite the numerous optical remote sensors currently
    in orbit, a limited body of literature exists on the exploitation of optical observations
    for skin SM estimation. This seems to be partly due to the inability of optical
    signals to penetrate clouds and vegetation covers (Zhao & Li, 2013) and the lack
    of an agreed physically based model for accurate estimation of SM from optical
    data (Sadeghi et al., 2017). In addition, some optical and hyperspectral data
    from satellite sensors exhibit low temporal resolution, which limits their applicability
    for monitoring state variables such as SM. Because of the wider spectral resolution
    of satellite/airborne sensors when compared to laboratory instruments that operate
    within the 1- to 8-nm spectral range and natural heterogeneities at larger scales,
    it is challenging to directly apply laboratory-developed SM retrieval methods
    to RS measurements. Besides SM, other soil properties (e.g., organic matter, color,
    salinity, texture, vegetation, roughness, and crust) affect surface reflectance;
    hence, RS spectral measurements are highly variable in space (Ben-Dor et al.,
    2002). This affects the accuracy of large-scale applications. Despite these limitations
    there is significant interest in SM estimation from optical RS data, because the
    high spatial resolution SM products are useful for agricultural applications.
    Recently, Hassan-Esfahani et al. (2015) developed a neural network method that
    translates high spatial resolution unmanned aireal system (i.e., AggieAir) imagery
    to reasonably accurate SM estimates (RMSE less than 0.03 cm3/cm3) for a large
    center pivot irrigated field in Scipio, Utah. Although the application of hyperspectral
    imaging has generally provided promising results for surface SM (Anne et al.,
    2014; Peng et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011), the usefulness of this technique
    needs to be further explored in future research. Hyperspectral sensors with finer
    spatial resolution and narrow spectral bands may offer an alternative to traditional
    multispectral analysis of SM, in particular for landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity.
    New missions such as Hyperspectral Precursor and Application Mission (Galeazzi
    et al., 2008), the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program, that will be launched
    in 2020 (Stuffler et al., 2006), or the HYPerspectral IMager, scheduled to launch
    prior to 2020 (Michel et al., 2010), are able to fully cover the solar domain
    (400 to 2,500 nm) with high spectral resolution (average of 10 nm) and offer new
    opportunities for estimating surface moisture from hyperspectral imagery. 5.1.2
    Reflectance Spectroscopy Reflectance spectroscopy (diffuse optical spectroscopy)
    has been applied as a powerful means for large-scale SM estimation or for skin
    SM measurements at smaller scales. This spectroscopic technique exploits the fact
    that the EM spectrum exhibits several distinct water absorption bands within the
    NIR (~1,414 nm) and SWIR (~1,915 and 2,210 nm) frequency ranges (Clark, 1999;
    Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006). Reflectance spectroscopy can be also classified
    as a proximal sensing techniques. Diffuse reflectance relies on a focused projection
    of the spectrometer beam onto a sample of interest, where it is reflected, scattered,
    and transmitted through the sample material. Spectrometers that operate within
    the Vis, NIR, and SWIR (400–2,500 nm) range are applied for both laboratory and
    field measurements. The relationship between skin SM and spectral reflectance
    has been extensively studied and is well documented in literature (Ben-Dor & Banin,
    1995; Bogrekci, & Lee, W. S., 2006; Chang et al., 2001; Hummel et al., 2001).
    Numerous studies have been conducted, mainly at the laboratory scale, to explore
    the relationships between spectral reflectance and skin SM for a wide range of
    soil types (Gao et al., 2013; Lobell & Asner, 2002; Philpot, 2010; Tian & Philpot,
    2015). Findings from these studies indicate that reflectance decreases relative
    to an increase of SM with the effect being more pronounced in the SWIR range (Angstrom,
    1925; Liu et al., 2002; Sadeghi et al., 2015; Weidong et al., 2002). Exceptions
    to this trend have been observed, particularly when approaching saturation (Liu
    et al., 2002; Neema et al., 1987) and when models that consider Fresnel reflectance
    were applied (Sadeghi et al., 2015). In general, empirical and physical approaches
    can be discerned for estimating SM from spectral reflectance data. Most studies
    that capitalized on the full hyperspectral signature of soils have focused on
    empirical regression models such as partial least squares regression (Bogrekci,
    & Lee, W. S., 2006; Castaldi et al., 2015), principal component regression (Chang
    et al., 2001), and multiple linear regression (Ben-Dor & Banin, 1995; Liu et al.,
    2002; Lobell & Asner, 2002) to estimate SM. Hyperspectral signatures measured
    in the laboratory are very repetitive and highly oversampled with a high degree
    of intercorrelation between neighboring bands. For such cases, band aggregation
    can be applied as a simple method to reduce and downsample spectral data, which
    in turn is helpful to obtain accurate calibrations (Lopez et al., 2013). Several
    empirical indices have been defined to estimate skin SM from measured surface
    reflectance. The most reliable results have been obtained with the Water Index
    SOIL (Bryant et al., 2003), the Normalized SM Index (Haubrock et al., 2008), and
    the Shortwave Angle Slope Index (Khanna et al., 2007). The main drawback of such
    indices is the use of bands located within the water absorption features, making
    them very sensitive to effects of atmospheric water vapor. Although empirical
    methods seem to work reasonably well for the distinct conditions they were developed
    for, they cannot be universally applied as spatially significantly varying soil
    composition (i.e., SM, organic matter content, minerals, and salts) strongly affects
    spectral reflectance (Huan-Jun et al., 2009). Physical approaches for SM estimation
    from optical reflectance are mainly based on radiative transfer theory (Philpot,
    2010; Twomey et al., 1986). Sadeghi et al. (2015) proposed a promising physically
    based method to determine skin SM from transformed reflectance of bare and sparsely
    vegetated soils based on the Kubelka-Munk (Kubelka & Munk, 1931) two-flux radiative
    transfer theory, which describes diffuse reflectance from a uniform, optically
    thick, absorbing, and scattering medium. This approach yielded reasonable results
    with a RMSE of less than 0.07 cm3/cm3 when compared to directly laboratory-measured
    water contents for various soils (Figure 15). The potential applicability for
    large-scale skin SM measurements and associated challenges is yet to be assessed.
    While diffuse spectroscopy has been proven to yield good skin SM results, a few
    studies also documented its potential for accurate predictions of more complex
    properties such as water retention and hydraulic properties (Babaeian et al.,
    2015; Santra et al., 2009). Figure 15 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison
    of the Sadeghi et al. (2015) model estimates with directly measured skin soil
    moisture for single samples representing four different soil orders (left) and
    multiple samples of two different watersheds (right). RMSE = root-mean-square
    error. It is apparent that while the application of diffuse spectroscopy under
    laboratory conditions in most cases provides reasonable results, field measurements
    exhibit higher uncertainty due to natural heterogeneity of soil properties, topography,
    and vegetation effects. This points to the need for further investigations of
    spatial heterogeneity effects on the relationships between reflectance and skin
    SM. A more detailed analysis of reflectance spectra and comparison to laboratory
    spectral resolutions are required to overcome this limitation (Haubrock, Chabrillat,
    Lemmnitz, & Kaufmann, 2008). 5.2 Thermal Infrared RS Thermal infrared RS exploits
    the EM wave band between 3,500 and 14,000 nm for SM retrieval from land surface
    temperature (LST) determined with the thermal inertia method (Jackson, 1982; Price,
    1980; Schieldge et al., 1982; Verstraeten et al., 2006) or in conjunction with
    vegetation indices (VI; Claps & Laguardia, 2004). Over the past three decades,
    the LST-VI concept has been widely applied for the estimation of SM (Gillies et
    al., 1997; Mallick et al., 2009) and evapotranspiration (Heilman et al., 1976;
    Stisen et al., 2008). Several studies have documented the LST-VI/fractional vegetation
    cover (FVC) relationship within a triangular (Carlson, 2007) or trapezoidal space
    (Moran et al., 1994). The FVC ranges between 0 for bare soil and 1 for full vegetation
    cover. The so-called “universal triangle” concept was first proposed by Price
    (1990) for prediction of evapotranspiration and later adapted for surface SM retrieval
    (Carlson et al., 1994; Gillies et al., 1997). A central assumption of the triangle
    method is that when a large number of pixels capturing the full range of soil
    surface moisture and FVC are considered, sharp boundaries in the LST-VI scatter
    plot reflect real physical limits that include bare soil, full-cover vegetation,
    and lower and upper limits for surface SM (e.g., completely dry points A and C
    and saturated points B and C in Figure 16a). The dry and wet edges intersect at
    point C for full vegetation cover. The relative value of surface SM and the surface
    energy fluxes for each pixel can be defined in terms of its position within the
    triangle (Wang et al., 2011). A detailed description of the universal triangle
    method is provided in Carlson (2007). While an advantage of the triangle method
    is its independence of ancillary data (atmospheric and surface data), it is challenging
    to define the triangular space for locations with narrow VI range or for regions
    with rainy/dry seasons, which results in narrow scattering of the LST-VI points.
    The establishment of the LST-VI relationship is more complicated for large scales
    due to the spatial heterogeneity of surface properties that may affect the shape
    of LST-VI space and thereby interfere with the precise determination of the dry
    and wet edges (Wang et al., 2011). Figure 16 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Triangular LST-FVC space (a), conventional trapezoidal LST-FVC space (b), and
    two-stage trapezoidal LST-FVC space (c) reproduced from Sun (2016). LST = land
    surface temperature; FVC = fractional vegetation cover. Numerous studies have
    been devoted to estimation of surface SM from the LST-VI space. For example, Sandholt
    et al. (2002) proposed a dryness index for estimation of SM via linking the surface
    temperature Ts-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) scatter plot with
    a temperature-vegetation dryness index and found similar spatial patterns (R 2
    = 0.70) between TDVI and SM simulated with a hydrological model. Wang et al. (2001)
    proposed a Vegetation Temperature Condition Index for monitoring drought occurrence
    and its spatial distribution at the regional scale in China. Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran
    et al. (2013) developed a new method to estimate SM from the surface evaporative
    fraction retrieved from the LST-FVC space. Some studies used multiple regression
    analysis for estimation of SM. For example, Sobrino et al. (2012) applied high-resolution
    thermal images acquired with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner to estimate SM
    at field scale from emissivity, NDVI, and LST data and obtained a RMSE value of
    0.05 cm3/cm3. Based on the triangular LST-FVC feature space method, Zhang et al.
    (2015) proposed a simple method to estimate SM for the North China Plain with
    a second-order polynomial interpolation function. This method requires a number
    of atmospheric input parameters to establish the edges of the triangular LST-FVC
    space from energy balance considerations, which allows comparison of the directly
    derived SM for a wide range of atmospheric forcing conditions. Validation experiments
    with ground data for 10- and 20-cm depths yielded RMSEs from 0.04 and 0.10 m3/m3,
    respectively. The universal triangle method has been previously employed to predict
    SM at the regional/global scales from low spatial resolution but high revisit
    frequency satellite imagery such as provided by MODIS and Advanced Very High Resolution
    Radiometer for a wide range of land surface covers (Sandholt et al., 2002; Wan
    et al., 2004). NASA''s Landsat-8 satellite that was launched in February 2013
    provides thermal data (bands 10 and 11) at a moderate resolution of 100 m that
    has been applied for thermal SM RS (Amani et al., 2016; Shafian & Maas, 2015).
    The trapezoid method first proposed by Moran et al. (1994) describes the relationship
    between the surface soil and air temperature difference (Ts-Ta) and the FVC. This
    method has been applied to estimate evapotranspiration rates for both fully covered
    and partially vegetated land surfaces via the Water Deficit Index (WDI). While
    the universal triangle method establishes the dry and wet edges empirically, the
    trapezoid method is based on physical processes (Yang et al., 2015); hence, derived
    WDI values are comparable for different times. In addition, the trapezoid method
    is applicable for finer scales and regions with a narrow SM and vegetation cover
    range (Wang et al., 2011). Although the idea of a trapezoidal (Ts-Ta)-FVC space
    is widely accepted, only a few applications for SM estimation are documented in
    literature. This is partly due to challenges associated with the calculation of
    the soil surface and air temperature difference (Ts-Ta) and partly due to the
    lack of atmospheric data (i.e., air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity).
    These limitations motivated Wang et al. (2011) to apply the Ts-VI space. They
    proposed an iterative procedure for quantifying the Ts-VI trapezoid and calculated
    the WDI from MODIS surface temperature and an Enhanced Vegetation Index. SM validation
    experiments in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona revealed that
    while temporal variations of SM can be captured reasonably well, the quantification
    of spatial variations is limited, at least for semiarid climatic conditions. This
    might be due to the often erroneous assumption of a linear relationship between
    SM and soil temperature. Although this assumption yielded reasonable SM estimates
    in the past, it is not supported by laboratory and field measurements. A simple
    evaporation experiment conducted in our laboratories revealed a nonlinear (L-shaped)
    relationship between soil surface temperature and surface SM that is also confirmed
    by field observations at a SCAN site within the Little River Watershed in Georgia
    (Figure 17). These observations point to the need to quantify and apply the actual
    soil temperature-SM relationship that is mainly influenced by atmospheric forcing
    (i.e., air temperature, humidity, and wind) to improve SM predictions. Figure

    measured surface/skin SM (soil moisture) and average (0–5 cm) SM (blue circles)
    and surface temperature (red circles) during evaporative drying of a sand column
    (left). Field-measured SM and temperature at different depths at a Soil Climate
    Analysis Network site in 2013 within the Little River Watershed in Georgia (right).
    Recent attempts to modify the trapezoid method have mainly focused on a more accurate
    definition of space edges based on the actual response of soil and vegetation
    to SM dynamics. For example, a two-stage trapezoid method (i.e., two merged triangular
    spaces) proposed by Sun (2016) proved to be more efficient than the conventional
    trapezoid method as it resolves some of the challenges discussed above (Figures
    16b and 16c). The central assumption of the two-stage trapezoid is that Ts is
    governed by surface SM within the LST-FVC space, while vegetation temperature
    (Tv) is governed by RZSM (Carlson, 2013). In fact, when moisture within a vegetated
    soil profile varies from its wettest to its driest value, the surface moisture
    approaches its lowest value before the RZSM does. This indicates a difference
    in variation rates for Tv and Ts, where Tv is lagging Ts because vegetation absorbs
    RZSM for photosynthesis and transpiration. Sun (2016) simulated the LST-FVC space
    with the “SimSphere” model and demonstrated that the new trapezoid is more consistent
    with the simulated LST-FVC space and can evolve the LST-FVC space from the triangular
    to the trapezoidal form (Figure 16c). Additionally, they compared both the two-stage
    trapezoid and the conventional trapezoid to estimate the evaporative fraction
    based on 110 MODIS LST and VI products. Comparisons have indicated that the two-stage
    trapezoid is more effective than the classical trapezoid for evaporative fraction
    estimation. The uncertainty analysis has also revealed that this method is better
    suited for areas and periods exhibiting low SM levels. Recently, Sadeghi, Babaeian,
    et al. (2017) and Babaeian et al. (2018) proposed a novel optical trapezoid model
    named OPTRAM as an alternative to the conventional triangle/trapezoid methods
    for estimating SM from transformed reflectance (SWIR transformed reflectance,
    STR) data of Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS in the SWIR band. The trapezoid
    is formed by distribution of NDVI as a measure of vegetation fraction versus STR
    as a measure of SM (Figure 18, left). The latter is based on a simple two-flux
    radiative transfer model indicating a linear relationship between surface SM and
    STR within SWIR bands, which proved to be valid for a broad range of soils (Sadeghi
    et al., 2015; Sadeghi et al., 2018). (13) Figure 18 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Sketch illustrating OPTRAM trapezoid (left), and the evaluation results of the
    optical trapezoid using Sentinel-2 data in the Little Washita watershed in Oklahoma
    (right) (Sadeghi, Babaeian, et al., 2017). STR = SWIR transformed reflectance;
    NDVI = Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; MAE = mean absolute error; RMSE
    = root-mean-square error LW = Little Washita watershed. where θ s is the saturated
    water content, r is transformed reflectance, and r s and r d are the transformed
    reflectance of saturated and dry soils, respectively. This novel approach was
    evaluated based on in situ measurements of SM in different watersheds in the United
    States and showed reasonably good performance for SM retrieval (see Figure 18,
    right). The OPTRAM model has also performed equally well or, in some cases, better
    than the traditional trapezoid models. The main advantage of OPTRAM is its applicability
    to new higher spatial resolution optical satellites with no thermal band (e.g.,
    Sentinel-2). 5.3 Microwave RS As with EM in situ SM sensors, the vast disparity
    in dielectric permittivity of water, air, and solids is also exploited for microwave
    RS (Ulaby et al., 1982). The dielectric properties of the soil phases (i.e., water,
    air, and solids) affect the emissivity and backscattering of microwaves at the
    soil surface. SM is routinely retrieved from low-frequency microwave data, including
    the P-band, L-band, C-band, and X-band. Several dielectric mixing and empirical
    models have been proposed to infer bulk soil permittivity that can be related
    to SM content (Dobson et al., 1985; Mironov et al., 2009; Roth et al., 1990; Topp
    et al., 1980; Wang and Schmugge, 1980). Passive and active microwave RS of SM
    are currently the most promising techniques for global-scale monitoring. Microwave-based
    SM products are the only ones routinely supplied various satellite missions. In
    terms of continues availability of large-scale data products, microwave-based
    techniques are substantially more advanced than optical- and thermal infrared-based
    SM products. For example, some agencies (e.g., EUMSETAT and JAXA) have made operational
    commitments to their microwave SM products (i.e., ASCAT and AMSR-2) by launching
    a new mission to ensure product continuity in the event of a satellite/sensor
    failure. 5.3.1 Passive Microwave RS Passive microwave sensors (radiometers) record
    the natural microwave emission (brightness temperature, T b ) that is dependent
    on emissivity and physical temperature of the emitting body. For passive SM retrieval,
    knowledge of the physical temperature of the land surface is required. The Fresnel
    reflection equations describe the emissivity of a smooth bare soil surface based
    on the incidence angle of the sensor and the complex dielectric constant of the
    soil. Typically, soils have a rough surface, which decreases reflectivity and
    thus increases emissivity. Vegetation cover also alters microwave emissions and
    adds a separate contribution to the land surface emission signal. To simulate
    these effects, Mo et al. (1982) developed the τ-ω model that requires the optical
    depth (τ) and the single-scattering albedo of the vegetation (ω) as input parameters.
    The τ-ω model is the basis for virtually all passive microwave SM retrieval models
    that include the SCA, the L-MEB Model, the Community Microwave Emission Model,
    and the LPRM as presented in Mladenova et al. (2014), Wigneron et al. (2007),
    and Drusch et al. (2009). Where vegetation opacity governs the attenuation effects,
    the single scattering albedo describes the scattering effects within the canopy
    (Brunfeldt & Ulaby, 1984). Because the optical depth is typically not directly
    available, it can be derived from vegetation water content (VWC; Njoku & Entekhabi,
    1996) or vegetation indices (Hasan et al., 2014). A more detailed discription
    of current passive microwave instruments is presented in section 28. 5.3.2 Active
    Microwave RS While radiometers capture weak natural microwave emissions from the
    land surface, radars actively transmit a microwave signal and record the normalized
    backscattered fraction, which after SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) proccessing
    provides higher spatial resolutions than obtained with passive systems. The microwave
    energy backscattered from land surfaces is determined by soil properties as well
    as vegetation cover. As the roughness of the surface increases, the specular reflection
    decreases and surface scattering increases, which in turn increases the backscatter
    returned to the sensor (Ulaby et al., 1982). Because of these interactions, SM
    retrieval is highly dependant on accurate characterization of soil surface roughness
    (Verhoest et al., 2008). The effect of soil surface roughness on SM estimates
    can be removed by means of multiincidence angle or multipolarimetric observations,
    which eliminates the need for independent roughness measurements (Jagdhuber et
    al., 2013; Kweon & Oh, 2014; Oh, 2006; Rahman et al., 2008; Srivastava et al.,
    2003). Existing SM retrieval methods from active microwave measurements can be
    classified as empirical (Le Hégarat-Mascle et al., 2002), semiempirical (Oh et
    al., 2002), or physically based (Elfouhaily & Guérin, 2004). In the presence of
    vegetation cover, the scattering process is more complex as it is affected by
    plant geometry and plant moisture content. The plant contribution to backscattering
    depends on the specific vegetation structure that is determined by occurrence,
    orientation, water content, and optical depth of stalks, branches, and trunks.
    Vegetation effects are commonly taken into consideration by means of multiangular
    observations (Gherboudj et al., 2011; Grant et al., 2010; Magagi and Kerr, 1997),
    multilayer canopy representation (Toure et al., 1994), or polarimetric decomposition
    of vegetation and soil contributions (Jagdhuber et al., 2013, 2015). More details
    regarding radar microwave instruments are given in section 28. 5.3.3 Downscaling
    Coarse (Passive) Microwave RS Data Because of its coarse spatial resolution, passive
    microwave-based SM is not suitable for small-scale (e.g., field scale and catchment
    scale) applications, where SM commonly exhibits significant horizontal spatial
    variability. Recently, some progress has been made toward improvement of spatial
    SM representation via downscaling of radiometer data. The general idea behind
    combining active and passive microwave observations for SM retrieval from SMAP
    was driven by the fact that passive (radiometer) observations are typically more
    accurate but exhibit low spatial resolution, whereas active (radar) observations
    are more susceptible to surface roughness conditions but exhibit higher spatial
    resolution (Das, Entekhabi, Dunbar et al., 2018). Combining both observations
    may provide lower accuracy but higher spatial resolution. Das, Entekhabi, Dunbar
    et al. (2018), Das, Entekhabi, Kim et al. (2018) applied the SMAP active-passive
    algorithm and combined 3-km L-band radar and 36-km radiometer observations as
    an effective approach to high spatial resolution (3 and 9 km) and accurate SM
    estimation (ubRMSE of 0.039 cm3/cm3). Several other published approaches for active/passive
    microwave data fusion include the temporal change detection method (Piles et al.,
    2009, 2014), a Bayesian merging approach (Zhan et al., 2006), and the fusion of
    two single-source SM products from radar and radiometer (Montzka et al., 2016).
    Akbar and Moghaddam (2015) developed a combined active-passive SM retrieval algorithm,
    which is based on Monte Carlo simulations and optimization. Their approach yields
    reasonable results for a wide range of SM (0.04 to 0.40 cm3/cm3) and vegetation
    (VWC, between 0 and 5 kg/m2) conditions. They concluded that the application of
    the combined active-passive algorithm for corn surface cover (with VWC 5 kg/m2)
    reduced the SM retrieval error from 0.050 cm3/cm3 (active only) and 0.045 cm3/cm3
    (passive only) to 0.035 cm3/cm3. The performance of active-passive microwave observations
    and various retrieval and fusion methods have been evaluated for several regions
    of the World; for example, North America (Bindlish et al., 2009; Colliander et
    al., 2012; Magagi et al., 2013; Narayan et al., 2006; Njoku et al., 2002), Australia
    (Panciera et al., 2014), and Europe (Montzka et al., 2016). The combined application
    of active and passive microwave observations is exploited not only to improve
    the spatial resolution but also to improve the parameterization of retrieval models.
    The combined application dates back to Ulaby et al. (1983). Recently, Rötzer et
    al. (2017) estimated the relationship between radar backscatter and vegetation
    opacity for radiometer brightness temperature inversion for SM estimation from
    Aquarius data. Dente et al. (2014) applied a discrete scattering model to forward
    simulate both emission and backscatter and used C-band AMSR-E and ASCAT observations
    for calibration. The application of active and passive microwave observations
    in conjunction with optical NDVI data in an artificial neural network simulation
    scheme improved SM retrieval accuracy (Santi et al., 2016). The potential of SMAP
    combined L-band radar-radiometer for high spatial resolution (3 and 9 km) and
    accurate global SM has been demonstrated in Das et al. (2018a). Additional downscaling
    methods are based on optical/thermal high-resolution remote sensors, mainly relying
    on MODIS LST/NDVI products (Merlin et al., 2012, 2013; Piles et al., 2011, 2014;
    Srivastava et al., 2013), cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching (Kornelsen
    & Coulibaly, 2014), and MODIS soil evaporative efficiency (Djamai et al., 2015;
    Merlin et al., 2008) and provide SM estimates at finer resolutions ranging from
    100-m to 1-km pixel size. In the course of the Southern Great Plains (SGP-97)
    experiment, Chauhan et al. (2003) inverted the brightness temperature from the
    Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) to SM and then linked the SSM/I-derived
    low-resolution SM to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-derived parameters
    NDVI, surface albedo, and LST, to obtain higher resolution SM estimates. Similarly,
    Merlin et al. (2013) downscaled ~40-km SMOS SM data with 1-km soil evaporative
    efficiency data from MODIS. Fang et al. (2018) improved a passive microwave SM
    downscaling algorithm based on thermal inertia for the use with SMAP. Pellenq
    et al. (2003) coupled a radiative transfer model with a hydrological model to
    consider topography and soil texture patterns for SM downscaling. Montzka et al.
    (2018) used soil textural information to estimate the subgrid SM heterogeneity
    to account for during downscaling. A good review of the existing methods for spatial
    downscaling of coarse-scale SM products is provided by Peng et al. (2016). 6 Data
    Resources This section provides an overview of ground and RS data resources available
    for long-term monitoring of SM. First, an overview of SM monitoring networks used
    for RS measurement validation is provided. Then newly developed active and passive
    microwave satellite instruments and microwave airborne remote sensors for near-surface
    and root-zone SM retrieval are described. 6.1 SM Monitoring Networks Due to the
    importance of measurements in identifying SM patterns and key hydrological processes,
    field to catchment-scale SM data have been integrated in global or continental
    networks. These data have found use both for evaluating models and for validating
    remotely sensed SM estimates. The International SM Network, ISMN, (Dorigo et al.,
    2011) combines and hosts in situ SM data from various networks including the U.S.
    Climate Reference Network, USCRN (Coopersmith et al., 2015) and the SCAN (Schaefer
    et al., 2007) for vadose zone research applications (Wang & Franz, 2015). Robock
    et al. (2000) were the first to initiate a global SM data bank including about
    600 stations in five regions. The ISMN has been initiated in 2009 by ESA for the
    SMOS project and made possible through the voluntary contributions of scientists
    and networks from around the World. The ISMN is hosted by the Vienna University
    of Technology and provides free access to the data set at http://ismn. geo. tuwien.
    ac. at/networks. The ISMN currently contains SM data contributions from more than
    35 networks and about 2,000 stations located in North America, Asia, Europe, and
    Australia. While the database contains measurements from as early as 1964, most
    data sets were initiated during the last decade (see Table 4). A long-time data
    set of gravimetrically measured SM has been previously presented by Robock et
    al. (2005), who compiled 45 years (1958–2002) of SM data for the top 1-cm soil
    layer from over 141 stations in croplands in the Ukraine with 10-day temporal
    resolution. However, this data set does not represent all the biomes to the same
    extent, which may provide uncertainties for validation of SM estimates. The latest
    SM networks in the United States are the COSMOS and GNSS networks, which are described
    in Sections 5 and 8. These data have been used for validation of remotely sensed
    SM products such as SMAP (Akbar & Moghaddam, 2015; Colliander et al., 2017; Montzka,
    Bogena, et al., 2017), SMOS (Montzka, Bogena, et al., 2017; Van der Schalie et
    al., 2016), ASCAT (Fascetti et al., 2016), and AMSR-2 (Wu et al., 2016). The USCRN
    data have been used to validate AMSR-E SM data products (Coopersmith et al., 2015).
    The ISMN data have been widely used to validate the ESA CCI SM product (Al-Yaari
    et al., 2016; Chakravorty et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2018; Dorigo et al., 2015;
    Karthikeyan et al., 2017). For further information, interested readers are referred

    of climate model simulations and identifying trends in the hydrological cycle
    due to the impact of regional climate change and land use. Some of the stations
    (e.g., OK Mesonet and ARM SGP Sites) only monitor soil matric potential with matric
    potential sensors. These matric potentials can be converted to SM estimates via
    site- and depth-specific soil water retention curves (see section 2). Apart from
    SM measurements, important atmospheric variables such as precipitation, air temperature,
    soil temperature, humidity, pressure, and solar radiation are also monitored in
    some U.S. networks that include SCAN, CRN, and SNOTEL. These auxiliary data assist
    users with correct interpretations of SM observations. Table 4 provides a detailed
    overview of the most important ISMNs that are currently measuring SM on an operational
    basis within and outside the United States. It should be noted that this overview
    of networks presents a current snapshot with the ISMN continuously expanding.
    Not only in the United States but also in Europe and Asia several large-scale
    SM monitoring networks have been established for research purposes, validation
    of RS SM products, and as support for natural hazard forecasting. It is widely
    acknowledged that significant additional efforts are needed to enhance measurement
    consistency and standardization, data, and metadata. Furthermore, to reach the
    goal of a fully integrated global SM observation system, it will be important
    to establish, expand, and improve current SM observations, both in situ and remotely
    sensed. 6.2 Microwave Satellite SM Data Resources Microwave RS has been applied
    for SM retrieval since 1978 (Chen et al., 2012). Recent and currently operating
    spaceborne sensors that provide SM information include (1) the Advanced Microwave
    Scanning Radiometer on NASA Earth Observing System Aqua and the GCOM-W1 (AMSR-E
    and AMSR-2; Jackson et al., 2012; Kachi et al., 2014), (2) the ASCAT on EUMETSAT
    MetOp-A and MetOp-B (Wagner et al., 2013), (3) NASA''s WindSat Spaceborne Polarimetric
    Microwave Radiometer on the Naval Research Laboratory''s Coriolis satellite (Gaiser
    et al., 2004), (4) the European SMOS (Kerr et al., 2001); (5) NASA''s SMAP (Entekhabi
    et al., 2010), (6) the JAXA Advanced Land Observation Satellite 2, and (7) the
    ESA Sentinel-1 (Bartalis et al., 2007), which are selectively described in more
    detail below and in Table 5. The Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR)
    onboard Nimbus-7 (1978–1987) and the SSM/I satellite data have been interpreted
    in terms of SM as well (De Jeu, 2003), and though the accuracy may be lower, these
    data do cover time periods that are otherwise missing. A combination of several
    initial active and passive satellites is provided by the CCI for global SM. The
    U.S. and Indian radar mission NISAR (NASA-ISRO SAR Mission) that is currently
    in the planning stage and projected to be launched in 2021 will operate at the
    L-band and S-band. However, it is still unclear whether NISAR will generate official
    SM products. A Tandem-L mission that enables the systematic monitoring of dynamic
    processes on the Earth surface has been proposed as an innovative interferometric
    and polarimetric radar mission (Krieger et al., 2007) using a pair of cooperating
    L-band SAR satellites flying in close formation (Krieger et al., 2009). Moreover,
    a Copernicus candidate mission has been proposed incorporating optical, thermal,
    and microwave data from ESA''s Sentinels and SMOS with contribution of non-ESA
    satellites such as ASCAT, Terra-SAR, and RADARSAT-2. The current state of SM RS
    has been reviewed by Mohanty et al. (2017). Table 5. Overview of Operational Satellite

    Over grasslands and agricultural areas. The integration of multiple SM data sources
    at various spatial and temporal scales is beneficial for numerous applications.
    An excellent example is NASA''s Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active
    Archive Center (ORNL DAAC), which provides scientific and other user access to
    SM data for North America from airborne (Airborne Microwave Observatory of Sub-canopy
    and Subsurface [AirMOSS]), satellite (SMAP, GRACE) and ground network sources
    (SCAN, USCRN, COSMOS, SNOTEL, Soil Moisture Sensing Controller and oPtimal Estimator,
    and FLUXNET) through a single platform called SM Visualizer (http://daac. ornl.
    gov). The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) also manages and distributes
    such data for users (https://nsidc. org/data). 6.2.1 The Advanced Microwave Scanning
    Radiometer (AMSR-E/AMSR-2) The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the
    Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) is a passive multiband sensor onboard of NASA''s
    Earth Observing System Aqua satellite (Figure 19a) that measures geophysical variables
    related to the Earth''s water cycle such as precipitation rate, water vapor, cloud
    water, sea surface wind/temperature, sea ice concentration, SWE, and SM content.
    AMSR-E uses the X-band and C-band for SM retrievals. Because of radio frequency
    interference (RFI) in the C-band (6.9 and 10.7 GHz), especially over the U.S.,
    Middle East, Japan, Italy, and the U.K. (Njoku et al., 2005), the X-band has been
    extensively used for SM retrieval. The AMSR-E spatial resolution has improved
    (50 km) when compared to previous missions (e.g., SMMR with 150 km), while sustaining
    all channels of the previous sensors (i.e., SMMR, SMM/I, and TMI). Providing ~10-year
    data across several channels, AMSR-E generates new opportunities and very useful
    insights toward the development of SM retrieval algorithms (e.g., development
    of SMAP and SMOS algorithms) and long-term monitoring of soil, water, and climate
    interactions. Several retrieval algorithms have been developed to estimate global
    SM from AMSR-E data (Du et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2010; Njoku et al., 2003;
    Owe et al., 2001). The LPRM developed by VU University Amsterdam in collaboration
    with NASA (Owe et al., 2008) is one of the more widely applied algorithms for
    simultaneous SM, vegetation optical depth, and surface temperature retrieval (Cho
    et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2015; Meesterns et al., 2005). Figure 19 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Renderings of the (a) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer
    for the Earth Observing System, (b) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2),
    (c) Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), (d) Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), (e)
    Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and (f) Sentinel-1 satellites. As a follow-on
    to AMSR-E, the AMSR-2 (Figure 19b) sensor onboard of Japan''s Aerospace Exploration
    Agency (JAXA) GCOM-W satellite started measuring and releasing brightness temperature
    (passive) data in multiple frequencies (bands) in January 2012 with a revisit
    time of 1–2 days and crossing nodes at 1:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. local solar time
    for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. The lower frequencies (6.9
    GHz, C-band) provide more accurate SM retrievals for the top ~1–2 cm soil layer
    (Molero et al., 2017). The underlying concept of AMSR-2 is identical to that of
    AMSR-E (Kachi et al., 2014). Major improvements of AMSR-2 include (1) a larger
    reflector system of 2.0-m diameter to provide better spatial resolution, (2) the
    inclusion of an additional 7.3-GHz dual polarization frequency channel for improvement
    of RFI mitigation, (3) 12-bit quantization for all channels, and (4) an improved
    calibration system (Imaoka et al., 2010). Table 5 provides operational details
    of the AMSR-E and AMSR-2 sensors. AMSR-2 includes several SM products. The LPRM
    SM product for descending overpass has provided more accurate results than that
    of ascending orbit (Molero et al., 2017) probably due to the more uniform surface
    temperature and SM. 6.2.2 The ASCAT The Active Microwave Instrument Wind Scatterometer
    onboard of the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite is a C-band (5.3 GHz) sensor
    initially intended for wind monitoring but also widely utilized as the first active
    sensor for retrieving SM. The ERS-1 SCAT has been monitoring the Earth between
    1991 and 2000. The second instrument (ERS-2 SCAT) was launched in 1995 and ceased
    operation in 2011. The ERS-1/2 SCAT had a spatial resolution of 50 km and a revisit
    time of 2–7 days. ERS-1/2 SCAT provides a valuable long-term SM data set for climate
    change applications that is used to create the ESA CCI active SM products. As
    a successor of ERS-1/2 SCAT, the ASCAT is a C-band scatterometer with no SAR-based
    resolution enhancement deployed on satellite platforms of the European Organization
    for the EUMETSAT (Figure 19c). The EUMETSAT MetOp-A satellite was launched in
    October 2006, and MetOp-B was launched in September 2012. The MetOp-C platform
    was launched in November 2018. The instrument was initially designed for monitoring
    wind speed and direction over the oceans, but ASCAT has also been widely used
    for monitoring SM (Albergel et al., 2009; Draper et al., 2011; Matgen et al.,
    2012) due to its high-quality calibration, high radiometric accuracy, and multiple-viewing
    capabilities (Wagner et al., 2013). The ASCAT sensor includes three vertically
    polarized antennas oriented at 45°, 90°, and 135° angles with respect to the satellite
    track, resulting in a double swath of about 500 km with a gap of about 360 km.
    The ASCAT near-surface SM estimates are obtained with a linear change detection
    retrieval algorithm developed by Wagner et al. (1999), where estimates are obtained
    at a distinct incidence angle (taken at 40°). This algorithm yields SM content
    in terms of relative saturation. The algorithm is part of the WAter Retrieval
    Package software, which provides the means for deriving long-term SM time series
    (Naeimi et al., 2009; Naeimi, Scipal, et al., 2009). The basic assumptions of
    the algorithm include a linear relationship between backscatter (dB) and near-surface
    SM and stability of backscatter despite seasonal change in vegetation and roughness
    (Naeimi et al., 2009a & 2009b). Thus, a disadvantage of the change detection algorithm
    is that the different contributions to the observed total backscatter from the
    soil, vegetation, and soil-vegetation interaction effects cannot be separated
    (Wagner et al., 2013). It should be noted that the algorithm calculates only relative
    changes in SM and not absolute SM. Hence, tie points to convert relative saturation
    to absolute SM are required. The MetOp-C, unlike SMOS and SMAP, is an operational
    platform that generates a real-time operational product that is publicly distributed
    by EUMETSAT (https://navigator.eumetsat.int/product/EO:EUM:DAT:METOP:SOMO12).
    This constitutes a much stronger commitment to data continuity than provided by
    scientific missions such as SMOS and SMAP. 6.2.3 The Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity
    (SMOS) Mission The SMOS satellite with the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture
    Synthesis (MIRAS) instrument is developed by the Centre d''Etudes Spatiales de
    la Biosphère with support from ESA and in collaboration with the Centre National
    d''Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the Centro Para el Desarrollo Tecnological Industrial
    (Figure 19d). SMOS is the first satellite dedicated to the global measurement
    of near-surface SM (top 5 cm) with moderate spatial resolution (Kerr et al., 2001;
    Kerr et al., 2010). Using an interferometric radiometer, SMOS captures brightness
    temperature (T b ) at several incidence angles. The radiometer exploits the interferometry
    principle, where 69 small receivers measure the phase difference of the incident
    radiation emitted from the Earth''s surface. The technique is based on cross correlation
    of observations from all receiver pair combinations to generate the scene T b
    . As the satellite moves along its orbital path, each observed area is imaged
    at various viewing angles. The microwave signal within the L-band is much more
    sensitive to changes in SM than it is to atmospheric disturbances or land surface
    characteristics (i.e., surface roughness, soil texture, topography, and soil bulk
    density; Kerr et al., 2012). The SMOS mission provides SM estimates generated
    from T b (L1) via the SMOS L2 processor (Kerr et al., 2010), which in principle
    contains the L-MEB model proposed by Wigneron et al. (2007). In general, L-MEB
    is applied to compute multiangular top-of-the-atmosphere brightness temperatures
    based on a set of soil (e.g., moisture, temperature, and texture), vegetation
    (e.g., water content and temperature), and radiative transfer parameters (e.g.,
    single scattering albedo, polarization coupling factor, and surface roughness).
    The retrieval algorithm as outlined in Kerr et al. (2012) is based on a Bayesian
    approach, where L-MEB based brightness temperatures are compared with direct observations
    through minimizing a cost function. SMOS L1 and L2 products have been used to
    derive higher-level products, L3 and L4. SMOS L3 products include surface SM and
    vegetation optical depth (VOD), while SMOS L4 products provide root-zone SM (0–100
    cm), surface roughness, neural network-based SM from AMSR-E/SMOS synergies, and
    an agricultural drought index with spatial resolution of 25 km (EASE-2 grid; Al
    Bitar et al., 2013; Mecklenburg et al., 2016; Parrens et al., 2016; Rodríguez-Fernández
    et al., 2016). A comprehensive overview of modeling approaches and SM retrieval
    algorithms has been presented by Wigneron et al. (2017). The recent diurnal L3
    product, SMOS-IC, has been released by the French Institut National de la Recherche
    Agronomique in collaboration with the Centre d''Etudes Spatiales de la biosphere
    to provide global estimations of SM (Figure 20, top) and VOD (Fernandez-Moran
    et al., 2017). The VOD product can be used in support of agricultural applications
    related to food security (Mecklenburg et al., 2016). SMOS-IC is based on L-MEB,
    but its algorithm is simpler than the operational SMOS L2 and L3 SM retrieval
    algorithms. In SMOS-IC pixels are assumed homogeneous (a single value of each
    input model parameter is used for the whole pixel), while operational SMOS L2
    and L3 algorithms correct for pixel heterogeneity. This provides greater independence
    of SMOS-IC from uncertainties in auxiliary data (e.g., MODIS LAI data and SM information
    used as auxiliary data in L2/L3 algorithms to estimate T b in the pixel fractions
    of heterogeneous pixels) and tends to perform better than previous SMOS products
    due to considering updated soil roughness and vegetation albedo parameters for
    calibration of L-MEB SM retrievals based on ISMN SM data (Fernandez-Moran et al.,
    2017; Parrens et al., 2016). L-band observations have been challenged by unexpected
    RFI. Despite being a protected band for scientific studies, the SMOS mission has
    suffered significantly from RFI effects in certain regions (Oliva et al., 2012).
    The number of RFI sources has been reduced in Europe, North and South America,
    and China but remains significant in Asia and the Middle East (Soldo et al., 2016).
    SMOS data are publicly available from ESA (L2 and L3; http://smos-diss.eo.esa.int/)
    and CATDS (L3 and L4; http://www.catds.fr/Products). Figure 20 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Comparison of SMOS-IC (top) and SMAP L3 (bottom) monthly surface
    (0–5 cm) soil moisture retrievals for August 2017. SMOS = Soil Moisture Ocean
    Salinity; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive. 6.2.4 The SMAP Mission The SMAP
    satellite is the most recent microwave sensor designed to measure and map SM within
    the top 5 cm of soil and to discern between frozen and thawed states by applying
    both active and passive sensors. The major science objectives of SMAP are to understand
    processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles, land surface global
    water, and energy fluxes and to improve weather and climate predictions (Entekhabi
    et al., 2010). This was intended to be accomplished with an instrument that combines
    L-band radar with an L-band radiometer, which share a conically rotating 6-m aperture
    reflector antenna that scans a 1,000-km-wide swath while the observatory orbits
    the Earth (Figure 19e and Table 5). The radiometer provides “passive” measurements
    of microwave emissions from the upper soil layer. It is more sensitive to near-surface
    SM and less sensitive to the effects of surface roughness and vegetation when
    compared to the radar. The SMAP mission yields 15 publicly available baseline
    science data products that include near-surface and root-zone SM (RZSM) estimates.
    The RZSM estimates are based on the assimilation of SMAP data into land surface
    models (NASA Catchment land surface model; Reichle et al., 2014). The joint processing
    of the radar and radiometer data was intended to yield SM at spatial resolutions
    of 3, 9, and 36 km with 3-day temporal resolution (Entekhabi et al., 2010). While
    the SMAP satellite was designed to spend at least 3 years in orbit, the high-resolution
    SMAP radar failed in July 2015 (three months after launch), leaving only the SMAP
    radiometer operational to this day. The SMAP target accuracy for SM is 0.04 cm3/cm3
    (based on unbiased RMSE) and is determined based on threshold VWC less than 5
    kg/m2. There are two types of SMAP level 2/3 passive surface SM products: the
    standard product is posted on a 36-km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE)-2 grid
    (L2/3 SM_P), while the optimally interpolated “enhanced” product is posted on
    a 9-km EASE-2 grid (L2/3 SM_P_E). The actual resolution of the latter is coarser
    than 9 km (Figure 20, bottom). Both products include SM retrievals for both a.m.
    and p.m. orbits. These data have a revisit time of 2–3 days at any location and
    a latency of 12–24 hr from the time of observation. Of particular interest is
    the SMAP level 4 (L4) model-based SM product obtained from assimilating SMAP level
    2 (L2) brightness temperature observations into the NASA catchment land surface
    model (Reichle et al., 2017). SMAP L4 provides global estimates of both surface
    (0–5 cm) and RZSM (down to 100 cm) with 9-km spatial and 3-hr temporal resolutions,
    interpolated from the coarse-scale (36 km) observations in space and in time (Reichle
    et al., 2017). The improved SMAP L4 product resolution provides additional information
    about the spatial variability of SM making it suitable for medium-scale applications.
    As a replacement for the radar, SMAP has recently released an active/passive SM
    product at a 3-km posting, which uses C-band backscatter observations from Sentinel-1
    to replace the SMAP L-band radar. It is only available for the locations and times
    where SMAP and Sentinel-1 overlap. The experience gained from SMOS aided SMAP
    in the development of better back-end mitigation tools and filters for RFI for
    both radiometer and radar instruments (Colliander et al., 2017). L-band RFI is
    a critical threat to future efforts to globally measure SM. It should be noted
    that to date, SMAP provides the most accurate global SM products (L3 and L4) for
    various applications (Chan et al., 2016 & 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Colliander
    et al., 2017; Crow et al., 2017; Koster et al., 2016). Passive SMAP data are publicly
    available from the National Soil and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) (https://nsidc. org/data/smap/smap-data.
    html). 6.2.5 The Sentinel-1 Mission The ESA Sentinel-1 mission (S-1) is a two-satellite
    polar-orbiting and day-and night-radar imaging system for land and ocean monitoring
    (Figure 19f). The goal of the mission is to provide data continuity following
    the retirement of ERS-2 and Envisat (Paloscia et al., 2013). The S-1 yields improved
    spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions when compared to the previous Envisat
    ASAR GM mode, while working at nearly the same frequency (e.g., 5.4 versus 5.3
    GHz; Table 5). Another improvement is the application of cross polarization to
    correct for seasonal vegetation effects in the copolarized backscatter measurements.
    In general, due to the better penetration of horizontally polarized (HH) waves
    through vertically oriented vegetation (grasses, crops), HH polarization is preferred
    (Brown et al., 2003). While the ESA provides Level-1 georeferenced single looked
    complex and projected multilook ground range detected products, a dedicated SM
    product is not available. Several attempts have been made to develop algorithms
    for retrieving SM from S-1 SAR data (Balenzano et al., 2012 ; Pierdicca et al.,
    2014). For example, Paloscia et al. (2013) presented an Artificial Neural Network-based
    algorithm to retrieve SM from S-1 data and tested their approach based on in situ
    ground data from several test sites in Italy, Australia, and Spain and obtained
    mean RMSEs less than 0.046 cm3/cm3, which is in line with S-1 target retrieval
    accuracy (0.05 cm3/cm3). In general, SM retrieval from SAR data is challenging
    due to the confounding influence of surface roughness and vegetation on the signal.
    Although numerous approaches utilizing different backscatter models have been
    developed, SM retrieval from S-1 data remains an enigma, mainly due to significant
    roughness changes (e.g., due to agricultural practices) and higher complexity
    of vegetation characterization at finer scales (e.g., wheat versus sugar beet)
    (Barrett et al., 2009). Due to the loss of the SMAP radar, S-1 is currently the
    only active sensor with a high spatial but 6-day temporal resolution for near-surface
    SM estimations. Such temporal resolution is not adequate for applications where
    3 days or less is required. Recently, the S-1 radar backscatter measurements (C-band)
    have been combined with SMAP radiometer brightness temperature (L-band) observations
    to produce a high resolution SMAP-Sentinel-1 SM product (SPL2SMAP_S) with 3-km
    EASE-grid providing SM from April 2015 to present and available to the public
    through NASA DAAC at the NSIDC (https://nsidc. org/data/SPL2SMAP_S/versions/2)
    (Das et al., 2018b). 6.2.6 The CCI The CCI is a part of ESA''s global monitoring
    of Essential Climate Variables (program, which includes SM). The CCI aims to provide
    the most complete and consistent global SM products based on several active and
    passive microwave remote sensors dating back to 1978. The record is based on three
    products that differ in the data source: (1) an active-only data set, (2) a passive-only
    data set, and (3) a merged active-passive data set (Liu et al., 2012; Wagner et
    al., 2012). The active data set (1991–2014) was generated with the change detection
    algorithm (Naeimi, Scipal, et al., 2009; Wagner, Lemoine, & Rott, 1999) based
    on observations from the C-band scatterometer onboard of ERS-1, ERS-2 (AMI SCAT)
    and METOP-A (ASCAT). The passive data set (1978–2014) was generated by VU University
    Amsterdam in collaboration with NASA using the LPRM (Owe et al., 2008) based on
    observations from Nimbus 7 SMMR, DMSP SSM/I, TRMM TMI, and Aqua AMSR-E (Liu et
    al., 2012). The new 04.2 version of the CCI additionally includes passive AMSR-2
    and SMOS SM data in the merged SM product (Chung et al., 2018). It is possible
    to include SM data from new satellite missions (i.e., SMAP, Aquarius, and Sentinel-1)
    (Wagner et al., 2012) (Figure 21). This CCI SM merged data set is publically available
    from https://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org. Figure 22 shows an example of the CCI
    product for global monitoring of SM. Figure 21 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Active and passive microwave remote sensors used for generation of the European
    Space Agency climate change initiative data sets. Although the SMAP and Aquarius
    missions have not been included in the latest version of the climate change initiative
    (Essential Climate Variable SM 04.2), they are already included in this diagram
    to highlight their potential future inclusions. Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture

    WACMOS: Water Cycle Multi-mission Observation Strategy). 6.2.7 Evaluation of Microwave
    Satellite SM Retrievals SM retrieval from RS observations may be biased by numerous
    factors, which are mainly related to atmospheric interferences, vegetation properties,
    and soil roughness. This necessitates comprehensive validation of the resulting
    SM estimates. Significant efforts have been devoted to the development of novel
    algorithms providing reliable SM estimates for a variety of land surface conditions
    (Al-Yaari et al., 2017; Das et al., 2011; Fernandez-Moran et al., 2017; Kerr et
    al., 2016; McNairn et al., 2015; Montzka et al., 2014; Piles et al., 2009; Rodríguez-Fernández
    et al., 2015; Schwank et al., 2010; van der Schalie et al., 2018; Vittucci et
    al., 2016). Validation of SM retrievals is commonly performed based on data from
    in situ SM networks. For example, validation of SMAP SM products is performed
    with a global network of 34 high-quality core validation sites that provide estimates
    of SM at SMAP grid product scales (Colliander et al., 2017). A comprehensive assessment
    of SMAP L4 surface and root-zone SM products based on sparse network and core
    validation sites in the World has been provided by Reichle et al. (2017). Their
    findings indicate that the SMAP L4 meets its established SM retrieval accuracy
    requirement (0.04 cm3/cm3) with ubRMSE of 0.035–0.038 cm3/cm3 and 0.026–0.03 cm3/cm3
    for surface and root-zone retrievals, respectively (https://nsidc. org/data/smap/technical-references).

    has a target SM retrieval error of less than 0.04 cm3/cm3. Experimental validation
    has been carried out in Europe (Dall''Amico et al., 2012; Dente et al., 2012;
    Fascetti et al., 2016; Pierdicca et al., 2015; Rötzer et al., 2014; Wigneron et
    al., 2012), the United States (Al Bitar et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2012; Wagner
    et al., 2014), Africa (Fascetti et al., 2016; Louvet et al., 2015; Pierdicca et
    al., 2015), South America (Niclòs et al., 2016), and Australia (van der Schalie
    et al., 2015). The validation ranged from local (Jackson et al., 2012; Louvet
    et al., 2015) to continental scales (Al Bitar et al., 2012; Fascetti et al., 2016).
    Different validation experiments for SMOS SM products have generally revealed
    varying retrieval accuracies ranging from 0.030 to 0.140 cm3/cm3 depending on
    soil type, seasonality, and vegetation density (see also Table 6). For example,
    for rain-fed croplands in Argentina, Niclòs et al. (2016) determined a SM retrieval
    uncertainty of ±0.07 cm3/cm3 for SMOS L2 SM products. Louvet et al. (2015) evaluated
    SMOS L3 SM data with ground-based SM measurements at the local and regional scales
    over West Africa and found an average RMSE of 0.047 cm3/cm3. Petropoulos et al.
    (2015) extensively evaluated SMOS SM operational estimates for some European sites
    with a variety of climate, environmental, biome, and seasonal conditions against
    the Carbo-Europe in situ network and found that SMOS performed better for low
    vegetation cover (with a RMSE from 0.044 to 0.061 cm3/cm3) and during the autumn
    season (with a RMSE of 0.076 cm3/cm3). Global comparison of SMOS to other missions
    like AMSR-2 indicated consistent results for SMOS over all surfaces from very
    dry (African Sahel, Arizona) to wet (tropical rain forests; Al-Yari et al., 2014;
    Kerr et al., 2016; Van der Schalie et al., 2016). Since AMSR-2 is a new passive
    system, efforts have been devoted to the evaluation of the quality of its SM estimates
    by utilizing existing in situ observation networks (Cho, Choi, & Wagner, 2015;
    H. Lu et al., 2014; Parinussa et al., 2014). For example, Kim et al. (2015) evaluated
    the accuracy of global AMSR-2 SM estimates based on COSMOS networks in the United
    States, Australia, Europe, and Africa and reported reliable performance. More
    recently, Wu et al. (2016) evaluated the performance for ascending and descending
    AMSR-2 SM products during a 3-year period (2012–2015) based on in situ measurements
    at 598 stations of the ISMN network obtained for various land cover types and
    ecoregions. Their results revealed the best agreement with in situ measurements
    for the Great Plains (RMSE 0.051 cm3/cm3) and the worst for forested areas (RMSE
    0.094 cm3/cm3; see also Table 6). Validation experiments for ASCAT SM estimates
    indicated reasonable performance for several regions in Europe, with even somewhat
    better results than provided by the initial SMOS and best AMSR-E SM retrievals.
    The performance of ASCAT for mountainous regions or desert land was unsatisfactory
    (Wagner et al., 2013). A comparison between ASCAT and SMOS SM retrievals with
    in situ ground measurements in Europe and Northern Africa for the period from
    2010 to 2013 has shown similar results (with mean RMSE 0.124 cm3/cm3; Fascetti
    et al., 2016). A validation experiment for ASCAT and SMOS SM data for four U.S.
    watersheds yielded large differences. The ASCAT SM estimates were very noisy and
    unstable, which may be due to higher sensitivity of the active observations to
    surface roughness (Leroux et al., 2014). In a similar study, Rötzer et al. (2014)
    evaluated SMOS and ASCAT SM products based on upscaled in situ measurements at
    three TERENO test sites in western Germany for the time period from 2010 to 2012.
    They applied the Water Flow and Balance Simulation (WaSiM) model for upscaling
    in situ measurements and found that while SMOS provided relatively constant bias,
    ASCAT bias was variable throughout the year. While ASCAT provides accurate SM
    estimates for bare and sparsely vegetated soils, estimates for tropical forests
    and other densely vegetated regions are associated with significant SM retrieval
    errors (Wagner et al., 2013). The ASCAT surface SM estimates have been applied
    to determine SM distributions within the soil profile by means of the Soil Water
    Index (SWI), an exponential relationship that links surface and subsurface SM
    via a characteristic time length (Ceballos et al., 2005; De Lange et al., 2008;
    Wagner et al., 1999). For example, Paulik et al. (2014) evaluated SWI estimates
    based on in situ measurements at 664 stations (distributed over 23 observation
    networks) in the United States for a 5-year period and found an average correlation
    coefficient of 0.54 and RMSEs below 0.079 cm3/cm3. A global validation of the
    ASCAT SWI with in situ data from the ISMN has been provided by Paulik et al. (2012).
    The ASCAT near-surface SM products have also been assimilated into land surface
    models to provide profile SM (Dharssi et al., 2011; Draper et al., 2011, 2012;
    Reichle et al., 2007). An ASCAT root-zone SM profile product, the so-called SM-Data
    Assimilation System-2, SM-DAS-2 or H14, has been developed by the European Organization
    for the EUMETSAT based on a near-surface SM index, the H-16 SM-OBS-3 product,
    and a Simplified Extended Kalman Filter Data Assimilation System (De Rosnay et
    al., 2011). This product is available for four soil layers from the surface down
    to 3 m (i.e., 0–7, 7–28, 28–100, and 100–289 cm) with global daily coverage. This
    product has been evaluated based on in situ measurements and yielded better SM
    estimates than model or satellite estimates alone (Albergel et al., 2010, 2012).
    The ASCAT root-zone SM profile retrieval algorithm is now operational at the European
    Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). A significant constraint of
    ASCAT SM data is the irregular temporal coverage. However, so far only a few validation
    experiments have been conducted to determine the performance of the S-1 data with
    regard to SM retrieval. Table 6 provides an overview of the accuracy and performance
    of validation experiments used to retrieve SM from various microwave satellite
    remote sensors. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate CCI products based
    on in situ measurements and finer spatial resolution remotely sensed SM data.
    In a comprehensive validation, Dorigo et al. (2015) evaluated historical CCI products
    based on ground measurements at 596 sites from 28 globally distributed SM networks.
    They reported RMSE of 0.05 cm3/cm−3 (R = 0.46) for absolute values and 0.04 cm3/cm−3
    (R = 0.36) for SM anomalies. In a similar study, Wang et al. (2015) performed
    reliability analysis of CCI products for croplands in North China for the period
    from 1981 to 2010. They obtained an average triple collocation (TC) random error
    of 0.052 cm3/cm3 and an average Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.42. A quality
    assessment of 5-year CCI data based on estimates from Envisat ASAR (Wide Swath
    Mode) for various climate, topography, land cover, and soil-type conditions has
    provided reasonable agreement between the ASAR and CCI data sets, with correlation
    values larger than 0.55 (Pratola et al., 2015). It has been pointed out that the
    merged products have a similar or better performance than individual products
    (Dorigo et al., 2015). Recently, Gruber et al. (2017) proposed a new merging approach
    based on weighted averaging and error variance estimates obtained from TC analysis
    for blending multi-platform (active/passive) SM products, which is being used
    in the new CCI product (version v03.x and higher). An overview of validation results
    for microwave satellite SM retrievals is given in Table 6. High spatial variability
    of SM results in significant differences between the point-scale in situ SM sensors
    and the coarse-scale satellite-based SM retrievals, which provides a significant
    challenge for the validation of SM from the current and the upcoming SM satellite
    missions. Upscaling point-scale SM could help to fill in the scale gaps and provide
    reliable validation of satellite SM products. An excellent review of the SM upscaling
    problem and measurement density requirements for ground based SM data has been
    provided by Crow et al. (2012). 6.3 Airborne Microwave Sensors and Imagery Over
    the past few decades, extensive L-band and C-band airborne observations have been
    conducted with the aim of preparation for L-band and C-band satellite missions.
    Such microwave instruments are only capable of measuring near-surface SM, which
    is then assimilated into hydrologic models to determine profile SM (Draper et
    al., 2012; Montzka et al., 2011; see also section 43). There is significant interest
    in direct, large-scale, profile SM measurements because data assimilation approaches
    that couple satellite-based near-surface SM and subsurface SM may fail under specific
    circumstances (Kumar et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2002). The application of lower-frequency
    (deeper measurement) airborne microwave remote sensors for profile SM quantification
    has been an area of extensive research in recent years. In this section we focus
    on lower-frequency airborne activities only. At the lower P-band microwave frequencies,
    the signal penetrates to deeper soil depths, which allows direct profile SM sensing,
    which is of significant importance for many agricultural, hydrological, and meteorological
    applications and which is critical to strategic management of water resources.
    6.3.1 The AirMOSS Mission The NASA AirMOSS mission that consists of a P-band fully
    polarimetric SAR represents the first attempt to provide high-resolution observations
    of RZSM and net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The project targets nine regions representative
    of the major North American climatic biomes for estimating the impact of RZSM
    on regional carbon fluxes and integrating the measurement-constrained estimates
    of regional carbon fluxes to the continental scale of North America (Chapin et
    al., 2012; Tabatabaeenejad et al., 2013). In contrast to L-band and C-band microwave
    remote sensors, AirMOSS is designed to provide direct RZSM estimates. For the
    AirMOSS mission, NASA has adapted its Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture
    Radar, a pod-based repeat-pass polarimetric SAR that operates within the L-band
    (∼1.2 GHz) and incorporated a P-band (280–440 MHz) SAR, which operates at different
    frequencies onboard a Gulfstream-3 aircraft. The AirMOSS is capable of penetrating
    through vegetation extending to soil depths of about 0.5 m. The actual measurement
    depth depends on SM status, soil type, and vegetation cover (Moghaddam et al.,
    2000). It should be noted that P-band SAR observations are influenced by Faraday
    rotation resultant from the anisotropic ionosphere and the action of the geomagnetic
    field. This distorts P-band data and complicates their direct application for
    SM retrieval (Qi & Jin, 2007; Rignot et al., 1995). AirMOSS test flights started
    in August 2012 and science operations commenced in October 2012. The surveys cover
    approximately 25 × 100-km areas that contain FLUXNET sites for ground calibration
    and span regions ranging from boreal forests in Saskatchewan (Canada) to tropical
    forests in La Selva (Costa Rica) (Tabatabaeenejad et al., 2015). The flights have
    provided high spatial resolution (100 m) measurements for nine regions representative
    for the major North American biomes (Figure 23) at subweekly, seasonal, and annual
    time scales. Furthermore, AirMOSS data can provide a direct means for validating
    RZSM algorithms applied for the SMAP L4 SM retrieval (Tabatabaeenejad et al.,
    2015). A cross comparison between AirMOSS and model-based RZSM estimates generated
    by the Flux-Penn State Hydrology Model (Flux-PIHM) over the nine biome sites demonstrated
    comparable levels of accuracy for the two products when evaluated against in situ
    SM measurements and a significant temporal cross correlation. However, the AirMOSS
    RZSM retrievals showed higher spatial and temporal variability than the Flux-PIHM
    estimates (Crow et al., 2018). AirMOSS data are publicly available from NASA at
    https://airmoss. jpl. nasa. gov. Figure 23 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The
    Airborne Microwave Observatory of Sub-canopy and Subsurface study regions in North
    America. 6.3.2 The E-SAR The Experimental Synthetic Aperture Radar (E-SAR) onboard
    the German DLR DO228 aircraft is capable of simultaneously capturing data within
    the X-band, C-band, L-band, and P-band. The measurement modes include single channel
    operation mode (i.e., one wavelength and polarization at a time), the SAR Interferometry
    mode (X-band and C-band), and the SAR Polarimetry mode (L-band and P-band). The
    E-SAR captures an area of 3–5 × 20 km with slant range resolution of 2.3 to 4.5
    m and azimuth resolution of 0.7 to 2.5 m. The E-SAR has been in operation since
    1989 and has been continuously improved and applied to various SM and ice study
    campaigns such as AgriSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar in Agriculture, 2006), OPAQUE
    (Operational discharge and flooding predictions in head catchments, 2007–2008),
    SARTEO (Synthetic Aperture Radar within TERENO framework, 2008; Bogena et al.,
    2018), and ICESAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar for Ice, 2007) (Jagdhuber et al.,
    2015; Parrella et al., 2016). In 2012, the Microwaves and Radar Institute of the
    German Aerospace Center (DLR) developed an improved E-SAR version, termed F-SAR,
    based on the same platform and frequencies. Several studies have demonstrated
    the capability of E-SAR for SM retrieval. Zwieback et al. (2015) showed that SM
    variations significantly affect E-SAR L-band radar signals (i.e., phase, coherence,
    and phase triplets). Jagdhuber et al. (2015) coupled full polarimetric L-band
    E-SAR data with an iterative generalized hybrid decomposition method to retrieve
    SM for vegetated land surfaces and obtained RMSEs ranging from 0.04 to 0.044 cm3/cm3
    for different vegetation covers and soil types. The retrieved RZSM from microwave
    airborne instruments can provide validation of RZSM retrievals from assimilation
    of near-surface SM into hydrological models, which is discussed in section 43.
    6.3.3 The Polarimetric L-Band Multibeam Radiometer The Polarimetric L-band Multibeam
    Radiometer (PLMR) is a passive microwave remote sensor onboard a small aircraft
    owned by the Australian Research Council and several Australien universities.
    It provides brightness temperature data at six different incidence angles (±7°,
    ±21.5°, and ±38.5°) to estimate high-resolution SM, salinity, and temperature
    at low to moderate vegetation conditions. The radiometer includes a thermal imager
    (FLIR ThermaCam S60, 7.5–13μ) and a dual polarization L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometer
    with 1- and 50-m resolutions, respectively, at a flight elevation of 150 m above
    ground. The instrument''s accuracy is 0.7 for H- and 2°K for V-polarizations,
    which translates to a SM accuracy better than 0.01 cm3/cm3. It was used to assess
    the performance of the core algorithm (L-MEB) used for SMOS SM retrieval (Peischl
    et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2015). For example, Panciera et al. (2009) used PLMR
    brightness temperature data from National Airborne Field Experiment conducted
    in southeastern Australia in 2005 to evaluate the L-MEB algorithm for SM retrieval
    and showed good accuracy with errors less than 0.048 cm3/cm3 for crops and grasslands.
    It was also used in different studies for detection of land surface SM changes
    (Ma et al., 2017; Summerell et al., 2009). The PLMR was also used in SMAP experiments
    in Australia for an algorithm development test-bed for the SMAP mission (Panciera
    et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014, 2015). 6.3.4 The Passive Active L-Band Sensor The
    Passive Active L-band Sensor (PALS) onboard NASA''s P-3, NCAR C-130, and Twin
    Otter International''s aircrafts is a combined dual polarization radiometer and
    radar operating at 1.41 and 1.26 GHz, respectively. The antenna is a high beam
    efficiency conical horn with relatively low side lobes pointed at a 38° incidence
    angle and the spatial resolution 600-m at 1,200-m altitude. It was designed and
    built as the prototype for the Aquarius and SMAP missions to assess the benefits
    of combining active and passive microwave sensors for SM and ocean salinity RS
    (Colliander et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2001). PALS has been used in varying
    configurations for four major field experiments between 1999 and 2007 (Colliander
    et al., 2012). PALS observations have been used to improve the calibration and
    validation of SMAP SM algorithms (Colliander et al., 2012). For example, McNarin
    et al. (2015) used PALS in a 6-week Canada-U.S. field campaign in 2012 (SMAPVEX12)
    to simulate SMAP data. They showed that PALS radar backscatter and radiometer
    brightness temperature data were able to closely follow dry down and wetting events
    during SMAPVEX12. Akbar and Moghaddam (2015) used PALS data in Iowa in 2002 (SMEX02)
    and introduced a combined active-passive approach based on numerical modeling
    and parameter optimization in support of SMAP SM retrieval and showed retrieval
    errors of 0.035 cm3/cm3 for corn (VWC equal to 5 kg/m2). Colliander et al. (2015)
    used PALS data acquired during the SMAP validation experiment in 2012 to evaluate
    SMOS satellite brightness temperature observations and found differences less
    than 5 and 6°K for V and H polarizations, respectively. They concluded that PALS
    estimates are of significant value for the development of SMAP SM retrieval algorithms.
    Examples for other widely applied microwave airborne systems for SM retrieval
    include the L-band Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (Gao et al.,
    2004; Guha et al., 2003), the C/X-band Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (Bindlish
    et al., 2006; Das & Mohanty, 2008), and the L-band radiometer 2D-DTAR (Rye et
    al., 2010). 7 Root-Zone SM Estimation As discussed above, most of the commonly
    applied RS methods provide only skin and near-surface SM estimates. The increased
    interest in estimating RZSM based on RS observations has led to close cross-disciplinary
    collaborations between the RS community and soil physicists and hydrologists with
    the central goal of linking RZSM to remotely sensed skin and near-surface data.
    Correlations of surface and RZSM at different depths are influenced by many factors
    such as soil type, land use, and prevailing hydroclimatological conditions (Mahmood
    & Hubbard, 2007). Nonetheless, several approaches, reviewed by Kostov and Jackson
    (1993), indicated that accurate estimation of RZSM based on near-surface SM is
    possible. Kostov and Jackson (1993) categorized these approaches into four main
    classes: (1) empirical regression-based models, (2) knowledge-based approaches,
    (3) microwave brightness temperature inversion techniques, and (4) combinations
    of remotely sensed data with soil water flow models. They concluded that “Proper
    integration of remote sensing and modeling is probably the best approach to the
    problem of profile SM estimation”. Soil water flow models commonly applied to
    this approach are classified as analytical and numerical models as discussed below.
    7.1 Analytical Modeling One approach to link RZSM to surface/near-surface SM is
    the derivation of a simple analytical equation from an approximate mass balance
    equation (Albergel et al., 2008; Ceballos et al., 2005; Wagner, Lemoine, & Rott,
    1999). An excellent contribution to this class of models is the pioneering work
    of Wagner, Lemoine, and Rott (1999), who introduced a simple one-parameter model
    by solving the following approximate mass balance equation: (14) where θ is the
    volumetric SM content averaged from z = 0 to z = L (z denotes soil depth), θ sur
    is the SM content at the surface (z = 0), t is the time, and C is a pseudo diffusivity
    coefficient that depends on the soil properties. Solving equation (14), Wagner
    et al. (1999a) obtained the following simple equation to estimate deeper layer
    (profile) SM, θ(t), from a time series of remotely retrieved surface/near-surface
    SM, θ sur (t i ), data (15) where T = C/L is a “characteristic time length” or
    recession constant, considered to be a calibration parameter to be determined
    by fitting model estimations to ground observations. Although the solution of
    Wagner, Lemoine, and Rott (1999) relies on some simplifying assumptions (i.e.,
    neglect of transpiration and invariant soil diffusivity), it is useful as a general
    concept for estimating the profile SM, accounting for the decreasing influence
    of measurements with increasing time lag. Equation (15) has been tested with both
    simulated and measured data and yielded good results (Tobin et al., 2017). The
    model has also been extensively used to improve the description of the RZSM for
    rainfall-runoff applications (Brocca, Melone, Moramarco, Wagner, et al., 2010;
    Brocca, Tullo, et al., 2012; Manfreda et al., 2011; Matgen et al., 2012). Another
    analytical approach for retrieving RZSM is the physically based model of Sadeghi
    et al. (2017), which builds on the second-order polynomial model of Tabatabaeenejad
    et al. (2015). Sadeghi, Tabatabaeenejad, et al. (2017) mathematically solved Richards''
    equation (RE; see equation (17) and section 43) for unsaturated flow in soil and
    introduced a more realistic model for retrieving profile SM from AirMOSS P-band
    radar data. The general form of their equation, neglecting initial and boundary
    conditions, is (16) where c1, c2, and c3 denote the unknown coefficients that
    need to be retrieved, P and h cM are soil-dependent parameters related to water
    retention function parameters (van Genuchten, 1980). The values of these two parameters
    are available for the 12 soil textural classes of the USDA classification scheme
    (Carsel & Parrish, 1988; Sadeghi, Tabatabaeenejad, et al., 2017). The AirMOSS
    retrieved SM profiles, using equation (16), revealed better performance than the
    original AirMOSS polynomial algorithm by improving the inversion accuracy and
    providing more accurate SM profiles (Figure 24). Figure 24 Open in figure viewer

    the mean absolute error (cm3/cm3). 7.2 Numerical Modeling and Data Assimilation
    For several years, SM has been estimated with “open loop” strategies, where hydrological
    land surface models are simply coupled with precipitation and other meteorological
    data. For example, SM has been provided as volumetric or soil wetness by the National
    Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research
    (NCEP-NCAR; Kalnay et al., 1996), the ECMWF (Simmons & Gibson, 2000), the Japanese
    25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25) project, the Global Land Data Assimilation System
    (GLDAS; Rodell et al., 2004; https://rda.ucar.edu/), the Global Energy and Water
    Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2; Dirmeyer et al.,
    2006), and the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS; Luo, 2003).
    Another strategy to provide high-accuracy RZSM is the combination of surface SM
    measurements with a numerical model. Numerical modeling to estimate RZSM from
    near-surface SM estimates is commonly accompanied by sequential data assimilation,
    that is, the combination of observations with previous simulations for estimations
    used for the next model forecast (Entekhabi et al., 1994; Crow & Wood, 2003; Das
    & Mohanty, 2006; Han et al., 2013; Montzka et al., 2011; Song, Shi, et al., 2014).
    Reichle et al. (2004) were among the first to show that the assimilation of SM
    observations can globally improve model-based RZSM predictions (Reichle et al.,
    2007; Reichle & Koster, 2005). In geosciences, and especially for estimation of
    RZSM, sequential data assimilation often forms an inverse problem. Here, near-surface
    SM (indirect measurements) can be used to update RZSM simulations (previous forecast)
    to initialize a corrected state for the next prediction (Hoeben & Troch, 2000).
    With this approach, a dynamically consistent motion picture of the hydrological
    system can be generated with known error bars (Ghil & Malanotterizzoli, 1991).
    In this case, accurate precipitation observations serve as the driving force for
    the hydrological model and have similar significance and largely independent information
    to contribute to the RZSM algorithm as compared to assimilated near-surface SM
    measurements (Reichle et al., 2014). The benefit of near-surface SM data assimilation
    to infer RZSM is the connection to water and energy cycles, for example, evapotranspiration
    and infiltration estimation (De Lannoy & Reichle, 2016; Lievens et al., 2015).
    Various assimilation techniques such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (Evensen, 1997),
    the Particle Filter (Gordon et al., 1993; Moradkhani et al., 2005), or variational
    methods (Lorenc, 2003) including their modifications have been applied to RZSM
    estimation (Montzka et al., 2012). Sabater et al. (2007) compared different assimilation
    methods for RZSM retrieval. In addition to the assimilation method, subsurface
    physical models also play an important role in the improvement of RZSM estimates.
    Kumar et al. (2009) found this to be a function of surface-root-zone coupling
    strength, where the catchment land surface model outperforms the Mosaic, Noah
    and Community Land Model (CLM) models by describing the deviations from the equilibrium
    SM profile. The coupling to very deep soils is weaker but still possible using
    longer assimilation periods with more observations (Walker & Houser, 2001). During
    extreme hot conditions, the long-term correlations between near-surface and RZSM
    conditions degrade (Hirschi et al., 2014), and inversion may become misleading.
    A decoupling occurs during such extended drying periods as a result of a divergence
    between the drying rates at the soil surface and at deeper locations within the
    soil profile (Walker et al., 2002). However, Sabater et al. (2007) tested various
    data assimilation techniques derived from Kalman filter and variational methods
    and generated satisfactory RZSM results by assimilation of near-surface SM measurements
    into a model. Reichle et al. (2004) were among the first to show the discrepancy
    between absolute SM values between the datasets (satellite, model, and in situ)
    and point out the importance of bias correction and rescaling data before SM retrievals
    can be assimilated into land surface models. Yilmaz and Crow (2013) evaluated
    the optimality of three bias correction approaches including CDF matching, least
    squares regression, and TC to remove systematic differences between modeled and
    observed values and concluded that TC is the optimal approach. However, TC rescaling
    only helps for multiplicative biases, whereas CDF matching and least squares regression
    deal with both additive and multiplicative biases. There are various examples
    of near-surface SM assimilation for improved RZSM estimation (e.g., Carrera et
    al., 2015; Draper et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2014; Lievens et al., 2017; Pan
    et al., 2012). Dumedah et al. (2015) used the advanced Evolutionary Data Assimilation
    procedure to assimilate downscaled (1 km) SMOS surface SM data into the Joint
    UK Land Environment Simulator to better estimate the RZSM for the western plains
    of New South Wales in Australia. Assimilation yielded a clear improvement of RZSM
    retrieval by 34% for the 0- to 30-cm soil depth, 59% for the 30- to 60-cm soil
    depth, and 63% for the 60- to 90-cm soil depth based on RMSE. Draper et al. (2012)
    used an ensemble Kalman filter to separately and jointly assimilate ASCAT and
    AMSR-E into the NASA Catchment land surface model and recommended that joint assimilation
    of active and passive microwave observations provide maximum accuracy for RZSM
    estimation. Kolassa et al. (2017) combined active and passive microwave data from
    ASCAT and AMSR-E in a SM assimilation system and obtained highly accurate SM products.
    Lievens et al. (2017) demonstrated that joint assimilation of high-resolution
    Sentinel-1 and SMAP observations can improve the spatiotemporal accuracy of surface
    and root-zone SM estimates. Koster et al. (2018) indicated that integration of
    SMAP L2 surface SM data into the Catchment land surface model (the same as SMAP
    L4 model) along with model calibration can improve simulated SM and streamflow
    estimates. This has important ramifications for maximizing the effective employment
    of SMAP data in hydrological simulations. Hain et al. (2012) used dual assimilation
    of thermal infrared and passive microwave satellite observations of SM into the
    Noah land surface model and reported improvements for surface and RZSM. In addition
    to RZSM, satellite-derived SM data have been used for initialization of numerical
    weather prediction models. In a study by Drusch (2007), the TRMM Microwave Imager
    (TMI) SM product with 40-km resolution was used in three data assimilation experiments
    with the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the ECMWF over the southern United
    States to infer RZSM and improve weather parameters and forecast quality. Satellite
    SM products have been used to correct precipitation estimates with a water balance
    model via matching of observed and simulated SM. Pellarin et al. (2008) demonstrated
    that the use of AMSR-E SM measurements can be useful to suppress a significant
    number of wrongly detected rain events. Often, the model hydraulic parameterization
    leads to inadequate SM profile predictions. However, surface SM assimilation for
    improved RZSM simulation can help to constrain the parameter space (Han et al.,
    2013; Lee et al., 2014; Montzka et al., 2011). The process of combining observations
    and model forecasts during data assimilation is typically carried out by weighting
    each on the basis of their respective errors (Kumar et al., 2012). Therefore,
    one important issue during near-surface SM data assimilation is the correct estimation
    of the observation error characteristics (Reichle et al., 2008). Typically, most
    data assimilation approaches assume random, zero-mean observation errors, but
    in reality biases are unavoidable and it is difficult to attribute the bias to
    the model or the observations. Assimilating biased observations would lead to
    biased model states (including RZSM) and model parameters. Therefore, several
    bias removal techniques have been developed (Kumar et al., 2012). These techniques
    correct for both additive and multiplicative biases. In contrast to dynamically
    bias-aware data assimilation systems (Chen et al., 2014; De Lannoy et al., 2007;
    Montzka et al., 2013; Ryu et al., 2009), typically a priori bias mitigation is
    performed. Kumar et al. (2012) compared the attribution of the bias to the model
    and a priori calibration of respective model parameters with the attribution to
    the observations and a priori SM climatology matching. They found similar assimilation
    skills for near surface and RZSM, where the spatial variability of skill scores
    is reduced by a priori parameter optimization. A priori bias mitigation strategies
    include cumulative distribution function matching (Reichle & Koster, 2004) and
    least squares regression rescaling (Crow & Zhan, 2007), or TC (Stoffelen, 1998).
    Applications of near-surface SM assimilation are discussed in Lievens et al. (2015),
    Parrens et al. (2014), Rains et al. (2017), and Xu et al. (2015). 7.2.1 Soil Water
    Flow Governing Equation Estimating RZSM from surface/near-surface SM is commonly
    accomplished through a land surface or hydrological model. Land surface models
    applied to the RZSM simulations commonly consider a limited number of soil layers
    along the soil profile and calculate SM for each layer using a water balance equation
    (Crow & Wood, 2003; Sabater et al., 2007). More sophisticated hydrological models
    solve the SM profile on a much finer grid where water flow is modeled based on
    Richards'' (1931) equation (Das & Mohanty, 2006; Entekhabi et al., 1994; Han et
    al., 2012; Heathman et al., 2003; Montzka et al., 2011). RE combines the Buckingham-Darcy
    equation (Buckingham, 1907), q = –K(∇h – 1), and the continuity principle (conservation
    of mass), ∂θ/∂t = –∇q. Modified to account for root water uptake, the one-dimensional
    (1-D) form of RE is written as (17) where q is the water flux density [LT-1],
    K is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity [LT-1], h is the pressure head [L],
    θ is the volumetric SM content [L3L−3], t is time [T], z is soil depth [L] assumed
    positive downward from the soil surface, and S is the sink term [L3L−3T−1] (i.e.,
    root water uptake). 7.2.2 Soil Hydraulic Functions In an unsaturated soil, h and
    K are functions of θ which are referred to as SHPs or “soil hydraulic functions”
    (SHFs) and assumed to be invariant for a given soil. Provided that K(θ) and h(θ)
    for any given soil component are known, solving RE subject to specific initial
    and boundary conditions would result in an estimate of the SM profile, θ(z), at
    any time of interest, t. Various mathematical relationships exist for SHFs, h(θ)
    and K(θ). The most widely used unimodal SHFs are relationships introduced by Gardner
    (1958), Brooks and Corey (1964), van Genuchten (1980), Russo (1988), and Kosugi
    (1994, 1996) (Sadeghi et al., 2016; Tuller & Or, 2005). The retention curves (see
    section 2) are empirical relationships, and the conductivity models are derived
    from substitution of the retention curve into a bundle of cylindrical capillaries
    (BCC) model. These empirical SHFs are commonly parametrized via nonlinear regression
    analysis of measured h-θ and K-θ data for a soil of interest. Several studies
    conducted within the past few decades have provided evidence that in addition
    to capillary forces, adsorptive surface forces significantly impact the matric
    potential, especially in fine-textured soils with high specific surface areas
    (Lebeau & Konrad, 2010; Peters & Durner, 2008; Tuller et al., 1999; Tuller & Or,
    2005). Direct measurements of SHPs mostly rely on inversion of Darcy''s law for
    steady state conditions or an approximate analytical or numerical solution of
    RE for transient conditions. Therefore, these methods are limited to the so-called
    “Darcy scale,” where the RE originates, such as the sample scale (Kool et al.,
    1985; Peters & Durner, 2008) or column scale (Sadeghi et al., 2014; Shao & Horton,
    1998) in laboratory analyses and at the point scale (Simunek & van Genuchten,
    1996) and block/plot scale (Hillel et al., 1972) in field experiments. Hence,
    these methods are not optimal for large-scale modeling of soil water flow, for
    example, at the satellite footprint scale. To tackle this problem, effective SHPs
    at the footprint scale have been recently investigated using RS techniques (Babaeian
    et al., 2016). Most of the existing methods for RS-based estimation of SHPs rely
    on inverse modeling of RE or its extended forms in which footprint scale effective
    SHPs are solved such that model simulations best fit remotely sensed data. Camillo
    et al. (1986) were among the first to estimate soil hydraulic parameters (Brooks-Corey
    parameters) by inversion of an extended form of RE accounting for nonisothermal
    soil water flow and heat transfer to fit microwave-based surface SM and soil temperature.
    They conducted a plot-scale experiment, where passive microwave data were acquired
    with a dual-polarized L-band radiometer mounted on a boom truck. Later, Ines and
    Mohanty (2008, 2008, 2009) developed Genetic-Algorithm-based inverse modeling
    and data assimilation methods for estimating footprint-scale effective values
    of the van Genuchten (1980) soil hydraulic parameters, incorporating time series
    data of airborne and satellite (e.g., AMSR-E) RS-based near-surface SM data. In
    a synthetic study, Montzka et al. (2011) explored the potential of using near-surface
    SM retrieved from different satellites to estimate SHPs (van Genuchten parameters)
    and SM profiles using the 1-D RE and a particle filtering data assimilation method.
    The inverse modeling approaches for estimation of SHPs using RS data have been
    thoroughly reviewed by Mohanty (2013). Besides inverse modeling approaches, there
    exist a few studies on the potential of direct estimation of SHPs using RS data.
    Hollenbec et al. (1996) indicated that soil hydraulic heterogeneity could be identified
    by detection of relative changes in passive microwave RS observations. They concluded
    that the variogram of relative change indicates existence of an effective correlation
    length much larger than that commonly observed in ground-based soil surveys, and
    their findings encourage the use of passive microwave RS for assessing soil hydraulic
    characteristics that are valid at a scale appropriate for hydrometeorological
    models. Mattikalli et al. (1998) observed that temporal changes of airborne passive
    microwave (L-band) brightness temperature (a function of SM) held statistically
    significant negative lognormal relationships with saturated hydraulic conductivity
    (K s ). They showed that regression-based models could accurately relate the brightness
    temperature variations to K s across large regions. Limited literature exists
    on predicting SHPs based on hyperspectral optical imaging (Babaeian et al., 2015a).
    Such methods are mainly based on regression models between SHPs or parameters
    as target variables and various features of soil absorbance and reflectance spectra
    as explanatory variables. These regression-based predictive models were termed
    “spectrotransfer functions” or “spectral transfer functions”, STFs, and spectral
    pedotransfer functions (analogous to “PTFs”; Babaeian, Homaee, Vereecken, et al.,
    2015; Santra et al., 2009). Studies of Santra et al. (2009), Babaeian, Homaee,
    Montzka, et al. (2015), and Babaeian, Homaee, Vereecken, et al. (2015)) are among
    a few in this category, relating soil reflectance at various optical wavelengths
    (400–2,500 nm) to K s and van Genuchten hydraulic parameters. Although the STFs
    were developed using laboratory spectroscopy (i.e., a spectroradiometer), they
    are potentially promising for airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensors
    for SHPs estimation (see section 19). Recently, Babaeian et al. (2016) used coarse-scale
    STFs and Spectral Pedotransfer Functions (SPTFs) to provide coarse-scale estimates
    of the van Genuchten-Mualem hydraulic parameters. They evaluated the effective
    values of the hydraulic parameters and showed that the coarse-scale spectral transfer
    functions coupled with vadose zone flow modeling can be applied to predict profile
    SM dynamics at larger scales. 7.2.3 Scale Mismatch Since the RE has been originally
    developed for the Darcy scale, which ranges from the representative elementary
    volume (REV) to the sample or column scale, application of RE to the RS footprint
    scale, i.e., from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers, may lead to physically
    unrealistic results. When solving RE in order to simulate θ(z,t), h should be
    translated as θ. As mentioned above, this is accomplished through the application
    of the soil water retention curve, which is valid for hydrostatic conditions (i.e.,
    no flow). This means that a “local equilibrium” between water content and water
    potential is assumed when solving RE (Vogel & Ippisch, 2008). The equilibrium
    (stationary) condition is not always guaranteed, for example, when solving the
    RE numerically in a coarsely discretized domain. Therefore, allocation of more
    computational resources to solve the RE for finer spatial grids is often required
    not only to avoid numerical errors but also to satisfy the local equilibrium assumption
    (Roth, 2008). Failure to satisfy this essential requirement is not only due to
    the numerical discretization issue but also may occur at the scale of the REV.
    Roth (2008) argued that “violation of the stationary assumption at the scale of
    the REV leads to a fundamental failure of the Richards'' equation that cannot
    be amended.” This condition is observed, for example, with infiltration instabilities
    that lead to localized flow processes. Several studies addressed the much debated
    question: “Do the underlying physics in the RE formulation apply at large scales
    of practical interest?” (Or et al., 2015). Several authors (Or et al., 2015; Roth,
    2008; Vogel & Ippisch, 2008) argued that, due to the underlying assumption of
    local equilibrium, there exists an upper limit of spatial discretization (δ) above
    which the solution is expected to be biased. By equating diffusive and convective
    water flows, Vogel and Ippisch (2008) analytically derived an upper limit for
    δ. Their solution showed δ ranges from a few centimeters to a few meters depending
    on the SHPs (smaller δ for coarser soils) and the total water potential gradient
    (smaller δ for larger gradients). For large-scale hydrologic applications, Or
    et al. (2015) also indicated that the spatial extent of lateral flow interactions
    under most natural capillary gradients rarely exceed a few meters. Despite this
    fact, the RE has been widely applied at the footprint scale as discussed above.
    For such applications the spatial discretization of the numerical solution of
    the RE is limited to the remote sensor''s spatial resolution (e.g., from 10 m
    for optical Sentinel-2 to about 40 km for microwave SMOS and SMAP). This scale
    mismatch should be considered as an unavoidable source of error in numerical models
    linking surface SM and RZSM (Entekhabi et al., 1994; Han et al., 2012; Heathman
    et al., 2003). Due to inherent spatial variability of soil properties, application
    of the RE at large scales is accompanied with upscaling SHPs from point to footprint
    scale. Two general approaches for upscaling SHPs are commonly applied: (1) forward
    upscaling and (2) inverse upscaling (i.e., inverse modeling; Vereecken et al.,
    2007). Forward upscaling methods directly calculate large-scale properties from
    small-scale properties. Various theories exist for forward upscaling of SHPs such
    as simple averaging (Zhu & Mohanty, 2006), percolation theory (Hunt & Idriss,
    2009; Samouelian et al., 2007), homogenization theory (Neuweiler & Cirpka, 2005;
    Neuweiler & Vogel, 2007), hybrid mixture theory (Hassanizadeh & Gray, 1979), similar/dissimilar
    media scaling theory (Miller & Miller, 1956; Sadeghi et al., 2012; Warrick et
    al., 1977), stochastic methods (Yeh et al., 1985; Zhang & Lu, 2002), and renormalization
    methods (King & Neuweiler, 2002; Saucier, 1992). Forward upscaling requires detailed
    information of SHPs at small scales, and hence, is not appropriate for RS applications.
    As discussed above, a common approach to incorporate RS data for effective SHP
    estimation is inverse modeling, where SHFs are parametrized to match the RE solution
    with RS-based observations at large scales. This strategy may alleviate the scale
    mismatch issue discussed above, as it basically calibrates RE so that it fits
    large scale observations. However, calibration of RE in hydrological models with
    insufficiently fine discretization will likely result in parameter values that
    are physically unrealistic (Downer & Ogden, 2004). Here the effective parameters
    also appear to be dependent on the type of boundary condition (Vereecken et al.,
    2007). In other words, the parameters may not work under boundary conditions different
    from those applied during calibration. 8 Spatial and Temporal Variability of SM
    The high variability of SM in space and time is well documented (Crow et al.,
    2012; Famiglietti et al., 2008; Vereecken et al., 2014) and to a certain extent
    the cause for the large variability of SM estimates obtained with the various
    sensing methods discussed above. The surface soil layer generally exhibits the
    largest SM variability, due to the interaction of environmental (soil properties,
    topography, and vegetation), meteorological (precipitation and temperature), and
    human factors, which decrease with soil depth. The magnitude of the variabilities
    depends on the extent of scale (see section 3) as it first increases with increasing
    extent and then when reaching a threshold remains constant (Brocca, Tullo, et
    al., 2012). The relationship between mean SM and the standard deviation of SM
    has been considered as an important aspect when analyzing the spatial variability
    of SM (Brocca, Melone, Moramarco, & Morbidelli 2010; Famiglietti et al., 2008).
    Figure 25 depicts an example of this relationship for surface SM (0–5 cm) from
    SMAP L4 data (April 2015 to May 2017) from the Tonzi Ranch site in California
    for an area about 2,000 km2. In particular, a convex upward relationship can be
    identified between mean and standard deviation of surface SM (Brocca, Melone,
    Moramarco, & Morbidelli, 2010; Western et al., 2004) when the data set covers
    the whole range from dry to wet conditions. Crow et al. (2012) reviewed different
    techniques for spatial upscaling of SM and discussed the upscaling problem and
    measurement density requirements for ground SM networks. While this relationship
    describes spatial SM variability, it does not provide information about temporal
    variability. Thus, the question is how can both spatial and temporal variabilities
    be quantified and made comparable between different data sets? Figure 25 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationship between mean surface soil moisture and
    standard deviation for SMAP L4 data for the 2,000-km2 Tonzi Ranch site in California.
    The red line represents a fitted third-order polynomial function. SMAP = Soil
    Moisture Active Passive. In contrast to methods only describing variability in
    the spatial domain, for example, geostatistics (Haining et al., 2010), or only
    in the temporal domain, for example, time series analysis (Fu, 2011; Sprott, 2003),
    there exist several methods that simultaneously analyze both space and time domains.
    Especially for SM, the combined analysis of spatial and temporal patterns of observations
    is important to understand their origin. Several methods have been proposed for
    analysis of the spatiotemporal SM variability, including Temporal Stability Analysis
    (TSA; Martinez-Fernandez & Ceballos, 2005), TC (Crow et al., 2015; Gruber et al.,
    2017), and Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs; Yoo & Kim, 2004). In this section
    we discuss EOF and TSA as new methods available for understanding spatiotemporal
    variability of SM. 8.1 EOFs EOF analysis, which is also known as principal component
    analysis (PCA), decomposes the observed variability of a data set into a set of
    orthogonal spatial patterns and a set of multivariate time series called expansion
    coefficients (Korres et al., 2010). With this separation, EOFs can be used to
    identify the dominant processes and essential parameters controlling spatiotemporal
    SM patterns (Korres et al., 2010). A temporal sequence of spatial variables is
    expressed as a result of the superposition of two or more temporally stable spatial
    structures. The spatial distribution of the variable at a specific point in time
    is then defined as a weighted average of those patterns, where the weights vary
    with time. The first EOF loadings (also called the eigenvectors) typically contain
    the dominant fractions of the spatiotemporal variability, whereas the last EOF
    loadings contain the residual variance classified as observation uncertainty or
    more generally as noise. Therefore, the approach can be used to efficiently extract
    information from observed data and to describe hydrological behavior in heterogeneous
    systems in a quantitative way (Hohenbrink & Lischeid, 2015). For more details
    see Hannachi et al. (2007). Typical applications for SM datasets mainly include
    an analysis of the origins of spatiotemporal patterns. Korres et al. (2010) related
    patterns of field-scale SM measurements to soil properties and topography. They
    applied EOF analysis and indicated that soil properties and topography control
    the spatiotemporal patterns of SM. Perry and Niemann (2008) analyzed the TARRAWARRA
    data set (Western & Grayson, 1998) and found a primary pattern association with
    soil water lateral redistribution. The second factor that was found to impact
    SM distribution patterns was solar radiation, which differentially insolated the
    surface due to topography. Moreover, they decomposed the data set into EOFs, interpolated
    the EOFs using a standard interpolation method, and used the interpolated EOFs
    to reconstruct the fine-scale SM patterns in time. This method outperformed the
    standard interpolation methods. Kim and Barros (2002) and Jawson and Niemann (2007)
    explained the relationship between the spatial structure of estimated SM and that
    of ancillary data including topography, soil texture, and vegetation cover with
    an EOF analysis. Joshi and Mohanty (2010) quantified the contribution of soil
    texture to SM variability from the watershed to regional scales, as microwave
    remotely sensed SM is retrieved with dielectric mixing models such as that from
    Wang and Schmugge (1980) that, in part, is based on the dominant soil texture
    within the measurement footprint. In addition to topography and soil properties,
    Qiu et al. (2014) also analyzed the role of precipitation on SM variability at
    different spatial scales. They were able to quantify the influence of rainfall
    variability on SM being small at watershed scales and larger at regional and national
    scales (e.g., China). This is because large-scale SM distribution is more closely
    related to atmospheric forcing processes. Nied et al. (2013) reduced the dimensionality
    of their SM data set to identify the main driving patterns of flood initiation.
    The EOF analysis of Fang et al. (2015) of simulated and observed SM revealed that
    introduction of heterogeneity in soil porosity effectively improved estimates
    of SM patterns. In the same region, Koch et al. (2016) and Graf et al. (2014)
    conducted an EOF analysis on SM data and clustered the resulting loadings to separate
    wet and dry periods. This classification was further used to assess the seasonality
    of the SM patterns. Fan and Dool (2004) showed the dominance of El Niño–Southern
    Oscillation in the first EOF of global long-term SM simulations. Bauer-Marschallinger
    et al. (2013) performed a similar study for Australia. Schubert et al. (2004)
    found the causes of long-term drought in the U.S. Great Plains in the El Niño–Southern
    Oscillation and pan-Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies. Wang et al. (2015)
    found correlations of the Palmer Drought Severity Index in China with the Northern
    Hemisphere polar vortex, the Arctic Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation.
    Tatli and Turkes (2011) analyzed different drought indices with and without SM
    information in an EOF analysis to identify the most suitable index for drought
    characterization in Turkey. EOFs are also used in downscaling approaches; for
    example, Busch et al. (2012) developed a topography-related downscaling algorithm,
    where the associated expansion coefficients are estimated on the basis of the
    spatial average SM. 8.2 TSA of Spatial Structures In contrast to EOFs, TSA assumes
    that there exists a single spatial pattern that manifests itself at all times
    as spatial distributions of soil vegetation atmosphere transfer variables. TSA
    is considered to be a valuable tool for identifying a small number of representative
    sampling points to estimate the grid mean SM. It temporally averages the relative
    differences of the observations at a specific location to the spatial mean of
    all observations at a specific point in time (Vachaud et al., 1985). Each observation
    point is then ranked from dry to wet locations, which describes the spatial pattern.
    Currently, the use of the mean relative difference is the most common way to characterize
    the temporal stability (Vanderlinden et al., 2012). TSA of SM has been reported
    for various spatial scales (Brocca, Melone, Moramarco, & Morbidelli, 2010; Mohanty
    & Skaggs, 2001) from subfield (Abdu et al., 2017; Pachepsky et al., 2005) to regional
    (Brocca, Tullo, et al., 2012, Cho & Choi, 2014; Martínez-Fernández & Ceballos,
    2003) to global scales (Rötzer et al., 2015). The applications of TSA are versatile,
    because the description of relative spatial SM patterns can be used for multiple
    purposes. For example, the site rankings can also be used to reduce the number
    of observation points in an area of interest by keeping the majority of the information
    about the spatiotemporal variability. So-called “catchment average SM monitoring”
    sites were proposed for such locations at the watershed scale, which are able
    to represent the spatial mean SM (Western et al., 1998). Applications of the monitoring
    site reduction or representative areal mean estimation can be found in Martinez
    et al. (2008), Schneider et al. (2008), Thierfelder et al. (2003), Zhao et al.
    (2013), and Zucco et al. (2014). This concept has interesting applications for
    upscaling and downscaling approaches for satellite RS SM validation (Dumedah et
    al., 2013; Molero et al., 2018; Vanderlinden et al., 2012). Rötzer et al. (2014)
    used the TSA method to validate remotely sensed SM products from SMOS and ASCAT
    in a relative way, focusing on the spatial patterns of SM. Also, Bhatti et al.
    (2013) and Cosh et al. (2006) used TSA for satellite SM validation. Zhang et al.
    (2016) analyzed the SM regimes under different land covers using TSA. It was determined
    that vegetation is able to introduce patterns in the spatial distribution of SM
    (Wang et al., 2015). Lin (2006) reported that the high spatial variability of
    SM in a catchment is largely a result of soil type and landform controls rather
    than a random process. In other regions temporally stable SM patterns can be directly
    attributed to relatively high clay contents (Gao et al., 2011). Ran et al. (2017)
    examined the capability of TSA for irrigated agricultural landscapes and indicated
    that irrigation practices reduce the accuracy of the representative sampling error
    at the 1 and 5 km scales. They introduced a stratified TSA that mitigates systematic
    and random errors by combining previous information through stratification, which
    is important for validation of remotely sensed SM. Several SM TSA results focus
    on SHPs (Cosh et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2016). But in hilly areas the contribution
    of topography to spatial structures in SM increases (Brocca et al., 2009). The
    higher the mountains, the larger is the effect of snow distribution on SM patterns
    (Williams et al., 2009). At larger scales, meteorological factors increase their
    impact (Cho & Choi, 2014). In addition to SM, matric potential has also been studied
    with more direct insights on the detailed soil characteristics and controls of
    spatial variability and temporal stability (Yu et al., 2015). 8.3 TC Analysis
    TC analysis was initially developed for ocean wind studies (Stofflen, 1998), but
    it is also used in land surface hydrology (Chen et al., 2017; Yilmaz & Crow, 2014).
    TC relies on a linear error model to reduce the error from an approximated linear
    relationship between different measurements of a geophysical variable. The metrics
    that are typically used to assess the error of each data set are the variance
    of its errors and the correlation with the true SM (Chen et al., 2016; Gruber
    et al., 2016). TC has been applied in the context of calibration, validation,
    bias correction, and error characterization to allow comparisons of diverse data
    records from measurement and estimation techniques such as in situ SM and RS/modeled
    SM. In a study by Chen et al. (2017), TC analysis was used for real validation
    of the SMAP L2 SM product at five core validation sites in the United States and
    it was found that TC can solve the impact of random representativeness errors
    in the point-scale data against footprint-scale SM estimates and provide an unbiased
    estimation of the satellite versus ground correlation metric. TC and other error
    estimation methods only provide an estimation of the total observation error variance
    that is the summation of the autocorrelated and the white observation error. This
    can lead to inaccurate results in SM data analysis at time scales that are shorter
    than the autocorrelation length of the errors. Some advances have been made in
    TC analysis. Dong and Crow (2017) proposed a more generalized TC algorithm, which
    decomposes total errors provided by TC into its autocorrelated and white error
    components, helpful for the ESA CCI SM data set and additionally for hydrology
    and climatology studies that require decomposed error information. Recently, Molero
    et al. (2018) evaluated the spatiotemporal representativeness degree of in situ
    SM within the satellite footprint in Little Washita (U.S.) and Yanco (Australia)
    at timescales from 0.5 to 128 days. They proposed a new approach called Wavelet-based
    Correlation (WCor) and concluded that in contrast to the TC method, which performs
    well at the week and month scales, WCor provides consistent results at all time
    scales and is a robust method for sparse SM networks. An overview of implementations
    of SM TC analysis has been presented in Gruber et al. (2016). 9 Application of
    SM Information and Outlook There are numerous Earth and environmental sciences
    disciplines and applications benefitting from detailed SM information (Figure
    26). For example, knowledge of the SM status and its spatial and temporal variability
    is key for forecasting weather and climate, modeling hydrological processes, predicting
    and monitoring of extreme natural events (e.g., droughts, fires, and dust storms),
    managing water resources, agricultural plant production and productivity, and
    for sustaining ecosystem services (Vereecken et al., 2016). A brief discussion
    of SM information applications follows. Figure 26 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Importance of SM information for various disciplines and applications. 9.1 Weather
    Forecasting and Hydrological Modeling The SM status governs water and energy exchange
    processes between the land surface and the atmosphere. When soils are moist, the
    major portion of the net radiation is utilized for evapotranspiration (i.e., latent
    heat flux), which leads to uplift of water vapor and cloud formation when the
    air temperature falls below the dew point temperature. In dry soils, on the other
    hand, more energy is invested in sensitive heat exchange, which reduces the atmospheric
    vapor pressure and cloud cover. Knowledge of the spatial and temporal SM variability
    aids in constraining the lower boundary conditions in atmospheric simulations.
    SM information can be applied for accuracy improvement of rainfall estimations
    via a bottom-up approach (Koster et al., 2016Koster et al., 2018). Pellarin et
    al. (2008) was among the first to estimate precipitation occurrence from AMSR-E
    surface SM observations in West Africa. Brocca et al. (2014) assumed that if soil
    is considered as a natural rain gauge, then rainfall can be successfully estimated
    from SM observations (i.e., ground based or satellite based) with the SM2RAIN
    model that inverts the soil water balance equation. SM data have been extensively
    used for validation of numerical weather prediction models (Cui et al., 2009;
    Drusch, 2007). Specifically, the impact of SM on high temperature weather and
    heatwave events has been well documented (Fischer et al., 2007; Lau & Kim, 2012;
    Zeng et al., 2014). For instance, Fischer et al. (2007) indicated that during
    a heatwave, the SM is extremely low, which greatly increases the surface temperature
    and substantially reduces the latent heat flux. This confirms the key role of
    SM as a lower boundary in the partitioning of net radiation into latent and sensible
    heat fluxes and the evolution of the heatwave (Miralles et al., 2014). Incorrect
    estimation of SM leads to erroneous simulations of the surface layer evolution
    and hence precipitation and cloud cover forecasts could consequently be affected.
    Collow et al. (2014) examined the impact of SM on precipitation, temperature,
    and humidity and pointed out that accurate initialization of SM in numerical weather
    forecasting models could improve temperature, humidity, and precipitation forecasts
    for the U.S. Great Plains. As already discussed, SM is a key state variable and
    of crucial importance for hydrological modeling. Ground and satellite SM products
    have been connected to hydrological models for prediction of hydrological fluxes.
    However, the effective application of SM information for such modeling efforts
    is still in an infancy state. Vereecken et al. (2015) discussed the value of SM
    information from a global hydrological observatory network for identifying soil
    hydrological processes. Recently, Sadeghi et al. (2019) proposed an analytical
    model based on RE for estimation of the net water flux (precipitation minus evapotranspiration)
    from near-surface SM observations for different soil and vegetation conditions.
    Recent applications of SM data for hydrological modeling have focused on joint
    assimilation of remotely sensed SM products and streamflow data into distributed
    hydrologic models to provide more accurate estimations of SM (Lievens et al.,
    2016 & 2017; Verhoest et al., 2015). Yan and Moradkhani (2016) used a particle
    filter Markov chain Monte Carlo method to assimilate synthetic ASCAT SM retrievals
    and synthetic streamflow data into a fully distributed Sacramento SM Accounting
    model for the Salt River Watershed in Arizona. They revealed that solely assimilating
    outlet streamflow leads to biased SM estimates, whereas joint assimilation of
    streamflow and SM products provides better predictions of surface SM. Lievens
    et al. (2015) coupled SMOS L3 SM data in the Variable Infiltration Capacity land
    surface model using Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation to improve modeled
    SM and streamflow prediction accuracies with high spatial resolution in Australia.
    They showed that assimilation with SMOS SM reduces modeled SM RMSE from 0.058
    to 0.046 cm3/cm3 and enhances correlation from 0.56 to 0.71, which demonstrates
    the merit of SMOS data assimilation for streamflow predictions at large scale.
    Crow et al. (2017) validated the claim of improvement of operational hydrologic
    forecasting through RS SM products and concluded that SMAP L4, which is the product
    of L-band microwave radiometry and a data assimilation technique, provides a SM
    product with the highest hydrologic forecasting skill observed to date for forecasting
    streamflow response to future rainfall events. More recently, Crow et al. (2018)
    used SMAP L4 surface and root-zone SM in combination with remotely sensed precipitation
    and streamflow observations and explored the relationship between prestorm SM
    and rainfall infiltration in the south central United States. They found that
    land surface models generally underestimate the correlation strength between prestorm
    SM and storm runoff. Mahanama et al. (2008) examined the contribution of SM to
    streamflow initialization during subseasonal and seasonal periods and pointed
    out that accurate SM data can contribute between 10% and 60% of the total streamflow
    prediction accuracy that can potentially be obtained for perfect predictions of
    meteorological forcing. Soil profile moisture measurements (10, 20, and 40 cm)
    along with rainfall data as inputs of a generalized regression neural network
    model significantly improved runoff prediction accuracy for the Tiber River in
    Italy (Tayfur et al., 2014). Data from WSMN or spatiotemporal information of SM
    are increasingly being used to validate hydrological models (Fang et al., 2015;
    Koch et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015) and to improve our understanding of hydrological
    processes. Koch et al. (2016) compared the performances of the Hydro-Geosphere
    (HGS) model, the European Hydrological System Model (MIKE SHE), and the ParFlow-CLM
    model for prediction of SM status, discharge, and cumulative water balance components.
    All three models performed well-predicting discharge and the water balance components
    but diverged in their predictions of SM status. A comprehensive review of hydrological
    applications of radar SM retrievals is also provided by Kornelsen and Coulibaly
    (2013). 9.2 Agriculture and Crop Productivity Information about the SM status
    is crucial for agricultural applications to, for example, identify field trafficability
    for heavy farm machinery or to make informed irrigation management decisions.
    Global scale SM data assimilation can improve the representation of agricultural
    drought (Bolten & Crow et al., 2012). While various factors, such as temperature
    stress and nutrient availability, impact the growth and persistence of plants,
    much of the initial focus has been on those crop systems that are water controlled
    (Laio et al., 2001; Ridolfi et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1999). The
    dynamics of SM has a significant impact on plant stress and the adaptability of
    various plant species to particular climate and soil conditions. Monitoring the
    amount of moisture retained in soil is critical for a healthy rhizosphere growth
    environment and aids with crop yield forecasts and irrigation planning. Early
    assessment of SM reserves and monitoring the change in plant available soil water,
    for example, with RS techniques, assist crop growers with risk reduction strategies.
    McNairn et al. (2012) argued that the Canadian RADARSAT-2 satellite can provide
    accurate estimates of field scale SM, which has been further advanced with the
    launch of the ESA Sentinel satellites as part of the Copernicus program. Continuous
    information of SM status can be used in crop growth models in combination with
    data assimilation approaches to provide growers with crop water demand estimates
    for precision irrigation management (Ines et al., 2013). Han et al. (2016) showed
    that the assimilation of continuous SM data from cosmic ray neutron observations
    into the CLM can be used for real-time irrigation scheduling for citrus trees.
    Recently, Andreasen et al. (2017) demonstrated the potential of using mobile cosmic
    ray neutron detection to support precision farming. Louvet et al. (2015) used
    SMOS L3 SM data in conjunction with the TRMM satellite-based precipitation product
    (TMPA) with 3-hr time resolution in West Africa and produced a NRT SM product
    with good accuracy (RMSE 0.030–0.044 cm3/cm3) for potential applications in agriculture
    and for drought detection. Escorihuela et al. (2018) showed that the use of SMOS
    SM in synergy with Sentinel-1 SM provides high spatial resolution SM maps with
    high accuracy (RMSE less than 0.040 cm3/cm3) applicable for the national and global
    desert early warning systems. 9.3 Natural Disasters SM is a key variable for operational
    flood forecasts (Komma et al., 2008; Silvestro & Rebora, 2014; Wanders et al.,
    2014), characterization of landslide occurrence (Baum et al., 2010; Krzeminska
    et al., 2012) and for monitoring drought conditions (Chakrabarti et al., 2014;
    Scaini et al., 2015). 9.3.1 Landslides and SM The ability to predict the spatial
    and temporal occurrence of rainfall-triggered shallow landslides is of crucial
    importance for prevention of human life and property losses. SM data are applied
    in conjunction with precipitation forcing as inputs for landslide models to obtain
    real-time assessment and forecasting of landslide occurrence (Posner & Georgakakos,
    2015; Ray & Jacobs, 2007). SM plays a critical role for slope stability, that
    is, as SM increases, slope stability decreases. Landslides commonly occur when
    SM is high. As soil saturation increases the pore water pressure increases and
    once the pressure exceeds the cohesive soil strengths, landslides are triggered.
    Coe et al. (2003) demonstrated that there is a positive correlation between SM
    content and landslide velocity, with velocities being highest during high SM conditions.
    Remotely sensed SM data have been used to forecast landslides. For example, Brocca,
    Ponziani, et al. (2012) used the SWI provided by the ASCAT satellite in conjunction
    with the antecedent precipitation index (API) to improve the accuracy of landslide
    forecasting models in central Italy. Ray et al. (2010) used AMSR-E SM products
    as input information for a dynamic physically based slope stability model to generate
    landslide susceptibility maps. SM observations have been also used in landslide
    prediction models. Recently, Segoni et al. (2018) demonstrated that SM threshold
    values can be defined to better predict landslides and improve the performance
    of regional scale landslide early warning systems in Italy. 9.3.2 Floods and SM
    Measurement and mapping of SM can potentially improve flood forecasting because
    initial SM conditions impact timing of flood initiation and peak runoff during
    storm events. The initial water content in conjunction with the infiltration capacity
    determines how much precipitation water can be added to the soil porous system
    before surface runoff (i.e., overland flow) and potential flooding occur. Silvestro
    and Rebora (2014) pointed out that the initial SM conditions substantially influence
    flood forecasting. They argued that the variability of flood forecasts is not
    constant and depends on the type and characteristics of the event and the initial
    SM conditions. Laiolo et al. (2016) used SM and LST to update the state variables
    of a physically based, distributed, and continuous hydrological model. They investigated
    the impact of SM and LST on the hydrological cycle and showed a general reduction
    of model discharge prediction errors by as much as 10%. Pauwels et al. (2001)
    assimilated European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS-1 and ERS-2 surface SM data
    into the TOPMODEL based Land-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme, which led to 20–50% reduction
    of discharge prediction errors for the Zwalm catchment in Belgium. Han et al.
    (2012) demonstrated the potential for improved streamflow predictions through
    assimilation of in situ near-surface SM with the Soil Water Assessment Tools model.
    The assimilation significantly reduced RMSE values for streamflow predictions.
    Recently, high spatial and moderate temporal resolution SM from the ESA Sentinel-1
    satellite has been assimilated into hydrological models for improving continuous
    streamflow simulations and enhancing flash flood predictions for civil protection
    applications in Italy (Cenci et al., 2017). Remotely sensed SM observations have
    improved NRT flood forecasts for large catchments. Tekeli and Fouli (2017) argued
    that incorporating antecedent SM information with a CDF based threshold value
    derived from AMSR-E products can significantly reduce false flood warnings in
    Saudi Arabia. Wanders et al. (2014) evaluated the added value of assimilated remotely
    sensed SM for the European Flood Awareness System and its potential to improve
    the timing and height prediction of the flood peak and low flows. They found that
    when remotely sensed SM data were used, the timing errors of the flood predictions
    significantly decreased, especially for shorter lead times. In addition, imminent
    floods can be forecasted more precisely. Such capabilities can improve the response
    time of government agencies to provide emergency and disaster relief. An excellent
    example is the major flood events throughout North and South Carolina on 5 October
    2015, where SM data from SMAP were able to clearly show areas of potential flooding
    and the extent of flooding prior to the event (see Figure 27). Figure 27 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Surface soil moisture in North and South Carolina
    retrieved from the Soil Moisture Active Passive level-4 product on 2 September
    2015 (before flooding, left) and on 5 October 2015 (after flooding, right). Large
    parts of North and South Carolina (red arrows) appear dark blue, representing
    the impact of heavy localized rains and flooding. Regions in darker blue indicate
    areas with saturated soil conditions and possibly standing water. Large-scale
    flooding was experienced all over South Carolina from 1 to 5 October 2015. 9.3.3
    Drought and SM Another increasingly important application of remotely sensed SM
    information is to monitor global drought conditions. There are four main drought
    categories that include meteorological, agricultural or agro-ecological, hydrological,
    and socioeconomic droughts (Dracup et al., 1980; Wilhite & Glantz, 1985). Meteorological
    drought is defined based on the number of days with precipitation below a specific
    threshold. Hydrological drought is commonly associated with effects of precipitation
    shortfalls on surface or subsurface water resources. The frequency and severity
    of hydrological drought are often defined for the watershed or basin scales. The
    definition of agricultural drought is based on soil water deficiency and its effect
    on crop production, that is, when evapotranspirative losses exceed the plant available
    SM content. Finally, socioeconomic drought occurs when the overall water demand
    exceeds supply. SM is a direct determinant of agricultural drought conditions
    that are commonly preceded by meteorological drought and succeeded by hydrological
    drought. Despite the obvious importance of SM, classical drought monitoring indices
    such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index neglect SM. Several in situ SM-based
    drought indicators have been recommended for agricultural drought monitoring,
    including the SM index (Sridhar et al., 2008), soil water deficit (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2013), and plant available water (PAW; McPherson et al., 2007). These
    indices identify drought conditions based on water deficit and plant available
    soil water. A major benefit of SM-based drought indices when compared to precipitation-based
    indices is that SM not only characterizes drought events but also responds to
    both precipitation and evapotranspiration processes. Detailed discussions about
    SM drought indices are provided in Ochsner et al. (2013) and Torres et al. (2013).
    More recently, several studies have attempted to improve potential applicability
    of SM indices for drought monitoring. For example, Cammalleri et al. (2016) proposed
    a novel Drought Severity Index for detecting main drought events and estimating
    both the extent and magnitude of drought. The index is based on a multiplicative
    combination of the observed soil water deficit intensity and on the rarity of
    the event compared with that of the site history (frequency of drought), in order
    to obtain a single measure of the severity of a specific soil water status in
    terms of drought. The DSI varies between 0 (no drought) and 1 (extreme drought),
    where the values between 0 and 1 can represent slight, moderate, and severe drought
    conditions. The applicability of the DSI has been evaluated for vegetated lands
    in Europe for the time period from 1995 to 2012, yielding better results for a
    broad range of conditions than commonly applied drought indices (Cammalleri et
    al., 2016). Sohrabi et al. (2015) proposed a new SM drought index (SODI) that
    considers temporal variations in precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration,
    run-off and SM to determine onset, continuation, and cessation of droughts. The
    SODI is based on available water capacity and SM deviation from estimated field
    capacity (θ FC). This time-dependent drought index combines advantages of other
    drought indices by characterizing soil water retention processes and determining
    dry and wet conditions in subsequent time steps. The SODI yielded better results
    for quantifying severe droughts associated with climate variability than precipitation-based
    indices. The advantage of SODI is that the index is, in fact, a time-dependent
    and continuous index that characterizes SM dynamics during time transitions from
    the current time step to the next. Although SM is a key indicator for agricultural
    drought assessment, less attention has been paid to the application of in situ
    SM networks for systematic drought monitoring. This may be due to the fact that
    these networks commonly measure absolute values of SM and do not provide SM in
    terms of PAW. Within this context, the Oklahoma Mesonet (McPherson et al., 2007)
    is an exception, providing average daily PAW maps at three different soil depths
    (i.e., 10, 40 and 80 cm), which are publicly available from www.mesonet.org. It
    should be noted that the Mesonet does not directly measure SM; instead, a heat
    pulse measurement is used to infer soil matric potential, which is related to
    SM using water retention calibration data. Recently, Ford et al. (2015) used the
    in situ SM data from 45 Mesonet stations for early drought warning in Oklahoma
    and concluded that Mesonet observations are an important source of information
    for early warning of flash drought events in the Southern Great Plains of the
    United States. SM-based drought indices have been also developed based on remotely
    sensed information (Babaeian et al., 2018; Scaini et al., 2015) and land surface
    models (Mo & Lettenmaier, 2014). Because the number of ground SM stations and
    networks is limited (see section 27), remotely sensed SM information has great
    potential for continuous SM and drought monitoring. Chakrabarti et al. (2014)
    demonstrated that assimilation of downscaled (km) SMOS SM estimates into the decision
    support system for the agro-technology transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model can
    be used to analyze the impact of agricultural drought on crop yields. Recently,
    Babaeian et al. (2018) analyzed optical satellite SM retrievals for a range of
    climate, land cover and soil conditions for potential monitoring of agricultural
    drought in the United States. They compared the OPTRAM-based Soil Water Deficit
    Index with the widely applied Crop Moisture Index (CMI) and saw similar patterns
    between these two indices and concluded that OPTRAM-based Soil Water Deficit Index
    can potentially be applied for agricultural drought monitoring. However, to date
    there are no operational agricultural drought monitoring systems that rely on
    remotely sensed SM. Recently, a new SMOS L3 SM-based drought index product has
    been introduced by Al Bitar et al. (2013) for global monitoring of drought and
    is available from ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/Land_products. Real-time drought monitoring
    systems are crucial for early warning and adaptive management of negative environmental
    drought impacts. A real-time monitoring system, the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM),
    has been established by the National Drought Mitigation Center and is accessible
    via www.droughtmonitor.unl.edu (Figure 28, top). The USDM depicts drought integrated
    across all time scales and differentiates between agricultural and hydrological
    impacts. It is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic, and soil conditions
    as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around
    the United States. There is a substantial correspondence between the USDM map
    and SM percentile map obtained from the CLM, which simulates surface water for
    the continental United States (Figure 28, bottom). SMAP SM is a potential input
    data source used by the U.S. Drought Monitor (Eswar et al., 2018). Figure 28 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint U.S. Drought Monitor map for 20 December 2016 (top)

    10 Summary State-of-the-art SM measurement, monitoring, and modeling capabilities
    were reviewed with the aim of extending the use of increasingly available RS data
    and to identify critical future research needs and directions. The latest ground,
    proximal, and satellite RS techniques; databases; and modeling approaches that
    have been developed in recent years to characterize surface, near-surface and
    root-zone SM for a wide range of spatial and temporal resolutions have been discussed.
    The main conclusions, challenges, and opportunities can be summarized as follows:
    SM networks and spatiotemporal SM data are increasingly applied to validate satellite
    RS observations. Information from these networks is also utilized to characterize
    spatial SM dynamics, validate hydrological models, identify trends in the hydrological
    cycle, identify needs yet to be developed, and improve our understanding of hydrological
    processes. The problem with validation tests of coarse-scale SM products are mainly
    due to disconnects between the sensing depth of ground and remote sensors and
    the scaling disparity (support or measurement volume) between in situ measurements
    and satellite sensor resolution. Antecedent and precise calibration of in situ
    sensors is crucial for reliable validation of remotely sensed SM estimates. Validation
    methods for these tests need to be further refined and standardized with due accounting
    for these scale mismatches that affect reliable validation. Along with the advancement
    of more reliable sensors and data acquisition systems, the number of in situ SM
    networks continues to increase. Because most of these networks have evolved without
    international standardization, they present challenges to the validation of satellite-based
    SM estimation and are not always representative of the larger surrounding area.
    The utilization of RS data within the optical and thermal bands with shallow measurement
    depth for surface and near-surface SM retrieval is sometimes restricted by atmospheric
    conditions (clouds and water vapor), causing uncertainty in relating soil reflectance/temperature
    to SM. On the other hand, most of the methods that use spectral/thermal data are,
    in principal, empirical models, which suffer from the associated limitations of
    site specificity. Advances are needed for deriving physically based models for
    SM retrieval from high spatial/temporal resolution optical/thermal RS data. The
    applicability of RS techniques reviewed in this paper is dependent on the scale
    (spatial and temporal) of interest and availability of data; hence, no single
    method can be suggested as a universal solution. While the combined use of active
    and passive microwave products may improve the resulting SM retrieval accuracy,
    it certainly improves the spatial resolution. Proximal RS methods and their combinations
    can potentially be used for mapping and monitoring SM variability at intermediate
    scales as well as for validating microwave RS SM products using field surveys.
    Improving, testing, and integrating new monitoring techniques able to provide
    SM measurements at intermediate scales like COSMOS, GPS, and EMI are potential
    new topics for future research. Because of the loss of the SMAP radar, there is
    a need for planning of a follow-on mission for providing SM with higher spatiotemporal
    resolution.SM spatial variability affects the accuracy of SM estimations from
    satellite remote sensors. Modeling and simulating SM spatial variability are important
    to improve validation of coarse-scale SM products. SM variability is associated
    not only with soil properties but also with the distribution and intensity of
    rainfall across the land surface and the heterogeneity of the vegetation cover.
    Within this context, SM data may be used for estimating rainfall by considering
    the soil as a natural rain gauge. SM estimates can also be integrated into hydrological
    models to estimate total water losses and gains, accounting for factors such as
    runoff, drainage, and ground-water recharge. SM is a key indicator for agricultural
    drought assessment, but little attention has been paid to the application of in
    situ networks and RS products for systematic drought monitoring. This may be due
    to the fact that these networks and products only measure absolute values of SM
    and do not provide SM in terms of PAW, which is a real representation of plant
    water stress. In this context, integration of remotely sensed SM products with
    SHPs provides unique opportunities to determine PAW and enhance drought monitoring.
    Integration of remotely sensed SM products and soil profile data (PAW) will provide
    invaluable information for better characterizing and monitoring of agricultural
    drought. Information about root-zone SM is critical for crop producers as it aids
    with irrigation and drought management in dryland agricultural. An increase in
    spatial and temporal resolution of SM satellite data can be expected in future,
    which will provide new opportunities for precision management of individual fields.
    This will be beneficial where installation of SM sensors and UAV observations
    are not feasible. It is necessary to improve SM retrieval accuracy over densely
    vegetated regions through development of new algorithms that precisely incorporate
    vegetation optical depth. A remaining grand RS challenge is the accurate estimation
    of root-zone SM from the SM content within the first few centimeters of the soil
    profile. The most commonly applied technique for retrieving root-zone SM from
    satellite RS is assimilation of near-surface SM measurements into, for example,
    land surface or crop growth models. Further information such as groundwater table
    depth, highly spatially resolved soil data, and remotely sensed crop information
    should be considered for constraining root-zone SM estimates. In addition, improved
    descriptions of subsurface processes that control the status of root-zone SM are
    necessary to remove model prediction biases and to further decrease estimation
    uncertainty. Acknowledgment We acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation

    of cosmic rays in thin air, the lateral footprint extent is inversely proportional
    to the atmospheric (vapor) pressure and is up to 300 m in diameter, while the
    penetration depth strongly depends on the SM content and ranges from 15 cm in
    wet soils to approximately 70 cm in dry soils (Franz et al., 2012; Zreda et al.,
    2008). Figure 5 shows simulations with the Ultra Rapid Adaptable Neutron-Only
    Simulation (URANOS) code that was tailored by Köhli et al. (2015) to simulate
    neutron transport for environmental science applications. The figure illustrates
    the simulated interactions of cosmic-ray neutrons in the ground (black dots),
    the estimated footprint radius and penetration depth within which 86% of the detected
    neutrons originated, and the respective histograms over distance and depth. The
    shown values are exemplary, while the exact CRNP footprint volume and sensitivity
    depend on soil moisture, bulk density, and atmospheric conditions and are still
    an active area of research. At present, most research is being conducted to interpret
    the measured signals, as the sensors measure not only SM but also the presence
    of water in vegetation, subsurface biomass and organic matter, surface water,
    atmospheric vapor, and clay lattices water (Baatz et al., 2015, Andreasen et al.,

    of remotely sensed albedo and vegetation fraction on simulation of urban climate
    in WRF-urban canopy model: A case study of the urban heat island in Los Angeles

    102 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Modeling the climate of urban areas is of
    interest for studying urban heat islands (UHIs). Reliable assessment of the primary
    causes of UHIs and the efficacy of various heat mitigation strategies requires
    accurate prediction of urban temperatures and realistic representation of land
    surface physical characteristics in models. In this study, we expand the capabilities
    of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by implementing high-resolution,
    real-time satellite observations of green vegetation fraction (GVF) and albedo.
    Satellite-based GVF and albedo replace constant values that are assumed for urban
    pixels in the default version of WRF. Simulations of urban meteorology in Los
    Angeles using the improved model show marked improvements relative to the default
    model. The largest improvements are for nocturnal air temperatures, with a reduction
    in root-mean-square deviation between simulations and observations from 3.8 to
    1.9°C. Utilizing the improved model, we quantify relationships between surface
    and 2 m air temperatures versus urban fraction, GVF, albedo, distance from the
    ocean, and elevation. Distance from the ocean is found to be the main contributor
    to variations in temperatures around Los Angeles. After conditionally sampling
    pixels to minimize the influence of distance from the ocean and elevation, we
    find that variations in GVF and urban fraction are responsible for up to 58 and
    27% of the variance in temperatures. The satellite-supported meteorological modeling
    framework reported here can be used for studying UHIs in other cities and can
    serve as a foundation for testing the efficacy of various heat mitigation strategies.
    Key Points Satellite-supported WRF-UCM is developed using MODIS observed GVF and
    albedo Satellite observations are implemented over both urban and vegetated pixels
    Urban heat island in Los Angeles is related to surface characteristics 1 Introduction
    Urban areas cover a small fraction of Earth''s surface. However, roughly 54% of
    the global population currently lives in urban areas, and this number is expected
    to reach 66% by 2050 [United Nations, 2014]. Urbanization impacts the exchange
    of energy, water, and momentum between the land surface and atmosphere at local
    to regional scales. This occurs through changes in land surface physical characteristics
    (henceforth referred to as “surface physical characteristics”) such as albedo,
    emissivity, vegetation fraction, and roughness, which control land-atmosphere
    interactions. Numerical modeling has been utilized to shed light on the relative
    importance of various surface physical characteristics in dictating land-atmosphere
    coupling [Wetzel and Chang, 1988; Molders, 2001; Vahmani and Hogue, 2014a]. Wetzel
    and Chang [1988] evaluated the significance of surface physical characteristics
    on simulating regional evapotranspiration (ET) using an ET model coupled with
    a one-dimensional atmospheric boundary layer model. They highlighted the importance
    of leaf area index (LAI), fractional green vegetation cover, and roughness length
    for accurately predicting ET. Uncertainty analysis conducted by Molders [2001]
    suggested that realistic representation of plant and soil parameters (i.e., albedo,
    evaporative conductivity, roughness length, soil volumetric heat capacity, field
    capacity, capillarity, and emissivity) should be prioritized in mesoscale modeling.
    Vahmani and Hogue [2014a] investigated the relative importance of surface physical
    characteristics for accurately predicting ET in the Noah land model coupled to
    an urban canopy model (Noah-UCM). They found that green vegetation fraction (GVF)
    plays the most significant role in reproducing observations of ET. These studies
    confirm that realistic domain-specific information on surface physical characteristics
    is critical for accurately modeling land-atmosphere interactions in numerical
    weather prediction models, over both urban and natural surfaces. However, most
    mesoscale modeling frameworks, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
    model, rely on either land cover-dependent lookup tables or outdated low-resolution
    climatological data sets to define these surface physical characteristics. Further,
    the models assume constant values for some surface physical characteristics over
    urban areas and therefore do not take into account the high-resolution variability
    that can be found in these regions. With a quasi-continuous and comprehensive
    mapping of Earth, satellite remote sensing is a unique data source for characterizing
    the land surface. These data have been used to derive model inputs that describe
    land surface characteristics for numerical weather and climate simulations [Crawford
    et al., 2001; de Foy et al., 2006; Meng et al., 2009]. However, there are relatively
    few studies that apply satellite observations to describe urban surface characteristics
    in modeling urban climate. A few studies have employed satellite observations
    to update outdated maps of land cover type that are used by default as inputs
    to mesoscale models [Cheng and Byun, 2008; Cheng et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014].
    When compared to observations, these studies reported improved model prediction
    of urban meteorology including boundary layer characteristics, wind patterns,
    and air temperatures. Other studies have utilized remotely sensed observations
    that represent morphological data over urban areas [Taha, 2008a, 2008b; Salamanca
    et al., 2011]. These data sets improve representation of urban canopy parameters
    (e.g., building height, height-to-width ratio, urban fraction, and roughness length)
    in mesoscale models such as the urbanized meteorological model (uMM5) and WRF.
    Other studies have used remote sensing for deriving roof albedos for use in WRF
    [Ban-Weiss et al., 2015a, 2015b]. Limited past research has taken advantage of
    satellite observations to directly improve representation of surface physical
    characteristics (as opposed to just land cover type) and associated parameters
    over highly heterogeneous and complex urban surfaces in mesoscale meteorological
    models [Vahmani and Hogue, 2014a; Li et al., 2014]. Vahmani and Hogue [2014a]
    utilized fused Landsat-MODIS observations over a small region of Los Angeles to
    improve the representation of GVF, impervious surface area, albedo, LAI, and emissivity
    in the offline version of Noah-UCM. Simulated ET was nearer to ground observations
    after implementing the remotely sensed surface physical characteristics in the
    model. Li et al. [2014] attempted to improve WRF by implementing MODIS-based GVF
    and LAI as well as remotely sensed land cover maps for the Pearl River Delta region
    of China. Their simulations were nearer to observations, relative to the default
    model, when the satellite-derived land surface physical characteristics were used
    as inputs to WRF. The urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon in which urban areas
    are hotter than rural surroundings [Manley, 1958], potentially resulting in human
    discomfort and increased building energy consumption [Lee and Park, 2008; Susca
    et al., 2011; Loughner et al., 2012]. Given that the UHI is one of the most prominent
    phenomena in urban climate [Oke, 1982; Arnfield, 2003], its accurate simulation
    by mesoscale models applied over urban areas is important. The UHI is generally
    understood as being caused by a shift in the surface energy partitioning toward
    lower latent heat flux and higher sensible heat flux. This is mainly attributed
    to the fact that in urban areas, vegetation and evaporating soil surfaces are
    replaced by impervious surfaces such as asphalt concrete with high heat storage
    capacity and often distinctly low albedo [Oke, 1982; Grimmond, 2007]. The UHI
    develops at the surface and through the lower atmosphere, from the urban canopy
    layer to the boundary layer, and can be assessed using land surface or air temperatures
    [Rao, 1972; Oke, 1976; Voogt and Oke, 2003]. The air temperature UHI is in many
    locations a nocturnal phenomenon [Oke, 1982], whereas the surface temperature
    UHI is usually greatest during the day [Roth et al., 1989], and is more easily
    related to surface characteristics [Owen et al., 1998; Voogt and Oke, 2003; Nichol
    and Wong, 2005]. Recent research has shown that the efficiency with which convective
    heat is transferred from the surface to the boundary layer also plays an important
    role in determining UHI intensity [Zhao et al., 2014]. Assessment of the UHI requires
    accurately representing surface or near-surface air temperatures within and surrounding
    an urban region. The first goal of this study is to investigate the extent to
    which prediction of spatial and temporal variation in these temperatures can be
    improved in a mesoscale meteorological model (WRF-UCM) by enhancing the representation
    of land surface physical characteristics within and surrounding a city. This enhancement
    is implemented using high-resolution and real-time gridded MODIS-based observations
    to derive important land surface physical characteristics, including GVF and albedo.
    To enable the use of satellite-based GVF and albedo, the model was modified since
    the default version of WRF-UCM assumes predefined and unvarying GVF and albedo
    values for the pervious portion of urban grid cells. This change allows for including
    heterogeneity of real-time domain-specific GVF and albedo over urban areas. The
    role of these model enhancements in improving the simulation of urban heat islands
    is then assessed by comparing to ground and satellite observations. GVF and albedo
    are selected in the current study for three main reasons. First, accurate representation
    of GVF and albedo within meteorological models is critical for realistic simulation
    of local and regional meteorology over complex heterogeneous landscapes [Wetzel
    and Chang, 1988; Molders, 2001; Loridan et al., 2010; Vahmani and Hogue, 2014a].
    Second, GVF and albedo are two physical characteristics of the land surface that
    get significantly altered via urbanization. In particular, loss of green vegetation
    in urban areas is one of the main contributors to the UHI. Third, the majority
    of UHI mitigation strategies involve urban vegetation and solar reflective cool
    roofs and pavements [Rosenfeld et al., 1995; Taha et al., 1999; Akbari et al.,
    2001; Taha, 2013]. These strategies modify GVF and/or albedo of urban surfaces,
    yet modeling efforts to predict the meteorological and climate impacts of these
    strategies often rely on predefined default model values and/or outdated climatological
    data to describe these surface physical characteristics for current time. Thus,
    realistic representation of these surface characteristics (i.e., albedo and GVF)
    in mesoscale modeling will lead to more accurate simulation of current urban climate
    and subsequently better estimates of expected changes induced by these strategies.
    The second goal of this study is to investigate the role of land cover variability
    on determining the urban heat island within the Los Angeles region. Previous studies
    have reported that the nature of the UHI in Los Angeles is uniquely complex due
    to surrounding mountainous and coastal regions [Roth et al., 1989; Witiw and LaDochy,
    2008]. Furthering understanding of the UHI in Los Angeles necessitates adding
    to the current capabilities of WRF to account for high-resolution spatial variability
    in urban land surface characteristics and subsequent impacts on the surface energy
    balance and temperatures. In section 2, we describe the current default versions
    of WRF, the enhancements we made to address our research goals, and the simulations
    carried out. In sections 11, 12, 12, 13, 15, we report the differences between
    the current default versions of WRF versus our enhanced version. In section 16,
    we utilize the enhanced model to characterize the UHI in Los Angeles. To do so,
    we examine spatial and temporal variations in surface and air temperatures, and
    their relationships to urban surface characteristics including GVF, albedo, elevation,
    distance from ocean, and urban intensity. In this regard, this study not only
    sheds light on the complex relationships between temperatures and surface characteristics
    of Los Angeles but also sets the stage for further investigation on UHI mitigation
    strategies. 2 Methods and Data 2.1 WRF-UCM Model In the current study, the WRF
    version 3.6.1 [Skamarock et al., 2008; Skamarock and Klemp, 2008] is used. WRF
    is a fully compressible, nonhydrostatic, mesoscale numerical weather prediction
    model that has been used for a variety of applications in urban environments (see
    Chen et al. [2011] for a review). WRF is coupled to the Noah land surface model
    (LSM), which includes an urban canopy model that allows for sophisticated representation
    of land-atmosphere coupling in urban areas. A description of the employed initial
    conditions, boundary conditions, spatial domain, and physics parameterizations
    is presented below. In the current study, WRF is initialized and forced at its
    lateral boundaries with the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) data set
    [Mesinger et al., 2006]. All simulations are conducted from 6 July, 1900 UTC (12:00 P.M.
    local standard time) to 11 July 0700 UTC (12:00 A.M. local standard time), 2012,
    which represents an episode with clear skies and low wind speeds. The dominant
    winds in Los Angeles are onshore. For the selected timeframe, average wind speeds
    are 4.7 m s−1 at 2:00 P.M. and 1.4 m s−1 at 10:00 P.M. Air temperature variations
    are limited to a range of 19.3–34.9°C. The first 12 simulated hours are discarded
    as model spin-up. The simulations are performed over three (two-way) nested grids,
    centered over the Los Angeles metropolitan area, with horizontal grid resolutions
    of 18 km, 6 km, and 2 km, respectively (Figure 1). The largest domain (d01) covers
    most of the western U.S. and northern Mexico, the middle domain (d02) encompasses
    southern California, and the innermost domain (d03) covers the Los Angeles metropolitan
    area. The three domains have 71 × 99, 91 × 103, and 130 × 142 (east–west × north–south)
    grid cells, respectively. Each domain uses 30 layers in the vertical. Figure 1
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Geographical representation of the three nested
    WRF domains with 18, 6, and 2 km resolution for d1, d2, and d3, respectively.
    Land cover classifications are presented in each map. Over the innermost domain
    (d3), white circles are locations of the CIMIS and NCDC observation sites. The
    physical parameterization schemes used in the current study include the Monin-Obukhov
    scheme for the model surface layer, the Yonsei University (YSU) scheme [Hong et
    al., 2006] for the planetary boundary layer (PBL), the Kain-Fritsch cumulus scheme
    [Kain, 2004], the Lin scheme for microphysics [Lin et al., 1983], the Rapid Radiative
    Transfer Model [Mlawer et al., 1997] for longwave radiation, and the Dudhia scheme
    [Dudhia, 1989] for shortwave radiation. It should be noted that the cumulus parameterization
    is used only in domains 1 and 2. The atmosphere model is coupled to the Noah LSM
    [Chen and Dudhia, 2001] including the single-layer UCM [Kusaka and Kimura, 2004].
    The UCM assumes infinitely long street canyons and takes into account the three-dimensional
    nature of urban surfaces including roof, wall, and road. This model also accounts
    for shadowing, reflections, and trapping of radiation in the urban canyon. Anthropogenic
    heat is not accounted for in our simulations. The UCM is employed for grid cells
    in which the dominant land cover type is one of three urban categories: low-intensity
    residential, high-intensity residential, and industrial/commercial, each of which
    has different assumed surface physical characteristics that by default are obtained
    from a predefined urban parameter table [Chen et al., 2011]. Land cover/land use
    is based on the National Land Cover Data (NLCD) for 2006, which has a spatial
    resolution of 30 m [Fry et al., 2011]. NLCD includes three urban types, which
    correspond to the three aforementioned urban categories in WRF/UCM. By default,
    the model assumes urban fractions of 50%, 90%, and 95% for low-intensity residential,
    high-intensity residential, and industrial/commercial, respectively. Instead of
    this default, we develop an independent impervious surface input data set based
    on the NLCD impervious surface data [Wickham et al., 2013], eliminating the need
    to assume fixed urban fraction values for each urban category. For each urban
    cell, this data set describes the fraction of the urban cell that is impervious
    (see section 5 for more details). Furthermore, we use the National Urban Database
    and Access Portal Tool (NUDAPT) [Ching et al., 2009] to define gridded and domain-specific
    urban morphological parameters including plan area fraction, mean building height,
    standard deviation of building height, area weighted mean building height, building
    surface to plan area ratio, and frontal area index. Li and Bou-Zeid [2014] reported
    that estimation of surface temperatures in urban grid cells in the default version
    of Noah-UCM is flawed. The problem is related to the grid cell level turbulent
    transfer coefficient, which is inaccurately calculated using the momentum and
    thermal roughness lengths of the pervious portion of urban grid cells only. This
    leads to significant biases in simulated impervious surface temperatures calculated
    by the UCM. In the current study, the model code for computing land surface temperatures
    in urban cells was revised based on canyon temperature, roof surface temperature,
    and roof fraction [see Li and Bou-Zeid, 2014]. 2.2 Study Domain and Ground-Based
    Observations The focus of the current study is on the Los Angeles metropolitan
    region (Figure 1). The surrounding areas, as identified by the NLCD data set for
    2006, include a variety of land cover types (e.g., water, barren land, forest,
    shrub land, and planted/cultivated land). The primary mountain ranges in the study
    domain are the Santa Monica and San Gabriel Mountains, located in the western
    and northern regions of the Los Angeles area, respectively. Farther away from
    the city, the eastern San Bernardino Mountains and southeastern San Jacinto Mountains
    are also captured in the current study domain. The valleys are generally the populated
    and extensively developed areas, making Los Angeles the second largest metropolitan
    area in the United States, currently home to 13 million residents (U.S. Census
    Bureau, 2013, http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2013/CBSA-EST2013-alldata.htm).
    The city is one of the most highly urbanized and least green cities in the country
    [McPherson et al., 2008]. We use hourly ground-based observations from 12 California
    Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) and 4 National Climatic Data
    Center (NCDC) stations to evaluate the simulations performed in this research.
    The location of each station is shown in Figure 1. The NCDC stations, which use
    Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS), are located at small airports within
    the Los Angeles metropolitan area in “large low-rise” climate zone, as defined
    by Stewart and Oke [2012]. These stations report hourly meteorological conditions
    at a standard reference height of 2 m. The regional CIMIS stations used in this
    study are mostly located in residential areas within “open low-rise” and “sparsely
    built” climate zone regions [Stewart and Oke, 2012]. CIMIS stations provide hourly
    weather data including 2 m air temperature. Using observed meteorological fields
    over a well-watered soil, hourly reference ET (ET0) is also estimated for each
    site (http://wwwcimis.water.ca.gov/cimis). In the current study, ET0 is converted
    to urban landscape ET employing an approached introduced by California Department
    of Water Resources [2000], and a landscape coefficient, which is calculated using
    vegetation species, density, and microclimate factors. Landscapes in the current
    study domain are assumed to have “moderate” water needs (average species factor = 0.50)
    and “average” density and microclimate factors (density and microclimate factors = 1).
    Based on these factors, a landscape coefficient of 0.50 (landscape coefficient = species
    factor × density factor × microclimate factor) is used to estimate the landscape
    ET values from the 12 CIMIS stations in the study area (Figure 1). 2.3 Satellite
    Observations Satellite observations are retrieved from MODIS to produce high-resolution
    and domain-specific GVF and albedo inputs for WRF-UCM. MODIS images are acquired
    from the U.S. Geological Survey National Center for Earth Resource Observations
    and Science website available at http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov. The corresponding
    MODIS vegetation indices (MOD13A3) and reflectance (MCD43A4) products are gathered
    for the year 2012 and are used as reference data to compute spatially resolved
    monthly means of GVF and albedo, respectively. It should be noted that the accuracies
    of MODIS vegetation index and reflectance products are 0.025 and less than 5%,
    respectively [http://landval.gsfc.nasa.gov]. Satellite observations from MODIS
    are also used to derive land surface temperatures for evaluating the simulations.
    We utilize MOD11A1 and MYD11A1 (version 5, level 3) products that provide daily
    land surface temperatures at a spatial resolution of 1 km and overpass times of
    11:00 A.M. and 10:00 P.M. local time. The satellite observations used in the current
    study are regridded to the WRF coordinate system and resampled to the same spatial
    resolution (2 km). A quality control mask is also extracted and utilized to remove
    cloudy and low-quality pixels. 2.3.1 Green Vegetation Fraction GVF is a key parameter
    within WRF and is defined as the fraction of the grid cell for which midday downward
    solar insolation is intercepted by a photosynthetically active green canopy. Thus,
    GVF acts as a weighting coefficient in partitioning total evaporation into direct
    evaporation from bare soil and canopy evapotranspiration [Chen and Dudhia, 2001].
    In the Noah LSM, seasonal variation in GVF also defines seasonal variation in
    other surface physical characteristics, namely, albedo, LAI, emissivity, and roughness
    length. This is accomplished through a GVF-based factor, which is used to scale
    the parameter values within predefined ranges. Despite the important role of GVF
    in land-atmosphere coupling in the model [Wetzel and Chang, 1988; Vahmani and
    Hogue, 2014a], WRF by default uses monthly varying five-year mean (1985–1990)
    green vegetation data observed by the advanced very high resolution radiometer
    (AVHRR) [Gutman and Ignatov, 1998]. This data set hereafter is referred to as
    AVHRR. It is noteworthy that the WRF version 3.6 also allows for using a relatively
    new global vegetation fraction data set based on MODIS climatological observations
    from 2001 to 2010, hereafter referred to as MODIS. In the current study, we replace
    these climatological GVF maps with high-resolution and real-time MODIS-based GVF
    maps, hereafter called Improved MODIS. In the next two sections, we present a
    detailed description of our implementation of satellite-based GVF in WRF-UCM.
    2.3.1.1 Non-urban Grid Cells In the current study, the monthly normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) product (MOD13A3) acquired by MODIS is used to generate
    realistic and real-time monthly maps of GVF over the study domain. We use an approach
    introduced by Gutman and Ignatov [1998] which calculates GVF using equation (1),
    (1) where GVFpixel is the pixel level GVF and NDVI0 and NDVI∞ are constant NDVI
    values calculated using pixels with bare soil and dense vegetation in the current
    study domain, respectively. For non-urban areas, the estimated GVF values are
    directly incorporated to the Noah LSM framework within WRF. The implementation
    of GVF in urban grid cells is described in the next section. 2.3.1.2 Urban Grid
    Cells As previously mentioned, urban grid cells in the WRF modeling framework
    are those whose dominant land use category is one of the three urban types: low-intensity
    residential, high-intensity residential, and industrial/commercial. Urban cells
    are divided into pervious and impervious parts using the aforementioned urban
    fraction parameter. The Noah LSM then simulates surface-atmosphere interactions
    for the pervious portion of the grid cell, and the UCM simulates those for the
    impervious portions. The current default version of WRF-UCM uses predefined values
    for some land surface characteristics for the pervious part of urban grid cells.
    For example, albedo and emissivity are assumed to be 0.2 and 0.98, respectively.
    In addition, GVF values for the pervious part of urban grid cells correspond to
    that of the “natural” vegetation type, which translates to an unvarying GVF of
    0.8 for all urban grid cells. In the current study, however, we modified the Noah-UCM
    code to use spatially varying GVF derived using satellite observations for both
    urban and non-urban grid cells. Another complexity regarding GVF relates to different
    interpretations of GVF values as used by the model versus quantified by the observations.
    The Noah LSM, by default, defines GVF as the fraction of the pervious portion
    of the grid cell that is vegetated (i.e., pervious-level GVF). However, observed
    GVF data sets represent the fraction of the entire grid cell that is vegetated
    (i.e., pixel-level GVF). In order to correctly implement the real-time satellite
    observations in the model, we modify the model code to convert the observed pixel-level
    GVF to pervious-level GVF as described by equation 2, (2) where GVFpervious and
    GVFpixel are pervious- and pixel-level GVF, respectively, and furban represents
    the urban fraction of the pixel. Failure to modify GVF as described in equation
    2 would result in significant underestimation of GVF for urban grid cells in the
    model. 2.3.2 Albedo Albedo is a measure of the fraction of downwelling sunlight
    that is reflected. Surface albedo plays a dominant roll in the dynamics of the
    surface energy balance [Dickinson, 1983; Dobos, 2003; Cedilnik et al., 2012].
    In the default WRF model, there are two ways of defining the surface albedo of
    non-urban grid cells. The first option utilizes a monthly climatological albedo
    data set based on AVHRR products from 1985 to 1991 [Csiszar and Gutman, 1999].
    This option is referred to as AVHRR hereafter. (In WRF, this option is known as
    “usemonalb.”) The second option computes albedo using tabulated values that are
    dependent on the land cover type of the grid cell (hereafter called Look-up table).
    Note that the look-up table option also results in monthly varying albedos through
    a monthly varying GVF-based factor, which scales the albedo values within predefined
    ranges. For urban grid cells in the default model, the albedo of the impervious
    portion is defined based on tabulated roof, wall, and road albedo values that
    are dependent on urban type. The default albedo of these three impervious surfaces
    is 0.2. The pervious portion of urban grid cells is by default assumed to also
    have an albedo of 0.2. To overcome the shortcomings of the treatment of albedo
    in the default model, we use remotely sensed, MODIS-based albedo to generate heterogeneous,
    real-time monthly albedos, hereafter called Improved MODIS. The MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted
    reflectance product (MCD43A4) is used in the current study. This product is corrected
    to represent local solar noon. View angle effects are also removed from the directional
    reflectances resulting in stable and consistent background albedos. These albedos
    are directly implemented within the WRF model. We modified the model code to assign
    the measured pixel-level albedo to both pervious and impervious portions of each
    grid cell. Thus, relative to the default model, we improve the representation
    of albedo by using observed city-specific and spatially varying values for both
    urban and non-urban areas. It should be noted that the same remotely sensed albedo
    value is used for all the urban surfaces in a grid cell (i.e., road, wall, and
    roof). 2.4 Model Simulations To investigate the changes in modeled urban meteorology
    induced by implementing the real-time satellite-based GVF and albedo data, we
    carry out a series of simulations as described in Table 1. The simulations investigate
    both default model configurations and implementations of new real-time MODIS-based
    data sets. The Default simulation uses AVHRR data sets for both GVF and albedo.
    MODIS_GVF and Improved_GVF cases incorporate different GVF data sets based on
    MODIS and Improved MODIS, respectively, while maintaining the same albedo maps
    as the Default case. Similarly, Table_alb and Improved_alb cases incorporate different
    albedo data sets based on Look-up table and Improved MODIS, respectively, while
    maintaining the default AVHRR GVF data. To understand how well the enhanced WRF
    performs in urban environments, the Improved_GVF_alb simulation utilizes real-time
    MODIS data (i.e., Improved MODIS) for both GVF and albedo. The three Improved
    simulations are conducted using the code modifications described in sections 5
    and 7 to allow for accurate model interpretation of the newly developed data sets.
    The enhanced code correctly incorporates the pervious-level GVF instead of pixel-level
    values and introduces satellite-based and spatially varying albedo values to both
    pervious and impervious portions of urban grid cells. It should be noted that
    all the simulations use NLCD-based urban fraction and NUDAPT-based urban morphological
    parameters, explained in the section 2. Table 1. Summary of Simulations Scenario

    GVF and Albedo Data Sets Figure 2 presents the real-time GVF data set developed
    in this research (Improved MODIS) as well as the two climatological data sets
    (AVHRR and MODIS) that are available for use in the standard WRF model. Difference
    maps are included in the supporting information (Figure S1). Note that Figure
    2 presents pervious-level GVF, while pixel-level values are included in the supporting
    information (Figure S2). Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial maps
    of GVF based on (a) climatology of AVHRR data, (b) climatology of MODIS data,
    and (c) real-time Improved MODIS data. All values shown are averaged over 2012.
    (d) Monthly time series of GVF averaged separately over urban and non-urban pixels
    are also shown. The two climatological data sets, AVHRR and MODIS, are available
    in the standard WRF model. The Improved MODIS data set is developed in this research.
    Note that values are pervious-level GVF, meaning that they represent the fraction
    of pervious area covered by green vegetation. Pixel-level GVF is shown in Figure
    S2. Over urban regions, AVHRR and MODIS produce identical pervious-level GVFs
    in the model (Figures 2a and 2b). This is because by default the model assigns
    a GVF of 0.8 to the pervious portion of urban cells. Compared to our real-time
    Improved MODIS data set, this assumption leads to significant overestimation of
    GVF over most of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, particularly in the eastern
    portion of the domain. The MODIS data set produces inaccurate and unrealistic
    pixel-level GVF patterns over urban areas when compared to the Improved MODIS
    maps (see supporting information Figure S2b). Over non-urban grid cells, MODIS
    and Improved MODIS data sets produce similar patterns and show more spatial detail
    and variability compared to AVHRR. MODIS produces lower GVF values compared to
    the real-time Improved MODIS data (Figures 2b and 2c). A comparison of seasonal
    variation in GVF from AVHRR, MODIS, and Improved MODIS is presented separately
    for urban and non-urban areas in Figure 2d. GVF values from Improved MODIS are
    lower (higher) than from AVHRR and MODIS over urban (non-urban) areas throughout
    the year. A subtle seasonal cycle in GVF is reported by all data sets over non-urban
    regions, while only Improved MODIS resolves the seasonal cycle over the urban
    grid cells (Figure 2d). Albedo maps derived from Look-up table, AVHRR, and Improved
    MODIS are presented in Figure 3. Difference maps are included in the supporting
    information (Figure S3). Unlike the differences in GVF, which were more significant
    over urban parts of the domain, differences in albedo are more significant over
    the non-urban areas. When compared to Improved MODIS, non-urban albedo values
    are generally lower from AVHRR and higher from Look-up table. Over the urban areas,
    AVHRR and Look-up table produce uniform albedos of 0.2 (Figures 3a and 3b). This
    is due to the fact that the current version of WRF-UCM, by default, assumes an
    albedo of 0.2 for both pervious and impervious surfaces (i.e., roofs, roads, and
    walls) in urban grid cells. Improved MODIS, however, resolves the spatial variability
    in albedo within urban areas and results in overall lower albedo values (Figure
    3c). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial maps of albedo based on
    (a) climatology of AVHRR data, (b) Look-up table, and (c) real-time Improved MODIS
    data. All values are averaged over 2012. (d) Monthly time series of albedo averaged
    separately over urban and non-urban pixels are also shown. Data from AVHRR and
    Look-up table are available in the standard WRF model. The Improved MODIS data
    set is developed in this research. Figure 3d presents the annual cycle of monthly
    albedos from the three data sets. While differences among the data sets over non-urban
    areas are large throughout the year, differences over urban grid cells are large
    only during winter and small during summer. 3.2 Impact of Implementation of Satellite
    Observations on Simulated Temperatures and Surface Energy Balance The influence
    of the different GVF and albedo inputs on the simulated surface energy balance
    and land surface and near-surface air temperatures is shown in Figures 4-7. The
    differences in spatial-mean diurnal profiles are shown separately for urban and
    non-urban grid cells (Figures 4 and 6). Absolute values are included in the supporting
    information (Figures S4 and S5). Spatial distributions are also presented for
    daytime (2 P.M.) and nighttime (10 P.M.) (Figures 5 and 7). Figure 4 Open in figure

    Default) for (a) sensible heat flux, (b) latent heat flux, (c) ground heat flux,
    (d) land surface temperature, and (e) 2 m air temperature. Results are presented
    for MODIS_GVF and Improved_GVF simulations. Values are averages over all urban
    and non-urban grid cells for 7–10 July 2012. Note that ground heat flux is positive
    downward. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Simulated (a–d) land surface

    simulations. Values are averages over all urban and non-urban grid cells for 7–10
    July 2012. Note that ground heat flux is positive downward. Figure 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Simulated (a–d) land surface and (e–h) 2 m air temperature differences
    between Table_alb and Default simulations (left column), and Improved_alb and
    Default simulations (right column). Values are averaged for 7–10 July 2012. 3.2.1
    Green Vegetation Fraction The Default and MODIS_GVF simulations produce almost
    identical sensible, latent, and ground heat fluxes over urban grid cells (Figure
    4) since in each case the model uses the same simplifying assumption that assigns
    a GVF of 0.8 to these cells (see Figure 2). For Improved_GVF, however, relaxing
    the aforementioned assumption and instead including high-resolution spatial variability
    in satellite-based GVF (Figure 2) leads to changes in the surface energy balance
    of urban grid cells (Figure 4). During daytime, the Improved_GVF simulation produces
    substantially higher sensible heat fluxes and lower latent heat fluxes relative
    to the Default and MODIS_GVF cases (Figures 4a and 4b). This occurs due to decreases
    in GVF values over urban grid cells in Improved MODIS (Figure 2), leading to up
    to 68.3 W m−2 less energy being partitioned to latent heat (Figure 4b) and up
    to 40.5 W m−2 more energy being partitioned to sensible heat (Figure 4a). For
    Improved_GVF, simulated ground heat flux also shows significant changes over urban
    pixels, compared to the Default simulation (Figure 4c). These changes are induced
    by decreased green vegetation cover and include increases of up to 30.8 and 15.7 W m−2
    in daytime downward and nighttime upward ground heat fluxes, respectively. It
    should be noted that ground heat fluxes are positive downward. Regarding non-urban
    grid cells, the surface energy changes are less significant for both Improved_GVF
    and MODIS_GVF, a consequence of the fact that the GVF changes are less significant
    in these areas (Figure 2). However, decreases in daytime downward and nighttime
    upward ground heat fluxes are noticeable for Improved_GVF (Figure 4c). These changes
    are due to considerable GVF increases over some non-urban areas (Figure 2). Spatial
    maps of sensible, latent, and ground heat flux changes (included in the supporting
    information Figures S6 and S7) confirm higher sensible heat flux, lower latent
    heat flux, and higher nighttime (upward) ground heat fluxes over urban areas for
    the Improved_GVF case, compared to the Default case. Changes in land surface and
    near-surface air temperatures relative to Default are dependent on time of day
    for the MODIS_GVF and Improved_GVF simulations (Figures 4d and 4e). The most significant
    changes are for urban grid cells in Improved_GVF, which uses real-time MODIS-based
    values for urban grid cells instead of the default model assumed GVF of 0.8. For
    the Improved_GVF case, the GVF-induced land surface and near-surface air temperature
    changes show similar diurnal behaviors with maximum temperature change of 2.3
    and 2.2°C, respectively, occurring at 18:00 local time. Diurnal temperature changes
    reported here are due to shifts in the partitioning of surface energy between
    sensible and latent heat flux (Figures 4a and 4b). Nocturnal temperature changes
    are induced by increased upward ground heat flux at nighttime (Figure 4c). We
    hypothesize that these nocturnal effects are amplified due to vastly lower boundary
    layer heights during nighttime than during the day (see supporting information
    Figure S8). Spatial temperature patterns from the Default, MODIS_GVF, and Improved_GVF
    simulations are presented in Figure 5. Default and MODIS_GVF produce nearly identical
    temperatures over urban grid cells due to the assumed GVF of 0.8 (see Figure 2).
    However, the Improved_GVF simulation shows higher land surface and near-surface
    air temperatures over urban areas relative to Default (Figures 5b, 5d, 5f, and
    5h). This is a consequence of the lower urban GVFs in Improved_GVF versus the
    assumed value of 0.8 used in Default. The largest changes are observed during
    nighttime and over the eastern parts of the urban region where the GVF changes
    are most significant (Figure 2). Increases in nocturnal land surface and air temperatures
    for Improved_GVF versus Default are as large as 5.1 and 2.9°C, respectively (Figures
    5d and 5h). Daytime changes in urban air temperatures for Improved_GVF versus
    Default range from 0.5 to 1.0°C. Over non-urban areas, MODIS_GVF and Improved_GVF
    simulations result in similar spatial patterns of temperature change, with Improved_GVF
    minus Default showing larger values than MODIS_GVF minus Default (Figures 5).
    Lower nocturnal air and surface temperatures are simulated over the San Bernardino
    and San Gabriel Mountains, located immediately east and north of the Los Angeles
    area (Figures 5c, 5d, 5g and 5h). These temperature changes are induced by decreases
    in upward ground heat fluxes at nighttime (see supporting information Figures
    S7c and S7d). During daytime, differences in non-urban surface temperature are
    more complex and linked to indirect effects of changes in GVF on cloud cover and
    therefore downwelling shortwave radiation (see supporting information Figure S9).
    3.2.2 Albedo The changes in diurnal variations of surface energy budget terms
    as well as land surface and near-surface air temperatures are compared for the
    Table_alb and Improved_alb versus Default in Figure 6. Default and Table_alb produce
    nearly identical surface energy budget values for urban grid cells, a consequence
    of the fact that they both use the model Default assumption that urban grid cells
    have albedo of 0.2 (Figure 3). When compared to Default, the Improved_alb simulation
    results in small changes to the surface energy budget over urban areas (Figures
    6a–6c). This is expected given that satellite-based albedo values over these regions
    during summer are similar to the Default model assumed value of 0.2 (see Figure
    3). These subtle changes in the sensible, latent, and ground heat fluxes, which
    are limited to 12.9, 5.1, and 2.8 W m−2, respectively, lead to mean increases
    in urban daytime surface and air temperature of 0.8 and 0.3°C, respectively, for
    Improved_alb minus Default (Figures 6d and 6e). Over non-urban areas, albedo-induced
    changes are larger than over urban areas (Figure 6). Higher albedo values used
    in both Table_alb and Improved_alb simulations versus Default result in lower
    surface net radiations (of up to 122.8 and 44.5 W m−2, respectively), leading
    to decreases in sensible heat fluxes (of up to 84.5 and 30.6 W m−2, respectively)
    (Figure 6a). Corresponding changes in latent heat fluxes are minimal (Figure 6b).
    This is an indicator of the high Bowen ratio in this region, resulting from low
    green vegetation coverage and dry soil over non-urban areas, which limits ET.
    An average daytime (7 A.M.–6 P.M.) Bowen ratio of 6.5 is calculated for non-urban
    areas. This is expected since summertime is a dry season in the Los Angeles region.
    Both Table_alb and Improved_alb simulations show lower land surface temperatures
    over non-urban areas relative to Default, with coolings of up to 3.7°C and 1.4°C,
    respectively. The larger temperature differences in Table_alb minus Default are
    consistent with the larger differences in albedo relative to Improved_alb versus
    Default (Figure 3). Air temperature changes are small and do not exceed 0.5°C
    (Figure 6e). The spatial distributions of land surface and near-surface air temperature
    changes due to incorporation of look-up table (Table_alb) and MODIS (Improved_alb)
    based albedo maps are shown in Figure 7. Spatial maps of sensible, latent, and
    ground heat flux changes are included in the supporting information (Figures S10
    and S11). For the majority of urban grid cells, lower albedo values in Improved_alb
    versus Default lead to higher sensible heat fluxes (see supporting information
    Figure S10b). This results in daytime warming of land surface and near-surface
    air by 1 and 0.5°C, respectively (Figures 7b and 7f). Over non-urban areas, higher
    albedo values lead to lower sensible heat fluxes (see supporting information Figure
    S10b). This results in daytime cooling of land surface temperatures in Improved_alb
    versus Default (Figure 7b). Nighttime albedo-induced land surface and air temperature
    changes are minimal for Improved_GVF minus Default (Figures 7d and 7h). Temperature
    changes over urban areas for Table_alb minus Default are also negligible (Figures
    7a, 7c, 7e, and 7g). However, widespread and significant cooling effects are simulated
    over non-urban areas for Table_alb versus Default (Figures 7a, 7c, 7e, and 7g).
    This is a result of albedo-induced decreases in sensible heat fluxes (see supporting
    information Figure S10a). The most significant albedo-induced cooling is associated
    with daytime land surface temperature, which reaches 5.2°C over non-urban areas
    (Figure 7a). Nighttime land surface temperature changes, as well as daytime and
    nighttime air temperature changes, also show cooling patterns over non-urban areas
    with magnitudes up to 2.6, 2.1, and 2.3°C, respectively (Figures 7c, 7e, and 7g).
    There are scattered areas in the mountainous parts of the domain with increased
    daytime land surface temperatures (Figures 7a and 7b) in both Table_alb and Improved_alb,
    despite the albedo increase in these regions. The regions with surface temperature
    increases are associated with increased downwelling shortwave radiation (see supporting
    information Figure S12) stemming from decreased cloud cover. A likely explanation
    for the decreased cloud cover is that higher albedo reduces convective available
    potential energy (CAPE) in the atmosphere above the San Gabriel and San Bernardino
    mountains, which is subject to convective activity during summer. 3.3 Model Validation
    We now compare simulations to ground and satellite observations to assess changes
    in the predicative capability of the model over the Los Angeles metropolitan area
    after implementing real-time satellite-derived GVF and albedo. As such, we evaluate
    two simulations: Default, and Improved_GVF_alb, which implements satellite-based
    GVF and albedo (Table 1). Observations used here include ground measurements of
    near-surface air temperature (Figures 8 and 9), ET (see supporting information
    Figures S12 and S13), as well as satellite-based land surface temperatures (Figure
    10). (See sections 3 and 4 for more details on observations.) Figure 8 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Diurnal variation in 2 m air temperature from ground
    observations, and the Default and Improved_GVF_alb simulations. The Improved_GVF_alb
    simulation adopts satellite-observed GVF and albedo data, whereas Default is the
    standard configuration of WRF-UCM. Values are averages over all urban and non-urban
    grid cells for 7–10 July 2012. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial
    distribution of 2 m air temperature for Default and Improved_GVF_alb simulations
    (a, b), and air temperature biases (simulated – observed) using concurrent ground-based
    observations (c, d). Values are averaged over 7-10 July 2012 for 10 P.M. local
    time. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial distribution of land
    surface temperature from MODIS daytime (11 A.M.) and nighttime (10 P.M.) observations
    (a, d), and land surface temperature biases (simulated − observed) for the Default
    and Improved_GVF_alb simulations (b, c, e, and f). Values are averaged over 7–10
    July 2012. Diurnal variation in 2 m air temperature from simulations and observations,
    averaged over 7–10 July 2012, is shown in Figure 8. Observations are from 16 CIMIS
    and NCDC stations over the Los Angeles metropolitan area. It is important to note
    that there is an inevitable inconsistency between ground-based observations, which
    generally represent a small footprint area of about 1 m2, and the modeled footprint
    area of corresponding 2 km grid cells. To help account for this fundamental disparity,
    observations from all stations are averaged and compared with the corresponding
    model-simulated averages from grid cells nearest to the station locations. The
    Default simulation tends to underpredict 2 m air temperatures at night by 2 to
    3°C (Figure 8). This is, in part, due to the overestimation of GVF and underestimation
    of albedo values in the default AVHRR-based data sets over urban areas (see Figures
    2 and 3). For Default, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for the simulation
    versus hourly observations is 2.3°C. Using more realistic MODIS-based GVF and
    albedo values, the Improved_GVF_alb simulation produces higher nocturnal 2 m air
    temperatures, which better match the observations (Figure 8). Improved_GVF_alb
    versus observations results in an RMSD of 1.2°C. The improved prediction of nocturnal
    air temperatures is consistent with that reported by Li et al. [2014] for the
    Pearl River Delta region of China. It is noteworthy that previous meteorological
    modeling studies have reported systematic shortcomings of boundary layer schemes
    including overestimations of nocturnal near-surface winds, which could contribute
    to the discussed underestimation of nighttime air temperature [e.g., Shimada et
    al., 2011; Vautard et al., 2012; Garcia-Menendez et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013].
    Figure 9 presents the simulated spatial distribution of 2 m air temperature for
    Default and Improved_GVF_alb, as well as comparisons to ground observations. Values
    shown are for 10 P.M. since previous studies have shown that the near-surface
    air temperature urban heat island is a nocturnal phenomenon especially in the
    period around and following sunset [Oke, 1982]. Comparisons of spatial variations
    in daytime air temperatures are included in the supporting information (Figure
    S13). Simulated versus observed nocturnal 2 m air temperatures at each measurement
    site shows marked improvements for Improved_GVF_alb versus Default (Figures 9c
    and 9d). For Default, 2 m air temperature is underestimated at almost all stations
    with a total RMSD of 3.8°C (Figure 9c). However, the implementation of MODIS-based
    GVF and albedo in Improved_GVF_alb reduces RMSD to 1.9°C (Figure 9d). Thus, accurately
    simulating nocturnal air temperature patterns depends significantly on realistic
    representation of GVF and albedo. The WRF prediction of daytime (at 2 P.M., local
    time) air temperatures, however, is not changed using MODIS-based GVF and albedo
    (RMSD of 1.0°C) (see supporting information Figure S13). The model performance
    in producing ET temporal and spatial fluctuations is also evaluated using CIMIS-based
    ET observations. Our results show that Improved_GVF_alb produces lower ET rates
    compared to Default. This is due to decreased GVF in Improved_GVF_alb (see Figure
    2). When evaluated against observations, both simulations show reasonable accuracy
    capturing ET variations (RMSD ~ 0.08 mm h−1 for both simulations). This analysis
    is included in the supporting information (Figures S14 and S15). Maps of land
    surface temperatures from MODIS during day and night are shown in Figure 10. During
    daytime, satellite-based land surface temperatures are generally higher in inland
    locations (i.e., away from the Pacific Ocean) and over highly developed areas
    such as central Los Angeles, illustrating a strong daytime land surface temperature
    urban heat island effect (Figure 10a). During nighttime, the surface UHI pattern
    is not pronounced though inland temperatures remain generally warmer than near-coast
    regions (Figure 10d). To further examine the improvements in model performance
    gained by implementing remotely sense GVF and albedo, simulated versus observed
    land surface temperatures are investigated (Figures 10b, 10c, 10e, and 10f). It
    is evident that the Default simulation underestimates daytime land surface temperatures
    over the central parts of Los Angeles (RMSD = 4.1°C) (Figure 10b). Implementing
    MODIS-based GVF and albedo in the Improved_GVF_alb case reduces the simulated
    cold biases over this region (Figure 10c). However, Improved_GVF_alb produces
    new regions of warm biases over the eastern and southern parts of the metropolitan
    area, leading to an RMSD that is nearly the same as that for Default (4.3°C).
    During nighttime, the Default simulation produces an RMSD of 2.6°C including large
    cold biases over the eastern and southern parts of the domain (Figure 10e). Biases
    are significantly reduced for Improved_GVF_alb (RMSD = 1.8°C), including improvements
    in the regions showing large cold biases in Default (Figure 10f). The improved
    model performance over these regions is largely associated with realistic estimation
    of GVF values (Figure 2). Nevertheless, over the central parts of the Los Angeles
    area, the land surface temperatures simulated by Improved_GVF_alb are still higher
    than MODIS observations (Figure 10f). We speculate that the overestimation of
    daytime and nighttime land surface temperature may be associated with the lack
    of urban irrigation in the current modeling framework. Previous studies over Los
    Angeles reported that irrigation-induced increases in latent heat flux can lead
    to land surface temperature decreases over urban areas [Vahmani and Hogue, 2014b].
    It is noteworthy that an important source of uncertainty in meteorological models
    stems from insufficient understanding and simplified parameterization of physical
    processes, as well as coarse spatial resolution. Accuracy of physical process
    representations varies significantly from model to model and has been the topic
    of extensive past research [e.g., Penner et al., 2006; Fast et al., 2011; Shimada
    et al., 2011; Vautard et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012; Garcia-Menendez et al.,
    2013; Zhao et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013]. 3.4 Quantifying the UHI: Relationships
    Between Simulated Temperatures and Land Surface Characteristics 3.4.1 Relationships
    Using All Grid Cells The accurate simulation of the diurnal cycle and spatial
    distribution of land surface and near-surface air temperatures (Figures 8-10 and
    section 12), as well as the realistic representation of GVF, albedo, and urban
    fraction, sets the stage for further investigation of the UHI in Los Angeles.
    Assessing the UHI in Los Angeles is difficult given that this region is surrounded
    by ocean and mountain ranges. Thus, spatial variations in temperatures are caused
    not only by land surface characteristics (e.g., urban fraction, albedo, and green
    vegetation fraction) but also by distance from the ocean and elevation. In an
    attempt to assess the factors that dictate the variations in surface and near-surface
    air temperature in the Los Angeles area, we evaluate relationships of grid cell
    level temperatures to distance from the ocean, elevation, urban fraction, GVF,
    and albedo (Figure 11). We note that while the surface temperature UHI has been
    investigated using satellite observations [Dousset and Gourmelon, 2003; Imhoff
    et al., 2010; Weng et al., 2014], measurements of surface air temperatures are
    spatially sparse, necessitating a model for investigation of the air temperature
    UHI. Figure 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationships between simulated
    temperatures and (a, f, k, and p) distance from the sea, (b, g, l, and q) elevation,
    (c, h, m, and r) urban fraction, (d, i, h, and s) green vegetation fraction, and
    (e, j, o, and t) albedo. All values are from the Improved_GVF_alb simulation and
    use satellite-observed land surface characteristics. Values are shown for both
    daytime (2 P.M.) and nighttime (10 P.M.), and surface temperature and 2 m air
    temperature. Values are averaged over 7–10 July 2012 such that each point represents
    a different grid cell in the domain. Elevation and distance from the sea are indicated
    by the size and color of the circles, respectively. Among the examined factors,
    distance from the ocean is the main contributor to variations in land surface
    and 2 m air temperatures, as illustrated in Figures 11a, 11f, 11k, and 11p. During
    daytime, the relationship between temperature and distance from the ocean is nonlinear.
    Daytime land surface and 2 m air temperatures show strong positive correlations
    to the distance from ocean over grid cells that are within about 50 km from the
    ocean. However, daytime temperatures become largely independent of distance from
    the ocean when farther than about 50 km. Counterintuitively, positive correlations
    are seen between surface and 2 m air temperature versus elevation (Figures 11b,
    11g, 11l, and 11q). This is due to the fact that in the Los Angeles metropolitan
    area, distance from the ocean and elevation are correlated. Inland areas are generally
    at higher elevations than coastal areas. The positive correlation between temperature
    and elevation holds only for elevation less than 600 m. At higher elevations (i.e.,
    >600 m), the cooling effects of increased altitude start to surpass the warming
    effects of the increased distance from ocean. These patterns are consistent for
    daytime and nighttime surface and 2 m air temperatures. In general, the elevation-related
    cooling effects are most significant above 1500 m. Remarkably, there are negligible
    correlations between surface and 2 m air temperatures versus urban fraction (Figures
    11c, 11h, 11m, and 11r). Previous studies report significant correlations between
    land surface temperature and urban fraction in other cities [Yuan and Bauer, 2007;
    Imhoff et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2014b]. The less pronounced relationships between
    temperature and urban fraction reported here is due to the uniquely strong influence
    of other factors including distance from the ocean and elevation in Los Angeles.
    Imhoff et al. [2010] assessed the relationship between land surface temperature
    and urban fraction for different impervious surface area zones in 38 cities within
    the continental United States. They reported an average coefficient of determination
    of 80% for five cities in California (i.e., Fresno, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San
    Diego, and San Jose). They, however, did not specify a value for Los Angeles alone.
    Other studies acknowledged the complex nature of the UHI in Los Angeles due to
    surrounding mountainous and coastal regions [Roth et al., 1989; Witiw and LaDochy,
    2008]. Surface and near-surface temperatures are negatively correlated with GVF
    (Figures 11d, 11i, 11n, and 11s). The negative correlations are less significant
    during the day. Interestingly, correlations appear stronger for temperatures versus
    GVF than versus urban fraction. Simulated surface and 2 m air temperatures show
    small and unexpectedly positive correlations with albedo (Figures 11e, 11j, 11o,
    11t). One possible explanation for this is that urban areas that are farther from
    the ocean, in the eastern part of Los Angeles, tend to have up to 0.1 higher surface
    albedos in the current study domain (Figure 3c). Importantly, the relationships
    between temperatures and albedo should be interpreted with caution because of
    the very narrow range in albedos considered (Figure 11). This analysis indicates
    that there is considerable complexity in the UHI in Los Angeles due to covariation
    in temperatures, distance from the ocean, elevation, urban fraction, albedo, and
    GVF. 3.4.2 Conditional Sampling In an attempt to tease out the influence of land
    surface characteristics, namely, urban fraction, GVF, and albedo, on surface and
    2 m air temperatures, we now conditionally sample grid cells based on distance
    from the ocean and elevation. The sampled grid cells are located at a distance
    from the ocean ranging from 16 to 33 km and have elevations from 25 to 113 m.
    Further attention is given to the biome of the analyzed grid cells, which are
    all located in the central region of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In total,
    167 grid cells are conditionally selected for this analysis (see supporting information
    for more information; Figure S16). Relationships of daytime and nighttime temperatures
    versus urban fraction, GVF, and albedo for conditionally selected grid cells are
    assessed using the coefficients of determination (R2) (Figure 12). In contrast
    with the previous section, which is focused in the entire metropolitan area, this
    analysis shows clear relationships between land surface and 2 m air temperatures
    versus urban fraction (Figures 12a, 12d, 12g, and 12j). Spatial variations in
    urban fraction contribute to 27, 23, 19, and 20% of the variance in daytime land
    surface temperature, nighttime land surface temperature, daytime 2 m air temperature,
    and nighttime 2 m air temperature, respectively. Figure 12 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Relationships between simulated temperatures and (a, d, g, and j) urban
    fraction, (b, e, h, and k) green vegetation fraction, and (c, f, i, and l) albedo
    for conditionally sampled grid cells. Conditionally sampled grid cells limit variations
    in elevation to between 25 and 113 m above sea level, and distance from the sea
    to between 16 and 33 km. All values are from the Improved_GVF_alb simulation and
    use satellite-observed land surface characteristics. Values are shown for both
    daytime (2 P.M.) and nighttime (10 P.M.), and surface temperature and 2 m air
    temperature. Values are averaged over 7–10 July 2012 such that each point represents
    a different grid cell in the domain. Elevation and distance from the sea are indicated
    by the size and color of the circles, respectively. Black lines represent best
    fits using the least squares method, and coefficients of determination (R2) are
    shown. Clearer relationships between temperatures and GVF are also detected (Figures
    12b, 12e, 12h, and 12k). For the conditionally selected grid cells, spatial variations
    in GVF are responsible for 58, 39, 18, and 43% of the variance in daytime land
    surface temperature, nighttime land surface temperature, daytime 2 m air temperature,
    and nighttime air temperature, respectively. GVF influences are stronger for daytime
    land surface temperature than nighttime land surface temperature and for nighttime
    air temperature than daytime air temperature. This is important since surface
    and near-surface UHI intensities are greatest during the day and night, respectively
    [Roth et al., 1989; Oke, 1982]. Based on these results, we hypothesize that strategies
    that include increasing GVF in urban areas can be effective in mitigating both
    the daytime surface and nighttime air temperature UHIs. This is consistent with
    previous studies that highlighted the key role of vegetation in attenuating the
    daytime surface temperature UHI [Zhou et al., 2014a; Peng et al., 2012; Dousset
    and Gourmelon, 2003] and the nighttime air temperature UHI [Yan et al., 2014].
    Simulated surface and air temperatures show negligible correlations to albedo
    (Figures 12c, 12f, 12i, and 12l). This is partially due to the small albedo variations
    in the studied region. 4 Summary In the current study, we enhance a mesoscale
    meteorological model (WRF-UCM) by implementing high-resolution and real-time gridded
    MODIS-based observations to derive important land surface physical characteristics,
    including GVF and albedo. To enable the use of satellite-based GVF and albedo,
    the model code was also modified. We replace predefined unvarying values for the
    pervious portion of urban grid cells with real-time, domain-specific, and spatially
    resolved MODIS-based data. To investigate the improvements in modeled urban meteorology
    attained from implementing the real-time satellite-based GVF and albedo data,
    we carry out a series of simulations using both Default model configurations and
    our real-time MODIS-based data sets. After implementing satellite-based surface
    characteristics within the modified model, the largest improvements are detected
    for nocturnal air temperatures. When compared with ground-based observations,
    simulated biases are reduced significantly (RMSD reduction from 3.8 to 1.9°C).
    This is critical since the near-surface air temperature UHI is mainly a nocturnal
    phenomenon. The model improvements in matching observed temperatures, compared
    to the default configuration, stem from a more accurate simulation of the surface
    energy balance, which depends on realistic representation of land surface characteristics,
    namely, GVF and albedo. Meanwhile, we acknowledge that an important source of
    uncertainty in meteorological models is associated with insufficient understanding
    and simplified parameterization of physical processes, as well as coarse spatial
    resolution, which are not the focus of the current study. Taking advantage of
    our improved simulation of the diurnal cycle and spatial distribution of land
    surface and 2 m air temperatures, as well as our realistic representation of the
    land surface GVF, albedo, and urban fraction, we quantify relationships between
    these temperatures versus land surface physical characteristics (i.e., GVF, albedo,
    and urban fraction), as well as distance from the ocean and elevation, in the
    Los Angeles region. Distance from the ocean is found to be a main contributor
    to temperature variations. During the daytime, distance from the ocean most strongly
    influences temperatures in grid cells that are within about 50 km from the ocean.
    We also show that, as expected, elevations of 600 m and above are associated with
    significant cooling effects on surface and 2 m air temperatures. Thus, there is
    considerable complexity in the UHI for Los Angeles due to covariation in temperatures,
    distance from the ocean, elevation, urban fraction, albedo, and GVF. To tease
    out the influence of urban fraction, GVF, and albedo, on simulated temperatures,
    we conditionally sample grid cells based on distance from the ocean and elevation.
    After conditional sampling, considerable relationships between land surface and
    2 m air temperatures versus urban fraction are detected. Urban fraction contributes
    to up to 27% of the variance in surface and 2 m air temperatures. Relationships
    between temperature fluctuations and GVF are most significant for daytime land
    surface temperature (coefficients of determination of up to 58%) and nighttime
    2 m air temperature (coefficients of determination of up to 43%). Based on these
    results, we suggest that strategies that include increasing green vegetation in

    THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT REQUEST OF AUTHOR.] Economic as well as water shortage
    pressure on agricultural use of water has placed added emphasis on efficient irrigation
    management. Center pivot technology has made great improvement with variable rate
    irrigation (VRI) technology to vary water application spatially and temporally
    to maximize the economic and environmental return. Proper management of VRI systems
    depends on correctly matching the pivot application to specific field temporal
    and areal conditions. There is need for a tool to accurately and inexpensively
    define dynamic management zones, to sense within-field variability in real time,
    and control variable rate water application so that producers are more willing
    to adopt and utilize the advantages of VRI systems. This study included tests
    of the center pivot system uniformity performance in 2014 at Delta Research Center
    in Portageville, MO. The goal of this research was to develop MOPivot software
    with an algorithm to determine unique management areas under center pivot systems
    based on system design and limitations. The MOPivot tool automates prescriptions
    for VRI center pivot based on non-uniform water needs while avoiding potential
    runoff and deep percolation. The software was validated for use in real-time irrigation
    management in 2018 for VRI control system of a Valley 8000 center pivot planted
    to corn. The water balance model was used to manage irrigation scheduling. Field
    data, together with soil moisture sensor measurement of soil water content, were
    used to develop the regression model of remote sensing-based crop coefficient
    (Kc). Remote sensing vegetation index in conjunction with GDD and crop growth
    stages in regression models showed high correlation with Kc. Validation of those
    regression models was done using Centralia, MO, field data in 2016. The MOPivot
    successfully created prescriptions to match system capacity of the management
    zone based on system limitations for center pivot management. Along with GIS data
    sources, MOPivot effectively provides readily available graphical prescription
    maps, which can be edited and directly uploaded to a center pivot control panel.
    The modeled Kc compared well with FAO Kc. By combining GDD and crop growth in
    the models, these models would account for local weather conditions and stage
    of crop during growing season as time index in estimating Kc. These models with
    Fraction of growth (FrG) and cumulative growing degree days (cGDD) had a higher
    coefficient of efficiency, higher Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency and
    higher Willmott index of agreement. Future work should include improvement in
    the MOPivot software with different crops and aerial remote sensing imagery to
    generate dynamic prescriptions during the season to support irrigation scheduling
    for real-time monitoring of field conditions. URI https://hdl.handle.net/10355/79549

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\
    \ Networks; Internet of Things; precision agriculture; smart farming;\ncommunication\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\
    \ based on the IEEE 802.11 standard. This standard speciﬁes the set of media\n\
    access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) protocols for implementing wireless\
    \ local area\nnetwork (WLAN) Wi-Fi computer communication in various frequencies.\n\
    •\nthe GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), a standard developed by\
    \ the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to describe the\
    \ protocols for second-generation\n(2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile\
    \ devices such as mobile phones and tablets.\n•\nthe GPRS (General Packet Radio\
    \ Service) technology standard that provides rapid sending and\nreceiving of data\
    \ over the GSM mobile networks based on packet switching, a well-known\nnetwork\
    \ transmission process.\n•\nthe 2G, 3G and 4G (LTE) are respectively the 2nd,\
    \ 3rd and 4th generation of GSM technology\naiming at higher speeds.\nTable 3\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\
    \ literature.\nTable 4. Smart farming routing protocols.\nRouting Protocols\n\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\
    •\nincrease production efﬁciency\n•\nimprove product quality\n•\nprovide more\
    \ efﬁcient use of chemicals in cultivation\n•\nmanage pesticide amounts\n•\nreduce\
    \ energy consumption\n•\nprotect the soil\n•\ncontrol water consumption and underground\
    \ water amounts\nThe IoT-based agriculture applications can be implemented for\
    \ an Android or Windows\nsmart-phone, a tablet or as a web application. The applications\
    \ of IoT-based smart farming apart from\nconventional, large farming operations,\
    \ targets also other growing or common trends in agricultural\nsuch as organic\
    \ farming, family farming (complex or small spaces, particular cattle and/or cultures,\n\
    preservation of particular or high quality varieties etc.), and enhance highly\
    \ transparent farming. Our\nprecision agriculture monitoring system can also beneﬁt\
    \ the dry farming technique that encompass\nspeciﬁc agricultural techniques for\
    \ the non-irrigated cultivation of crops. Furthermore, greenhouses\ncan use our\
    \ architectural model to intelligently monitor as well as control the climate,\
    \ eliminating the\nneed for manual intervention.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n\
    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Water is becoming scarcer. The unmonitored control
    and the extensive use of fossil fuel in water-table pumping for irrigation exacerbate
    global warming and harm the environment. Along with the rapid population growth
    and the concomitant increase in the demand for food, optimal usage of water-table
    and energy is becoming a must and indispensable for sustainable agriculture. In
    this context, Smart Agriculture (SA) is emerging as a promising field that leverages
    ICT (Information and Communication Technology) to optimize resources’ usage while
    enhancing crops’ yields. In this paper, we present an integral SA solution that
    leverages cost-effectiveness . Commercial solutions are costly and thus become
    impossible to adopt by small and medium farmers. Our solution revolves around
    three main axes: 1. Smart Water Metering promotes optimal usage and conservation
    of water-table (a.k.a., groundwater) via real-time data collection and monitoring
    using a Cloud-based IoT (Internet of Things) system; 2. Renewable-Energy integration
    promotes energy-efficient agriculture by reducing reliance on fossil fuels in
    water-table pumping, and 3. Smart Irrigation to promote good crops quality and
    quantity without harming the soil and the water-table ecosystems. Our solution
    has been deployed and tested in a real-world Smart Farm testbed. The results have
    shown that the adoption of our SA system reduces the amount of water consumption
    (with a traditional irrigation system) up to 71.8%. Finally, our solution is open-source
    and can be easily adopted and adapted by other researchers to promote the setting
    of a dedicated Cloud-based platform for water-table usage, especially in arid
    and sub-Saharan countries. IoT Based Smart Agriculture: Testbed General Architecture.

    I. Introduction Water is the basis and the main engine of life on earth. Humans
    use water for industrial purposes, sanitation, and irrigation. In the last decades,
    the annual water withdrawal ranged between 11 billion and 15 billion cubic meters
    per year, out of which 69 % is used in agriculture [1]. Unfortunately, most of
    this water is wasted because of inadequate irrigation control systems. As in most
    arid and sub-Saharan countries, agriculture in Morocco is the largest consumer
    of fresh water, especially after launching the Green Plan program in April 2008
    [2]. This program aims to promote agriculture as an efficient sector capable of
    advancing the economy, fighting poverty, and preserving many people in rural areas
    efficiently and sustainably. Within the framework of this program, the government
    provided many facilities and assistance to farmers and investors in irrigated
    agriculture to provide enough basic food for local consumption and export promotion
    programs. However, the level of Smart Agriculture penetration in Morocco remains
    very low. In addition, investors in the irrigated agricultural projects started
    sounding alarms of severe depletion of groundwater on the horizon [3] and the
    lack of a cost-effective real-time data collection in irrigation systems in farming
    fields that will enable them to benefit from the advanced modern technologies.
    There is a need to develop a cost-effective and sustainable data acquisition system
    for smart agriculture applications in sub-Saharan fields for sustainable, efficient,
    and smart agriculture. The system should use renewable energy and the latest Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) that can sustain the aridity of an agricultural
    environment. When combined with reasonable control and management and data analytics,
    the data acquisition system can play an essential role in increasing agricultural
    productivity and improving the quality of crops. Most importantly, unlike the
    traditional methods of irrigated agriculture that widely use underground water
    reservoirs and resort to fossil fuels, especially gas, as a source of energy.
    Smart agriculture (SA) exploits modern management systems to rationalize water
    consumption and adopt renewable energies as a source of energy, thus rendering
    the agricultural sector eco-friendly. In this paper, we are presenting an integral
    and cost-effective SA solution. When approached from a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)
    perspective [4], our solution relies on four main ICTs: 1. A Wireless Sensors
    Network (WSNs) monitor, in real-time, the plant environmental conditions, e.g.,
    weather and soil conditions, 2. A Wireless Actuators Network (WAN) acts upon electric
    appliances such as water pumps and light bulbs, 3. A Cloud-based IoT platform
    for real-time data storage, processing, and visualization; and 4. A Fuzzy Logic
    Control module decides on monitoring irrigation durations based on the real-time
    acquired differences between desired and ambient soil moisture. We deployed our
    open-source software solution for data acquisition, actuation, and control. We
    built our cost-effective sensors and actuators using off-the-shelf cheap nano-Arduinos.
    Finally, we leveraged an existing free Cloud-based IoT platform, e.g., NodeRED
    [5]. In this paper, and by considering optimal water-ground usage, renewable energy
    integration, and open-source ICT-based smart irrigation, we aim to contribute
    towards the smooth penetration of Smart Agriculture into underprivileged sub-Saharan
    countries. We are further envisioning, through this work, to set a solid cornerstone
    for establishing a dedicated Cloud-based and HPC (High-Performance Computing)
    platform [6] to collect real-time data about water-table usage. This data, which
    falls under the big data category, as it bears the big data 3Vs (Volume, Velocity,
    and Variety) [7], and along with appropriate Big Data Analytics tools, will tremendously
    assist in promoting eco-friendly smart agriculture. The paper contributions are
    as follows: We present a real-world, cost-effective, and easy-to-deploy general
    architecture for a Smart Farm testbed that the research community can easily adopt
    and adapt for further testing and improvement. We detail how to use open-source
    software and leverage Cloud Computing for wireless sensor data storage and processing.
    We demonstrate the integration of our developed cost-effective wireless sensors
    and actuators using off-the-shelf hardware in a real-world case study. We show
    how integrating renewable energy into smart farms paves the path towards adopting
    our solution in off-grid sites, e.g., arid and sub-Saharan areas. We prove that
    by adopting fuzzy logic into smart drip irrigation, our system reduces water consumption
    by up to 71.8%, thus contributing to sustainable water-table usage. The rest of
    the paper is organized as follows. The background is presented in Section 2, and
    the related work is overviewed in Section 3. The general system architecture and
    design are described in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss the results and evaluate
    the findings. Finally, in Section 6, we conclude and present our future work.
    SECTION II. Background A. Smart Agriculture as a Cyber-Physical System The rapid
    technological developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), WSN, and Embedded
    Systems in recent years have enabled the development of modern systems and applications
    that have completely changed our lives. CPSs are among the most powerful of these
    modern systems, and Smart Agriculture is a CPS. CPS refers to systems that ideally
    integrate software and hardware components to perform precise tasks. A formal
    definition states: “Cyber-Physical System is defined as transformative technologies
    for managing interconnected systems between its physical assets and computational
    capabilities” [8]. As shown in Fig. 1, the general CPS architecture combines embedded
    computing, wireless sensors, and actuators networks to monitor and control the
    physical environment and give it the ability to adapt itself to new conditions
    in real-time through feedback loops. Its ability to combine different technologies
    and make them integrated has made CPS a crucial technological revolution that
    brings innovation to multiple industries by replacing traditional processes in
    many application areas with new and modern ones. FIGURE 1. Cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) general architecture. Show All Smart agriculture is one of the most promising
    CPS applications that will positively affect human life. SA can preserve a significant
    amount of water and energy through its ability to monitor multiple resources such
    as irrigation and solar energy systems. As a CPS, it replaces the traditional
    agricultural system with a smart and modern one that provides accurate agricultural
    management by collecting and processing data related to the plant, the weather,
    and the soil, in real-time mode and using precise control methods. The interaction
    of the main components of SA as a closed-loop control CPS is depicted in Fig.
    2. This figure includes the field, the control center, the Wireless Sensors and
    Actuators Network (WSAN), and the drip irrigation system. FIGURE 2. Smart farm
    as a closed CPS (Cyber physical system). Show All B. Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) The rapid developments in wireless communication technologies, micro-electromechanical
    systems, and digital electronics have given rise to WSN [9]–[11]. The latter consists
    of sensor nodes that monitor the agricultural environment needed data, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, motion, and pressure, and send through a
    gateway towards the data processing server(s). This data can be hosted locally
    or remotely in the Cloud [12]. Once processed and analyzed, it becomes information
    that can be visualized (e.g., using plots and charts) and sent to the control
    unit to react upon and take actions, e.g., switching On/Off water pumps and drip
    irrigation motors. One of the main advantages of WSN is that it reduces the cost
    of wiring and makes it practical and easy. According to some studies, WSN will
    have the ability to eliminate from 20% to 80% of the installation costs [13].
    The general structure of a wireless sensor node is depicted in Fig. 3 and consists
    of four units [14]: The Sensing Unit consists of sensor modules that sample the
    environmental conditions of the deployment field. The Processing Unit consists
    of a microcontroller with a CPU and memory to run code and process the data. The
    Transmission Unit: This unit modulates digital data and sends it wirelessly. Several
    wireless technologies are adopted for this unit. In our deployment, we are using
    ZigBee [15]. The power Supply Unit is the Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery that powers
    the wireless sensor node. FIGURE 3. General architecture of a wireless sensor
    node. Show All C. Internet of Things (IoT) With the rapid advancement in ICT,
    today’s era has left the concept of the internet far behind, and a new concept
    has emerged: the IoT. There are many definitions of IoT set by many organizations
    working globally. ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
    Standardization Sector) has defined IoT as “Global infrastructure for Information
    Society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual)
    things based on existing and evolving, interoperable information and communication
    technologies” [13]. [16] defines IoT as a technology that combines the internet
    and existing resources to control devices. This control is ensured by using various
    IoT communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Long-Range (Lora), Zensys
    Wave (Z-Wave), SigFox, Wi-Fi, GPRS, 4G, and 5G [17]. Even though IoT is mainly
    about connecting and automating things (objects) over the internet, human intervention
    gives this concept the possibility of existence. The interrelationship between
    the three sections that make up the IoT is illustrated in Fig. 4. FIGURE 4. Tri-sectional
    relationship between the three components of IoT. Show All IoT is witnessing continuous
    progress and has a promising future. Statistics indicate that the number of IoT-connected
    devices is expected to rise to 43 billion devices by 2023 [18]. Furthermore, the
    total IoT market worldwide was worth around \\(389 billion in 2020, and it is
    expected to rise to more than one trillion US dollars in 2030 [19]. This optimistic
    future vision reinforces the necessity to develop newer communication technologies
    that enable the synchronization of the largest possible number of new devices
    with sensors over the internet. Fig. 5 shows the persistent increase in connected
    devices/things over the internet for ten years (2015-2025) [20]. FIGURE 5. IoT
    connected devices in 2015-2025. Show All Given that IoT is a fertile research
    area that both the academic and industry sectors are interested in, all indications
    show an urge to deploy novel technologies to cope with the rapid increase in IoT
    deployment and adoption. In this regard, 5G and its Massive Machine Type Communication
    (mMTC) component is excellent news for the IoT market, and it will have a significant
    impact on it [19]. Through mMTC, 5G networks will inevitably improve the reliability
    and performance of many vital ICT-related domains of substantial interest to society,
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart buildings, and smart agriculture. The
    following section presents some critical IoT applications in SA. D. IoT Applications
    in Smart Agriculture IoT and connected objects have invaded our daily lives in
    all fields, from smart TVs to connected cars: all our activities are facilitated
    by these new tools, which significantly increase our comfort. All studies confirm
    that the potential of connected things is enormous. For example, a study done
    by Fortune Business Insight indicates that the global IoT market size is projected
    to reach $ 1,854.76 billion by 2028. It is set to exhibit a Compound Annual Growth
    Rate (CAGR) of 25.4% during the forecast period between 2021 and 2028 [21]. The
    applications of IoT are numerous and cover many areas. The most appealing IoT
    applications in Agriculture are presented next. 1) Smart Greenhouses Greenhouse
    farming enhances the quality and quantity of crops production through manual control
    of environmental conditions [22]. A smart greenhouse can be created using IoT
    by deploying sensors and motors that intelligently monitor and control the climate
    conditions based on the needs of the plants [23]. Several operations will be automatic
    by adopting this innovative agricultural system, such as opening and closing windows,
    adjusting the cooling and heating system, and turning on/off light bulbs. Thus,
    manual intervention is no longer required. 2) Smart Irrigation Management The
    currently adopted irrigation methods are somewhat advanced and depend on watering
    at specific times, which does not require much human intervention. Still, at the
    same time, it involves a high degree of guesswork and can be very wasteful in
    terms of water and energy consumption. Some field parts are under or over irrigated
    even with modern irrigation systems. Besides, although farmers would stop irrigation
    systems when expected to rain, sometimes they do not check the weather to adjust
    their schedules accordingly. The smart irrigation management system can consider
    all of this by using precision farming methodologies and IoT-enabled sensors that
    monitor soil moisture levels, humidity, and temperature everywhere in the field.
    The control based on this data automatically adjusts irrigation schedules. It
    also provides the exact amount of water where and when needed to create optimal
    conditions for the plant for a better yield without wasting water and energy.
    3) Integration Into Smart Grid Renewable energy integration into Smart Agriculture
    would serve as a bias to link Smart Farms to Smart Grids (SG) [17]. Smart farms
    are both energy producers and consumers. An SG is an electricity distribution
    network that promotes the flow of information between suppliers and consumers
    to adjust the flow of electricity in real-time and allows more efficient management
    of the electricity network [24], [25]. Smart grid benefits from the significant
    development that IoT and embedded systems are witnessing to optimize energy production,
    distribution, consumption, and storage. It improves the energy efficiency of the
    assembly by minimizing line losses and optimizing the yield of the means of production
    used, taking into consideration the real-time consumption. E. Cloud-Based Big
    Data Analytics Platforms This study uses Node-RED, an open-source flow-based programming
    tool that allows wiring hardware devices, application programming interfaces (APIs),
    and online services. We used the built-JavaScript-based library on Node.js to
    develop the application. We wired pre-programmed nodes represented by appropriate
    icons and created the application’s different needed functional IoT components.
    Node-RED contains several node types, each of which has a specific function. For
    instance, the debug-out nodes are used to monitor the flow. The inject nodes trigger
    a flow manually by clicking on it or automatically at regular intervals. The function
    nodes allow JavaScript code to be run on the messages passed through it. Furthermore,
    dashboard nodes allow us to display data [26]. In this work, we wired up input,
    output, and processing nodes to create needed flows for data preprocessing, processing,
    storage, and controlling the water pumps and the lighting system, as well as sending
    alerts. The deployed Node-Red flow construction of our irrigation control system
    is depicted in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. NodeRED irrigation control flow construction.
    Show All SECTION III. Related Work Several studies have been carried out in Smart
    Agriculture (SA). Authors in [27] covered state of the art in SA systems from
    a big data perspective. Their work aimed at introducing big data processing into
    SA. Besides, the authors presented a detailed evolution of the different agricultural
    systems was presented. It showed that SA could explore the full potential of information
    communication technology (ICT) by using various data sources. In [28], D. Glaroudis
    et al. provided a detailed survey about the most used messaging protocols in IoT
    applications. Based on the up-to-date references, they introduced, analyzed, and
    compared six protocols: Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), Extensible
    Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), WebSocket, and Data Distribution Service
    (DDS). The performance comparison was based on throughput, latency, power consumption,
    bandwidth, reliability, and security. The main challenges that are and will be
    raised by SA applications were also presented in this paper to provide a solid
    basis for realistic implementation options for SA applications. Authors in [29]
    highlighted the importance of IoT and WSN in precision agriculture. The development
    of a low-cost system that monitors, controls, and makes decisions, was presented.
    According to the results, the deployed system showed meaningful improvement in
    the efficiency of resources usage and crops production. Another model of a low-cost,
    effective irrigation system for enhancing cotton production using wireless sensors
    was proposed in [30]. The proposed wireless sensor showed excellent efficiency
    in monitoring the soil water tension, thus implementing an effective irrigation
    scheduling protocol. Authors in [31] deployed small-sized and low-cost WSN nodes
    to improve potato yield by monitoring the field. This study presented a model
    for irrigation management based on mathematical estimations of the agricultural
    parameters. The obtained results ensure better crop yield quality even under stressful
    environmental conditions. Besides, the irrigation system efficiency showed an
    increase that goes up to 10%. In [32], the authors concluded that environmental
    conditions monitoring is crucial to increasing agricultural yield. In this direction,
    a smart system was deployed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    the movement of animals in the field. The system used Arduino-based sensors. Besides,
    the suggested system deployed an Android mobile application that schedules the
    irrigation, visualizes real-time data, and alerts the farmer in case of any discrepancy.
    The IoT-based SA system farmer-friendly, which is an intelligent system for monitoring
    the concentration of nitrates in groundwater without human intervention, has been
    established in [33]. The proposed approach was based on WSN using Wi-Fi and LoRa
    for data communication. The results demonstrated that the model is ambitious and
    can be adopted by the farmers on large scales. The authors in [34] performed an
    experimental comparison of IoT devices with solar energy harvesting. For the sake
    of the comparison, they used three different communication technologies: Wi-Fi,
    LoRaWan, and ZigBee. The results proved that LoRaWan was the best solution for
    agricultural monitoring when prioritizing network lifetime. The research work
    in [35] defined SA as the application of modern ICT into agriculture. They presented
    the usable IoT hardware and software for smart agriculture and shared interesting
    results. A practical solution for sustainable irrigation in hyper-arid regions
    was proposed in [36]. The suggested solution is based on fuzzy logic combined
    with WSN. According to the results, vast amounts of water and energy were saved
    through effective irrigation scheduling and management processes. For environmental
    sustainability, authors in [37] developed a system that retrieves real-time data
    and uses it to accurately determine the amount of water needed to irrigate the
    garden. The results of this real-world prototype showed savings between 26% and
    34% in water consumption. Still, the results depend on whether the temperature
    sensor is used alone or humidity and soil moisture sensors. Similar to Industry
    4.0 [38], “Agri-Food 4.0” was introduced in [39]. Inspired by the concept of “agriculture
    4.0”, it aims to meet the challenge of enhancing the performance of the agricultural
    supply chain using efficient and effective methods and procedures. The authors
    have conducted a comparative analysis of more than 100 research papers on the
    new technologies and the latest available supply chain approaches. This analysis
    aims to prospect the future of Agri-Food and answer the relevant outstanding questions,
    e.g., how Agri-Food can better support supply chain decision-making? Escamilla-García
    et al. in [40] proposed the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in precision
    agriculture. According to the authors, these models can be developed to adapt
    to new technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually
    improve the agriculture field. The feedforward architecture is predominant in
    most of the works analyzed in this paper, while the recurrent and hybrid neural
    networks are less used. The benefits and shortcomings of using ANNs in different
    greenhouses applications such as microclimate prediction, control of carbon dioxide,
    and energy expenses are also featured. In [41], the authors proposed Agrinex,
    a modern irrigation mechanism that helps preserve resources by using WSAN. This
    mechanism can be an alternative to the traditional methods used to control agricultural
    irrigation. Agrinex is based on a mesh network consisting of nodes distributed
    in the field and act simultaneously as sensors detecting soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Some nodes of the mesh network act as actuators that control the
    valves of the drip irrigation system. The results show that Agrinex is a promising
    start for many other WSAN applications in the agricultural sector. A GSM-based
    smart irrigation system was presented in [42]. GSM was used to communicate environmental
    data such as the soil moisture, the temperature in the field, the solar power
    data, and the status of the water pumps. Fuzzy Logic control has been exploited
    in this study to take input from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity)
    and decide on the water pump status as output. This system has several advantages.
    The most important ones are the availability of a mobile application to remotely
    monitor the irrigation system and its ability to switch Off the water pumps when
    expected to rain. Compared to manual flooding, the results showed that this smart
    system proved its efficiency in conserving water and energy. A system that relies
    on solar energy to cope with water and energy shortages was developed in [43].
    This system uses Wi-Fi technology to provide the control unit with data related
    to the soil and the weather in the field where they are deployed to decide whether
    to send a switch On command to the pumps to irrigate the area or not. Besides,
    the designed controller monitors the water level in the well and operates in three
    different modes: manual mode, mobile control mode, and fuzzy logic control mode.
    The developed prototype solely relied on solar energy. Moreover, it successfully
    proved its efficiency in providing the appropriate conditions for the plants without
    wasting water and energy. In [44], Y. P. Lin et. argue that the next step in the
    evolution in Smart Agriculture will consist of blockchain usage. They proposed
    an ICT e-agriculture system using blockchain infrastructure. SECTION IV. System
    Architecture and Design Our proposed system consists of seven main elements, see
    Fig. 7: Data Acquisition: It is a Wireless Sensor Network that senses the environment
    data and sends it to the gateway [45]. Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP): The
    unit responsible for data storage, visualization, and processing. In addition
    to that, this platform controls the drip irrigation and lighting system within
    the farm. We deployed this component using a Raspberry Pi along with Node-Red.
    The latter is a local server containing a control unit running algorithms to decide
    whether to pump water from groundwater to basin via water pump #1 or from basin
    to the drip irrigation system via water pump # Wireless Actuator Network (WAN):
    It consists of actuators carrying out decisions issued by the BDAP by switching
    On/Off the water pumps and the lighting bulbs. The actuators are wirelessly connected
    to the BDAP [46]. Renewable Energy: These are solar panels that constitute the
    renewable power source for the farm and battery. Storage Unit: The element responsible
    for storing extra electrical energy produced by the solar panels and reusing it
    when needed to operate the water pumps and lighting. It consists of a Lithium
    battery. Control Unit: It decides whether to forward the produced electricity
    to the Smart Farm or store it in the batteries for future use. Cluster Controller:
    It is responsible for collecting and filtering data related to the smart grid
    and sending it to the Cloud-based IoT platform in real-time mode [47]. FIGURE
    7. IoT based smart agriculture: Testbed general architecture. Show All Our proposed
    system is meant to cope with the rapidly growing need for water-table by controlling
    water pumping, overcoming the shortage in electricity by integrating renewable
    energy, and promoting rational usage of water by regulating drip irrigation. The
    following sections shed further light on the main functionalities of our system.
    A. Data Acquisition The data acquisition is composed of wireless sensors and actuators.
    As depicted in Fig. 8, a sensor node is composed of three elements: Sensor modules:
    soil moisture sensor deployed in the field, temperature, and humidity sensor (DHT11)
    which measures the ambient air temperature and humidity, PIR sensor which detects
    the existence of humans by sensing motion, and for the fields’ security reason,
    the fire sensor is used to detect the presence of a flame or fire, the Ultrasonic
    HC-SR04 sensor which measures the water level in the basin, and the AC sensor
    which measures pumps’ power consumption. Microcontroller: an Arduino Nano board
    that connects all the components is used in this study. Communication module:
    It is responsible for transceiving data between sensors and the BDAP. In this
    study Zigbee module (Xbee series 2 S2C) was used. FIGURE 8. Data flow: from sensors
    to the cloud. Show All In anticipation of any power failure in sunlight deficiency,
    all nodes are powered with an IoT solar system (solar panel 20W, solar battery
    charger, and 25Ah battery). This method makes the WSN data acquisition system
    ideal for agriculture as it can be easily deployed everywhere independently of
    the power installation. This energy harvesting system can guarantee up to 5 days
    of total autonomy for each sensor node. B. Sensor Node Configuration The WSN was
    implemented as a mesh topology using a scalable and reliable firmware named Digimesh.
    Each sensor node can act as a sensor and a router in this configuration using
    the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol [10]. In the current
    study, five wireless sensor nodes were deployed. These send real-time data to
    the BDAP every 15 minutes through the gateway device (sink node) that connects
    the WSN and the BDAP, see Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. Wireless mesh network architecture.
    Show All The wireless actuator nodes we used to control the water pumps are smart
    relays (Sonoff with integrated ESP8266 Wi-Fi Card [48]). These are WiFi-based
    wireless smart switches that operate with a voltage range of 90-250v AC and a
    wireless frequency of 2.4GHz and are compatible with a wide range of appliances.
    We adopted this smart switch as it is cost-effective, reliable, and provides an
    integrated Wi-Fi module. In addition, ensuring communication with the BDAP as
    the Wi-Fi connection might not be available. We enhanced the data acquisition
    and control unit by replacing Sonoff’s smart relay module with a standard relay
    5V connected to an Arduino Nano microcontroller equipped with a GSM/GPRS module
    or a Zigbee module. Fig. 10. shows the wireless sensors used to collect data from
    the field, Fig. 11. shows the wireless sensors used to monitor the water level
    in the basin and the water pump’s energy consumption, and Fig. 12 shows the wireless
    actuator nodes that act on the water pumps to switch them On/Off. FIGURE 10. In-field
    wireless sensor node deployment. Show All FIGURE 11. Basin wireless sensor node
    deployment. Show All FIGURE 12. Wireless smart actuators nodes deployment. Show
    All C. Big Data Analytics Platform Big Data Analytics Platform (BDAP) is the backbone
    of the proposed system. The developed BDAP is based on Node-RED and tested locally
    on a RaspberryPi 3 board running Raspbian OS. Besides, we installed the message
    broker Eclipse-Mosquitto that implements the IoT publish-subscribe messaging protocol
    (MQTT). Following are the main functionalities of our BDAP. 1) Real-Time Data
    Collection and Storage The BDAP receives real-time data from three sources. DigiMesh
    sensors network is distributed in the field to collect and send data to the gateway.
    This data is then forwarded to the BDAP through the USB serial port. Wireless
    sensor/actuator nodes are deployed in groundwater sources and basins. They are
    connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266 module, and they communicate with BDAP using
    the MQTT communication protocol. OpenWeatherMap online forecasting portal: it
    provides up to 5 days forecast of temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure,
    and precipitation. 2) Real-Time Data Visualisation The proposed BDAP contains
    a NodeRED dashboard that displays the acquired data from the different sources
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The main characteristics
    of the GUI are: Visualizing data over short, medium, and long-term periods (daily,
    monthly, and yearly) in charts form. Allowing the user to remotely act on the
    pumps by switching them On/Off via graphical command buttons. Securing data access
    by prompting the user to authenticate through password-secured sessions. Fig.
    13 depicts the interactive real-time control GUI, which displays the real-time
    soil moisture average, temperature average, water level in the basin, irrigation
    duration, rain precipitation, and the state of water pumps (On/Off). The NodeRED
    dashboard was deployed using flowchart programming. FIGURE 13. Real-time control
    interface. Show All 3) Real-Time Irrigation and Water Level Control The control
    flow of the proposed smart irrigation system is presented in Fig. 14. It has two
    primary sequences: 1. Irrigation control (in green), and 2. water level control
    (in blue). FIGURE 14. Deployed system control-flow diagram. Show All a: Real-Time
    Irrigation Control We are adopting fuzzy logic in deploying this component, and
    we dubbed it the Fuzzy Irrigation Control Unit (FICU). The BDAP starts by retrieving
    predicted precipitation data for the next 24 hours from OpenWeatherMap. Depending
    on provided data, two cases are possible: If it is predicted to rain, the FICU
    decides to switch Off the basin waterpump #2 as the rain will likely irrigate
    the field. else, the FICU proceeds as follows: It retrieves the actual soil moisture
    and ambient temperature (Ta) from the wireless sensor nodes and computes their
    average values. The computed average soil moisture is compared to the desired
    one that varies depending on the plant type. In this study, the desired soil moisture
    is set to 60%. The FICU computes a new variable named Soil Moisture Difference
    (SMD). SMD is the difference between the real-time soil moisture average and the
    desired one. If SMD is ≤ 0, FICU uses SMD and Ta to generate the irrigation duration
    (Id) based on the rules mentioned in Table 1. For instance, “If SMD ≪<0 , and
    Ta is Cold, then Id is set to Short”. Then, waterpump #2 is turned On for Id minutes
    to irrigate the field. If SMD >0, the waterpump #2 is turned Off. TABLE 1 Fuzzy
    Rules of Irrigation Duration The use of Ta alongside SMD by FICU is meant to reduce
    water evapotranspiration at high temperatures. FICU comprises four components,
    see Fig. 15: 1. fuzzification module, 2. The Max-Min Inference Engine, 3. The
    Mamdani-type rule base module, and 4. The Centroid defuzzification module. FIGURE
    15. Fuzzy irrigation controller architecture. Show All The inputs and output membership
    functions of the FICU are depicted in Fig. 16. The fuzzification/defuzzification
    of inputs/output is done using trapezoidal and triangular membership functions.
    FIGURE 16. Fuzzy sets memberships functions. Show All Only three membership functions
    were used for each input to improve the program execution speed and avoid the
    memory backlog [36]. However, five membership functions were used for the output
    to cover all variations of Id. b: Real-Time Water Level Control Drip irrigation
    using basins is the most used irrigation method in agriculture. This method has
    several advantages and drawbacks as well. Advantages: Collecting rainwater: by
    collecting rainwater, water table resources are saved, and energy use is reduced.
    Improving water quality: when water is kept in basins, it becomes more oxygenated,
    thus becoming more beneficial for the plants [49]. Drawbacks: Permanent supervision
    cost: This is the sole drawback. Conventional Water Level (WL) control requires
    permanent human supervision, increasing the cost of the products. Our BDAP monitors
    WL in basins based on real-time data provided by a WL sensor to minimize the additional
    cost due to supervision. The blue part in Fig. 14 shows the WL control flowchart.
    Once the field is watered, the BDAP checks the WL value of the basin. If WL <
    50 %, waterpump #1 is turned On. Then, water is pumped from the groundwater source
    to fill the basin to the maximum. Once at maximum, a switch Off command is sent
    to waterpump #1. The whole water irrigation and water level control process is
    regularly repeated (see Fig. 14). We fixed the cycle duration to one hour. The
    solar system used in this study is shown in Fig. 17. It consists of a DC/AC inverter,
    an AC/DC inverter, electrical protection, and a lithium battery. FIGURE 17. Solar
    system real-world deployment. Show All The real-world deployment of the proposed
    SA system is depicted in Fig. 18. The setup consists of solar panels, WSN, IoT
    solar panels with batteries and water pumps. FIGURE 18. Smart agriculture real-world
    deployment. Show All SECTION V. Results & Discussions In order to evaluate our
    system, real-time data was continuously collected remotely via the settled WSN
    over five days in July 2020. Collected data include soil moisture, temperature,
    irrigation duration, water level, solar panels energy production, and the energy
    consumption of waterpump #2. The relevant data variances are depicted in Figures
    19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. FIGURE 19. Real-time temperature and soil moisture averages.
    Show All FIGURE 20. Real-time soil moisture using the traditional irrigation system.

    All FIGURE 22. Real-time water level and groundwater pump state. Show All FIGURE
    23. Real-time PV power production and waterpump #2 energy consumption. Show All
    In Fig. 19, depicting the temperature and soil moisture variances, we notice that
    the day temperature rose to 40 °C, and the nocturnal temperature ranged between
    15 and 20 °C. Unlike conventional irrigation systems (depicted in Fig. 20), the
    soil moisture is optimal and closer to the desired value (60%), and it stays within
    the range of 57%-65%. In conventional irrigation systems, represented in Fig.
    20, the soil moisture varies from 0%-100%. In Fig. 20, we track the real-time
    soil moisture in traditional irrigation systems within five days. This method
    consists of irrigating the field for two consecutive hours daily. The results,
    in Fig. 20, underpin the following drawbacks: The plant is either over or under
    irrigated since the soil moisture varies between those extreme values, and the
    optimal value (60%) is not maintained for an extended period. The quality and
    quantity of the yield would be negatively affected since the soil moisture reaches
    0% for at least five hours each day. High water and energy consumption: in five
    days, 2400L were consumed, which is equivalent to 480L/day for an area of 25m2.
    The last average is used later to evaluate our system compared to conventional
    irrigation in the same region. Our proposed system reacts to weather changes with
    high precision. It raises the soil moisture to 65% during high temperatures (to
    avoid evapotranspiration losses) and does not exceed 62%-63% in low temperatures.
    To study the impact of the irrigation duration on soil moisture, we tracked the
    relevant variances as depicted in Fig. 21. Accordingly, whenever there is a decrease
    in soil moisture, the FICU computes the desired irrigation period to meet the
    desired moisture value and sends a switch On signal to the wireless actuator attached
    to waterpump #2. Accordingly, the higher the temperature is, the longer the irrigation
    duration becomes. When raising the irrigation periods, the evapotranspiration
    losses are reduced, and as a result, the desired soil moisture is continuously
    maintained. Thus, better conditions are provided to the plant, consequently increasing
    the yield’s quality and quantity. Monitoring and controlling the water level in
    the basin is crucial for controlling the drip irrigation system. In this experiment,
    we continuously track the basin water, which varies according to the irrigation
    periods computed by the FICU. For instance, as shown in Fig. 22, when the water
    level exceeds the set threshold (50% in our case), waterpump #1 is turned Off;
    otherwise, waterpump #1 is switched On until the basin is reached entirely complete.
    Thus, the obtained results are consistent with the water level control previously
    presented in section IV. We used a water pump with a water flow rate of 240 L/hour
    in our experiment. Within five days, the total Id was 169 minutes, and 676 L were
    consumed during this time. This rate is equivalent to 135.2 L/day consumed over
    the same area of 25 m2. Accordingly, our proposed smart agriculture system provides
    the field with an average of 54 m3/hectare per day. This water consumption is
    3.55 times lower than in the traditional irrigation system, and thus the energy
    consumption as well since used pumps are electrical ones. Therefore, we conclude
    that the traditional irrigation system is ineffective in maintaining soil moisture
    at the desired value. In addition, it is wasting water and energy resources. The
    real-time energy consumption of waterpump #2 measured by AC sensor and the real-time
    solar panels’ energy production measured by a smart energy meter within five days
    are presented in Fig. 23. We notice from this figure that the maximum energy consumption
    and maximum solar energy production are reached simultaneously (between 12:00
    pm and 4:00 pm). From this figure, we also conclude that the integration of solar
    energy is suitable for smart agriculture without implementing an extensive storage
    system(batteries). In the design of our SA prototype, the cost has been reduced
    to the minimum possible to make it affordable and widely adopted even by small
    and medium farmers. The unit price for every single component is presented in
    Table 2. TABLE 2 Unit Price of the Different Components The total cost of designing
    our SA Prototype with a RaspberryPi, five wireless sensor nodes, 5 IoT solar panels
    and batteries, two smart relays, and a Zigbee gateway is $ 609, which is much
    cheaper than other existing solutions in the market. The proposed SA system is
    an up-and-coming solution for many reasons: Better quantity and quality production.
    Less energy and water consumption. Cost-effectiveness. Open-source. Eco-friendly.
    Easy monitoring (less effort). Designed to promote scalability. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper developed, presented, and deployed an open-source and easy-to-deploy
    smart agriculture system with the main drivers of cost-effectiveness, water consumption
    optimization, and renewable energy integration. The deployed SA system leverages
    up-to-date ICT. We used IoT devices for data acquisition and control (sensors
    and actuators). We also used Cloud Computing for data processing, visualization,
    and data storage. Besides, we recurred to fuzzy logic to implement a fuzzy irrigation
    control unit that decides on the appropriate Id (Irrigation Duration) based on
    real-time processed data. This approach saves water and energy and provides adequate
    conditions for the plants, thus optimizing crops’ yield. Furthermore, this allows
    better monitoring for the water level in the basin and adheres to the conventional
    eco-friendly trend of sustainable agriculture through its total reliance on solar
    energy. The case study results show that our proposed solution is promising compared
    to the traditional irrigation system due to its cost-effectiveness and ability
    to reduce water/energy consumption by 71.8%. As future work, we are paving the
    way towards scaling up our system by deploying our solution in several farms in
    the region, allowing our BDAP (Big Data Analytics Platform) to collect big real-time
    data about water-table usage in the region. Thus appropriate irrigation strategies
    can be derived and analyzed. Besides, we plan further experimentation to enhance
    solar energy production and storage. We will also integrate LoRa wireless sensors/actuators
    network and develop a machine learning system that predicts soil moisture, energy
    production, and energy consumption within a few days. The machine learning algorithm
    can adapt to different crop requirements in moisture levels and improve crop yield.

    is considered one of the most efficient water distribution systems and allows
    increasing water use efficiency if coupled with effective water-saving irrigation
    management strategies as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or partial root-zone
    drying (PRD) techniques. However, application of these strategies makes it crucial
    the real-time monitoring of soil and crop water status, in order to identify appropriate
    irrigation scheduling parameters (irrigation timing and doses) and to prevent
    irreversible damage of plant system and/or crop yield reductions. Even if midday
    stem water potential (MSWP) is considered one of the most affordable indicator
    for direct determinations of crop water status, its measurement requires skilled
    operators, is destructive and time consuming, so that indirect and fast estimations
    are desirable. In this direction, agro-hydrological models can be considered an
    easy-to-use tool for indirect evaluations of soil and crop water status aimed
    to identify irrigation scheduling parameters even when micro-irrigation distribution
    systems and water saving management strategies are adopted. The paper, after examining
    the eco-physiological response of citrus orchards to soil water deficit, assessed
    the potential of FAO-56 agro-hydrological model to identify the crop water stress
    under different irrigation management strategies. Experiments carried out during
    three years (2009–2011) allowed identifying the crop water stress response to
    soil water deficit conditions, also confirming the schematization proposed in
    FAO-56 paper for citrus orchards. Moreover, after evaluating the similarity between
    the measured MSWP with the simulated crop water stress coefficient, Ks, it was
    proved the fairly good performance of FAO-56 agro-hydrological model to predict
    soil water content (RMSE = 0.04 m3 m−3), from one side, and the crop response
    to different irrigation management strategies, from the other. The obtained results
    evidenced that the crop water stress coefficient estimated by the model can be
    used as a suitable indicator to replace the tedious and time-consuming field measurements
    of MSWP. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords FAO-56 modelMidday

    Introduction Water availability is one of the most limiting factors in worldwide
    agriculture, which represents the largest water-consuming sector. Among typical
    Mediterranean crops, citrus represents the second largest fruit crops in the European
    Union. The main producing countries are Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal, with
    a total surface slightly higher than 322,000 ha, corresponding to about 25% of
    the total acreage of fruit orchards (Eurostat, 2014). The most of these orchard
    productions are located in arid or semi-arid regions, where the growing season
    is usually dry. Due to the high crop water requirements and the large surface
    involved, there is an increasing interest to improve crop sustainability in order
    to optimize crop water use, to preserve the productivity maximizing the economic
    benefits, while maintaining environmental quality (Provenzano et al., 2013, Rodriguez-Sinobas
    et al., 2016). Moreover, considering the fact that the annual number of precipitation
    days and the annual precipitation are decreasing, as predicted by climate change
    scenarios for Mediterranean region (Smith et al., 2007), it is evident that implementation
    of strategies aimed to increase water use efficiency can no longer be postponed.
    If micro-irrigation is considered the most efficient water distribution system
    and several researches have been proposed design procedure to improve field distribution
    uniformity (Barragan et al., 2006, Wu et al., 2006), a number of works have been
    emphasizing that “water-saving” management strategies, such as regulated deficit
    irrigation, RDI, (García-Tejero et al., 2010, Gasque et al., 2016, Rodrigues et
    al., 2008) and partial root-zone drying, PRD, (De la Hera et al., 2007, Marsal
    et al., 2008, Romero et al., 2012), can contribute to significant reductions of
    the seasonal crop needs and consequently to increase water use efficiency. However,
    the most effective way to increase water use efficiency is the precise control
    of irrigation that should be supported by soil/plant-based water status indicators
    (leaf/stem water potential, sap flow, trunk diameter, infrared thermometry) aimed
    to identify appropriate irrigation scheduling parameters (irrigation timing and
    doses). Under RDI, water is generally supplied at levels below full crop transpiration
    during specific periods of the growing season. Operating in this way it is possible
    to balance the plant vigor with the potential production (Costa et al., 2007,
    De Souza et al., 2005), by limiting the irrigation volumes. On the other hand,
    PRD method involves the exposure of half of the roots system in a drying state,
    while the remaining roots are wetted, so to alter the irrigated roots in time
    cycles. Application of these water saving strategies, however, makes it crucial
    to monitor crop water status in order to identify, in real time, the level of
    water stress to which the crop is subjected, so as to avoid irreversible consequences
    to the crop, as well as the loss of productions. Leaf water potential (LWP) is
    a commonly used variable to describe crop water status and, when measured at predawn
    or midday, represents an indicator of any instantaneous crop water stress condition.
    The cumulative integral of LWP, referred to a specific time or during certain
    phenological stages, represents a link between the short-term stress and the long-term
    growth response (Myers, 1988). Even if the measurements of leaf water potential
    are considered one of the most affordable methods for direct determinations of
    crop water status, these determinations require skilled operators, are destructive
    and time consuming, so that indirect estimations are desirable. In this direction,
    agro-hydrological models can be considered as an easy-to-use tool for indirect
    evaluations of soil and crop water status, as recently demonstrated for olive
    groves by Rallo et al. (2014a), as well as to estimate other parameters related
    to the crop development (Minacapilli et al., 2009, Cammalleri et al., 2013). However,
    the application of agro-hydrological models, require the preliminary calibration
    and validation of the algorithms used to schematize the different processes occurring
    in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum, based on site-specific experimental investigations.
    For a long time, irrigation in citrus orchards has been scheduled according to
    the FAO method described in the paper number 56 (FAO-56), by considering the single
    or dual crop coefficient approach (Allen et al., 1998). During the different phenological
    stages, crop coefficients can be chosen among tabular values or according to experimental
    results. However, this scheduling strategy has some uncertainty, particularly
    in citrus orchards where crop water use depends on tree light interception (Consoli
    et al., 2006) or crop load (Yonemoto et al., 2004). González-Altozano and Castel
    (1999) proved that in citrus orchards, fruit drop is not very sensitive to soil
    water deficit applied during the phase-II of fruit growth and, if returning to
    the full water dosage for a sufficiently long period before harvesting, it is
    possible to compensate the fruit growth (Cohen and Goell, 1988). On the other
    hand, Hutton et al. (2007) evidenced that even if water restrictions are applied
    only during the linear phase of fruit development, severe plant water stress might
    reduce the final fruit size at harvest. If from one side FAO-56 model has been
    diffusely applied, its potential to detect water stress conditions has not been
    largely investigated yet. For different crop systems in fact, model validation
    has been generally carried out based on the comparison between measured and estimated
    soil water contents (Sammis et al., 2012) without considering the actual crop
    water status. Researches in this direction should allow to verify how water management
    can affect the different adaptive crop behavior to water stress under different
    irrigation water saving strategies and environmental conditions, avoiding wrong
    decisions in irrigation water management programs, mainly in those environments
    prone to drought. The main objectives of the paper were: i) to investigate on
    the eco-physiological response of the citrus orchard to soil water deficit and
    ii) to assess the potential of FAO-56 agro-hydrological model to identify water
    stress conditions when the crop is maintained under Regulated Deficit Irrigation
    (RDI) applied only during the phase II of fruit growth. After the initial model
    calibration, based on the comparison between measured and simulated soil water
    contents in the root zone, its ability to identify actual crop water stress in
    the periods of water restriction was assessed according to the observed similarity
    between the temporal dynamic of the simulated water stress coefficient (Ks) with
    the measured midday stem water potentials, MSWP. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Site description, experimental design and irrigation treatments The field experiments
    were carried out during three years (from 2009 to 2011) in Senyera, Spain (39°
    3′ N, 0° 30′ W, 23 m a.s.l), in a commercial citrus orchard planted with Navel
    orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) grafted onto Cleopatra mandarin trees (Citrus
    reshni Hort.). The orchard was planted in 1982 in a square configuration, with
    spacing between plants equal to 5 m. Three treatments, including one full irrigation
    and two RDI and at least 8 plants per treatments excluding the borders, were applied
    in order to replace different amounts of irrigation needs, IN, obtained by multiplying
    reference evapotranspiration to the crop coefficient, Kc, after subtracting the
    precipitation of the period. Reference evapotranspiration was evaluated according
    to the Penman-Monteith equation, in the version modified by FAO (Allen et al.,
    1998), whereas the crop coefficient, Kc, was determined by using the site-specific
    polynomial equation, as a function of the measured canopy fraction cover, fc (Castel,
    2005). In the full irrigation treatment (T100), irrigation dose (Id) replaced
    about 110%IN in 2009 and 100%IN in 2010 and 2011, whereas in the two RDI treatments,
    Id was scaled to a total amount of 60%IN (T60) and 40%IN (T40), only during the
    phase II of fruit growth (initial fruit enlargement phase, occurring from July
    13 to September 13 in 2009, from July 12 to August 30 in 2010 and finally, from
    July 12 to August 28 in 2011), being the plots irrigated as T100 during the remaining
    periods of the year. Irrigation water was automatically supplied by a drip system
    consisting of two drip lines per tree row laid on the soil surface at a distance
    of approximately 0.9 m from the row, including eight 7.4 l h−1 pressure-compensating
    emitters per single tree. One flow meter per irrigation treatment recorded the
    exact volumes of water applied during each irrigation event, whose frequency ranged
    between two irrigations per week during winter and six irrigation per week during
    summer. In the period when deficit irrigation was applied to T60 and T40, water
    in the soil was restored every 1–2 day. The soil textural class, according to
    USDA, is sandy loam, with sand and clay contents ranging between 46 and 60% and
    18–22% respectively. The fertilizer application was the same in all the plots,
    with a seasonal application of 260, 65 and 130 kg ha−1 of N, P2O5 and K2O respectively,
    from April to October. Meteorological data were acquired from a standard weather
    station located about 500 m apart the experimental orchard and belonging to the
    Irrigation Technology Service (STR) of Valencian Institute of Agrarian Research
    (IVIA). 2.2. Monitoring soil and crop water status In each treatment, soil water
    content (SWC) was monitored along a soil profile with a FDR (Frequency Domain
    Reflectometry) down-hole probe (Enviroscan, Sentek), installed at distances of
    about 1.0 m and 0.5 m from the tree and the dripline respectively. Each probe
    allowed monitoring soil water content at four depths (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 m)
    every 15 min interval and then the measurements were averaged at daily time step.
    Crop water status was monitored according to the Midday Stem Water Potential (MSWP,
    MPa), measured with a pressure chamber (Solfranc SF-Pres-35), approximately every
    week and on three trees for each treatment, by following the procedure described
    in Turner (1981). Determinations were carried out in at least two mature leaves,
    bagged in plastic bags and covered with a silver foil at minimum two hours prior
    the measurement. To assess the model ability to identify the stress conditions
    consequent to the adopted RDI strategies, the Water Stress Integral (SMSWP, MPa.
    day) was calculated according to Myers (1988): (1) where is the mean midday steam
    water potential for any time interval (i,i + 1), c is a threshold of MSWP below
    which crop water stress conditions occur and n is the number of days in the interval.
    The c value was subtracted from each to emphasize the relative difference of crop
    water status between treatments (Myers, 1988). Similarly, using FAO-56 model,
    the water stress integral, SFAO-56, was calculated as: (2) where is the mean stress
    coefficient for any interval (i,i + 1), and the datum value equal to 1.0, corresponds
    to the minimum stress level reached in absence of water stress. 2.3. Description
    and parametrization of FAO-56 model FAO-56 model (Allen et al., 1998) simulates
    the root zone depletion, D, at a daily time step, according to a simple tipping
    bucket approach: (3) where Di (mm) and Di−1(mm) are the root zone depletions at
    the end of day i and i − 1, Pi (mm) is the net precipitation, ROi is the surface
    runoff, ETai (mm) is the actual evapotranspiration, Ii is the irrigation depth
    and DPi (mm) is the deep percolation of water moving out of the root zone. The
    domain of the depletion equation ranges between 0, occurring when the soil is
    at field capacity, to a maximum value related to the total plant available water,
    TAW (mm), evaluated as: (4) where SWCfc (m3 m−3) and SWCwp (m3 m−3) are the soil
    water contents corresponding to field capacity and wilting point and Zr (m) is
    the depth of the root system. The multiplicative coefficient adjusts the units
    in order to express TAW in mm. When considering the dual crop coefficients approach,
    crop potential evapotranspiration, ETc, evaluated in absence of soil water deficit,
    is obtained by multiplying the Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration, ET0
    (Allen et al., 1998) to a coefficient, Kcb + Ke, composed by two terms. The first,
    Kcb, is the basal crop coefficient accounting for the plant transpiration, whereas
    the second, Ke, is the soil evaporation (E) coefficient, accounting for the topsoil
    evaporation. When soil water content in the root zone and in the evaporative layer
    drop below the relative critical levels, crop water stress and friction on soil
    evaporation phenomena occur and the amount of actual crop transpiration and soil
    evaporation are evaluated by multiplying Kcb and Ke, respectively, to a transpiration
    (Ks) and an evaporation (Kr) reduction coefficient. Analytically, actual evapotranspiration
    can be evaluated as: (5) Both the coefficients Ks and Kr range between 0 and 1.
    In absence of crop water stress Ks = 1, whereas under soil water limiting conditions,
    Ks < 1. After a rainfall or following irrigation Kr is 1, and soil evaporation
    is maximum. As the soil evaporative layer dries, Kr becomes lower than one and
    evaporation decreases till reaching zero when no water is available for evaporation
    in the upper soil layer. The reduction factor, Ks, is a function of the amount
    of water crop depleted from the root zone (D) and, when D exceeds the readily
    available water (D > RAW), can be calculated as: (6) The depletion coefficient,
    p, in Eq. (6) accounts for the resistance of crop to water stress and the values
    corresponding to different crops are tabulated in the original publication (Allen
    et al., 1998). Considering that p depends on the atmospheric evaporative demand,
    a function for adjusting p for ETc is usually applied (Van Diepen et al., 1988).
    In FAO-56 model, irrigation timing can be evaluated based on the management allowed
    depletion, MAD (Merriam, 1966), depending on management and economic factors in
    addition to the other eco-physiological factors influencing p. When irrigation
    is scheduled in absence of crop water stress, the value of MAD can be assumed
    equal to p. On the contrary, when irrigation is managed under water-deficit conditions,
    the MAD parameter is higher than p. This last circumstance is typical of the semiarid
    Mediterranean environments. The original algorithm proposed in the FAO-56 paper
    (“Appendix 8: Spreadsheet for applying the dual Kc procedure in irrigation scheduling”)
    only permits to schedule full irrigation (MAD = p) and not considers crops maintained
    under water stress conditions. This circumstance represents a limitation in the
    Mediterranean environment, where water is often a limiting factor for crop production.
    For this reason, Rallo et al. (2012) proposed a first amendment of the original
    algorithm to allow irrigation scheduling of arboreal crops maintained under soil
    water deficit conditions. The amendment allowed to separate the eco-physiological
    factor, affected by the crop stress, from the management allowed depletion term,
    that is related to the farmer choices and depends on unsystematic variables like
    the economic factors. Moreover, for drought tolerant crops, it has been observed
    that a convex shape better represents the crop water stress function (Rallo and
    Provenzano, 2013), so that a further adjustment of FAO 56 model was proposed to
    improve its performance in the estimation of actual transpiration fluxes and soil
    water contents for drought tolerant crops under soil water deficit conditions
    (Rallo et al., 2014a). In order to run the model, average soil water content at
    field capacity and wilting point were assumed equal to 0.24 cm3 cm−3 and 0.12
    cm3 cm−3, based on the soil water retention curves previously estimated, at different
    depths, on the same soil by Martí et al. (2013). The soil Available Water (AW)
    resulted therefore equal to 120 mm m−1. Reference daily evapotranspiration, ET0,
    was computed by means of meteorological data and the FAO Penman-Monteith model.
    The basal crop coefficients, Kcb, were obtained from Table 17 of the FAO-56 manual
    (Allen et al., 1998), by considering a citrus orchard characterized by a fraction
    cover of 70% and the absence of ground cover. The values of Kcb in the mid and
    final crop development stages were then adjusted to account for non standard climate
    conditions (minimum relative air humidity and wind speed different than 45% and
    2.0 m s−1). Table 1 summarizes the values of the variables used for model application
    and the related data sources. Table 1. Values assumed for the variables used for

    = 1, a soil water content corresponding to the field capacity (SWCfc = 0.27 m3
    m−3), as consequence of the copious rainfall occurred during each antecedent period.
    2.4. Statistical analysis for model validation The model performance was evaluated
    based on the root mean square error (RMSE) and the mean bias error (MBE), defined
    as: (7) (8) where N is the number of measured data, and Xsim,i and Xobs,i are
    the predicted and measured values of any considered variable (Kennedy and Neville,
    1986). Moreover, a Student t-test allowed evaluating the statistical differences
    between measured and simulated data (Kennedy and Neville, 1986): (9) For any fixed
    significance level, α, the differences are statistically significant if the calculated
    t is lower than a critical threshold, tcrit. In this respect, a significance level
    of α = 0.05 was assumed. Finally, the predictive power of the model was evaluated
    according to the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, E, (Nash and Sutcliffe,
    1970, Willmot, 1981): (10) A perfect match between simulated and observed data
    is represented by E = 1, whereas for E = 0 the model prediction has the same accuracy
    of the measured mean; values of the efficiency coefficient lower than 0 indicate
    that the mean of measured values is a better predictor than the considered model.

    1.7 3.4 7.7 6.7 15.3 24.5 1.5 13.4 24.8 As can be observed, during the considered
    years there was a certain variability in the rainfall distribution, that was characterized
    by yearly values ranging between 840 mm in 2009 and only 566 mm in 2010 (Fig.
    1f); on the other hand, even if the distribution of reference evapotranspiration,
    ET0, was similar during the three years, with daily peaks between 5.5 mm and 6.5
    mm generally occurring in July (Fig. 1d), slight differences were observed in
    cumulated yearly values, equal to 1202 mm, 1132 mm and 1067 mm in 2009, 2010 and
    2011, respectively. The total irrigation depths supplied in treatment T100 was
    quite variable in the three years and ranging between 512 mm in 2009, and 315
    mm in 2011. Of course, during the three years, T60 and T40 received a total irrigation
    depth lower than T100, as a consequence of the minor volumes applied during the
    periods of water restrictions. However, it has to be noticed that in 2009 the
    total volumes provided in the three treatments were considerably higher if compared
    to the other two seasons; during the first year, in fact, experiments permitted
    tuning the system in order to identify the duration of watering and therefore
    the actual volume to provide during each irrigation event. During the periods
    of water restrictions, total rainfall, P, and reference evapotranspiration, ET0,
    was determined to be equal to 19.7 mm and 405.0 mm in 2009, higher than those
    registered in the corresponding periods of 2010 and 2011. On average during the
    three years, MSWP in T100 ranged between −1.00 MPa and −1.17 MPa, whereas in T60
    varied between −1.05 MPa and −1.65 MPa and finally, in T40, between −1.14 MPa
    and −1.98 MPa. According to the MSWP thresholds suggested by Goldhamer (2012),
    these values evidenced mild stress levels in treatments T100 (MSWP > −1.5 MPa),
    and slightly higher stress levels in T60 and T40 in which, however, only occasionally
    the stress conditions become severe (MSWP < −2.0 MPa). As can be observed in Table
    2 the minimum values of MSWP observed during the periods of restricted water applications
    declined at decreasing irrigation amount. Similar results can be obtained when
    considering the water-stress integral (SMSWP, MPa.day), evaluated with Eq. (1),
    by assuming a value of c = −1.0 MPa (Gasque et al., 2016) in agreement with González-Altozano
    and Castel, 1999, corresponding approximately to the maximum MSWP measured in
    the field (Table 2). For the three treatments, Fig. 2 shows the values of water-stress
    integral, SMSWP, during the periods of water restriction versus the total provided
    irrigation depths. As can be observed, the value of SMSWP decreased at increasing
    irrigation depth, being T100 characterized by very low values of the dependent
    variable. The robust relationship between the two variables, characterized by
    a regression coefficient R2 = 0.82 (significant at p < 0.01 level according to
    the Pearson’s correlation coefficient), confirms that SMSWP can be considered
    a good indicator of the plant-water relationships, as suggested by García-Tejero
    et al. (2010). Thus, in the absence or under limited precipitation, this indicator
    can be used to predict the total irrigation depth to apply in order to achieve
    a desired stress level during the phase II of fruit growth (Goldhamer, 2012).

    Fig. 2. Values of water stress integral, SMSWP, versus the irrigation depth applied
    during the periods of water restriction, I, evaluated by using Eq. (5) with c
    = −1.0. However, it has to be noticed that this relationship is influenced by
    the threshold value, c, assumed in Eq. (1) and its precision is affected by the
    time step during which MSWPs are measured. In order to improve the estimation
    of SMSWP it is therefore necessary to carefully estimate the value of c, as well
    as to increase the acquisition frequency of MSWP even by using new sensors, like
    the non-invasive Zim-probe (Zimmermann et al., 2008, Zimmermann et al., 2010,
    Martínez-Gimeno et al., 2016) or field spectroscopy (Rallo et al., 2014b). Therefore,
    further experiments will be addressed to identify appropriate threshold value
    and to assess the consequences that the assumption of the coefficient c may have
    on the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the productions. When considering
    the average depth applied in each irrigation event and in the periods of water
    restriction, the values of SMSWP are still correlated with the average irrigation
    depth, with a slope of the regression curve that declines at increasing of irrigation
    depth (Fig. 3). Under the examined frequency of watering therefore, the values
    of SMSWP also depends on how irrigation was managed and particularly on the average
    irrigation depth provided in each watering. Download : Download high-res image

    status evaluated distinctly at the four different soil depths (0.1 m, 0.3 m, 0.5
    m, 0.7 m) and expressed in terms of soil water content (SWC) or depletion (D).
    The values of SWC were determined as the average of 48 records acquired per day
    (one measurement every 15 min) during the period of water restriction, and can
    be considered representative of a soil layer with a thickness of about 10 cm (Provenzano
    et al., 2015). Download : Download high-res image (181KB) Download : Download

    and corresponding soil water status expressed in terms of soil water content,
    SWC, and depletion, D, during the periods of water restriction. Dotted and solid
    vertical lines correspond to wilting point and field capacity, respectively. As
    can be observed, the eco-physiological crop response to soil water deficit was
    quite different for the investigated soil layers and treatments. When considering
    the soil top-layer, the evaporative process was dominant if compared to the root
    water uptake, so that MSWP did not depend on soil water status. At the higher
    depths, where root water uptake was largely concentrated, crop water status was
    affected by soil water content, especially for treatment T40, characterized by
    the largest variability of the investigated variables. However, if considering
    the average soil water contents of the whole soil profile, Fig. 5 shows the variability
    between MSWP and the average soil water status. As can be noticed, at higher soil
    water contents, MSWPs are dispersed around to a value of −1.0 MPa and tend to
    decline at decreasing SWCs. Even though it is quite difficult to identify a clear
    threshold of depletion, the value of D* ≈ 20 mm, corresponding to a SWC* ≈ 0.22
    can be assumed as the critical threshold for the considered soil. This threshold
    separates two different plant behaviors: i) D < D* for which MSWPs are approximately
    constant and equal to −1.0 MPa, expressing a condition of absence or limited water
    stress (González-Altozano and Castel, 1999) and ii) D > D* for which the lower
    is the depletion, the smaller is the MSWP as a consequence of the progressively
    increasing crop water stress. Download : Download high-res image (121KB) Download

    function, Ks(D), proposed by FAO-56 is also represented in the secondary axes

    in a certain way, by the crop water stress function schematized by FAO-56 model,
    according to which any reduction of plant transpiration (stress coefficient),
    Ks, occurring for D > RAW, is linearly related to the depletion D (Eq. (6)). For
    the investigated soil-crop system however, the observed depletion threshold correspond
    to a coefficient p of Eq. (6) of about 0.2, lower than p = 0.5 proposed in Table
    22 of FAO-56 paper (Allen et al., 1998). 3.3. Validation of FAO-56 model and identification

    the three years (from left to right). The standard deviations of measured values,
    ±σ, are also indicated with grey bars. For treatment T100, the temporal variability
    of average SWC in the root zone resulted in general more limited than the other
    two treatments, as a consequence of the higher irrigation volumes applied. The
    average SWCs ranged between 0.24 cm3 cm−3 and 0.30 cm3 cm−3, except that for short
    periods when they were slightly lower. This circumstance evidences that the average
    soil water content of the soil profile was generally higher than field capacity
    (SWCfc = 0.24 m3 m−3), with values sometimes close to saturation. On the other
    hand, the dynamic of SWC in T60 and T40 during the examined years resulted to
    quite different, in line with the rainfall events and the applied amount of irrigation.
    In both these treatments, the average SWCs resulted slightly lower than the field
    capacity for long periods of the monitoring period, while evident reductions of
    water availability in the soil profile occurred mainly in the second half year
    of 2010 and only episodically in 2011. It is interesting to notice that during
    the periods of water restriction, the dispersion of measured SWCs generally increased
    at decreasing SWCs, due to the partial wetting of soil profile occurring in RDI
    treatments (T60 and T40). Table 3 shows the statistical parameters associated
    to the comparison between simulated and measured soil water contents, obtained
    for the three treatments during the whole period of observation. Table 3. Results

    root mean square errors were always lower than 0.04 m3 m−3 suggesting that there
    was a substantial agreement between the average soil water contents in the soil
    layer from 0.1 m to 0.7 m depth and the corresponding values simulated by the
    model. According to the Student t-test, the observed differences between measured
    and simulated SWCs in the three treatments were statistically not significant
    at a significance level of α = 0.05. According to the statistical analysis therefore,
    it is evident that FAO-56 model can be considered suitable to reproduce the temporal
    variability of soil water content in the root zone. This result, in conjunction
    with the accurate analysis of crop response to water stress, can be used for irrigation
    scheduling purposes, by avoiding costly and time-consuming field monitoring. Similar
    results have been recently obtained even for drought tolerant crops like olive
    trees (Rallo et al., 2014a) even if in that case it was necessary to implement
    on FAO-56 model, a more appropriate crop response function to water stress. The
    ability of the model to identify the actual water stress conditions occurring
    in RDI treatments, was assessed according to the observed similarity between measured
    midday stem water potentials, MSWP, and simulated crop water stress coefficient,
    Ks, evaluated as the ratio between actual and maximum transpiration simulated
    by the model. Fig. 7, Fig. 8 show, respectively for T60 and T40 treatments, the
    temporal dynamics of reference evapotranspiration, precipitation and irrigation
    events, (upper row), as well as measured midday stem water potentials, MSWP, and
    simulated crop water stress coefficient, Ks, (middle row). In the lowest row of
    the figure, the cumulated water stress integrals during the periods of water restriction,

    stress integral, Scum, during the periods of water restriction (lower row), referred
    to T40 treatment. As can be detected, in both treatments the absolute values of
    MSWP generally spread around 1.0 MPa for the most of examined years, identifying
    conditions of negligible water stress (González-Altozano and Castel, 1999), except
    that in the periods of water restriction, coincident with the phase II of the
    fruit growth (Gasque et al., 2016). During such periods and in both RDI treatments
    in fact, it can be noticed that MSWPs, after an initial decline, followed patterns
    that depends on the water supply (irrigation or rainfall). During the three years,
    the minimum absolute values of MSWP resulted equal to −1.30, −2.09 and −1.53 MPa
    in T60, and equal to −1.48, −2.50 and −1.95 MPa in T40. The lowest crop water
    stress observed in 2009 was an obvious consequence of the higher irrigation volumes
    provided, as previously discussed. When considering the model results in terms
    of simulated stress coefficient Ks, it can be easily verified that this indicator
    can be used for explaining the variability of measured MSWPs. As can be observed
    in fact, the dynamic of Ks coefficient follows the temporal patterns of MSWP,
    as a consequence of the correct schematization of the stress function under crop
    water deficit conditions. Even considering the cumulative values of the water
    stress integral, Scum, during the water restriction periods (lowest row of Fig.
    7, Fig. 8), it is possible to notice that the modeled Scum,FAO-56 values fit fairly
    well to the measured Scum,MSWP, confirming the ability of the model to identify
    the differences, in terms of temporal patterns of water stress integral, recognized
    among the treatments. Fig. 9a shows the measured Midday Stem Water Potential (absolute
    values), MSWP, as a function of the simulated water stress coefficient, Ks, during
    the periods of water restriction, whereas Fig. 9b illustrates the comparison between
    cumulated water stress integrals evaluated according to measured MSWP (Scum,MSWP)
    and simulated Ks (Scum,FAO-56), based on a weekly time step. Download : Download

    coefficient, Ks, obtained during the periods of water restriction. b) Measured
    cumulated water stress (SMSWP) during two consecutive measurements (weekly time
    step) as a function of the corresponding simulated water stress (SFAO-56). As
    can be noticed in Fig. 9a the two variables are linearly correlated, with intercept
    and angular coefficient equal to 2.14 MPa and −1.14 MPa (R2 = 0.73), respectively.
    This relation allows extrapolating the −2.0 MPa of MSWP proposed as threshold
    value in this same orchard (Gasque et al., 2016) to a Ks of 0.12. On the other
    hand, when considering the cumulative values of the water stress integral (Fig.
    9b) it can be observed that, for each treatment, a strong linear correlation exist
    between Scum,MSWP and Scum,FAO-56. Of course, the variability ranges of both the
    considered variables increase at decreasing of the applied irrigation depth, as
    a consequence of the higher cumulated stress levels achieved by crop. In addition,
    even the slope of the regression relationships, depending on the adopted irrigation
    strategy, increases at increasing of the cumulative stress levels, underlining
    the sensitivity of the model to identify the observed variability of crop water
    status, characterizing the different examined treatments. This last result indicates
    that under the examined conditions the model can be successfully used to indirectly
    estimate and with a fairly good approximation, the cumulative stress occurring
    in the field during the phase II of fruit growth and corresponding to any pre-fixed
    irrigation strategy. 4. Conclusions In the paper, the eco-physiological response
    of citrus orchard to soil water deficit conditions was investigated for three
    years, through field measurements of soil and plant water status carried out in
    a commercial citrus orchard located near the town of Senyera, Spain. Three different
    irrigation treatments, including one full irrigation (T100) and two regulated
    deficit irrigation were in particular examined. In the later treatment, irrigation
    water supply was scheduled according to different percentage of irrigation needs
    (T60 and T40) applied only during the phase II of fruit growth (approximately
    from mid of July to the beginning of September), and the crop was irrigated at
    T100 during the other periods of the year. Soil water status was expressed in
    terms of soil water content (SWC) or depletion (D), whereas crop water status
    considered the midday stem water potentials (MSWP) measured in the field, as well
    as the water stress integral evaluated in the periods of water restriction. Experimental
    data evidenced the absence of stress in treatment T100 and mild or moderate stress
    levels in T60 and in T40 in which, however, conditions of severe stress were only
    occasionally achieved. The analysis showed a strong correlation between the water
    stress integral and the applied irrigation depth, which can be used to predict
    the seasonal irrigation volumes to be provided when a desired crop stress level
    is required. On the other hand, MSWPs were dispersed around a value of −1.0 MPa
    when the average SWCs in the soil profile ranged between the soil field capacity
    SWCfc = 0.24 m3 m−3 and a threshold value of soil water content of SWC* ≈ 0.22m3
    m−3, corresponding to a soil depletion D* ≈ 20 mm. At values of SWC ≤ 0.22m3 m−3,
    MSWP was linearly decreasing at decreasing SWC (increasing D), as a consequence
    of the gradually rising crop water stress. Finally, the performance of FAO-56
    model to identify the temporal dynamic of soil and crop water status, under different
    irrigation strategies, was demonstrated. The comparison between measured and simulated
    soil water contents in the root zone evidenced that the model is able to predict,
    with reasonable accuracy, the average SWC in the root zone, with differences statistically
    not significant and errors of estimation always lower than 0.04 m3 m−3. On the
    other hand, the model ability to predict the actual crop water stress was demonstrated
    according to the observed similarity between the temporal dynamic of the simulated
    water stress coefficient (Ks) with the measured midday stem water potentials,
    MSWP. In fact, it was observed that the temporal variability of MSWP can be explained
    by the dynamic of simulated Ks. Even extending the analysis to crop water stress
    cumulated during periods of water restriction, it was observed how the model predictions
    fitted quite well to the corresponding measured, confirming the suitability of
    the model to identify the differences, in terms of temporal pattern of water stress
    integral, characterizing the examined treatments. After a site-specific calibration
    accounting for different irrigation strategies therefore, the cumulative water
    stress integral evaluated by the model can be used as a surrogate variable of
    MSWP for irrigation timing established according to “model-based” irrigation scheduling,
    even under periods of water restrictions. Acknowledgements Research was carried

    \ Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) consists of managing crops by observing,\
    \ measuring, and acting against\nthe many variable factors that aﬀect them. Systems\
    \ for PA can be based on satellite navigation\nsystems or terrestrial systems\
    \ for geographic information and sensors located in the plot. These\nsystems collect\
    \ information to be used to make decisions with greater precision and to optimize\
    \ crop\nyields. PA contributes to producing a more eﬃcient and ecological agriculture.\
    \ It allows saving\non phytosanitary products, fertilizers, and reducing the amount\
    \ of nitrogen used. PA reduces costs\nand optimizes agriculture. It also reduces\
    \ the environmental impact by optimizing the use of water,\npesticides, and machinery\
    \ fuel; thus, greater production is obtained with fewer resources.\nIn order to\
    \ develop eﬃcient PA systems, there is an increasing trend towards using smart\
    \ decision\nsystems (SDS). The acceptance of SDS solutions in many industrial\
    \ sectors that specialize in agriculture\nis limited by the fact that building\
    \ an SDS requires a signiﬁcant investment of time and knowledge. If it\nis to\
    \ beneﬁt from technological advances, agricultural activity has therefore to absorb\
    \ not only technical\nexpertise, but also skilled knowledge of engineering. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) [1] can be used\nfor that purpose, despite several\
    \ immense challenges linked to big data analytics, cloud computing,\nand new business\
    \ models in SDS.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216; doi:10.3390/agronomy9050216\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\

    \ reported rapid developments in the IoT and cloud computing, applied in this\
    \ \npaper to a field known as smart farming. Algorithmic training processes for\
    \ decision-making \nsupport are highly complex tasks, with many problematic issues\
    \ found in models that are \nautomatically induced from data through big data\
    \ applications [3]. Perhaps the most problematic is \nthe value chain that refers\
    \ to the sequence of activities from data capture to decision making, \ninvolving\
    \ data marketing, decision trees, and rule injection procedures. The advantage\
    \ of these \nmodels is that they consist of individual units of knowledge (rules)\
    \ that can be separately viewed, \nevaluated, processed, deleted, and even edited.\
    \ In a business process [4], for example, work laid out \nin a set of logically\
    \ related tasks can be performed to achieve a defined business outcome. \nBig\
    \ data represents the information assets that are characterized by high volumes,\
    \ high-speed \nprocessing and a variety of inputs. Processing such information\
    \ requires specific technology and \nanalytical methods [5] for their transformation\
    \ into a value chain. \nThis paper presents a complete implementation of a smart\
    \ decision support system prototype, \nwhich automatically learns decision rules\
    \ from data, thereby permitting the domain expert to edit \nthe resulting rule\
    \ base, which can apply the rules to achieve incoming objects. As agriculture\
    \ \nconsumes about 70% of all fresh water resources, one important aspect of green\
    \ farming is \neconomical and efficient use of water [6]. Water consumption percentages\
    \ can be decreased through \nefficient water management, where irrigation needs\
    \ are adjusted to supply. Decision trees generate \nrules to enhance the use of\
    \ irrigation water, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. A web platform can convert \n\
    the results of data-based decision making into user-friendly public information\
    \ that is only posted \nfollowing a decision maker review process. The major advantage\
    \ is integration into a unique \nplatform to control farming decisions such as\
    \ irrigation system control, fertilization, pesticides, and \nan open data network,\
    \ all in one. In addition, our system includes rules based on variable-rate \n\

    which automatically learns decision rules from data, thereby permitting the domain\
    \ expert to edit the\nresulting rule base, which can apply the rules to achieve\

    \ one important aspect of green farming is economical and\neﬃcient use of water\
    \ [6]. Water consumption percentages can be decreased through eﬃcient water\n\
    management, where irrigation needs are adjusted to supply. Decision trees generate\
    \ rules to enhance\nthe use of irrigation water, fertilizers, pesticides, etc.\
    \ A web platform can convert the results of\ndata-based decision making into user-friendly\
    \ public information that is only posted following a\ndecision maker review process.\
    \ The major advantage is integration into a unique platform to control\nfarming\
    \ decisions such as irrigation system control, fertilization, pesticides, and\
    \ an open data network,\nall in one. In addition, our system includes rules based\
    \ on variable-rate irrigation (VRI) [7]. VRI is a\nnew technique that allows optimization\
    \ of irrigation application, considering the status of ﬁeld and\nweather. In most\
    \ cases, these systems are implemented by using a center pivot irrigation system\
    \ that\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n3 of 19\ncan reduce the total irrigation water\
    \ volume required to grow ﬁeld crops. According to Reference [8],\nthis kind of\
    \ system is able to reduce irrigation water use by 8% compared to uniform irrigation\n\
    application. Considering this idea, we designed [9], developed, and tested an\
    \ intelligent system for\nirrigation control of urban lawns. The system is based\
    \ on the use of a multisensor node composed by\nhumidity and temperature for soil\
    \ and air, as well as a rain sensor. The multisensor node is controlled\nby an\
    \ intelligent algorithm that takes into account the real time values provided\
    \ by the sensors and the\nstored data of previous measurements. The intelligent\
    \ algorithm is responsible for analyzing the data\nand deciding on the amount\
    \ of water to be used in a given area. Using actual annual meteorological\nvalues\
    \ of a city with diﬀerent water requirements, the system’s operation was simulated.\
    \ The results\nshowed that for a landscaped area of about 140 ha, we could save\
    \ around 6% of the irrigation water,\nwhich would be equivalent to about 22 million\
    \ liters of water. Finally, the complete system behaves\nas a collaborative platform,\
    \ taking into account the experience of other users and previous events\nintroduced\
    \ into the system. A system with these features can help farmers to enhance the\
    \ activity\nsustainability, at the same time, that a more controlled use of chemical\
    \ products and natural resources\nwill protect our environment and groundwater\
    \ resources.\nThis study is organized as follows. Section 2 will present the reasoning\
    \ behind the study and\nrelated works. Section 3 will describe the individual\
    \ steps of the preparation process of a classiﬁcation\nrule set. Section 4 will\
    \ then detail the software components of the engine and, in Section 5, the web\n\
    platform and the processing of open data will be outlined. Finally, in Section\
    \ 6, the conclusions will\npresent the advantages of the demonstrated model and\
    \ future avenues of work will be suggested.\n2. Related Works\nThe generation\
    \ of “business rules” from data-mining results is an emerging research area. To\
    \ the\nbest of our knowledge, the only publicly available software solution to\
    \ business rule learning is\nRule Learner, which forms part of the Open-Rules\
    \ Decision Management System. According to\nthe SOA paradigm, software should\
    \ function as cooperating services, as described in a previous\nwork [1]. However,\
    \ there have been several experimental systems developed in the machine learning\n\
    community with related functionality. The Drools system [3], used in our solution,\
    \ is a business rules\nmanagement system that combines user needs and constraints\
    \ in the search space with interactive\nmining. The interactive nature of both\
    \ systems, MIME and Drools, can help to address the excessive\nnumber of rules\
    \ that typically form the output of rule learning. Additionally, in Reference\
    \ [4],\nwe showed that the database-pruning algorithm can signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ the number of rules that\nDrools outputs, without adversely impacting on the\
    \ quality of the classiﬁer. The smart farming decision\nsystem proposed in this\
    \ paper is called PLATEM. Drools is the core of this system, which is integrated\n\
    in a single web application. The user can launch multiple farm functionalities,\
    \ export the results that\nare selected, and apply the rules on test data in auto\
    \ mode. The rule-learning algorithm used in Drools\nfor building the classiﬁer\
    \ from association rules is evaluated and described in detail in the following\n\
    sections. The software solution is presented and implemented in demo form. Its\
    \ main contribution,\nwith respect to the previous results in References [5,6],\
    \ is in the integration of the periodically sampled\nindoor and outdoor irrigation\
    \ system linked to a wireless sensor network, the SDS, and the web,\nwhich together\
    \ form the complete PLATEM system.\nThis pervasive paradigm [10] of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) is to increase the value of the\ninformation generated by the\
    \ number of interconnections between people and gadgets, denoted by\nthings, and\
    \ to transform of the processed information into knowledge for the beneﬁt of mankind\n\
    and society.\nThe architecture of the IoT unit [11] is built from a man-like neural\
    \ network (MLN) model and\nits modiﬁed model. Ubiquitous IoT refers to the global\
    \ IoT and its integration in multiple-unit IoTs.\nIts architecture employs a social\
    \ organization framework (SOF) model. The models for future IoTs are\nnot only\
    \ helpful to interpret the relationship between IoT and the real world, but are\
    \ also beneﬁcial for\nthe implementation of IoT in its current form.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2019, 9, 216\n4 of 19\nVazquez et al. explored [12] the diﬀerent criteria for\
    \ designing IoT architectural solutions, together\nwith illustrative examples\
    \ of prototypes that have implemented these approaches. Likewise, Misra [13]\n\
    proposed a community detection scheme in an integrated Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ and social network\n(SN) architecture. The paper follows a graph mining approach\
    \ to solve the problem in a complex\nnetwork of IoT and SN. There are a few studies\
    \ in the literature on community detection in SNs;\nhowever, to the best of our\
    \ knowledge, there are no speciﬁc studies that address the integration of IoT\n\
    and SN architecture.\nAtzori [14] analyzed the major opportunities arising from\
    \ the integration of social networking\nconcepts in the Internet of Things, presenting\
    \ the mainstream research activities and pointing to the\nmost critical technical\
    \ challenges.\nSmart farming technology is continuously reinventing new business\
    \ models using real-time data\nwith automated data-acquisition devices. The sector\
    \ needs open infrastructure between technologies,\nbecause of a concern that key\
    \ data processing techniques may become the exclusive domain of\nmultinational\
    \ AgTech corporations.\nIn the current market, applications developed by AgTech\n\
    corporations and AgBusiness companies, with patented speciﬁcations, are commonly\
    \ found for\nmachine manufacturing processes. There are also applications that\
    \ function exclusively with irrigation.\nThese underlying reasons prompt us to\
    \ work towards integrated components in technology, both for\ndevice interaction,\
    \ such as fertirrigation controllers, and for data processing, to produce information\n\
    for greater agricultural eﬃciency. Basing our work on agricultural knowledge,\
    \ and in consultation\nwith individual farmers and agronomists, the focus of this\
    \ work is on the development of a platform\nthat integrates the core control operations\
    \ and that monitors data on crop yields, in order to build\non synergetic results\
    \ from multidisciplinary expertise. PLATEM PA is a combination of a smart\nfertirrigation\
    \ manager application that displays historical data, and social networking forums\
    \ that\nshare productive data.\nThe main complexity of such applications is that\
    \ they require collaboration between many diﬀerent\nelements with diﬀerent contributions\
    \ to the data values and related decisions over the consequential\nactions. An\
    \ overview of current European applications in PA is presented below, identifying\
    \ the major\nfunctions of each one in comparison with PLATEM PA.\nTable 1 shows\
    \ the aspects that PLATEM introduces in relation to the diﬀerent elements of other\n\
    smart farming platforms. The integration of several tools in the main user proﬁle\
    \ is central to PLATEM,\nenabling the development of a social network between\
    \ professionals in diﬀerent areas where they can\ndiscuss data acquisitions, notiﬁcations,\
    \ and crops risks. The ultimate goal is an open communication\nprotocol and open\
    \ data platform between large precision agriculture technologies, oriented towards\n\
    indoor and outdoor VRF and VRI.\nSmart-Akis [15] represents the application of\
    \ modern information and communication technologies\n(ICT) in agriculture, leading\
    \ to what can be called a third Green Revolution.\nAgrivi [16] is a crop management\
    \ software for crop planning, monitoring, and analysis. Advice\nand relevant data\
    \ on tillage, sowing, fumigation, fertilization, irrigation, and harvesting, and\
    \ almost\nall other activities, can be accessed with a few clicks. In addition,\
    \ volumetric calculations, and costs\nand hours of work are suggested for each\
    \ activity. The processes, based on best practices gathered in\nrelation to over\
    \ 100 crops, are designed to improve productivity.\nThe main objective of the\
    \ sigAGROasesor [17] project is the development of decision support tools\nfor\
    \ the agricultural sector, through a web platform for online services to farmers,\
    \ assisting eﬃcient,\neﬀective, and competitive farming activities, based on environmental\
    \ and social sustainability.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n5 of 19\nTable 1. Smart farming\

    Agronomy 2019, 9, 216\n6 of 19\nIn relation to a smart water-saving irrigation\
    \ system [18], X, Kehui et al. published a scientiﬁc\npaper based on an intelligent\
    \ irrigation programmer with sensory connectivity and 433 MHz ISM\ncommunication.\
    \ The research focused on applications in precision agriculture, using a wireless\n\
    humidity sensor. A network of wireless sensors was conﬁgured to monitor the moisture\
    \ content and\nthe amount of water in the ﬁeld soil samples. The architectures\
    \ of both the wireless sensor network and\nthe intelligent system were based on\
    \ the network of sampled irrigation controllers. The irrigation test\nwas performed\
    \ with real-time humidity data and expert inputs. A feasible system was demonstrated\
    \ in\nthe rice cultivation process, and a good exploration in the ﬁeld of precision\
    \ agriculture and sustainable\nwater resources.\nThe APOLLO project [19] shares\
    \ similarities with the PLATEM PA project proposal design.\nThe technology was\
    \ analyzed in depth for the consolidation of the PLATEM PA system, improving\n\
    its potential for use with other innovative ultra-low power communications and\
    \ dynamic routing\nprotocols, and in the latest business rule engine models applied\
    \ to the multimedia platform.\nAPOLLO aims to bring the beneﬁts of precision agriculture\
    \ to farmers through aﬀordable\ninformation services, making extensive use of\
    \ free and open Earth observation data, such as those\nprovided by the EU Copernicus\
    \ program. These services are intended to assist agricultural decision\nmaking,\
    \ while observing crop growth and conditions, providing advice on irrigation and\
    \ tilling,\nand providing crop estimations. Ultimately, these interventions are\
    \ designed to reduce agricultural\ninputs and increase competitive production\
    \ levels and beneﬁts.\nAs Table 1 shows, the novelty of our platform is that PLATEM\
    \ PA can be considered as a\ncollaborative tool where farmers can post their experiences.\n\
    It is able to monitor the diﬀerent\nparameters of soil and environment to better\
    \ growth of crops. In addition, PLATEM PA is able to\nimprove their decision,\
    \ regarding to actions to be performed over the ﬁeld, taking into account previous\n\
    stored information and farmers posts. Finally, its operation is based on the use\
    \ of an intelligent Virtual\nRouting and Forwarding (VRF) and Virtual Router Instances\
    \ (VRI). PLATEM PA therefore represents a\ncompetitive sample of European supplier\
    \ networks focused on Precision Agriculture management and\na multimedia platform\
    \ with basic group tools to control and monitor data and relations between all\n\
    participants for sharing results.\nThe PLATEM system presented in this paper can\
    \ be used to accomplish the task through a\nchain of web-based graphical tools,\
    \ running on standard BRMS software with open-source formats.\nOur technological\
    \ solution is capable of adapting “high-tech tools” to be used by farmers, many\
    \ of whom\nmay have little or no technical hi-tech expertise. One problem is the\
    \ necessary automatization of several\nsystems (irrigation controller, fertirrigation\
    \ pump, pH sensor node, . . . ) from diﬀerent manufacturers\nthat need to be adapted\
    \ to speciﬁc communication protocol. PLATEM PA combines several data\nintegration\
    \ processes in a single easy-to-use platform with a standard communication protocol.\n\
    Although the ﬁnal system will be composed by both hardware part (in charge of\
    \ collecting\ndata from the ﬁeld) and software part (in charge of processing data),\
    \ this paper is focused on\ndata computation and not in the agronomic side and\
    \ to perform the tests we will take a data base\nwith the needs of fertilization,\
    \ weekly irrigation liters and diﬀerent Kc for corn varieties of alfalfa,\nbarley\
    \ and wheat.\n3. Rule-Based Preparation Work\nThe ﬁrst step to develop our management\
    \ platform was to know the variable inputs the system\nhas and how they have to\
    \ be processed by using the rules. Taking into account that the ﬁnal goal is\n\
    to enhance the sustainability and competitiveness of the activity, the system\
    \ also includes business\nprocess management (BPM) and business rules. It is also\
    \ important to deﬁne the platform architecture.\nThis section therefore presents\
    \ the server-based decision-making structure for decision making on\nirrigation\
    \ device settings, which processes data inputs on edaphic and environmental conditions,\n\
    images of crop growth, and crop status.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n7 of 19\nThe objective\
    \ of this server-based decision-making structure is the integration of a BPMS\
    \ and a\nbusiness rules management system. A middleware data-exchange system serves\
    \ as a link between\nboth. The middleware that serves to relay data from Bonita\
    \ BPM and Drools includes the following\ndevelopments:\n•\nPerformance of an integrated\
    \ architecture for a business rules management system and a business\nrule management\
    \ system (BRMS).\n•\nDialogue through the intermediate middleware component that\
    \ is responsible for the data\nmanagement model and the rule-based activities.\n\
    Bonita Soft provides connectors to interact with the Drools manager that connect\
    \ with the Drools\nAPI Engine to run the execution of a certain rule, in order\
    \ to obtain results that conclude with the\npreviously triggered decision-making\
    \ process.\nThe process of preparing a rule base in Drools can be divided into\
    \ several consecutive steps\nthat are presented in Figure 2, wherein several layers\
    \ are created: data preparation, association rule\nlearning, rule selection, classiﬁcation\
    \ model testing, rule set editing, and deployment of rules.\nAgronomy 2019, 9,\

    \ the rules association had been defined, it was required to \ndevelop the software\
    \ part that would implement our web platform. To perform that, this section \n\
    presents the implementation of server rules in the Drools engine. The server has\
    \ three main \ncomponents. The first one is an application that is able to register\
    \ the external sensor data in the \nsystem. A device or application simply registers\
    \ as a data source by sending information via socket \ncommunication to the middleware,\
    \ which then prepares the data in a specified format, depending \non the type\
    \ of sensor. \nThe system architecture is divided into the following layers: \n\
    1. \nUser interface: enables farmers, providers, and technics to interact with\
    \ the system and execute \ncomputerized workflow activities. To do so, it invokes\
    \ operations of the interfaces published by \nthe business layer. It is a set\
    \ of HTML and Php pages hosted on an Apache web server that are \ndisplayed in\
    \ a web browser. \n2. \nBusiness layer: responsible for making calculations, queries,\
    \ and invoking the execution of \nbusiness rules. To do this, it accesses the\
    \ data layer and the rules services layer. It is a set of PHP \npages hosted on\
    \ an Apache web server. \n3. \nData layer: in charge of managing the system’s\
    \ database, which contains information about all \nthe data of the process and\
    \ its stages for each field. It provides interfaces so that the business \nlayer\
    \ can access it. To implement this layer, the MySQL database management system\
    \ was \nused. \n4. \nService layer of business rules: exposes interfaces through\
    \ web services to business rules. It is \ninvoked from the business layer and\
    \ executes the rules contained in the rules layer. It is made \nup of web services,\
    \ programmed in Java, which run on a Tomcat web server. \nFigure 4. Diagram of\
    \ business process management (BMP) process.\n4. Software Components\nOnce the\

    \ interfaces to the\nrules services layer. To implement this layer, a free, open\
    \ source, java-developed BRMS was used.\nThe BRMS is deployed on a Tomcat web\
    \ server.\nFigure 5 shows the architecture of BRMS used by our platform. As we\
    \ can see, the main component\nof our BRMS is an Apache web server, which uses\
    \ the data stored in our database (DB). In order to\nenhance our server, we used\
    \ a Tomcat web server. Tomcat is an extension of Apache that works as a\ncontainer\
    \ of servlets, and can help us to include new functionalities to our server. Using\
    \ the servlets,\nwe can extend applications held in web servers to be seen as\
    \ JAVA Applets. To generate and manage\nthe diﬀerent rules we need to enhance\
    \ the system performance, we used Drools, a common tool used\nfor managing business\
    \ rules that we have adapted to our application. These rules are sent to the\n\
    Tomcat web server through the API. These rules are sent to the Apache web server,\
    \ which combines\nthem with the data stored in the DB. Finally, the users can\
    \ see the results of these decisions by using a\nweb browser and surﬁng the diﬀerent\

    The last step to make the web platform usable was to develop a graphic user interface\
    \ (GUI) to\nfacilitate its use by farmers. Additionally, PLATEM should be tested\
    \ in terms of data collected and\noperation. In this section, the web view development\
    \ is presented, with the aim of oﬀering a high\nusability level for non-IT-experts.\
    \ PLATEM incorporates a web-based data-mining system [21,22].\nThe web provides\
    \ an important interaction model for the smart farming IoT by letting users obtain\n\
    device-related information and, in some cases, control their devices through the\
    \ ubiquitous web\nbrowser. The conventional web is a convenience we enjoy as we\
    \ search for information, irrigation Tele\nManagement control, and post historical\
    \ data in social networking. Users can refer to devices that are\npart of the\
    \ IoT and that are directly accessed, monitored, and controlled by web technologies\
    \ as the\nPhysical Web: web technology + IoT. The web interface supports pre-processing\
    \ deﬁnitions such as\nuploading data to DB, and post processing ones such as the\
    \ data results viewer [23]. The backend is\nwritten in PHP; the frontend is based\
    \ on PHP/HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript libraries.\nThe PLATEM platform is a web\
    \ view application written in PHP. The user module can share\nrestricted postings\
    \ and control security. Communication is performed through a MySQL extension.\n\
    MySQL is great at performance database technology, but we see databases becoming\
    \ more popular\nwhen they simply provide more and more features that are easily\
    \ connectable and manageable with\nexisting systems. The more features a database\
    \ has, the easier it will be for users to develop their\nsystems, thus making\
    \ them better and raising the general level of the applications that are made\n\
    through MySQL. Since MySQL is very popular, any major improvements or added features\
    \ aﬀect many\npeople. The web view uses direct communication with Drools only\
    \ in parts, with speciﬁc functionality\nwhere it is accessible through REST web\
    \ services in JSON. The remaining ﬁelds interact, such as: make\na post, likes,\
    \ upload images, write commentaries to status or in images, search and list friends,\
    \ friend\nrequest (send and accept), send messages to friends. They are all accessible\
    \ through the web interface\nwithout setters to the rule engine.\nIn addition,\
    \ there is a settings view to update user proﬁles that is accessible to friends,\
    \ which can\nbe edited (clicking on Edit Information). The next important point\
    \ is a notiﬁcations menu located\non the top-right of the screen in main view,\
    \ where the notiﬁcation icons ﬂash for alerts/notiﬁcations,\nfriends, and messages.\n\
    The user can search for other users in the database by writing the name in edit\
    \ text “Search\nPeople,” and can view an open proﬁle, send a message, and add\
    \ a name to a list of friends. Figure 7\nshows the My Friends list with a “View\
    \ proﬁle” button and “Send message” button.\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n12 of 19\n\

    In addition, we tested a new multimedia platform for user manager (farmer) proﬁles\

    \ with the irrigation–fertirrigation system\nAgronomy 2019, 9, 216\n18 of 19\n\
    controller. Comparing our study with other applications, we can highlight the\
    \ potential of PLATEM:\nthat integrates all the tools that a farmer may need on\
    \ a day-to-day basis, so that many fertirrigation\noperations can bring in results\
    \ with a rule engine and a list of rules or models based on historical\ndata acquisition\
    \ and user-inserted values. Another important function is information sharing\
    \ through\nforums with input from agronomists, agricultural technicians, and other\
    \ farmers on doses, plagues,\nwater restrictions, etc. Work continues on expansions\
    \ of the rules for the integration of the business\nengine system. The goal of\
    \ this integration is to present the basic user-demanded rules deﬁned in\nthe\
    \ system, enabling a simple and unique functional platform for smart farming in\
    \ irrigation areas,\nboth under cover and in the ﬁeld, for fertilization and pest\
    \ control.\nIn future work, further development of smart system applications will\
    \ be necessary, and is likely\nto produce two opposing supply chain scenarios:\
    \ one with further integration of the supply chain, in\nwhich farmers have private\
    \ data, and another in which farmers are empowered by big data and open\ncollaboration\
    \ and can easily switch between suppliers, sharing data with agricultural organizations\n\
    and the Ministry of Agriculture, and participating in short supply chains rather\
    \ than integrated long\nsupply chains.\nCurrently, PLATEM is working well for\
    \ relatively small data sets. A further action required\nto process bigger amount\
    \ of data is to apply diﬀerent decision-making tools, since the rule engine\n\
    and decision tree become ineﬃcient because of the swapping of training tuples\
    \ in and out of the\nmain memory.\nThe situation is likely to navigate a steady\
    \ course between these two extremes diﬀerentiated by\ncropping methods, commodity,\
    \ market structure, etc. In this work, the use of open data is fostered with\n\
    the aim of promoting communication channels between farmer, researcher, commercial\
    \ intermediary,\nand technological expert.\nAnother focus is on the extension\
    \ of the system that would allow mixing rules from multiple\ndatasets in a single\
    \ knowledge base and a common communication protocol through various sources,\n\
    e.g., manufacturers of irrigation controllers, real-time information from satellites,\
    \ and weather\nforecasting servers. Finally, we have to consider supporting alternative\
    \ backend rule learning adjusted\nto each user proﬁle (horticulture, cereal, and\
    \ fruit farmers, etc.) to classify the rules on use in the\nrule container. The\
    \ promise of big data in agriculture is alluring, but the above challenges have\
    \ to\nbe addressed for increased uptake of big data applications. Although there\
    \ are certainly technical\nissues to be resolved, we recommend focusing on the\
    \ most signiﬁcant obstacles above all, the initially\nidentiﬁed governance issues,\
    \ and the design of suitable business models.\nAuthor Contributions: C.C.B. designed\

    According to the UN-FAO, agricultural production must increase by 50% by 2050

    to meet global demand for food. This goal can be accomplished, in part, by the

    development of improved cultivars coupled with modern best management practices.

    Overall, wheat production on farms will have to increase signiﬁcantly to meet
    future

    demand, and in the face of a changing climate that poses risk to even current
    rates

    of production. Durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (Desf.)] is used largely

    for pasta, couscous and bulgur production. Durum producers face a range of factors

    spanning abiotic (frost damage, drought, and sprouting) and biotic (weed, disease,

    and insect pests) stresses that impact yields and quality speciﬁcations desired
    by

    export market end-users. Serious biotic threats include Fusarium head blight (FHB)

    and weed pest pressures, which have increased as a result of herbicide resistance.

    While genetic progress for yield and quality is on pace with common wheat (Triticum

    aestivum L.), development of resistant durum cultivars to FHB is still lagging.
    Thus,

    successful biotic and abiotic threat mitigation are ideal case studies in Genotype

    (G) × Environment (E) × Management (M) interactions where superior cultivars (G)

    are grown in at-risk regions (E) and require unique approaches to management

    (M) for sustainable durum production. Transformational approaches to research
    are

    needed in order for agronomists, breeders and durum producers to overcome

    production constraints. Designing robust agronomic systems for durum demands

    ecozones and close the yield gap between genetic potential and on-farm achieved

    yield. Advances in individual technologies (e.g., genetic improvements, new pesticides,

    INTRODUCTION

    An estimate by the UN-FAO indicates that, by 2050, the global

    demand for agricultural products will have risen by 50%. Meeting

    this demand will require traditional development of improved

    cultivars coupled with modern best management practices as

    well as innovations that are transformational. Achievement of

    this goal on existing cropland will require a signiﬁcant increase

    in rates of genetic gain in grain yield for crops such as wheat

    (Triticum aestivum L.), increasing the current rate of gain (ca.

    1% p.a.) by 30–40% (FAO, 2017; Cassman and Grassini, 2020).

    Climate change will be an added challenge to productivity

    improvement (Reynolds et al., 2016). Durum wheat (Triticum

    turgidum L. var durum Desf.) is the 10th most important and

    commonly cultivated cereal worldwide with a yearly production

    average of 40 million tonnes (MT) (2016/17). Typically, durum

    wheat production represents 5% of total wheat production with

    a planting area of 16 M hectares globally (International Grains

    Council [IGC], 2020). Wheat and wheat products could account

    for 20% of protein and calories consumption per capita for a

    global population of 9.7 billion in 2050 (CRP-WHEAT, 2016).

    Durum is produced primarily for making pasta, but is also

    an important ingredient for couscous and bulgur, particularly

    in North Africa and the Middle East. These products use

    durum semolina resulting from milling of the hard-textured

    durum wheat kernel. In some countries such as Italy, regulatory

    standards specify that pasta must be made with 100% durum

    semolina (Sopiwnyk, 2018). The production of pasta requires

    grain with high protein content, gluten strength, and high yellow

    pigment content (resulting largely from lutein), which provides

    the characteristic yellowness that is expected from the pasta. Only

    a few regions in the world are capable of producing durum that

    meets the high standards for end-use suitability. In this review

    article, we will discuss the current state of durum production and

    explore how recent genetic progress and selected management

    innovations can lead to a resilient and transformative durum

    production system.

    Statistics and Regional Speciﬁc

    Summaries (Canada, Australia, and the

    United States)

    Durum wheat is grown in many of the same countries that

    produce common wheat, with Italy as an important producer

    (4.95 MT) within Europa, along with the Commonwealth of

    Independent States (CIS), North America, South America, Asia,

    Africa, Oceania, and Turkey (3.62 MT) (International Grains

    Council [IGC], 2020). A majority of the world’s durum wheat is

    planted in North America, with Canadian production typically

    around 7.8 MT, which is almost three times the production

    of the United States (US) and Mexico (International Grains

    Council [IGC], 2020). In Canada, southern Saskatchewan is the

    largest wheat durum producer, supplying 81 percent of the total

    Canadian durum wheat produced from 1990 to 2017. Canada’s

    durum export volume has increased from 2.7 to 4.5 MT from

    1990 to 2017, which underscores the signiﬁcant contribution

    of durum production to the Canadian export market (Statistics

    Canada, 2019). Canada now leads the world in durum wheat

    exports, with about half of all durum wheat available for export

    grown in Canada. Mexico and the EU contribute 17 and

    16%, respectively. The remaining 17% is exported from other

    countries including the United States, Australia, Mexico, and

    Kazakhstan. From the period 2013–2014 to 2017–2018, Italy,

    Algeria, Morocco, United States, and Japan were the top ﬁve

    importing countries for Canadian durum wheat (International

    Grains Council [IGC], 2020).

    In Australia, durum wheat represents a relatively small

    component of the Australian wheat crop. Durum production is

    largely conﬁned to rainfed production in southeastern Australia

    (South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales and a small

    part of southern Queensland) and small pockets of irrigated

    production. Wheat production in eastern Australia has averaged

    ∼16 MT per annum over the last 10 years (ABARES 2017),

    whereas durum production averages ∼4,00,000 tonnes (T) but

    has ﬂuctuated substantially between ∼50,000 and 8,00,000 t over

    the last decade (Kniep, 2008; Ranieri et al., 2012); and represents

    on average 3% of the eastern Australia wheat crop. Australian

    durum wheat production is relatively stable, and the annual

    supply of grain is split equally between domestic consumption

    and export markets, which is somewhat dependent on seasonal

    ﬂuctuations (Ranieri, 2015).

    In the United States, durum is produced primarily in two

    regions, the desert southwest region under irrigated regimes,

    and in the central region of the northern Great Plains under

    rainfed conditions. The largest area planted to durum is in

    North Dakota (Table 1), followed by Montana, Arizona, and

    California. There is also minor production in Idaho (irrigated),

    South Dakota and Minnesota. In the last two decades, there has

    been a substantial reduction in the area planted to durum in

    the United States. Most of this can be attributed to reductions

    in North Dakota, where there has been a reduction of nearly

    800,000 hectares over the period. Farmers in North Dakota have

    opted to grow other crops due to the challenges of meeting

    the high quality standards to reach the top grade and the lack

    of ﬁnancial incentives relative to other crops including hard

    red spring wheat, which has somewhat less stringent quality

    requirements. Lastly, as with other regions, the lack of genetic

    resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium

    graminearum Schwabe [telomorph: Gibberella zeae Schwein

    (Petch)] has shifted hectarage away from durum to wheat crops

    with higher levels of resistance.

    Market Access

    A recent challenge for producers is slumping durum exports

    to Italy, the world’s largest pasta maker. As reported in April

    2018, despite the high exceptional quality of Canadian durum

    and as Italy’s biggest durum supplier, the company Barilla has

    cut back its imports from Canada by 35%. Italy has expressed

    concerns over Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for glyphosate

    in Canadian durum as the reason for the blockade. In the

    northern Great Plains, where durum is managed within no-

    tillage, soil conservation system, glyphosate is widely used as a

    pre-plant application to control weeds. Glyphosate applied to

    durum after it reaches physiological maturity is also approved as

    a pre-harvest weed control in the United States and Canada. It

    is most commonly used when environmental conditions prolong

    the process of drying after maturity. Glyphosate applied prior to

    harvest has been found to only marginally hastens the rate of dry

    down in fully mature wheat (Darwent et al., 1994), but it does an

    excellent job of controlling any green tillers or weeds that might

    produce seed and increase dockage at grain terminals. Although

    the MRL is ﬁve parts per million for wheat according to Health

    Canada’s current guidelines, the accepted limit of glyphosate

    established by the Italian pasta industry is under 10 parts per

    billion. Exporters argue the limits are too low because glyphosate

    is already used within acceptable limits of the herbicide in the

    grain production system.

    The expanded use of glyphosate as a preharvest aid may

    be associated with the expanded use of fungicides for FHB

    control, as plants treated with this late fungicide application

    tend to remain green longer as the leaves and stems are not

    aﬀected by late-season diseases that might naturally desiccate

    them. Glyphosate is highly mobile in the plant and moves to

    areas of high metabolism. When applied prior to maturity, it

    can accumulate in developing kernels in suﬃcient quantity that

    it can aﬀect germination and therefore is not currently approved

    for use in seed production or on barley intended for malt (Jenks

    et al., 2019). Even when applied after physiological maturity,

    however, it is possible to detect traceable amounts of glyphosate

    in the grain (Cessna et al., 1994). When applied according to

    the manufacturer’s label, glyphosate does not aﬀect milling and

    baking characteristic of spring wheat (Manthey et al., 2004) or

    the functional quality of durum (Zollinger et al., 1999). From a

    toxicological standpoint, glyphosate is considered to be one of

    the safest herbicides available, as its mode of action is directed

    towards an enzyme not found in mammals. Most countries

    consider pesticide residues in their food based on the guidelines

    found in the Codex Alimentarius which has a permitted residues

    limit of 30 ppm of glyphosate in wheat. Some countries like Japan

    and Canada have lower permitted limits of 5 ppm. Nevertheless,

    after the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded

    that glyphosate may be linked to cancer, many end users have

    become concerned with any detected levels of glyphosate in

    the grain. There are alternative chemicals registered for pre-

    harvest weed control in durum, but they are primarily eﬀective

    on broadleaf weeds and would have minimal impact on the

    desiccation of the durum crop (Jenks et al., 2019). Reverting

    to the practice of swathing the crop and leaving the cut grain

    in windrows to dry before combining may also be challenging.

    This practice is labor-intensive and increases operational input

    costs. Grain quality is also at greater risk as there is less potential

    airﬂow permeating through the windrow such that, if there is a

    rain event, there is increased risk of quality downgrading from

    weathering and sprouting.

    Yield Constraints and Emerging Issues

    for Durum Wheat Production

    Attainable Yield and the Global Yield Gap Atlas

    Our ability to fully harness the genetic yield potential of newly

    deployed genetics and traits in the latest durum cultivars is

    determined by site-speciﬁc parameters and local management

    practices. Achieving food security and protecting carbon-rich

    and biodiverse natural ecosystems from massive conversion to

    cropland ultimately depend on our ability to sustainably increase

    crop yields on currently cultivated land (Cassman, 1999). Until

    recently, for most of the world, including data-rich regions such

    as the United States Corn (Zea mays L) Belt and Europe, there

    were no reliable data on yield potential—the maximum attainable

    yield as determined by climate and soil in the absence of nutrient

    deﬁciencies and biotic stresses (Evans and Fischer, 1999). To

    help meet this need for data and help producers achieve these

    potential yield gains, researchers from University of Nebraska-

    Lincoln (United States) and Wageningen University (WU) began

    development of the Global Yield Gap Atlas (GYGA) (GYGA,1)

    in 2011, with the goal of deﬁning regions’ exploitable yield

    Exploring G × E × M Synergies in Durum

    gaps (Figure 1). In this ﬁgure, yield potential is determined

    by temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, carbon dioxide,

    and, in the case of rainfed crops, also by water supply and

    soil properties inﬂuencing soil water balance (Evans, 1993; Van

    Ittersum et al., 2013). The attainable yield is about 80% of

    the yield potential (Cassman et al., 2003; Lobell et al., 2009).

    Achieving yield gain above the attainable yield is diﬃcult as the

    extra investment on inputs and labor is not cost eﬀective. The

    exploitable yield gap represents the diﬀerence between average

    on-farm or actual yield and the attainable yield.

    The GYGA provides a web-based platform for estimating yield

    gaps that is transparent, accessible, reproducible, geospatially

    explicit, agronomically robust, and applied in a consistent

    manner throughout the world. A standard protocol for assessing

    yield gaps was developed by leading scientists, which is based on

    a strong focus on understanding the local farming system and

    making use of the best available data sources (Grassini et al., 2015;

    Van Bussel et al., 2015). A number of studies have been published

    on these topics using the GYGA approach (Hochman et al., 2013;

    Merlos et al., 2015; Van Oort et al., 2015; Espe et al., 2016; Marin

    et al., 2016; Van Ittersum et al., 2016; Timsina et al., 2018).

    Currently, wheat yield gaps have been developed for the EU,

    AUS, South America, and India; however, yield gaps for Canada

    and the United States have yet to be developed by GYGA and

    remain unknown. A project to obtain estimates for Canada and

    the United States in a joint collaborative project utilizing GYGA

    methodology was initiated in 2019. In GYGA, yield potential is

    simulated based on long-term weather data, local soil, cropping

    system data, current crop sequences, and dominant management

    practices such as sowing date, plant density, and cultivar maturity

    (Grassini et al., 2015).

    An alternative approach was used to investigate wheat yield

    trends, attainable yields and yield gaps for the 10 largest

    wheat producing countries in the world and more localized

    yield statistics at the state or county level. These data were

    assembled from available government sources. Attainable yield

    was determined using an upper quadrant analysis to deﬁne the

    FIGURE 1 | Representation of yield potential, attainable yield, farm yield, and

    yield gap (Van Ittersum et al., 2013). Appropriate permissions have been

    obtained from the copyright holder(s) of this work.

    upper frontier or yields over the period of record and yield

    gaps calculated as the diﬀerence between attainable yield and

    actual yield for each year. In all countries, the attainable yield

    increase over time was larger than the yield trend indicating

    the technological advances in genetics and agronomic practices

    were increasing attainable yield. Average wheat yield gap using

    this method report that Australia is about 24%, spring wheat

    in Canada (Saskatchewan and Alberta) is between 21 and 24%.

    France, Germany, Mexico, and United States are approximately

    14, 9, 10, and 12%, respectively. Observations across all the wheat

    production regions shows no apparent trend in closing the yield

    gap. The average yield gap using this method is a reﬂection in the

    variation in weather among growing season and management of

    soil water followed by enhanced agronomy. A series of challenges

    exist as we attempt to assemble regional data with much ﬁner

    resolution data to be able to elucidate speciﬁc soil diﬀerences

    and weather/climate data. The country level data is useful for

    looking at trends but is not robust enough for managing yield

    gap solutions as an accurate measure of the yield gap due to

    management. Therefore, more country partners with ﬁner scale

    data are needed to make progress on the quantiﬁcation of yield

    gaps, the factors which constrain growers achieving water limited

    yields, and potential strategies for reducing the yield gap with true

    G × E × M synergies (Hatﬁeld and Beres, 2019). For example, the

    most recent study on yield gaps of wheat in Australia conducted

    in-silico experiments to determine the impact on grain yield

    of sub-optimal practices and tested these against emerging best

    practices as developed by agronomists (Hochman and Horan,

    2018). With this approach, it was possible to quantify reasons for

    the yield gap. Average national losses were due to growers not

    applying enough nitrogen, failure to adopt conservation tillage

    techniques, suboptimal weed control during summer fallow, low

    seed densities, and delayed sowing. Moreover, the GYGA atlas

    determined that the yield gap that is related to management for

    Australia is around 50%. Irrespective of the method to deﬁne

    yield gaps, progress toward closure in the future will require local

    producers to adopt practices that increase their climate resilience

    in wheat production systems (Hatﬁeld and Beres, 2019).

    Speciﬁc to durum yield gaps and for the purposes of this paper,

    the GYGA methodology was utilized recently along with existing

    data to calculate durum yield gaps for speciﬁc durum producing

    regions (Figure 2). France and Mexico represent regions with

    the smallest yield gap, with some regions in France nearly

    achieving yield gap closure. The higher yield potential in Mexico

    is a reﬂection of production under irrigation, which can largely

    eliminate the limitation caused by insuﬃcient water supply from

    precipitation and stored soil moisture at sowing. Regions within

    Italy, Greece, and Cyprus with the highest yield potential also

    displayed actual yields that were not measurably diﬀerent from

    the lowest yield potential regions, which creates a wide yield gap

    exceeding 50%. This suggests large room at the farm level to

    improve yield via improved agronomic management.

    wheat midge (Sitodiplosis mosellana) can be major production

    constraints, their cyclical nature includes years to a decade

    where their presence is below economic thresholds. Fungal

    diseases, however, and most notably FHB caused by Fusarium

    graminearum, have had the greatest impact on the durum

    industry in the Canadian Prairies and the Great Plains

    of United States as well as other wheat-growing regions

    (Beres et al., 2018). Durum is also particularly vulnerable

    to crown rot (Fusarium pseudograminearum, Fp), tan spot

    (Drechslera tritici-repentis), Septoria leaf blotch (Mycosphaerella

    graminicola), bacterial leaf streak (Xanthomonas translucens), leaf

    rust (Puccinia triticina), and stem rust (Puccinia graminis), and

    stripe rust or yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis) which causes

    the most damage when pustules develop early on the ﬂag leaf

    and disrupt photosynthesis (Ransom et al., 2017). While many

    diseases can potentially reduce the yield and quality of durum,

    integrated management strategies exist that can help reduce the

    eﬀects of these diseases. However, genetic progress to develop

    cultivars resistant to diseases lags behind other wheat classes

    in both North America (Ransom et al., 2017) and Australia

    (Hollaway et al., 2013). In Australia, durum cultivars with a

    high level of resistance to Fp have not been identiﬁed. This

    has reduced durum production to farming systems with lower

    levels of crown rot. Farming practices such as retaining more

    cereal residue and increasing the intensity of wheat rotations

    can increase the amount of inoculum in the soil, which can

    further increase the likelihood of infection (Summerell et al.,

    1989). With key durum growing regions of Australia predicted

    to become hotter and drier, yield losses due to crown rot disease

    are expected to increase. While the development of varieties

    with improved crown rot resistance has been shown to reduce

    inoculum levels in soils, improved management solutions must

    focus on limited exposure to water stress as a key G × E × M

    strategy to reduce yield loss from crown rot in Australia. One

    proposed strategy is the development of durum cultivars with

    improved frost tolerance and subsequently amenable to earlier

    planting, which would minimize exposure to terminal drought

    and water stress during grain ﬁll.

    Weeds are one of the largest contributors to wheat yield

    loss. Weed interference can result in spring wheat yield loss

    ranging from 5% to greater than 80% (Harker et al., 2017).

    Currently, a paucity of information is available highlighting the

    magnitude of weed-induced yield loss in durum compared with

    other wheat classes. However, the information that is available

    suggests that durum and bread wheat may have similar tolerance

    to weed interference. One exception showed greater grain yield

    loss induced by increasing densities of wild oat (Avena fatua L.)

    in a lath-house experiment in a bread wheat cultivar compared

    with a durum wheat cultivar; suggesting that durum wheat could

    have greater tolerance to weed interference (Henson and Jordan,

    1982). In their study, densities of wild oat equivalent to 162,

    406, and 812 plants m−2 reduced grain yield of durum wheat on

    average by 34, 53, and 67%, respectively, when durum wheat was

    sown at a density equivalent to 162 plants m−2. A crop rotation

    study in a rainfed Mediterranean environment of central Italy

    concluded that weed control and nitrogen supply are among the

    most important factors impacting durum wheat yield and grain

    quality, and that these factors are of greater importance in years

    with excess rainfall and low temperatures during reproductive

    development of durum wheat in organic production systems

    (Campiglia et al., 2015).

    Although the use of herbicides has enabled the adoption

    of conservation cropping systems, the increased reliance on

    herbicides for weed control has led to the evolution of herbicide

    resistance (Walsh and Powles, 2007). It has been estimated that

    overall, the total cost of weeds for growers with resistance can

    Exploring G × E × M Synergies in Durum

    increase by as much as $55 ha−1 higher than those without

    resistance (Llewellyn et al., 2016). The major weed constraint

    to durum wheat production in Australia is annual ryegrass

    (Lolium rigidum L.). In South Australia, annual ryegrass has

    evolved considerable resistance to all post-emergent herbicides

    used in cereal crops (Boutsalis et al., 2012). Similarly in Canada,

    a recurring theme around weed dynamics in durum ﬁelds is

    the occurrence of herbicide-resistant biotypes of these species

    (Heap, 2019). In Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, separate

    green foxtail (Setaria viridis L.) populations have been found

    with resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase)-inhibiting

    (group A/1), acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting (group B/2)

    and microtubule-inhibiting (group K1/3) herbicides. Wild oat

    populations with resistance to ACCase inhibitors, ALS inhibitors,

    or lipid synthesis (group N/8) inhibitors are also present in

    these areas. The increasing frequency of multiple herbicide-

    resistant wild oats in the Canadian prairies has raised concern

    over eﬀective management of these populations in cereal and

    pulse crops. In Canadian durum, no post-emergence herbicide

    options exist currently for management of wild oat populations

    with multiple resistance to both the ACCase and ALS inhibitors,

    assuming cross-resistance to all active ingredients within this

    herbicide modes-of-action. This has increased grower reliance on

    pre-emergence herbicide options.

    Global Challenges for Yield Attainment – Abiotic

    Threats

    Abiotic stress is a phenomenon encountered in all durum

    production regions, but Australia is particularly vulnerable as it

    appears most likely to ﬁrst experience climate change that will

    challenge yield and quality targets for durum. Agronomic and

    genetic solutions have been successful in mitigating yield lost

    to some degree but challenges remain; therefore, a considerable

    research eﬀort is still required. Durum yield losses in Australia

    are primarily due to water stress (Liu et al., 2015) similar to

    well-published studies in wheat from lack of rainfall during

    spring, which causes a mild water deﬁcit stress prior to anthesis,

    moderate stress at anthesis and becomes more severe during

    grain ﬁll (French and Schultz, 1984). Breeding for genotypes

    adapted to pre- and post-anthesis water-deﬁcit stress has been

    a major target of Australian breeders (Liu et al., 2015) and will

    need to remain a signiﬁcant priority (Alahmad et al., 2019) given

    that durum production is in Mediterranean areas most likely

    inﬂuenced by climate change, and wheat yields in Australia are

    beginning to stall (Hochman et al., 2017).

    Frost events in spring are also common, which causes yield

    loss by directly reducing the number of grains via sterility induced

    by the combined eﬀect of cold, desiccation and freezing damage

    to the ﬂoral organs and developing grain (Al-Khatib and Paulsen,

    1984; Boer et al., 1993; Fuller et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2015).

    A large eﬀort has been undertaken in Australia to screen for

    improved frost tolerance; however, Australia durum cultivars

    have a signiﬁcantly higher susceptibility to frost damage than

    bread wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (Cocks and Cullis,

    2019). Equally high temperatures and heat shock during sensitive

    reproductive growth stages and grain ﬁll can also result in a

    yield penalty (Gomez-Macpherson and Richards, 1995). A key

    study by Zubaidi et al. (2000) concluded the critical issue with

    durum wheat in South Australia was not its yield potential

    per se, but its ability to maintain yield when challenged by

    environmental stress. Agronomic solutions to maintain yield

    and reduce potential exposure to water stress, heat and frost

    can be achieved by manipulating plant development and sowing

    date (Bassu et al., 2009). A series of experiments in South

    Australia compared the relative performance of durum and bread

    wheat when exposed to the same level of abiotic stresses. When

    ﬂowering at a similar time the yield gap ranged from 0.6 to

    1.5 t/ha due to increased sterility from increased sensitivity of

    durum to abiotic stresses such as heat and reproductive frost

    (McCallum et al., 2019). The best strategy available to growers

    under these conditions is to ensure that ﬂowering occurs during

    the optimum ﬂowering period (Flohr et al., 2017) when the

    combined stresses of frost, drought and heat risk (Flohr et al.,

    2017) are minimized. A more recent environmental constraint,

    and a further example of potential negative eﬀects of climate

    change, is the fact that autumn rainfall required to establish

    crops in Australia has diminished (Cai et al., 2012). Increased

    eﬀort is therefore needed to develop genetics with diversity

    in crop phenology patterns to ensure growers can respond

    and sow earlier or later than currently practiced, and still

    achieve ﬂower on time in order to overcome the yield decline

    (Kirkegaard and Hunt, 2010).

    DESIGNING A RESILIENT DURUM

    CROPPING SYSTEM

    Improvements to the “G” in the

    G × E × M Paradigm in Canada

    The rate of genetic gain in yield of durum wheat in Canada

    averaged 0.63% (approximately 21.5 kg ha−1) per year from 1963

    to 2017 (Figure 3). There was an increase in the number of

    new cultivars brought into production during the last decade,

    reﬂecting the major increase in funding for breeding programs,

    principally by farmers. De Vita et al. (2007) reported a gain of

    19.9 kg ha−1 year−1 for durum yield in Italy from 1900 to 1990.

    Royo et al. (2007) reported a rate of gain of 0.36 to 0.44% per

    year in a historic set of Italian and Spanish durum cultivars.

    Investigation of rates of gain in a more recent period (1980–2009)

    in Spain showed a similar gain of 0.44% per year up to 2003, with

    little change thereafter (Chairi et al., 2018). Declining rates of

    genetic yield gain, much less doubling current rates, could be a

    concern in future, and widening the genetic diversity of crossing

    programs is necessary, and is a priority of breeding programs

    unless new genetic diversity is discovered.

    Retrospective studies of the factors underlying genetic

    improvement in grain yield identiﬁed key contributing traits. For

    example, increased harvest index (the ratio of grain weight to

    total plant biomass) has contributed to yield improvement in

    durum (De Vita et al., 2007) and bread wheat (Beche et al., 2014).

    This is largely associated with the introduction of semi-dwarf

    cultivars, now grown exclusively in many countries, although less

    so in the northern Plains area of North America, particularly in

    the case of durum. Future increases in harvest index are unlikely

    because it is impractical to further shorten straw length due to

    issues of mechanical harvest, so yield increases must come from

    improved overall biomass, coupled with resistance to lodging. An

    exhaustive long list of possible selection targets for potential yield

    and methods for their selection, have accumulated (Fischer and

    Rebetzke, 2018). Yield increases over time were associated with

    improvements in plant physiological processes such as higher

    stomatal conductance (leading to lower leaf canopy temperature)

    and photosynthetic rates (Fischer et al., 1998; De Vita et al., 2007;

    Beche et al., 2014) and associated traits such as leaf chlorophyll

    content (Beche et al., 2014). Manipulation of factors related to

    photosynthetic eﬃciency might contribute signiﬁcantly to future

    yield gains (Martin et al., 2011), but the probability of success

    and associated timeline are highly uncertain. Up to the present,

    physiological traits were improved indirectly through selection

    for grain yield because direct measurement of such traits was

    limited by the technology available to measure them. However,

    research suggests co-selection of physiological traits with yield

    per se can maximize genetic gain, and the availability of new

    tools associated with ground-based or aerial platforms is driving

    new interest in assessing crop canopy traits such as transpiration,

    chlorophyll content, and leaf area, in addition to plant phenology,

    in high throughput phenotyping systems (White et al., 2012).

    This can now be done at the scale required for breeding programs

    (Araus and Cairns, 2014). Combining these data with genomic

    selection, made possible by next-generation sequencing and SNP

    genotyping technologies, might help increase the rate of genetic

    gain compared to traditional breeding approaches (Rutkoski

    et al., 2016; Crain et al., 2018).

    Resistance to disease continues to be a major factor in the

    maintenance or improvement of durum wheat yields. Leaf rust,

    yellow or stripe rust and stem rust are globally important biotic

    constraints to wheat production (Eversmeyer and Kramer, 2000).

    Other leaf diseases such as tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora

    tritici-repentis) and Stagonospora nodorum blotch and Septoria

    tritici blotch limit yields, which can be mitigated by genetic

    resistance. For example, Fernandez et al. (2010) demonstrated

    that a 16% reduction in tan spot symptoms increased durum

    grain yield by 17%. FHB is a major disease of durum wheat,

    capable of causing yield reduction and loss of marketability of

    infected grain. Both genetic resistance and crop management can

    mitigate the eﬀects and contribute to incremental increases in

    yield potential (Beres et al., 2018).

    Going forward, the challenge is to vastly increase rates of

    genetic gain in wheat yield. The underlying key to achieving

    genetic gain for grain yield is having appropriate genetic

    variability from which to select. Past success is largely based on

    recombining alleles within elite germplasm and is now supported

    by advances in genomic selection (Haile et al., 2018; Montesinos-

    López et al., 2019) and high-throughput phenotyping (Condorelli

    et al., 2018). Hybrid wheat breeding is another approach to

    improving durum wheat, with indications of hybrids with 10%

    greater yield than the mid-parental value (Gowda et al., 2010).

    However, an eﬀective pollination control system for hybrid seed

    production remains elusive. Thus, real progress will require

    an infusion of new genetic diversity into breeding programs.

    This can be done by crossing with related landraces or wild

    relatives, recognizing strategies to minimize linkage drag of

    undesirable traits will be required. Introgressions from wild

    Exploring G × E × M Synergies in Durum

    relatives have been used successfully for disease resistance,

    although this has usually entailed many cycles of backcrossing

    and selection to develop agronomically suitable cultivars. New

    genomic technologies may be able to assist in the introgression

    process and shorten the time to cultivar release (Dempewolf

    et al., 2017), particularly if coupled with approaches to speed

    generation acceleration (Alahmad et al., 2018). Genome editing

    is a promising technology that will allow precise generation

    of new allelic variants for use in breeding. The clustered

    regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9)

    system was demonstrated to increase grain size in durum

    and common wheat (Zhang et al., 2016). The CRISPR/Cas9

    system requires precise determination of the desirable allele for

    mutation, which in turn requires accurate genome sequence

    annotation. Annotation of wild emmer (Triticum dicoccoides)

    and durum wheat genome assemblies will assist in this process

    (Avni et al., 2017; Maccaferri et al., 2019). However, routine

    application of gene editing requires extensive research to link

    gene annotation with phenotypic function (Barabaschi et al.,

    2016; Adamski et al., 2020).

    The development of strong international collaborations

    during the last decade, such as the Wheat Initiative2 and

    associated projects such as the 10+ Wheat Genome project3

    has signiﬁcantly increased our understanding of the wheat

    genome. This knowledge paves the way for future research

    that will link genes to phenotypic function. Maccaferri et al.

    (2019) recently demonstrated the linkage for the example

    trait, grain cadmium concentration. Understanding multi-gene

    (quantitative) traits such as grain yield will be more challenging,

    but ultimately achievable.

    Examples of Innovations in the “M” of

    the G × E × M Paradigm

    Seeding Systems – A Re-think on Sowing Density

    The role of management is to limit or overcome losses due

    to abiotic and biotic factors with the aim to achieve the

    genetic potential for grain yield. A fundamental step is the

    consideration of planting density, which is often under-utilized in

    the context of optimizing genetic yield potential, imparting yield

    stability and improving crop uniformity and competitive ability.

    Decisions around optimal sowing density are often inﬂuenced by

    convenience, past practice, equipment, and the cost of purchasing

    seed of new cultivars. This decision-making process can lead to

    less than ideal seeding rates as seed input costs may be perceived

    as cost-prohibitive if yield potential is not achieved. Thus, despite

    increases in genetic yield potential, sowing densities during the

    1970s through to the 1990s was fairly static at a rate of fewer

    than 200 seeds m−2 (Grant et al., 1974; Fowler, 1982; Entz and

    Fowler, 1991). However, research in wheat (Beres et al., 2010a,b,

    2011) indicates higher rates are needed similar to experiences in

    other crops such as corn where increases in sowing density were

    needed before grain yield of corn hybrids could reach potential

    and eclipse older conventional corn cultivars (Duvick, 2005). In

    wheat, Beres et al. (2011) reported a positive linear improvement

    2https://www.wheatinitiative.org

    3http://www.10wheatgenomes.com/

    to grain yield in durum at rates as high as 450 seeds m−2, which

    was more than double the rate of standard practices at the time.

    The potential of higher seeding rates to exploit the yield of new

    durum genetics was conﬁrmed in follow-up studies and is now

    the norm in western Canada (Beres et al., 2010b, 2011; Nilsen

    et al., 2016; Isidro-Sánchez et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2017).

    The adoption of high seeding rates also reduces the potential

    for weed competition and can be an important tool for disease

    management as crop uniformity can inﬂuence the prevalence of

    some diseases (Beres et al., 2018). Variation in crop uniformity

    generally prolongs the ﬂowering period of durum wheat for

    the most sensitive time for FHB infection (Buerstmayr et al.,

    2019), resulting in greater disease severity in the crop. Higher

    sowing densities in wheat reduces tillering and results in more

    main stems in a ﬁeld, which will shorten ﬂowering and days

    to maturity. Greater uniformity would also improve fungicide

    eﬃcacy as crop staging to determine appropriate application

    windows would be facilitated greatly if the crop was less variable

    (Beres et al., 2018).

    Seeding Systems – Seed Treatments for Abiotic

    Stress Resistance

    Seed-applied

    fungicidal

    or

    insecticidal

    applications

    are

    traditionally based on mitigating biotic stress caused by

    insects or seed/soil-borne pathogens (Hewett and Griﬃths, 1986;

    Mathre et al., 2001). McMullen and Stack (2009) observed a

    substantial improvement in germination and seedling vigor even

    when diseased seeds are used. Vernon et al. (2009) reported

    improved wheat stand with imidacloprid, in the presence of

    wireworms. Recently, the importance of seed treatments has

    been proposed not only in managing the biotic stressors but

    in mitigating abiotic stressors like heat stress, drought, wind

    desiccation, and frost, which usually arise from cold ambient and

    soil temperatures at planting and emergence.

    A study of soybean (Glycine max L.) seed treated with

    thiamethoxam reported accelerated germination and larger

    seedlings concomitant with buﬀering against the negative

    eﬀects of water deﬁcit (Cataneo et al., 2010). A Canadian

    study on eastern Canadian spring wheat reported that a dual

    fungicide (difenoconazole and metalaxyl) and an insecticide

    (thiamethoxam) enhanced the freezing tolerance of seedlings

    (Larsen and Falk, 2013). Ford et al. (2010) established that

    neonicotinoids such as imidacloprid and clothianidin induce

    salicylic acid-associated responses, which elicit plant protection

    to pathogens such as powdery mildew concomitant with abiotic

    stress tolerance.

    in wheat production systems (Beres et al., 2016; Turkington et al.,

    2016; Ye et al., 2017). The same seed treatments also improved

    crop vigor and yield stability when integrated into a system

    with factors related to seed size and sowing density. The most

    notable responses occurred in the weakest agronomic system

    with thinner seeds and low seeding rates. An economic analysis

    supported that a dual (fungicide/insecticidal) seed treatment

    provides greater gross returns (CAN+$31 ha−1) as well as

    improved net returns (+$22 ha−1) (Beres et al., 2016). Moreover,

    comparisons between spring and winter growth habits indicate

    greater responses in winter wheat. This suggests the prolonged

    period of abiotic stress associated with winter growth habits can

    be mitigated eﬀectively with seed treatments to overcome the

    negative aspects of the “E”.

    Seeding Systems – “Ultra-Early” for Life Cycle

    Synchrony

    Planting date and environment play an impactful role in

    durum wheat agronomic and end-use characteristics, regardless

    of cultivar grown (Forster et al., 2017). Historically, the

    recommended planting date for wheat on the Canadian Prairies

    has been early- to mid-May in southern regions and a targeted

    deadline of June 10 in the northern latitudes of the Parkland

    region. These dates were prescribed largely to meet crop

    insurance deadlines, or, are a product of on-farm logistics. For

    example, He et al. (2012) indicated that average commercial

    spring wheat planting dates were May 9, May 14, and May

    15, for Swift Current, Saskatoon and Melfort, SK, respectively.

    These dates appear late when compared with earlier planting

    dates they predicted using a DSSAT-CSM model. This is largely

    to ensure the crop has developed suﬃcient biomass so as

    to capture maximum radiation by June 21 when photoperiod

    tends to peak on the Prairies. Early planting, therefore, is an

    important integrated crop management strategy designed to

    optimize genetics and to fully synchronize crop phenology with

    maximum solar radiation and environmental conditions that

    achieve high attainable grain yield and quality (Beres and Wang,

    2018). Durum wheat yield losses in Australia are primarily due

    to water stress (Liu et al., 2015) similar to well-published studies

    in wheat from lack of rainfall during spring which causes a

    mild water deﬁcit stress prior to anthesis, moderate stress at

    anthesis and becomes more severe during grain ﬁll (French and

    Schultz, 1984). Agronomic solutions to maintain yield and reduce

    potential exposure to water stress, heat and frost can be achieved

    by manipulating plant development and sowing date (Bassu et al.,

    2009; Collier et al., 2020). To facilitate the timing of optimal

    ﬂowering, growers need to match a genotype development speed

    with sowing date. An emerging trend in Australia has been the

    shift towards earlier planting systems to overcome the negative

    impacts of climate change (Hunt et al., 2019b). However, there

    is less variation in ﬂowering time of the commercially available

    durum wheat cultivars relative to bread wheat in Australia,

    which is restricting a grower’s ability to adopt this strategy for

    durum production.

    Forster et al. (2017) conducted a study on durum wheat

    in North Dakota, United States and concluded early planting

    improved grain yield regardless of cultivar or environmental

    conditions during vegetative and reproductive growth. Early

    planting helps to enhance soil moisture usage, which is an

    important factor for growing durum and can be proﬁtable for

    the environments with low and high rainfall as well. They also

    concluded that quality diminishes in late plantings regarding

    semolina extraction, gluten index, and wet gluten values and a

    signiﬁcant reduction in test weight and grain yield on diﬀerent

    cultivars with delayed planting. Conversely, protein and kernel

    yellow pigment contents, vitreous kernels, and falling number

    were more related to cultivar and did not depend on planting date

    and environment.

    Research in Canada has reported a number of beneﬁts

    associated with an “ultra-early” planting regime whereby soil

    temperature in the top 5 cm of the soil surface dictates when

    planting should occur instead of a traditional calendar date.

    The authors report that grain yield was not compromised and

    often maximized when seeding occurred at around 2oC soil

    temperature. A greater reduction in grain yield was observed

    when planting was delayed until soil reach 10oC, despite extreme

    environmental conditions after initial seeding, including air

    temperatures as low as −10.2oC and as many as 37 nights with

    air temperatures below 0oC (Collier et al., 2020). An opportunity

    associated with such a system that results in earlier maturity

    is a reﬁned integrated pest management strategy. For example,

    one major pest of durum wheat is the orange wheat blossom

    midge, which attacks wheat during anthesis. An ultra-early

    planting strategy using soil temperature as a trigger facilitates

    an asynchrony between the vulnerable host plant phenological

    stage and the primary window of pest infestation (Collier et al.,

    2020). The same management strategy is used by producers

    to mitigate FHB infection such that earlier ﬂowering coincides

    with less optimal environment conditions for fungal infection.

    Early planting coupled with an early-maturity cultivar managed

    with practices that optimize crop uniformity might lessen the

    probability of FHB infection and reduce the risks associated with

    early fall frost events (Beres et al., 2018).

    CASE STUDIES OF G × E × M

    Synergies of genetic gain and agronomic management are

    critically important in achieving higher yields, including the

    adoption of the new high-yield cultivars, applying precision

    farming, optimizing the nutrient application, zero tillage,

    appropriate seeding rates, and irrigation management. Overall,

    the interaction of genetics and agronomy management strategies

    has resulted in up to 1.2% increase in yield per year over time

    in Canada (Figure 4), approximately double of the rate of the

    genetic gains alone (Clarke et al., 2010). While there is no

    evidence yet that rates of genetic gain have begun to decline,

    sustaining current rates long-term, or further increasing rates of

    gain, will require new genetic diversity, breeding technologies,

    and strategies. To double overall production, assuming the

    current balance of genetic and agronomic improvement is

    maintained, the rate of genetic gain in grain yield will have to be

    increased to greater than 1% per year.

    Fusarium Head Blight Management –

    Experiences in Canada and the

    United States

    Fusarium head blight is a devastating disease of wheat and

    a serious production and marketing constraint for durum

    production. It can cause signiﬁcant yield losses concomitant with

    reductions to durum quality via development of mycotoxins

    in the seed if the fungal pathogen fully develops without

    intervention. The mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol or DON, is present

    in the grain and causes serious downgrades when delivered to

    market. Moreover, once DON levels exceed 2 ppm, markets that

    would accept the grain are limited. Fusarium graminearum, the

    causal organism of FHB, overwinters on infected residues of small

    grains and corn. Synchrony between the release of spores and

    ﬂowering of the subsequent wheat crop phase ensures a high

    rate of infection within the spike/spikelet, leading to high rates

    of seed infection. The spread of conidia to the spike is facilitated

    with conditions that transport spores upward from the colonized

    stubble (splashing), and/or through release of ascospores into

    the air where windborne dispersal occurs to neighboring ﬁelds.

    The cycle perpetuates through the annual colonization of host

    tissues and when infected seed is planted without mitigation

    tactics. Conditions most favorable for the development of FHB

    are high humidity, frequent rainfall and relatively warm night

    temperatures at heading, especially in regions where host crop

    residues are present. Therefore, inoculum is rarely considered

    a limiting factor in the development of this disease. Currently,

    the recommendations for FHB control include growing durum

    after a broadleaf crop, using an approved fungicide at ﬂowering,

    and grow resistant varieties if available. Though there are notable

    diﬀerences between varieties in their susceptibility to FHB, there

    are currently no varieties that are considered resistant or even

    moderately resistant (Beres et al., 2018).

    Since

    2000,

    there

    has

    been

    signiﬁcant

    investment

    in

    breeding FHB resistant cultivars. In Canada, cultivars are

    rated along a resistance continuum as follows: “Susceptible”

    (S) (e.g., Strongﬁeld), “Moderately Susceptible” (MS) (e.g.,

    CDC Credence, Brigade, and Transcend), “Intermediate” (I),

    “Moderately Resistant” (MR), and “Resistant” (R). To date,

    the best cultivar rating remains at the level of “MS” (Beres

    et al., 2018). In the Canadian Prairies, Manitoba is the most

    vulnerable region due to frequent occurrences of FHB outbreaks;

    therefore, little to no durum is grown in that region. Some

    progress has occurred with respect to FHB resistance as MS

    FIGURE 5 | Durum cultivar adoption in the Canadian Prairies based on FHB

    rating. Original work.

    cultivars have now been released. Since 2015, there has been an

    increase in the cultivated area of the MS varieties compared to

    other varieties. The rate of adoption of cultivars and respective

    ratings for FHB in the Canadian Prairies during 2013 to 2017

    is presented in Figure 5. Producers have displaced susceptible

    cultivars with improved resistance, such that in 2017, 78% of

    cultivated area of durum wheat were planted with cultivars rated

    “MS” (Agriculture Financial Services Corporation [AFSC], 2020;

    Manitoba Agricultural Services Corporation [MASC], 2020; The

    Western Producer, 2020). Obviously, improvements to resistance

    that results in the release of I or MR cultivars is critically

    important to stabilize or expand both the production area

    and market access.

    Given the lack of genetic control options, greater attention

    to management strategies is required, particularly when durum

    seed is sourced from a seed lot with greater than 10% Fusarium

    damaged kernels. Mitigation strategies are most successful when

    Exploring G × E × M Synergies in Durum

    the disease cycle is interrupted at or prior to the ﬂowering

    stage to prevent spore dispersal and/or host infection. While

    the main management strategy for FHB mostly focusses on

    in-crop fungicide applications to control FHB, seed-applied

    fungicides have been recognized as an eﬀective method to

    improve yield and stand establishment when FHB stress exists

    (Ye et al., 2017). Durum wheat seed treatments that apply

    difenconazole, triticonazole, maneb, or ﬂudioxonil have been

    found to signiﬁcantly improve germination and reduce Fusarium

    seedling blight in ﬁeld trials with 5–45 % levels of infection, but

    with no signiﬁcant improvements in yield (Jørgensen et al., 2012).

    Other wheat trials have reported that seed treatments increased

    emergence and yield when levels of seed infection were high

    (>50%), with no improved emergence and grain yield in low

    levels of seed infection (≤10%), and increased emergence with

    no change in grain yield in moderate levels of infection (25–35%)

    (May et al., 2010).

    The lack of genetic resistance in durum varieties to FHB and

    poor eﬃcacy with management practices has led to a reduction

    of durum production in North Dakota and the migration of

    durum to the drier parts of the state. In order to improve

    eﬃcacy of management practices, research was initiated in North

    Dakota that created a G × M context by exploring genetic

    aspects with the inclusion of both susceptible cultivars and a

    breeding line with some level of known resistance. Experiments

    were conducted in four environments in 2017 through 2019.

    These experiments consisted of ﬁve or six genotypes (released

    varieties and one advanced line) that were either treated with

    fungicide or not. Yield and DON levels were measured after

    harvest. The released varieties are commonly grown in North

    Dakota and their current rating of FHB tolerance is listed.

    The fungicide treatment consisted of applying prothioconazole

    plus tebuconazole when most of the spikes had reached 50%

    ﬂowering (Table 2).

    The response of genotype and fungicide on DON levels varied

    considerably between environments. In Carrington 2017, DON

    was aﬀected by the interactions of wheat variety and fungicide

    (Table 2). This was due to the more susceptible genotypes

    having high levels of DON (more than 6 pm) when no fungicide

    was applied, and all genotypes having similarly low levels of

    DON (less than 1 ppm) when treated with fungicides. This

    location was in contrast to two environments where DON levels

    when averaged across genotypes, were reduced by only 0.4 to

    0.6 ppm DON with the application of a fungicide but similar

    to the 2019 data. Genotypes diﬀered signiﬁcantly across all

    environments for DON levels. Within the released varieties,

    no one variety consistently had the lowest DON. Though

    there were signiﬁcant interactions between variety and fungicide

    treatment, the moderately resistant varieties were still responsive

    to fungicides, showing the value of integrating control practices.

    The yield was only measured at two locations. Yield increased

    dramatically with the application of fungicide at the Carrington

    2017 location, but only modestly at the Prosper location. Only

    at the location exhibiting the highest FHB infection was there a

    genotype by fungicide interaction for yield.

    While fungicide-based options are the primary management

    response, other components should be considered. When

    designing crop rotations, the “1 in 4” principle is particularly

    important for FHB mitigation (Kutcher et al., 2011, 2013),

    whereby a susceptible crop phase occurs only once in every 4

    crop years. Moreover, sequencing durum after a broadleaf crop

    oﬀers advantages such as: potential increases in yield; reductions

    in disease pressure such as tan spot and Septoria; a reduction in

    inoculum load of Fusarium graminearum; preventative buildup

    of soil-borne pathogens; rotation of herbicide chemistry diversity,

    which helps delay the buildup of herbicide-resistant weeds

    (Knox, 2018). The need for uniformity has been discussed

    in the context of the inﬂuencing factors of seeding rate and

    seed treatments; however, crop nutrition such as appropriate

    levels of phosphorous contribute greatly to crop uniformity

    (Hooker et al., 2016).

    Durum is particularly vulnerable to FHB infection when

    produced under irrigated conditions. However, alterations to

    irrigation management, particularly during pre- and post-

    anthesis, is an eﬀective strategy for controlling FHB. Flowering

    is an important phenological stage for durum wheat, which

    typically begins 3 days after the head has fully emerged and lasts

    for about 3–5 days. This period also coincides with maximum

    water uptake requirements by the crop. It is recommended that

    irrigation should be terminated for 8–10 days during ﬂowering

    to reduce humidity in the durum canopy. Reducing water

    availability during this critical phase of crop development could

    compromise yield potential. However, durum grown on loam or

    clay loam soils may tolerate 10 dry days without signiﬁcantly

    impacting yield, if the 50–100 cm of soil in the root zone is at

    ﬁeld capacity just before ﬂowers emerge (McKenzie and Woods,

    2018). Thus, intensiﬁcation of irrigation management is required

    in order to mitigate FHB without compromising yield.

    The over-arching principle for FHB management is the

    manipulation of agronomic factors that facilitate completion

    of critical crop developmental phases, such as ﬂowering, while

    doing so rapidly and uniformly, as a consequence of early

    sowing and increased seeding rates. Experiences in Canada and

    the United States illustrate the importance of linking together

    multiple management factors. For example, a management

    strategy of foliar fungicide and/or ST+foliar fungicide generally

    produced higher yields with greater stability, particularly for

    susceptible cultivars in high FHB environments (Ye et al., 2017).

    These strategies and the adoption of practices involving proper

    fungicide selection, and optimal application timings and methods

    will lead to improved yield stability and quality in high risk

    environments (Beres et al., 2018; Newlands, 2018). This is

    critically important for durum as it would help to overcome the

    necessary use of moderately susceptible cultivars until such time

    that breeding can catch up and deploy genetics with improved

    levels of resistance.

    pressure for herbicide resistance. Several physiological traits are

    linked to the ability of wheat to compete with weeds, including

    early-season vigor, tillering, leaf area index, plant height, and

    allelopathic potential, among others. Fewer physiological traits

    impact the ability of durum wheat cultivars to compete with

    weeds compared with bread wheat cultivars (Zerner et al., 2008).

    This is likely due to diﬀerences in growth habit among durum

    and bread wheat. In general, durum cultivars exhibit reduced

    tillering and leaf area index; two traits that are often associated

    with early canopy closure. The ability for durum to compete

    with weeds is associated closely with cultivar height, where taller

    cultivars are generally more competitive (Zerner et al., 2008;

    Beres et al., 2010b; Giambalvo et al., 2010). For example, Zerner

    et al. (2008) studied how the height of near-isogenic wheat

    lines (NILs) contributed to the ability for wheat to compete

    with oats (Avena sativa L.). In their study, tall bread wheat and

    durum wheat NILs reduced oat seed production by 26 and 41%,

    respectively. Similarly, a study of three durum wheat cultivars in

    the presence and absence of a surrogate weed [barley (Hordeum

    vulgare L.)] showed diﬀerences in the ability to compete with

    weeds among the durum cultivars (Giambalvo et al., 2010). In

    their study, the ability for durum wheat to compete with the

    surrogate weed was associated with the stature of the cultivar

    (i.e., taller plant stature contributed to greater ability to compete

    with weeds) and the nutrient uptake ability of the cultivar,

    which reduces nutrients available to competing weeds. Much

    less is known about allelopathy of durum wheat compared with

    bread wheat, and the contribution of allelopathy to genotypic

    diﬀerences in the ability for durum wheat to suppress weeds is a

    current knowledge gap (Oueslati, 2003; Fragasso et al., 2013).

    Experiences in North America

    Wheat is an important rotational crop, often grown in Canada

    as the dominant cereal in crop rotations with other commodities

    including pulses and oilseeds. Pulses like ﬁeld pea (Pisum

    sativum L.) or lentil (Lens culinaris Medic.) are sensitive to

    many herbicides, leaving limited options for chemical weed

    control. Many of the herbicides that are eﬀective in these crops

    (e.g., the ALS inhibitors) have been rendered ineﬀective on

    several weed species with evolved resistance to active ingredients

    within this herbicide mode-of-action. Alberta and Saskatchewan,

    Canada, alone is home to 18 weed species with conﬁrmed

    resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides (Beckie et al., 2017;

    Heap, 2019). The cereal phase in the crop rotation provides an

    excellent opportunity to manage ALS inhibitor-resistant weeds

    and facilitate inclusion of high-value pulses in crop rotations.

    In durum, post-emergent application of synthetic auxins (group

    O/4), photosystem II inhibitors (nitriles) (group C3/6), or (4-

    hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) HPPD inhibitors (group

    F2/27) can be an excellent rotational weed management strategy,

    however re-cropping restrictions must be considered when

    using some of these active ingredients (Geddes et al., 2018).

    Durum wheat is unique from common wheat as it can be

    more sensitive to certain herbicides such as pyroxasulfone

    (Soltani et al., 2012).

    Optimizing plant spatial arrangement can help improve

    the ability for durum to compete with weeds. Some reports

    indicate that narrower row spacing (5 cm vs. 15 cm vs.

    25 cm) improves the weed competitive ability of durum over

    increased seeding densities (De Vita et al., 2017). Moreover,

    row widths >25 cm reduced yield of wheat. The greater

    impact of row spacing compared with seeding density is

    likely due to reduced tillering in durum compared with

    bread wheat cultivars, which could limit the extent to which

    durum occupies inter-row niche space compared with bread

    wheat classes. However, increased durum seeding rates may

    be a beneﬁcial management tool in zero- or minimum-

    tillage production systems, where moderate (20–30 cm) row

    spacings are commonplace. Indeed, increased durum seeding

    densities are correlated positively with increased leaf area

    index (Isidro-Sánchez et al., 2017), which can hasten crop canopy

    closure and reduce the quality of light available to weeds beneath

    the crop canopy. Optimal plant spatial arrangement by reducing

    row spacing and using high durum seeding densities (≥400 seeds

    m−2) can improve the ability for durum to compete with weeds

    and thus reduce selection pressure for herbicide resistance in

    durum production.

    Recent advances in multispectral or hyperspectral imaging

    technologies hold promise for real-time and site-speciﬁc weed

    management. Several problematic weeds in durum, including

    wild oat and annual ryegrass, can be successfully discriminated

    from durum wheat using multispectral imaging in the 400–

    900 nm range (Lopez-Granados et al., 2008). These methods hold

    promise for mapping of weed patches in durum, allowing for

    cost-eﬀective herbicide application including additional eﬀective

    sites-of-action on herbicide-resistant weed patches.

    According to weed surveys of Alberta and Saskatchewan,

    Canada conducted between 2009 and 2017, the most abundant

    weeds found in durum wheat were green foxtail, wild oat,

    volunteer canola [Brassica napus L.), stinkweed (Thlaspi arvense

    L.), and wild buckwheat (Fallopia convolvulus (L.) Á. Löve]

    (Geddes et al., 2018). Within these weeds, green foxtail, wild oat,

    and wild buckwheat have been known as the most abundant

    weeds in all crops in the prairies since the 1970s. Both

    green foxtail and wild oat are spring annuals that cause yield

    loss in durum depending on emergence timing of the weeds

    and weather conditions (Douglas et al., 1985; Beckie et al.,

    2012). Green foxtail exhibits seed dormancy at maturity for

    approximately 10 weeks and wild oat exhibits it for almost

    one year, resulting in moderately persistent seed banks. Green

    foxtail is highly responsive to nitrogen fertilizer and can

    be managed using suitable fertilization techniques like mid-

    or side-row banding. Volunteer canola is an annual weed,

    with seeds in the soil seed bank maintaining viability for

    about three years. Presence of this weed is often caused by

    large seed losses at canola harvest, resulting in glyphosate,

    glufosinate, or imidazolinone resistant populations in subsequent

    crops (Gulden et al., 2008). Disturbing soil shortly after

    canola harvest can reduce the density of volunteer canola

    originating from crop harvest losses (Geddes and Gulden,

    2017). Wild buckwheat is a spring annual weed with seeds

    germinating within the ﬁrst year in the seed bank, and

    surviving up to ﬁve years. It can cause signiﬁcant crop

    lodging, grain sample contamination, and harvest diﬃculties.

    It has the ability to climb the canopy to capture light

    (Hume et al., 1983). Stinkweed has the ability to grow

    like a spring or winter annual, with viability for over

    20 years in the soil and causing yield losses in many crops

    (Warwick et al., 2002).

    Experiences in Australia

    The evolution of herbicide resistance highlights the need for

    alternative forms of weed control including improving the

    competitiveness of the durum crop. The main aim is to increase

    the competitive ability of the crop against weed species, this not

    only means lower yield losses from weed competition but also

    greater suppression of weed growth and seed production (Bajwa

    et al., 2017). Agronomic or genetic intervention to improve crop

    competition works particularly well when the weed and crop are

    phenotypically similar, such as in the case of ryegrass and wheat

    (Lemerle et al., 2001).

    Durum has typically reduced early vigor and crop competition

    with weeds when compared to other cereal crop options in

    Australia. A comprehensive study of bread wheat and durum

    wheat genotypes from all over the world found signiﬁcant

    variation in the competitiveness of genotypes on annual ryegrass

    (Lemerle et al., 1996). Overall, bread wheat was more competitive

    against ryegrass than durum wheat. In Australia, there has

    also been improvements in plant breeding for crop vigor

    Exploring G × E × M Synergies in Durum

    in durum, the introduction of new durum cultivar DBA

    Aurora has demonstrated a similar ability to reduce ryegrass

    seed set through competition when compared to bread wheat

    (Goss and Wheeler, 2014).

    To encourage integrated G × E × M approaches in South

    Australia, Porker and Wheeler (2012) demonstrated that the

    management combination of variety, seeding rate, and herbicide

    all play a signiﬁcant role in the success in managing annual

    ryegrass (Figure 6). The pre-emergent herbicide combination

    of prosulfocarb plus S-metolachlor remains the main factor

    providing the greatest proportion of weed control. However

    combining this with more vigorous varieties such as Saintly

    and increasing seeding rates from 100 to 300 seeds m−2

    resulted in increased yield, improved weed competition and

    reduced weed seed set (Figure 6). This is consistent with bread

    wheat examples and the recommendation for higher wheat

    seed rates as part of an integrated weed management strategy

    is now strongly promoted to farmers (Lemerle et al., 2004;

    Bajwa et al., 2017).

    Sowing time also plays a key role in weed control. The

    beneﬁt of earlier sowing across most of the southeast Australian

    wheat belt is now well-established (Flohr et al., 2018; Hunt

    et al., 2019b). It is often tempting for growers to delay sowing

    in order to achieve greater control of weeds with additional

    tillage; however, these practices have been shown to signiﬁcantly

    contribute to the yield gap in Australian wheat (Hochman and

    Horan, 2018). Sowing earlier in warmer soils also enables wheat

    a competitive advantage against weeds (Gomez-Macpherson

    and Richards, 1995) and, when combined with eﬀective pre-

    emergent herbicides, can provide adequate control of annual

    ryegrass and reduced seed production without compromising

    yield (Preston et al., 2017). Broader adoption of alternative, non-

    chemical management options in-conjunction with herbicide

    weed management programs is essential for sustainable durum

    crop production in Australia.

    CONCLUSION

    Globally, durum is still considered a minor wheat crop

    and typically much of the research eﬀort on durum often

    is conducted in conjunction with studies of bread wheat.

    Moreover, management practices are often borrowed from

    research conducted on common wheat. While we have sought to

    present synergies possible with a G × E × M paradigm, it is clear

    a coordinated eﬀort and cross-disciplinary approach is yet to be

    fully realized, which underscores the need for transformational

    research that exempliﬁes the G × E × M paradigm (Beres et al.,

    2020). In many areas of the world, climate change will drive

    future research and innovation, which requires a re-think of how

    we link together all the genetic and management components

    when designing a resilient cropping system (Fletcher et al., 2020).

    Rather than commonplace ‘reactive agronomy’, transformational

    research will be needed where there is greater emphasis on

    integration and optimization of the overall G × E × M

    system by the agronomist (Hunt et al., 2019a). Agronomists

    must be the leaders, the translators and the communicators,

    accessing the best discipline-based knowledge and expertise

    where relevant to deliver transformational change. Kirkegaard

    and Hunt (2010) demonstrated how a systems approach can

    transform a wheat-based cropping system averaging 1.6 Mg

    ha−1 with inherent sustainability issues into a resilient system

    that increased attainable yield by 3×. This represents the

    type of modiﬁed paradigm needed to address the very real

    threat of declining rates of yield growth (Fischer and Connor,

    2018). A major component when deﬁning resiliency will

    be the need for systems to be sustainable. Moreover, the

    sustainable intensiﬁcation of cropping systems is considered

    the only feasible path to meet future food demands (durum

    no exception) as it is recognized that further conversions

    of natural ecosystems to farmland is not tenable (Cassman

    and Grassini, 2020). The Wheat Initiative4 could provide the

    framework in charting this path forward as it brings together

    wheat experts from around the world to participate in cross-

    disciplinary teams and working groups to establish priorities for

    global wheat research.

    Genotype × Environment × Management (G × E × M) systems

    that will ﬂourish in the ﬁeld under unpredictable conditions of

    prairie farmlands.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Measurement of plant characteristics is still
    the primary bottleneck in both plant breeding and crop management. Rapid and accurate
    acquisition of information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring
    plant health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years, high-throughput
    phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both remote sensing and machine
    learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors (e.g., high-resolution RGB, multispectral,
    hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR))
    allows a range of spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question.
    Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged as powerful
    tools for extracting useful biological information from image data. Together,
    these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological, structural, biophysical,
    and biochemical traits. In this review, we focus on the recent development of
    phenomics approaches in strawberry farming, particularly those utilizing remote
    sensing and machine learning, with an eye toward future prospects for strawberries
    in precision agriculture. The research discussed is broadly categorized according
    to strawberry traits related to (1) fruit/flower detection, fruit maturity, fruit
    quality, internal fruit attributes, fruit shape, and yield prediction; (2) leaf
    and canopy attributes; (3) water stress; and (4) pest and disease detection. Finally,
    we present a synthesis of the potential research opportunities and directions
    that could further promote the use of remote sensing and machine learning in strawberry
    farming. Keywords: artificial intelligence; Fragaria; machine learning; phenomics;
    phenotyping; plant breeding; precision agriculture Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction
    According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Future of Food and
    Agriculture: Alternative Pathways to 2050 report, the global population will reach
    almost 10 billion in 2050 [1], which mandates a continued increase in crop production.
    Meanwhile, agriculture is under increasing resource constraints within the context
    of climate change, with decreasing water and land resources. Precision agriculture
    is an important approach to help meet this goal of a continuous increase in crop
    production. Precision agriculture is an operation and management system supported
    by information technology that makes targeted measurements of plant growth, plant
    health, soil conditions, and other factors [2,3]. Through the integration of the
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Geographic Information System (GIS),
    and remote sensing technologies, precision agriculture can help achieve a number
    of specific goals, such as (1) conduction of farmland surveys; (2) site-specific
    precision application of fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation management schemes;
    and (3) fine-scale monitoring of crop status, soil moisture, diseases, and pests
    [2]. Implementing informed and science-based decision-making protocols can increase
    profits and productivity, environmental sustainability, crop quality, and ultimately
    food security [4]. Recently, applications of precision agriculture have gradually
    spread throughout the world as the adoption of auto-guidance systems, yield monitoring
    technology, and variable rate technology (VRT) in agriculture has increased in
    both developed and developing countries over the past 20 years [5]. Another important
    application of precision agriculture is in plant phenotyping, particularly within
    the context of breeding and genetic research. Phenotyping is broadly defined as
    the acquisition and evaluation of complex plant traits, such as geometric structure,
    abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance, yield, and other physiological and
    biochemical characteristics. The measurement of economically important traits
    is essential to plant breeding [6]. With the combination of remote sensing, computer
    vision, and robotics, high-throughput plant phenotyping platforms have been developed.
    These systems usually use multiple sensors to measure various traits, such as
    color, texture, plant height, area, volume, degree of wilting, fresh weight, number
    of flowers/fruits, and quality of fruits [7]. This information enables scientists
    to establish a connection between genotype and phenotype, thus allowing them to
    select resilient varieties with high yield potential in the target environment.
    Of course, the same technologies and similar approaches are also valuable for
    crop management, specifically determination of nutrient needs, water, and pesticide
    requirements, as well as the detection of weeds, pathogens, and pests [8]. At
    present, plant phenotyping is the primary bottleneck in both plant breeding and
    crop management. Connecting phenotype to genotype in a set of target environments
    is the basic goal [9]. Next-generation advances in DNA sequencing technology and
    genome assembly methodology have dramatically increased the throughput and lowered
    the cost of genotyping. However, connecting this mountain of genomic information
    to the expression of traits is still a knotty problem [10]. The greatest challenge
    at present is to rapidly acquire large-scale plant phenotyping data with high
    dimensionality, density, and accuracy from single molecules to entire organisms.
    While new phenomics technology has significantly relieved some bottlenecks, many
    questions remain on how to efficiently define and extract complex traits as well
    as improve accuracy and throughput [11]. New advances in remote sensing and machine
    learning have the capacity to solve many of these problems. Strawberry (Fragaria
    × ananassa) is a very popular fruit among consumers by virtue of its appealing
    appearance, flavor, and health benefits [12]. The latest statistics from the FAO
    show that the world’s strawberry yield and cultivated area from 1961 to 2018 grew
    at annual rates of about 1.82% and 2.44%, respectively (Figure 1). A large portion
    of the research conducted during this period focused on the medical benefits of
    strawberries to human health [6]. The high-value market for strawberries has significantly
    promoted the breeding of new varieties worldwide, including in Europe, Asia, and
    North America [13], which is now driving the need for high-throughput phenotyping
    techniques. Accurate and rapid acquisition of heritable traits of interest is
    critical to improving the strawberry breeding selection accuracy. Remote sensing
    and machine learning can greatly relieve the heavy burden of manual work for strawberry
    phenotyping, such as plant height measurement and fruit quality evaluation. How
    to effectively improve accuracy and throughput is a hot research theme. On the
    other hand, strawberry is a highly perishable and labor-intensive crop that can
    benefit greatly from precision agriculture approaches. The fruits have many developmental
    stages and when ripe are very sensitive to environmental and management conditions.
    Plant development and fruit production can continually cycle and change over a
    6-month period, depending on the growing region. Therefore, real-time and intelligent
    monitoring of plant health and development as well as fruit quality assessment
    is essential for crop management and strategy formulation. The combination of
    remote sensing and machine learning is considered to have huge potential and a
    broad application space in these areas. Figure 1. Global trends in strawberry
    yield and harvested area from 1961 to 2018 [14]. In this manuscript, we reviewed
    the use of remote sensing and machine learning in agricultural applications, especially
    focusing on the latest advances in strawberry phenotyping and management. The
    manuscript also presented a synthesis of potential research opportunities and
    directions that could further support strawberry farming. A rigorous two-step
    approach was adopted to search and screen the literature related to remote sensing
    and machine learning applications, with an emphasis on strawberry. Details of
    the adopted approach and the number of articles on each topic are shown in Appendix
    A and Figure A1, respectively. 2. Remote Sensing Platforms and Sensors Remote
    sensing technology has developed rapidly in recent years, with sensors providing
    higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution images. Remotely sensed data
    are acquired by mounting sensors on multiple platforms, including satellites,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), and ground-based vehicles. The unparalleled
    advantage of satellite observation lies in its large area of coverage, which allows
    for collecting various types of datasets, routinely on a global scale. A summary
    of agricultural data sources by Huang et al. [15] presented 28 optical and synthetic
    aperture radar (SAR) satellites for plant vegetation studies, with spatial resolutions
    varying from 0.3 m to 1 km. Research on the agriculture-related applications of
    satellite sensors focuses on several aspects, including crop type classification
    [16], soil property determination [17,18,19], crop mapping and spatial statistics
    [20], crop yield forecasting and canopy parameter estimation [21], and irrigation/drought
    evaluation [19,22]. For example, Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery was used to
    retrieve various biophysical parameters of winter wheat, including the leaf area
    index, leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy chlorophyll content, utilizing vegetation
    indices and radiative transfer modeling [23]. A combination of two indices, enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI) and vegetation optical depth (VOD), derived from optical
    (MODIS) and microwave (Soil Moisture Active Passive Satellite, SMAP) remote sensors,
    respectively, was used to make a prediction of the corn, soybean, and wheat yield
    on the county scale, with an accuracy of over 76% [24]. In contrast to satellites,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, can carry low-cost sensors and can
    operate on a flexible on-demand schedule. Due to higher spatial resolution, low
    cost, and high maneuverability, drones have become one of the most widely used
    remote sensing platforms in agriculture. Yang et al. [7] investigated the current
    progress and future prospects of UAVs as a remote sensing platform by reviewing
    96 articles. Radoglou-Grammatikis et al. [25] further made a comprehensive survey
    of UAV applications in precision agriculture. Currently, non-destructive crop
    monitoring and smart spraying are two of the primary UAV applications. Moreover,
    the integration of UAVs, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the Internet of
    Things (IoT) and the maturity of 5th-generation (5G) technology can make several
    applications such as pesticide application, irrigation, crop monitoring, and soil
    property analysis more precise, timely, and efficient [26,27,28,29]. Compared
    with satellites and drones, ground-based platforms enable close-range detection
    of plant characteristics and generally serve as ground truth information sources
    for sensor calibration and data quality control. Ground-based platforms can be
    categorized into sensors mounted on fixed platforms, such as towers or booms (fixed
    scanning systems); handheld field measuring instruments; and sensors mounted on
    mobile ground vehicles [30,31]. Currently, the main sensors used in remote sensing
    agricultural applications consist of passive multispectral, hyperspectral, visible
    RGB (VIS), and near-infrared (NIR) sensors, fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging
    sensors, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
    [32]. High-resolution RGB images are widely used in vegetation classification;
    identification of plant leaves, canopy, and fruits; and estimation of geometric
    attributes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging provides spectral information
    about various parameters related to physiological and biochemical attributes,
    such as the leaf area index (LAI), crop water content, leaf/canopy chlorophyll
    content, and nitrogen content [7,33]. These parameters are very useful for crop
    growth evaluation and yield prediction. Fluorescence remote sensing is efficient
    in retrieving the chlorophyll and nitrogen content, nitrogen-to-carbon ratio,
    and LAI [34]. LiDAR has the advantage of a high point-cloud density, which is
    useful for obtaining horizontal and vertical structural characteristics of plants
    [35]. A synthetic aperture radar can function in very low visibility weather conditions
    (e.g., cloud cover). It has been extensively explored in crop classification,
    crop growth monitoring, and soil moisture monitoring [36,37,38]. Specific uses
    of different sensor types in different agricultural applications are elaborated
    by Yang et al. [7]. Strawberry is different from most agronomic crops like corn,
    soybeans, and wheat in various aspects. It is clonally propagated, and a single
    plant is relatively small in size but has a complex growth habit that includes
    several parts such as the crown, leaves, runners, inflorescences, and fleshy fruits.
    Higher-spatial-resolution imagery is needed to reveal the canopy structure and
    identify the fruits. Handheld sensors as well as sensors mounted on UAVs and ground-based
    platforms have been used to study various strawberry phenotyping traits. Some
    commonly used UAV types for agriculture applications are elaborated by Radoglou-Grammatikis
    et al. [25]. Ground-based platforms (e.g., tractors) were used to collect high-quality
    images and generate a 3D point cloud for strawberry plants [39]. Handheld non-imaging
    spectrometers that cover a wide spectral range (350–2500 nm) and provide continuous
    spectral reflectance could be used to study strawberry physiological characteristics
    [40]. Additionally, many researchers designed various types of phenotyping platforms
    for strawberry disease detection and fruit quality evaluation. Multispectral or
    hyperspectral sensors mounted on various platforms have been used for specific
    purposes, such as powdery mildew disease detection, fruit grading, and fruit 3D
    construction [41]. Some platforms and topics discussed in this review are shown
    in Figure 2. Figure 2. Strawberry traits can be assessed using a variety of sensors
    mounted on multiple platforms. 3. Machine and Deep Learning Analysis Methods Machine
    learning (ML) is one of the most effective ways to process and analyze the vast
    amounts of data obtained by today’s remote sensing techniques. In general, machine
    learning used in the agricultural field can be grouped into four categories: (1)
    crop monitoring, including yield estimation, disease and weed detection, species
    recognition, and crop quality assessment; (2) livestock management, such as animal
    welfare and livestock production; (3) water regulation, for example, plant evapotranspiration
    estimation; and (4) soil management, including the identification and prediction
    of soil temperature and moisture content [42]. Traditional machine learning methods,
    such as support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and
    random forests (RFs), require the extraction of key features from image or LiDAR
    datasets that sufficiently represent the characteristics of the studied objects
    or phenomena [43,44]. The quality of selected features is critical to the classification
    or prediction performance [45]. However, finding the best feature subset can be
    a time-consuming and subjective process, especially for highly dimensional datasets
    and in problems with a complex domain (e.g., crop yield estimation) [46]. For
    example, Sabanci et al. [47] extracted 12 features of wheat grains from high-resolution
    RGB images, including grain dimension (length, width, perimeter, and area), spectral
    band (red, green, and blue), and texture (contrast, correlation, energy, homogeny,
    and entropy) information. These features were imported into an ANN model to classify
    the wheat into two types, bread and durum, with an accuracy higher than 97%. Deep
    learning (DL) has emerged as perhaps the most important branch of machine learning.
    Deep learning refers to the extension of ANNs to accommodate neural networks with
    a relatively large number of layers that enable hierarchical data representation
    [48,49]. Mainstream deep learning models at present include deep neural networks
    (DNNs) [50,51], recurrent/recursive neural networks (RNNs) for sequence or time
    data processing [52], convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis
    [53,54], deep generative models [55], and auto-encoder networks [56]. In contrast
    to conventional ML algorithms, DL models can achieve optimal discrimination features
    by determining a set of parameters during the training process; thus a specific
    step for feature extraction is not required [49,57]. The main disadvantages of
    DL methods are the need for massive training datasets, computing capacity, and
    training time [58]. Improving existing DL methods and creating novel algorithms
    have been the goals of numerous studies involving agricultural applications. Kamilaris
    et al. [59] reviewed the agricultural problems solved using DL, common DL models
    and frameworks, data sources and corresponding preprocessing procedures, and the
    overall performance of DL by summarizing 40 studies. They identified land cover
    classification, crop type estimation, crop phenology, fruit and weed detection,
    and fruit grading as the current main applications of DL in the agriculture field.
    DL may also have significant potential in seed identification, soil and leaf nitrogen
    content determination, and irrigation management. In addition, they identified
    the potential for long short-term memory (LSTM) or other RNN models in yield prediction,
    disease management, and water needs assessment based on consecutive observations.
    Overall, deep learning has experienced remarkable developmental progress and already
    has a number of operational applications in agriculture. 4. Fruit Traits 4.1.
    Fruit/Flower Detection Automated counting of fruits and flowers from images is
    a critical step in autonomous robotic harvesting and yield prediction [60]. In
    recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on this topic, mainly aimed
    at developing new image-based object detection and localization algorithms to
    improve recognition accuracy. Traditional image segmentation methods use morphological
    operations to generate binary images and separate fruits from the background according
    to the similarity of color, spatial texture, and geometric shape. For example,
    Feng et al. [61] introduced a strawberry stem detection and fruit classification
    workflow, which used the OHTA color space to segment the fruit from black-and-white
    plastic sheets, extracted the principal inertia axis feature to define the stem
    position, made a judgment of strawberry ripeness based on the hue intensity and
    saturation (HIS) color space, and then selectively harvested strawberry fruits
    according to fruit ripeness and shape. However, this segmentation method is not
    yet robust and stable enough for application in commercial settings that have
    variable lighting conditions, observation angles, object orientations, relative
    positions, and various clustering and occlusion situations. Recently, CNNs have
    evolved to be the most powerful approach for solving target identification and
    classification problems. The superiority of a CNN in image recognition lies in
    its ability to extract increasingly complex visual concepts and features through
    hierarchical structures. The first few layers can be used to learn simple local
    features, and the deeper hidden layers can capture more complicated semantic information,
    such as shape and texture. Koirala et al. [47] reviewed the use of deep learning
    in fruit detection and yield prediction. The author elaborated on the applications
    of current state-of-the-art DL frameworks in target recognition, including the
    faster regional convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN), single-shot multibox
    detector (SSD), and you only look once (YOLO), and in detectors, including the
    Oxford Visual Geometry Group network (VGGNet), the Residual Network (ResNet),
    and the Zeiler and Fergus network (ZFNet). Fruit weight and yield estimation were
    also discussed, which demonstrates the superiority of deep learning in analyzing
    multi-dimensional remote sensing data. With regard to strawberry flower/fruit
    counting, Lin et al. [62] applied RCNN, Fast RCNN, and Faster RCNN models for
    the identification of strawberry flowers from the image, with an accuracy of 63.4%,
    76.7%, and 86.1%, respectively. The Faster RCNN framework demonstrated good performance
    even if strawberry flowers were occluded by foliage, under shadow, and overlapped
    by other flowers. Another DL framework (SSD) was implemented by Lamb et al. [63]
    for strawberry detection. The authors modified the training images and network
    structure to optimize the detection precision and execution speed. This system
    with a sparse CNN can run quickly on mobile low-power hardware with an average
    precision of 84.2%. Yu et al. [64] further adapted a Mask-RCNN model for mature
    strawberry detection in the RGB image and achieved an accuracy of 95.78% even
    in a non-structural environment, particularly for overlapping and hidden fruits
    and those under varying illumination. Zhou et al. [65] proposed a robust deep
    learning architecture named improved Faster-RCNN, which adopted a transfer training
    technology based on Faster RCNN and greatly reduced the number of strawberry images
    required for training the network. The average fruit extraction accuracy was more
    than 86%. 4.2. Fruit Maturity/Ripeness During strawberry ripening, the fruit surface
    color typically goes through green, white, pink, and red stages, concurrent with
    the accelerated biosynthesis of pigments (e.g., carotenoids and anthocyanins)
    over a period of up to 30 days. Fruit ripening is a complicated process, with
    a variety of internal physical and chemical changes, which is mainly controlled
    by the synthesis and action of hormones [66]. Azodanlou et al. [67] found that
    as the fruit matures, there is an increase in volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
    and sugars, as well as a decrease in acidity. Meanwhile, structural changes in
    cell wall polysaccharides, especially the dissolution of pectin, contributes to
    fruit softening. The state of ripeness at harvest directly determines fruit quality
    and shelf life. Unripe fruits have lower nutrient values but are more resistant
    to physical injury. Overripe fruits are more susceptible to the external environment
    and fungal infection [68]. Rahman et al. [69] found that the shelf life of strawberry
    fruits picked at the 1/3rd maturity stage and the full maturity stage were about
    7.8 and 2.4 days, respectively, regardless of the genotype. Therefore, early evaluation
    of fruit ripeness and the determination of optimal harvest time are crucial to
    reducing waste in the supply chain and improving fruit quality [70]. Traditional
    strawberry ripeness assessment is implemented visually and subjectively based
    on the appearance, aroma, color distribution and intensity, as well as texture
    [71,72]. Standard maturity evaluation methods are quantitative, measuring the
    contents of internal quality attributes, such as firmness, soluble solids content
    (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), and total anthocyanins [73]. However, this technique
    is destructive, slow and requires expensive specialized devices and expertise
    [74]. Researchers have spent considerable efforts developing simple, non-invasive,
    and high-throughput ways to estimate the ripeness stage of strawberry fruits.
    Most of the studies have focused on extracting spatial and spectral information
    from representative wavelength bands (usually R, G, and NIR bands) to discriminate
    between strawberries at different growth stages. Raut et al. [75] proposed a direct
    color-mapping method to evaluate the redness of strawberries based on RGB images
    and sort them into pre-mature, mature, and over-mature classes. Jiang et al. [76]
    selected the wavelengths 535, 675, and 980 nm and introduced eight spectral indices
    to automatically identify immature, nearly mature, and mature strawberries using
    the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) model, with a prediction accuracy over 95%.
    Guo et al. [77] combined spectral reflectance and textural indicators (correlation,
    contrast, entropy, and homogeneity) of 11 optimal wavelengths from hyperspectral
    images and used the SVM algorithm to classify ripe, mid-ripe, and unripe fruits,
    with an accuracy higher than 85%. Yue et al. [78] assessed strawberry maturity
    in the greenhouse using only a smart phone equipped with 535 and 670 nm optical
    filters, which were chosen to capture anthocyanin and chlorophyll contents, respectively.
    Absorptance data for the two wavelengths served as variables in three regression
    classification methods (multivariate linear, multivariate nonlinear, and SoftMax
    regression). The multivariate nonlinear model yielded an identification accuracy
    of over 94%. Gao et al. [79] further used the AlexNet CNN deep learning model
    to categorize the strawberry fruits into ripe and early-ripe stages using hyperspectral
    datasets, achieving 98.6% classification accuracy. Recently, data collection processes,
    feature extraction and classification algorithms have been integrated into a real-time
    strawberry ripeness evaluation and decision-making system developed for harvesting
    robots [80]. 4.3. Fruit Quality and Postharvest Monitoring Postharvest operations,
    including sorting, grading, and spoilage stage monitoring, are of great significance
    for price determination, fulfillment of orders with specific quality standards,
    and sales strategy formulation [81]. In terms of strawberry grading, manual selection
    is widely based on the shape, size, color, maturity, and imperfection of the fruits
    [82]. Compared with apples and citrus fruits, strawberries are more vulnerable
    to damage due to their high moisture content, lack of exocarp protection, and
    susceptibility to fungal infection [12]. From the moment of harvest, strawberry
    fruits begin to lose nutrition and generally spoil after three days without cold
    storage, potentially generating toxins harmful to human health [83]. Therefore,
    it is helpful to have a rapid and non-invasive inspection method for postharvest
    strawberry monitoring. As with ripeness evaluation, emerging computer vision and
    machine learning technologies have enabled the development of automatic, real-time,
    and non-destructive fruit-grading systems. Liming et al. [84] designed an intelligent
    strawberry-grading system by integrating conveyer belts, cameras, and other auxiliary
    devices and employing multi-attribute decision-making theory to grade the strawberry
    fruit into three or four classes based on color, shape (13 feature parameters),
    and size. The final accuracy was above 90%. Mahendra et al. [85] compared seven
    types of features and used the SVM classifier to categorize the fruits into two
    groups: good and damaged. They found that the speeded-up robust features (SURF)
    were most effective in classification, with an accuracy of 90.73%. Sustika et
    al. [81] evaluated the capability of six CNN architectures (the baseline CNN,
    AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, Xception, and MobileNet) for the binary classification
    (good or bad) of strawberry fruit and its classification into four grading levels
    (1–4 ranking) using RGB images. The study indicated that VGGNet’s performance
    was the best, producing 96.49% and 89.12% accuracy for the binary and the four-grade-level
    classification, respectively. Péneau et al. [86] represented the consumer perception
    of freshness quantitatively by establishing the relationship between the fruit’s
    physiochemical parameters (appearance, odor, texture, and flavor) and consumer/expert
    ratings of freshness. Dong et al. [87] used long-path Fourier-transform infrared
    spectroscopy (FTIR) technology to capture the spectral characteristics of VOCs
    generated after different lengths of storage and then detect changes in VOC (esters,
    alcohols, ethylene, etc.) abundance. A principal component analysis (PCA) was
    implemented on the spectral data to distinguish fresh, slightly spoiled, and spoiled
    strawberries. As for storage time estimation, Weng et al. [12] collected the spectral
    data for strawberries from 0 to 60 h of storage with an interval of 6 h, using
    hyperspectral imaging technology. SVMs and RFs were then used to classify strawberry
    samples from different storage times with an accuracy of 100%. Partial least-squares
    regression (PLSR) [88] analysis has also been used to estimate the storage time
    with a prediction accuracy approaching 100%. 4.4. Internal Fruit Attributes As
    discussed in the previous section, fruit quality is broadly assessed by many parameters
    associated with the external attributes of the fruit, including appearance, texture,
    and flavor. However, the determination of internal fruit attributes (sugar content,
    juiciness, acidity, color, etc.) is also very important. NIR spectroscopy and
    multiple/hyperspectral imaging technology have been effective for evaluating internal
    fruit quality attributes in a non-contact manner. A difference between spectroscopy
    and imaging is that the former can only obtain single-point information, while
    the latter can provide spatial distribution. The VIS/NIR spectral range is usually
    selected for internal fruit attribute studies because it provides information
    about O–H, C–H, and N–H absorptions [89]. Spectroscopy and hyperspectral image
    data are highly redundant and require preprocessing and analysis. Most research
    on the retrieval of internal fruit attributes adopts the following steps: data
    pretreatment (spectral correction and noise reduction), optimal sensitive wavelength
    selection, feature extraction, and prediction model construction. ElMasry et al.
    [90] estimated the moisture content (MC), SSC, and pH of strawberry fruits using
    hyperspectral images. Optimal wavelengths were selected for the MC, SSC, and pH,
    using β-coefficients from partial least-squares models. Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) models were then applied to retrieve fruit quality attributes using the
    spectral data of optimal wavelengths, with prediction accuracies of 87%, 80%,
    and 92% for the MC, TSS, and pH, respectively. Unlike many researchers who only
    used the spectral information directly as input variables, Weng et al. [91] extracted
    the spectral information about optimal wavelengths, 9 color features obtained
    from color histograms and moments, and 36 textural features simultaneously from
    the hyperspectral images for the detection of soluble solid content (SSC), pH,
    and vitamin C. Spectral and color features achieved the best prediction for SSC,
    with an R2 coefficient of 0.94. In terms of pH, optimal prediction was obtained
    using spectral features only, with an R2 of 0.85. A combination of spectral and
    textural features helped improve the estimation of vitamin C, with an R2 of 0.88.
    At present, the main parameters retrieved for the internal fruit quality of strawberry
    include firmness; vitamin C (VC); phenolic compounds; TA; total water-soluble
    sugar (TWSS) content; concentrations of glucose, fructose, and sucrose; SSC; pH;
    MC; and VC. A detailed summary of the acquisition of these parameters using spectroscopy
    and imaging technology is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of articles addressing
    the estimation of internal fruit quality attributes of strawberry based on remote
    sensing and machine learning. 4.5. Fruit Shape Fruit shape is a critical parameter
    affecting the esthetic appearance and marketability of strawberries. Basic shape
    descriptors, such as length, width, and aspect ratio, can be manually measured
    with, for example, a vernier caliper. However, this method is not only labor intensive
    and time consuming but also limited in capturing the complex and multi-dimensional
    aspects of shape and uniformity. Currently, most shape classification studies
    are based on 2D digital images. Ishikawa et al. [103] extracted four types of
    shape descriptors from RGB images taken by a digital camera: (1) measured values,
    including contour line length, fruit length and width, and fruit width/length
    ratio; (2) ellipse similarity (ES) index, including the optimum ellipse area ratio
    and the boundary length ratio, which indicate the ellipse similarity of fruits;
    (3) elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs); and (4) chain code subtraction (CCS).
    Random forest analysis was conducted to categorize strawberry fruit shape into
    nine types: reniform, conical, cordate, ovoid, cylindrical, rhomboid, obloid,
    globose, and wedged. The recall ratio was used for accuracy evaluation since Kappa
    coefficients were not able to classify more than three types. The recall ratio
    ranged from 0.52 to 1, depending on shape type. Oo and Aung [104] proposed a simpler
    but efficient method for strawberry size estimation and shape classification based
    on RGB images. Only three parameters (diameter, length, and apex angle) were imported
    into a three-layer neural network for four classes. The estimation accuracy of
    diameter and length was 94% and 93%, respectively, for strawberries without calyx
    occlusion and 94% and 89% for those with calyx occlusion. The classification was
    between 94% and 97%. Feldmann et al. [105] further extracted 68 strawberry fruit
    shape features of four types (linear and geometric descriptors, outline-based
    descriptors, landmark-based descriptors, and binary-image-pixel-based descriptors)
    from digital images and introduced a method called principal progression of k
    clusters (PPKC), which can automatically discover potential shape classes. Relationships
    between four shape categories and features were built and used for the classification.
    The accuracy varied from 68% to 99%. Zhou et al. [65] used the length-to-width
    ratio of the minimum external rectangle obtained from RGB images to assess the
    plumpness of strawberry fruits. Strawberries were classified into three types
    based on this ratio: plump (0–0.5), approximately plump (0.5–0.8), and fully plump
    (0.8–1). However, this approach applies only for strawberries of globose type.
    Although 2D images can only reflect one dimension or plane characteristics, they
    are sufficient to determine shape properties to some extent. Today, imaging technology
    can obtain three-dimensional information. A 3D-shape-measuring system equipped
    with cameras, a rotation table, and an operation system was designed by He et
    al. [106], which generated 3D point clouds of strawberry fruits using photos from
    various angles and heights using structure from motion (SfM) methods. The errors
    were less than 0.6 mm for 90% and 0.3 mm for 80% or more of the strawberry fruits
    [107]. Construction of 3D strawberry architecture can provide information beyond
    basic descriptors. For example, uniformity is a key shape factor that is directly
    tied to fruit quality and sales volume. Li et al. [108] defined eight uniformity
    variables calculated from the 3D architecture of the strawberry fruit and evaluated
    the importance of each variable for manual uniformity assessment. The results
    showed that circularity of the maximum circumference had the closest predictive
    relationship with the manual uniformity score. A regular shape genetic locus was
    detected and found to be related to three uniformity parameters. 4.6. Strawberry
    Yield Prediction Strawberry harvesting can extend for many months depending on
    the growing system and environment, with dramatic variation in weekly yields.
    Forecasting strawberry yield ahead of time can help growers formulate labor/equipment
    allocation strategies during the harvesting period. Since weather fluctuation
    is a key factor, many studies have been conducted on how weather parameters (e.g.,
    solar radiation, wind, temperature) influence strawberry yield [109]. These significant
    influential factors were combined with other yield-associated traits as input
    for statistical models and machine learning methods to predict strawberry yield.
    For example, Misaghi et al. [110] applied three neural network models (multilayer
    perception (MLP), generalized feedforward neural network (GFNN), and modular neural
    network) for strawberry yield prediction using vegetation indices (normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI))
    and soil characteristic parameters, with up to 94% final accuracy. MacKenzie and
    Chandler [111] built a relational expression between flower counts, temperature
    data, and strawberry total weight, with a coefficient of determination of 0.84.
    Various meteorological parameters (e.g., net radiation, vapor pressure, relative
    humidity) were examined by Pathak et al. [109] for strawberry yield forecast using
    a principal component regression model, achieving 70% yield prediction accuracy.
    Hassan et al. [112] used hyperspectral remote sensing imagery to obtain LAI parameters
    and six vegetation indices (VIs) to explore the relationship between these parameters
    and yield under different growing conditions (organic and conventional). The prediction
    accuracy (R2) was higher than 0.7 except in the treatment using the black plastic
    mulch conventional system (<0.6). The result also showed that six VIs worked better
    than LAI as yield estimators. Maskey et al. [113] utilized predictive principal
    component regression (PPCR), neural network (NN), and random forest (RF) models
    to forecast strawberry yield using 26 parameters related to leaf and canopy properties,
    soil characteristics, and weather conditions. Each of the selected weather parameters
    was highly correlated with strawberry yield, and the neural network (NN) analysis
    provided the best prediction accuracy (95%). Nevertheless, these prediction models
    were generally spatially confined and need to be validated in field experiments.
    Another method for strawberry yield forecasting is to count fruit numbers and
    determine size and maturity using remote sensing images. Deep learning can play
    a crucial role in accomplishing this task. Using the Faster RCNN model, Chen et
    al. [114] predicted strawberry yield by identifying and counting strawberry flowers
    and immature and mature fruits from UAV high-resolution images obtained at two
    heights (2 m and 3 m). The results showed that the mean average precision was
    higher at 2 m (83%) than at 3 m (72%). 5. Leaf and Canopy Traits Leaf and canopy
    traits are generally divided into two types: architectural and biophysical/biochemical
    characteristics. Architectural traits refer to external geometric morphology,
    such as leaf length and width; leaf area; leaf inclination angle; leaf azimuth;
    and canopy height, width, size, and shape. These parameters affect the penetration
    of light through the canopy, light utility efficiency (LUE), and, ultimately,
    photosynthesis efficiency. Biophysical/biochemical parameters describe internal
    physiological characteristics of leaves and are highly associated with crop growth
    dynamics, nutritional status, and photosynthetic capacity. These parameters include
    the green area index (GAI), green fraction (GF), above-ground biomass (AGBM),
    LAI, leaf/canopy water content, leaf/canopy chlorophyll content, leaf/canopy nitrogen
    content, and leaf/canopy temperature, etc. At present, SfM analysis and LiDAR
    are two methods used to generate 3D point-cloud data and obtain 3D structural
    properties of leaves and canopies with desirable accuracy. SfM is a computer vision
    technique that aims to recover the three-dimensional geometry of objects by analyzing
    overlapping images taken from different perspectives [115]. The workflow involves
    several steps: (1) Image feature extraction and matching is performed, where matching
    algorithms are used to detect conjugate features or tie points between overlapped
    images. (2) Camera location and orientation estimation is done using the conjugate
    features in the images. A bundle-block adjustment process is then implemented
    to estimate the position and orientation of each camera at the exposure moment.
    (3) Orthoimage and 3D point-cloud production [116] is then conducted using more
    dense conjugate points detected through image matching. The point cloud can be
    rasterized to produce a digital surface model, which is used to generate ortho-rectified
    image mosaics. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an active remote sensing
    method that utilizes laser to generate 3D point-cloud datasets [35]. Most LiDAR
    systems send laser pulses and compute the distance between the LiDAR source and
    the point where the LiDAR pulse hits an object (e.g., plant leaf) using the laser
    pulse travel time. Other navigation sensors are then used with the measured distance
    to compute the 3D location of the point. Dense 3D points can be created this way
    to accurately depict the surveyed objects. One of the major differences between
    LiDAR- and SfM-based datasets is the significantly higher cost associated with
    LiDAR measurements. LiDAR, however, is capable of producing 3D points along the
    LiDAR laser path, which can reveal some under-canopy information. Both methods
    have been widely used to extract height, size, and shape of various crop plants,
    such as blueberry, maize, and soybean [117,118,119]. Two main approaches have
    been commonly used to retrieve biophysical characteristics and related parameters:
    statistical modeling and radiative transfer modeling (RTM). The former aims to
    establish the relationship between features obtained from remote sensing and field
    measurements using traditional statistical modeling (e.g., regression analysis)
    and machine learning methods. Commonly used image features include spectral (e.g.,
    band values and vegetation indices) and textural information. More than a hundred
    VIs could be calculated using different light spectra combinations extracted from
    UAV hyperspectral imagery, supplying abundant information about vegetation vigor
    and health [120]. It is worth noting that the red edge region, which is defined
    as the wavelength position of the inflection point on the red-NIR reflectance
    slope, has raised wide interest among researchers for LAI and chlorophyll content
    estimation [121]. As an alternative to statistical modeling, RTM considers the
    physical process of interactions between the vegetation canopy and solar radiation.
    Through the simulation of canopy reflectance, canopy parameters can be retrieved
    by RTM as long as other input parameters (radiation intensity, observation angle,
    soil conditions, etc.) are known [122,123]. Kattenborn et al. [124] revealed how
    canopy reflectance is linked with functional traits using the PROSAIL radiative
    transfer model (combination of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL
    canopy bidirectional reflectance model). Recently, several scholars have compared
    and combined these two approaches to implement leaf/canopy property retrieval
    [81,124,125]. Studies on phenotyping of strawberry leaves and canopies using remote
    sensing techniques are relatively rare. Luisa et al. [126] investigated the relationship
    between 11 spectral response indices and nitrogen (N) content of young, mature,
    and old leaves. The results showed that only green reflectance (550 nm) was responsive
    to N fertilization for individual leaves. At the canopy level, green reflectance
    (550 nm), red reflectance (680 nm), VI, and NDVI were highly correlated with N
    content, with an R2 of 0.5, 0.6, 0.56, and 0.56, respectively. Sandino et al.
    [127] adopted a basic computer vision method to estimate strawberry leaf coverage
    from RGB images with an accuracy of 90%. Procedures such as smoothing, dilatation,
    contour detection, threshold segmentation, and edge detection operations were
    used. Similarly, a more complex algorithm was introduced by Jianlun et al. [128]
    to segment the greenhouse strawberry leaf edge from the background noise in the
    images, which integrated the scale space wavelet transformation, canny edge detection,
    Otsu threshold segmentation, and morphological analysis approaches. Guan et al.
    [129] extracted planimetric canopy area, canopy surface area, canopy average height,
    standard deviation of canopy height, canopy volume, and canopy smoothness parameters
    from high-spatial-resolution RGB images (~0.5 mm) through SfM, object-based image
    analysis (OBIA), and GIS analysis. Three of the variables were used to predict
    the leaf area (R2 = 0.79) and dry biomass (R2 = 0.84) throughout the strawberry-growing
    season using multiple linear regression analysis. Abd-Elrahman et al. [130] built
    on this study by developing automated canopy delineation and canopy size metric
    extraction models to predict strawberry biomass at greater throughput. Takahashi
    et al. [131] applied Kinect (the depth sensor used in the Microsoft XBOX console)
    to detect plant height and leaf area receiving direct sunlight at different leaf
    layers over time under different environments. These parameters were compared
    to the yield, dry weight, and nitrogen content inside the leaf. Kokin et al. [132]
    used a thermal camera to examine the difference between the strawberry leaf surface
    temperature and ambient air temperature under night frost conditions, which reached
    a maximum of ~8 °C. 6. Abiotic/Biotic Stress Detection 6.1. Water Stress Water
    deficit stress refers to the inhibition effect on plant growth caused by soil
    water deficiency or high evaporation requirement in a low-humidity atmosphere.
    The detection of the plant response to water stress is critical to irrigation
    management. Current irrigation practices are generally based on indirect estimation
    of plant water demand or evaporation calculated from soil moisture content and
    meteorological data [133,134]. Gutiérrez et al. [135] developed an automated irrigation
    system equipped with a distributed wireless network of soil moisture and temperature
    sensors placed in the root zone of the plants. Through irrigation control based
    on soil moisture and temperature threshold values, 90% saving was achieved in
    water consumption compared to traditional irrigation practices. Morillo et al.
    [136] implemented precision drip irrigation for strawberries using crop water
    requirement estimates and optimum irrigation pulse design. The method incorporated
    soil water content and crop evapotranspiration data obtained from a local meteorological
    station. In contrast, monitoring physiological changes in plants due to water
    stress provides a more direct and intuitive way to assess water demand. Under
    water stress, a plant’s temperature increases due to stomatal closure and reduced
    transpiration. Severe water scarcity can lead to wilting and loss of key pigments
    such as chlorophyll, which cause irreversible damage to the photosynthesis process.
    Multiple remote sensors have been used to detect pre-symptom changes. Commonly
    used sensors for this approach include the thermal imager (TIR; 8–14 µm), VIS,
    NIR, shortwave infrared reflectance (400–2500 nm), and sun-induced fluorescence
    (SIF; 685 and 740 nm). Thermal infrared imaging has demonstrated advantages compared
    to other remote sensing spectral domains in crop water stress detection. Through
    the analysis of information in different spectral ranges, numerous indices sensitive
    to water stress were proposed, such as temperature-based indices (stress degree
    day (SDD), crop water stress index (CWSI), and water deficit index (WDI)) and
    leaf-water-content-related indices (water index (WI), leaf water index (LWI),
    moisture stress index (MSI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI)) [137].
    These indicators can quantitatively reflect the water deficit of leaves or canopy
    to some extent. As for strawberries, drought severely limits plant growth and
    reduces yield and fruit quality. Extensive research has been done to investigate
    responses of strawberries to water stress, including changes in yield and morphological,
    physiological, and biochemical properties. Drought-tolerant cultivars have been
    selected according to their adaptability to limited water supply [138]. Numerous
    parameters related to strawberry growth status, such as leaf area, leaf size,
    leaf longevity, dry mass, number of leaves per plant, leaf expansion rates, leaf
    chlorophyll content, chlorophyll stability index, leaf moisture content, stomatal
    conductance, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, root development, and plant
    height, exhibit a decreasing tendency under water stress [139,140,141]. Adak et
    al. [142] found that water deficit increased some biochemical features of fruits,
    such as total phenolics, total anthocyanins, antioxidant activity, and sugar content.
    Strawberry fruit weight and yield per unit declined by 59.72% and 63.62%, respectively,
    under water stress as compared to control conditions. It is helpful in crop management
    to provide a real-time, accurate assessment of water demand inside the strawberry
    plant. Peñuelas et al. [143] found that strawberry leaf temperature and the CWSI
    obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer were very useful in evaluating even
    mild water stress. Razavi et al. [144] used chlorophyll fluorescence to identify
    drought stress in strawberries. Delalieux et al. [145] compared plant height,
    NDVI, red edge inflection point (REIP), and pigment-specific simple ratio for
    chlorophyll b (PSSRb) differences between strawberries under two irrigation scenarios
    (20% and 100%) using the COmpact hyperSpectral Imaging (COSI) system. The study
    indicated that the growth inhibition caused by water shortage could be detected
    using these spectral characteristics. Li et al. [146] measured strawberry plant
    temperature, dry surface temperature (Tdry), wet surface temperature (Twet) for
    a single point, and the whole plant area using a TIR sensor. They found the CWSI
    to be significant in detecting strawberry water stress. More indicators were examined
    by Gerhards et al. [147], including surface temperature (TS), CWSI, sun-induced
    fluorescence (F687, F780), and TIR indices, as well as the visible and near infrared
    (VNIR)/short-wave infrared (SWIR), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), and moisture stress index (MSI). These results
    illustrate the great potential of remote sensing in water stress detection. 6.2.
    Pest and Disease Detection Strawberries are susceptible to many insects, mites,
    pests, and microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that regularly cause
    reductions in total and marketable yield [148,149]. Early diagnosis and control
    of strawberry pests and diseases is critical to avoiding yield losses. The occurrence
    of plant diseases is a process of pathological and physiological changes. Internal
    symptoms of diseased crops are eventually reflected as abnormal changes in external
    morphological characters, such as necrosis, rot, and deformity of strawberry roots,
    stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Visual identification of pathogen signs and
    plant disease symptoms performed by trained experts is the common practice. Nevertheless,
    this process is post-symptom, and its accuracy depends on the individual’s experience.
    Microscopic methods are not feasible for large-scale commercial detection of pest
    and disease problems [150]. Numerous studies have utilized remote sensing to recognize
    various strawberry diseases, such as powdery mildew, anthracnose crown rot, verticillium
    wilt, and gray mold (Figure 3). Reflectance at various spectral bands contains
    significant information about plant biophysical and biochemical properties, such
    as leaf pigment content (VIS: 400–700 nm), leaf internal structure and water content
    (NIR: 700–1100 nm), and the composition of leaf chemicals and water content (SWIR:
    1100–2500 nm) [139]. Consequently, remote-sensing-based plant disease detection
    methods focus on the optical characteristics of infected and healthy strawberry
    plants in the images acquired by one or more sensors. The majority of the current
    research in this area focuses on differentiating between healthy strawberries
    and those affected by a single disease. Machine learning (particularly deep learning)
    plays an important role in analyzing images for disease detection. For example,
    Park et al. [151] applied a CNN to classify healthy and diseased strawberry using
    RGB images taken by a smart phone, with 89.7% accuracy. Chang et al. [149] extracted
    40 textural indices from high-resolution RGB images and compared the performance
    of three supervised learning classifiers, ANNs, SVMs, and K-nearest neighbors
    (KNNs), in detecting the strawberry powdery mildew disease. The overall classification
    accuracy was 93.8% and 78.80% for the ANN and KNN classifiers, respectively. More
    studies addressing strawberry disease detection are detailed in Table 2. Figure

    Table 2. Summary of recent articles investigating strawberry diseases using remote
    sensing and machine learning. 7. Discussion and Outlook The primary aim of this
    manuscript was to present an overview of how remote sensing and machine learning
    have been used in strawberry phenotyping and management. We reviewed studies that
    have applied state-of-art technological breakthroughs in machine and deep learning
    techniques to detect strawberry fruits and flowers from images with high accuracy.
    This work contributed greatly to autonomous robotic harvesting and yield prediction
    applications. Statistical models and machine learning methods were explored to
    evaluate strawberry fruit ripeness, estimate internal fruit attribute parameters,
    and monitor postharvest fruit quality based on RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral
    image datasets. Various image-based fruit shape descriptors were suggested, such
    as fruit contour line length, uniformity, and ellipse similarity indexes. Structures
    from motion algorithms were used to generate 3D point clouds of strawberry fruits.
    Canopy and leaf images were analyzed to build models relating the biochemical
    content of leaves and spectral indexes as well as predict biophysical parameters,
    such as dry biomass and leaf area. Additionally, studies related to the detection
    of abiotic and biotic stressors were developed. Table A1 lists a categorized summary
    of the studies reviewed in this manuscript that were not presented in tabular
    form. Although remote sensing data acquisition and machine learning data analysis
    are already advancing the prospects of strawberry precision agriculture and phenomics
    applications, there is still an urgent need for further exploration. For example,
    questions related to how to expand the robustness and transferability of the statistical
    and machine learning models connecting fruit quality to image-based spectral and
    geometrical information are still active research topics. Deep learning is also
    very promising for further advances in fruit quality assessment. A deep learning
    method may enable obtaining multiple fruit quality parameters, such as shape,
    size, color, and internal attributes, simultaneously, which can help build a comprehensive
    evaluation system for strawberries and promote the automation of postharvest grading
    processes. Strawberry yield forecasting can be improved by integrating multiple
    variables such as weather condition, soil parameters, fruit/flower counts, canopy
    metrics, and various spectral indices from hyperspectral images as input. Many
    of these parameters, such as fruit and flower count and canopy size, can be extracted
    directly from the images using deep learning networks, which may effectively increase
    prediction accuracy and reduce manual work of feature extraction. Continuous,
    real-time observations of leaf and canopy phenotyping traits are critical to monitoring
    the growth and nutritional status of the plants. With the advancement of remote
    sensing technology, UAVs and updated ground-based platforms are being used extensively
    in agriculture. Sensors that are expensive and hard to access, like LiDAR and
    hyperspectral cameras, are gradually becoming more affordable. Thus, an increasing
    number of studies are being conducted on using remote sensing and machine learning
    to obtain structural (e.g., leaf width/length, leaf inclination angle, and canopy
    height and width), biophysical (e.g., LAI and biomass), and biochemical (e.g.,
    chlorophyll and nitrogen content) traits of agronomic crops, fruit trees, and
    vegetables. Strawberry fruit shape is mostly depicted and evaluated by features
    extracted from 2D and 3D information facilitated by SfM and LiDAR technologies.
    As those technologies become more ubiquitous, more fruit descriptors and novel
    assessment systems can be developed based on the 3D architecture of strawberries.
    Although SfM methods were applied to high-spatial-resolution RGB images [129,130]
    to calculate several strawberry canopy parameters (e.g., canopy area, average
    height, volume, and smoothness), LiDAR could be used to obtain detailed information
    about a strawberry plant’s structural properties. For example, Jiang et al. [166]
    analyzed LiDAR data and proposed various quantification factors for the bush architecture
    of blueberries, including bush morphology (height, width, and volume), crown size,
    and shape descriptors (path curve λ and five shape indices). This type of research
    can be readily transferred to the strawberry domain. Besides, there is a great
    deal of progress to be made in predicting strawberry biophysical parameters and
    the photosynthesis process, and there is much to learn from other crops. Paul
    et al. [167] applied Gaussian process regression and the SVM model to estimate
    the canopy-averaged chlorophyll content of pear trees based on convolutional auto-encoder
    features of hyperspectral data. Li et al. [168] summarized the development of
    remote sensing imaging technologies for retrieval and analysis of information
    about various nutrition parameters, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
    iron, and magnesium. The study showed that a leaf or canopy nutritional distribution
    map can be generated, and the coefficient of determination (R2) of nitrogen even
    reached 0.91. Lu et al. [169] found that the total emitted solar-induced chlorophyll
    fluorescence (SIF) is more effective than top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF in the prediction
    of forest photosynthesis. Dechant et al. [170] further revealed the canopy structure
    is dominant in the relationship between SIF and gross primary production (GPP)
    for rice, wheat, and corn. Studies like these in strawberry are few. Multispectral
    and hyperspectral datasets, radiative transfer modeling, and machine learning
    analysis may be comprehensively applied to study strawberry’s biophysical properties
    and photosynthesis processes. Furthermore, in a general sense, there is still
    room for model and algorithm development and the fusion and application of multiple
    types of remote sensing images. At present, several studies have assessed the
    feasibility of different methods or parameters in the detection of biotic and
    abiotic strawberry stresses, focusing on single stressors at discrete time points.
    These works have tried to distinguish between healthy plants and those with a
    single disease, improving discrimination accuracies where possible, as shown in
    Table 2. For future high-throughput disease detection, there is a need to integrate
    multiple sensors and multiple time points to identify field areas and plants under
    stress automatically and rapidly, diagnose the stressor type and evaluate its
    severity, comprehensively assess plant health through time, and model and predict
    plant responses to management strategies. 8. Conclusions Strawberry is different
    from most agronomic crops like corn, soybean, and wheat in various aspects. It
    is generally grown on raised-bed structures instead of flat ground and is also
    grown in hydroponic systems and under greenhouse and plastic tunnel structures.
    Strawberry is clonally propagated and has a complex growth habit that includes
    several plant parts, such as the crown, leaves, runners, inflorescences, and fleshy
    fruits. The fruits have many developmental stages and when ripe are very sensitive
    to environmental and management conditions. Plant development and fruit production
    can continually cycle and change over a six-month period, depending on the growing
    region. These characteristics make phenotyping considerations complex for strawberry.
    Therefore, the methods developed in major row crops must be creatively adapted
    to strawberry. The development of ground-based devices, UAVs, and emerging field
    robotics is advancing the potential for monitoring strawberry growth throughout
    the entire growing cycle, from planting to final harvest. Remote sensing can provide
    massive amounts of data about crop condition and health via plant and fruit characteristics.
    This deepens our knowledge about the crop itself and allows more advanced management
    practices. Remote sensing may also be useful for postharvest evaluation of strawberry
    fruits. Spectral and textual information obtained from multiple sensors can capture
    both external and internal fruit traits. Further, available artificial intelligence
    options include an expanding array of deep learning techniques and computer vision
    analysis methods. This combination of advances in sensors and data extraction
    and analysis will continue to accelerate the use of precision agriculture in strawberry
    production and phenomics technology in strawberry breeding and genetics. Author

    Appendix A A two-step approach was adopted to search and screen the literature
    related to remote sensing and machine learning applications, with an emphasis
    on strawberry. In the first step, refereed articles about remote sensing, machine
    learning, phenotyping, and strawberries were collected from the IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect,
    Web of Science, and Google Scholar scientific database portals. The following
    query was used, which included the keywords implemented in the search: [“machine
    learning” OR “deep learning” OR “computer vision” OR “remote sensing” OR “phenotyping”
    OR “phenomics”] AND [“strawberry”]. In the second step, we screened a total of
    79 papers resulting from the search, of which 60 dealt with strawberry phenotyping
    and 19 were related to strawberry management during growth and development. The
    number of articles on each topic is shown in Figure A1. Figure A1. Number of articles

    \ 2016; Accepted: 4 August 2016; Published: 17 August 2016\nAbstract: As an important\
    \ parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture\n(SM)\
    \ inﬂuences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land\
    \ surface and\natmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations\
    \ of SM is critical for numerous\nlarge-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave\
    \ remote sensing provides many algorithms to\nobtain SM at large scale, such as\
    \ SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are\nalmost low resolution\
    \ and not applicable in small catchment or ﬁeld scale. Estimations of SM from\n\
    optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and signiﬁcant\
    \ progress\nhas been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents\
    \ a new, comprehensive and\nsystematic review of using optical and thermal remote\
    \ sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis\nand status of the estimation\
    \ methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important\nand latest\
    \ advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have been shown\
    \ in this\npaper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly\
    \ depends on the relationship\nbetween SM and the surface reﬂectance or vegetation\
    \ index. The thermal infrared remote sensing\nmethods uses the relationship between\
    \ SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface\ntemperature/vegetation\
    \ index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes and many\napproximations.\
    \ Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed data\
    \ can\nprovide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages\
    \ and weaknesses\nof different approaches are compared and applicable conditions\
    \ as well as key issues in current soil\nmoisture estimation algorithms are discussed.\
    \ Finally, key problems and suggested solutions are\nproposed for future research.\n\
    Keywords: soil moisture (SM); optical and thermal remote sensing; vegetation index;\
    \ land surface\ntemperature\n1. Introduction\nSoil moisture (SM) is an important\
    \ variable in land surface system research, including studies\nof the regional\
    \ water cycle, agricultural irrigation management, climate change and environmental\n\
    monitoring [1–7]. SM links the energy and water exchange between the atmosphere\
    \ and land surface\nand indicates groundwater conditions [8,9]. Additionally,\
    \ SM is used to indicate drought in vegetated\nenvironments because water content\
    \ is an essential factor for vegetation growth [10–12]. This means\nthat SM plays\
    \ an important role in the terrestrial water cycle [13–16]. When soil moisture\
    \ evaporates\ninto the atmosphere, energy exchange occurs between the atmosphere\
    \ and land surface. On the\nother hand, surface water and groundwater are linked\
    \ with the vertical migration of the SM that\nis taken up by vegetation for survival.\
    \ Because the SM plays two vital roles, it is an indispensable\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308; doi:10.3390/s16081308\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n2 of 29\nvariable in terrestrial research. SM estimation studies originated\
    \ in the 1960s because of the limitations\nof measurement equipment and theoretical\
    \ immaturity; however, this research mainly relies on\nempirical relationships\
    \ and point-based experiments [17–19]. In the 1970s and 1980s (corresponding\n\
    with theoretical advances), SM was treated as an important parameter in conjunction\
    \ with other\nsurface parameters in comprehensive studies [20–26]. Since the 1990s,\
    \ several studies have been\nperformed to determine methods for estimating SM\
    \ [27–32]. In addition, due to the advent of remote\nsensing technologies, researchers\
    \ have gradually shifted their attention to monitoring large areas\nby using remotely\
    \ sensed data. Based on the optical and thermal infrared remote sensing, many\n\
    approaches have been developed by establishing relationships between SM and soil\
    \ reﬂectivity or\nsurface temperature/vegetation coverage and soil thermal properties.\
    \ Based on the microwave remote\nsensing, various methods have been proposed for\
    \ the past 35 years [6,33]. For passive microwave\nremote sensing, the representative\
    \ models are GOM [34], POM [34], SPM [34], IEM [35,36], AIEM [37,38],\nQ/H [39,40]\
    \ and Q/P [41] for bare soil area. The representative soil moisture estimation\
    \ models for\nvegetation area are MIMICS model [42], water-cloud model [43], crop\
    \ model [44] and f-k model [45,46].\nDue to the close relationship between backscatter\
    \ coefﬁcients and SM, researchers developed different\nSM modeling efforts from\
    \ active microwave sensors, such as Empirical models [47,48], Semi-empirical\n\
    models [49–51] and Physically-based models [52–54]. At the regional scale, SM\
    \ has been obtained by\nusing remote sensing techniques, which represent a new\
    \ era in soil moisture estimations.\nTraditional\nSM\nobservations\nmainly\ninclude\n\
    single-point\nbased\nor\nspeciﬁc\nlocation\nmeasurements [55–59].\nThe direct\
    \ and most accurate method is the gravimetric method [60].\nThe original soil\
    \ moisture content can be determined from changes in mass. However, this method\
    \ is\ndestructive and cannot be reproduced. Moreover, this method requires a large\
    \ amount of manpower for\nsampling and lab measurements [61]. Time domain reﬂectometry\
    \ (TDR), neutron probes and gamma\nray scanners are subsequently used to indirectly\
    \ measure the SM. These methods are point-based and\ncannot be used as a proxy\
    \ for the regional SM.\nThe development of satellite technology provides a powerful\
    \ method for monitoring the\nspatial-temporal variations of regional SM and provides\
    \ quantitative estimations. Many experts\nhave established different methods for\
    \ retrieving SM based on the relationships between the SM and\nsatellite-derived\
    \ land surface parameters. Using the visible infrared band, the SM can be derived\
    \ from\nthe relationships between soil reﬂectance and different SMs or vegetation\
    \ traits that occur under water\nstress. These methods can be divided into two\
    \ categories, (1) the single spectral analysis method; and\n(2) the vegetation\
    \ index method. For thermal infrared wavebands, the parameters related to the\
    \ soil\nthermal properties are mainly used to derive the SM. This method includes\
    \ two categories, (1) the\nthermal inertia method; and (2) the temperature index\
    \ method. Combining visible and thermal infrared\nremotely sensed data can provide\
    \ more information for estimating soil moisture than the single one.\nSpatial\
    \ and temporal information-based methods have their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\
    It is therefore important to determine how to combine these methods reasonably\
    \ to obtain highly\naccurate SM.\nIn this article, SM estimation methods relying\
    \ on optical and thermal remote sensing are collated\nand summarized. Starting\
    \ from the main methods currently used, the SM estimation status and major\nissues\
    \ are introduced. Next, the physical principles, advantages and existing problems\
    \ regarding the\ndifferent methods are presented in detail. Finally, several recommendations\
    \ are made based on current\nissues faced when estimating SM. The overall framework\
    \ of different remote sensing methods used in\nsoil moisture estimation is summarized\

    \ Estimation from Optical and Thermal Remote Sensing\nAlthough the signal penetration\
    \ capabilities of optical and thermal methods are worse than those of\nthermal\
    \ infrared and microwave methods, the reflectance domain is the most operational\
    \ because the\nimages are easily available over a broad range of ground resolutions\
    \ [77–82]. Wavelengths of 0.4–2.5 µm\nrepresent the radiation of the sun reﬂected\
    \ from the Earth’s surface [83,84]. These approaches mainly\nuse reﬂectance to\
    \ estimate the SM in visible infrared remote sensing techniques. In this paper,\
    \ according\nto the different characteristics used of many bands in visible infrared\
    \ remote sensing, they are divided\ninto the single spectral analysis method and\
    \ vegetation index method.\n2.1. Single Spectral Analysis Method\nThe inﬂuences\
    \ of soil moisture on spectral reﬂectance were observed in early studies [85,86].\n\
    The reﬂectance of water absorption bands is different from that of non-absorption\
    \ bands.\nThe absorption amplitude and presented reﬂectance differences are used\
    \ to establish relationships\nwith soil moisture. From the experimental results\
    \ on many soils with different SMs as early as 1925,\nreﬂectance has been observed\
    \ to decrease as the SM increases [85]. Since then, many scientists have\nreproduced\
    \ this phenomenon and have established empirical relationships between soil reﬂectance\
    \ and\nSM [87,88]. In 1972, Bowers and Smith demonstrated that the absorption\
    \ amplitude was linearly related\nto the SM at the water absorption bands [86].\
    \ Based on experimental results, Jackson et al. [89] found\nthat the albedos of\
    \ all dry soils were approximately two times greater than those of wet soils,\
    \ except for\nsand. By analyzing the water absorption values measured in the near-infrared\
    \ band, Dalal et al. [90]\naccurately estimated the SMs of a large number of soil\
    \ samples. However, the above-mentioned\nmethods are all limited to speciﬁc regions.\
    \ Because of the different physical compositions, soil textures\nand surface roughness\
    \ in different study areas, empirical equations cannot be applied universally.\n\
    Corresponding with the development of monitoring instruments and theoretical advances\n\
    for estimating soil moisture, Jaquemoud et al. [91] developed the SOILSPEC transmission\
    \ model,\nwhich considers soil roughness, viewing angle and the inherent spectral\
    \ characteristics of soil to obtain\nthe bidirectional reﬂectance of the soil\
    \ from 450 nm to 2450 nm. Later, Lobell et al. [92] established\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n4 of 29\na physical model and indicated that an exponential relationship\
    \ exists between soil reﬂectance and\nSM by analyzing the changes in the reﬂectance\
    \ of four different soils at various moisture contents.\nThe model can be expressed\
    \ simply as\nR = f × Rdry + (1 − f ) × Rdry × (−c × s)\n(1)\nwhere Rdry is the\
    \ dry soil reﬂectance, c describes the change rate induced by SM, s is the soil\
    \ saturation,\nand f is the saturation rate.\nLiu et al. [93] applied a simple\
    \ stepwise linear regression method to reduce the band numbers\nand found that\
    \ the soil reﬂectance decreased as the SM increased when the soil moisture was\
    \ low.\nHowever, after the soil moisture reaches the critical point, the reﬂectivity\
    \ increases as the SM increases.\nThis critical point is closely related with\
    \ the soil hydrodynamic characteristics. Based on previous\nstudies, Liu et al.\
    \ [94] evaluated three soil reﬂectance models using 18 soils and the following\
    \ methods:\nthe relative reﬂectivity method, the derivative/difference method\
    \ and the discrete band difference\nmethod. The most applicable method is the\
    \ derivative/difference method because it can be used to\nestimate the SM precisely\
    \ and is less sensitive to external factors, such as the atmosphere and the large\n\
    variation of soil roughness and soil types, etc. Similarly, Whiting et al. [95]\
    \ obtained better results by\nusing the Gaussian model to estimate the SM. Using\
    \ a linear mixed pixel separation algorithm in the\nnear-infrared—red band space,\
    \ Gao et al. [96] used soil line equations and empirical formulas to derive\n\
    the soil reﬂectance of mixed pixels under vegetation cover. Combined with the\
    \ TM images for ﬁeld\nveriﬁcation, this method is applicable at different spatial-temporal\
    \ scales and the results are credible.\nBased on laboratory measurements of soil\
    \ spectral information, single spectral analysis approaches\nare generally used\
    \ to determine the relationships between SM and soil reﬂectance that can obtain\n\
    reasonable results for speciﬁc soil samples. However, in practice, soil reﬂectance\
    \ is affected by many\nfactors, such as vegetation, the atmosphere, etc. The measured\
    \ satellite signals on the surface will\nbe inﬂuenced or reduced, affecting the\
    \ reﬂectance and its operability. In addition, such methods are\nstatistical and\
    \ empirical models that lack physical basis to quantitatively determine the SM.\n\
    2.2. Vegetation Index Method\nBecause it is extremely sensitive to water stress,\
    \ the vegetation index estimated by remote sensing\nhas been widely used to detect\
    \ drought conditions, such as the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI)\
    \ and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [97]. Drought conditions can be reﬂected\
    \ by vegetation\ngrowth, which can be directly represented by the vegetation index.\
    \ By comparing the vegetation index\nat different times, the impacts of drought\
    \ can easily be determined. However, the accuracy of using\nNDVI-based drought\
    \ indices is often subject to changes in vegetation types and ecosystem differences.\n\
    Additionally, the NDVI-based drought index may be a conservative indicator [32]\
    \ because droughts\ncaused by water stress or rainfall anomalies will both have\
    \ time delays [98]. A detailed overview of\nthe drought indices for regional monitoring\
    \ was provided by Richard and Heim [99].\nMany classical drought indices based\
    \ on vegetation indicators were proposed and have been\nwidely used in drought\
    \ monitoring. To remove the inﬂuences of weather and geographic location\ndifferences\
    \ on NDVI, Kogan [100,101] developed the following Vegetation Condition Index\
    \ (VCI)\nbased on statistical NDVI time-series data:\nVCIij = 100 ∗ (NDVIij −\
    \ NDVI − MINj)\nNDVI − MAXj − NDVI − MINj\n(2)\nwhere VCI is a modiﬁed NDVI, vegetation\
    \ condition index; NDVI is a weekly smoothed composite\nNormalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index. NDVI-MIN and NDVI-MAX are the maximum and minimum\nvalues\
    \ of NDVI, respectively, which can be obtained from historical data. i and j denote\
    \ weeks and\nlocations. VCI not only describes the surface vegetation cover and\
    \ spatial-temporal variations but also\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n5 of 29\nquantiﬁes\
    \ the impacts of weather on vegetation. Furthermore, VCI can be used to evaluate\
    \ the effects\nof weather on different ecosystems.\nConsidering the error caused\
    \ by the instantaneous vegetation index and using the multi-year\naverage NDVI\
    \ values as criterion, the difference in amplitude was calculated from the NDVI\
    \ values\nobtained over one month or ten days minus the reference value, which\
    \ are positive or negative\nanomalies of the vegetation index. Chen et al. [102]\
    \ developed an anomaly vegetation index (AVI) to\nstudy annual vegetation dynamics.\n\
    The monthly AVI is calculated as follows:\nAMTNDVI = (MTNDVI − MTNDVI)\n(3)\n\
    where AMTNDVI is the anomaly vegetation index, MTNDVI is the average value for\
    \ the same month\nin different years, and MTNDVI is the monthly vegetation index\
    \ for a speciﬁc year.\nBecause its sensitivity to water differs, the relationships\
    \ among different water absorption bands\nwere applied to derive the SM. Gao et\
    \ al. [103] presented a normalized difference water index (NDWI)\nusing the reﬂectance\
    \ at 1.24 µm rather than 0.66 µm because the former is more sensitive to SM.\n\
    More importantly, the NDWI is insensitive to the atmospheric conditions.\nNDWI\

    \ reﬂectance. Based on the NDWI, Wang et al. [104] proposed using the normalized\n\
    multi-band drought index (NMDI), which uses the band differences between the sensitivity\
    \ of 1640 nm\nand 2130 nm for soil and vegetation, respectively, with enhanced\
    \ sensitivity to drought monitoring.\nThe successful application in detecting\
    \ forest ﬁres demonstrated that NMDI can provide a quick\nresponse to moisture\

    \ spectral signatures of soil moisture variations,\na new method was developed\
    \ for drought monitoring [107]. Based on the spectral pattern of SM\nchanges in\
    \ the near-infrared–red band space, the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) was\
    \ established\nusing ETM reﬂectance (Figure 1).\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308 \n5 of\

    \ Drought Index [107]. \nFigure 1. Near Infrared–red space and Perpendicular Drought\
    \ Index [107].\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n6 of 29\nFor a speciﬁc soil type, the\
    \ soil line can be regarded as a line that characterizes the spectral behavior\n\
    of non-vegetated pixels when the soil moisture content varies noticeably [108].\
    \ The PDI describes the\nSM distribution in the near-infrared—red space. The points\
    \ farther away from the coordinate origin\nindicate low soil moisture areas. In\
    \ contrast, the closer points represent wet conditions and the PDI is\nexpressed\
    \ as follows:\nPDI =\n1\n√\nM2 + 1\n(RRed + MRNIR)\n(6)\nwhere RNIR and RRed denote\
    \ the reﬂectance of near-infrared and red band, respectively; M represents\nthe\
    \ slope of the soil line. The PDI is suitable for bare soil but has many limitations\
    \ in vegetated areas,\nespecially for non-ﬂat regions with different soil types.\n\
    Ghulam et al. [108] introduced fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) for the removal\
    \ of vegetation\ninformation from mixed pixels and proposed the Modiﬁed Perpendicular\
    \ Drought Index—MPDI. If the\nrelationship between the reﬂectance of vegetation\
    \ and bare soil is linear, the MPDI can be expressed\nas follows:\nMPDI = RRed\
    \ + MRNIR − fv(Rv,Red + MRv,NIR)\n(1 − fv)\n√\nM2 + 1\n(7)\nwhere Rv,Red and Rv,NIR\
    \ are the vegetation reﬂectances in the red and near-infrared band, respectively,\n\
    generally set to 0.05 and 0.5 by ﬁeld measurements [108]. fv is the vegetation\
    \ cover. By considering\nthe SM status and vegetation growth, the MPDI can be\
    \ applied to vegetated regions to obtain\ncredible results.\nThe vegetation indicator\
    \ method can reﬂect the SM conditions from the vegetation index changes.\nThe\
    \ advantages and disadvantages of these commonly used drought indices are described\
    \ in Table 2.\nBecause the vegetation index cannot immediately reveal information\
    \ when the vegetation is restricted\nby water stress, a long period is required\
    \ to show the water-limited features after some accumulation;\nthus, this method\
    \ requires a certain time lag to show real-time SM conditions. Second, the inter-annual\n\
    changes of land cover types may affect drought monitoring results. Therefore,\
    \ interpretation of the\nmonitoring results should require the latest reliable\
    \ land cover map. Simultaneously, these methods\nonly consider that water stress\
    \ leads to reductions in the NDVI and do not account for other factors,\nsuch\
    \ as changes in temperature and rainfall. In addition, good quality satellite\
    \ data obtained over\na long period of many years must be obtained, and the obtained\
    \ results only reﬂect the SM deﬁcit\nsituation and not the true soil moisture\

    \ many surface temperature studies, the surface temperature variations at the\
    \ thermal wavebands\nor the soil thermal properties were strongly correlated with\
    \ the SM. Due to the special thermal\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n7 of 29\nproperties\
    \ of the soil in the thermal infrared band and its theoretical maturity, SM estimations\
    \ are\ngradually achieved. The thermal inertia and temperature index methods are\
    \ two main methods\nwith their own advantages and disadvantages. The development\
    \ process and their advantages and\nlimitations are introduced in the following.\
    \ Also, some useful references and recommendations\nwere provided.\n3.1. Thermal\
    \ Inertia Method\nAs a property of the substance itself, thermal inertia is often\
    \ used for mineral exploration,\nlithological mapping and geological research.\
    \ Thermal inertia was highly correlated with SM in\nnumerous laboratory experiments\
    \ and is deﬁned as the resistance to temperature variations that is\ninduced by\
    \ exterior energy and controls the amplitude of the temperature change. The higher\
    \ the\nthermal inertia, the less the temperature varies. The relationship between\
    \ thermal inertia and SM can\nbe determined quantitatively from the changes in\
    \ soil temperature or the diurnal amplitude of the\nsurface temperature. Generally,\
    \ thermal inertia includes the soil thermal conductivity and soil heat\ncapacity.\
    \ The soil thermal inertia can be expressed as follows:\nP =\np\nλρC\n(8)\nwhere\
    \ λ is the soil thermal conductivity, ρ is the soil bulk density, and C is the\
    \ soil heat capacity.\nWhen the SM increases, the thermal inertia increases correspondingly\
    \ and reduces the diurnal\namplitude variations of the land surface temperature\
    \ (LST).\n3.1.1. The Physical Analytical Model\nIn geophysical research, soil\
    \ thermal properties and SM show certain relationships [109,110].\nWatson [26]\
    \ ﬁrst proposed physical analytical equations of thermal inertia that were retrieved\
    \ from\nremotely sensed data. The SM was successfully estimated using several\
    \ meteorological elements,\nthe soil moisture proﬁle and remote sensing information.\
    \ In addition, Kahle [23] conducted many\nstudies on thermal inertia models, proposed\
    \ different approaches for solving one-dimensional heat\nconduction equations,\
    \ and attempted to integrate remotely sensed data to estimate thermal inertia\n\
    for large regions. In addition, Price [111] simpliﬁed the latent and sensible\
    \ heat ﬂux expression and\ncombined the surface one-dimensional heat conduction\
    \ equation with the energy balance principle by\nusing Fourier transformation\
    \ to introduce a comprehensive surface parameter B (B is a function of soil\n\
    emissivity, air humidity, temperature and other meteorological factors). Because\
    \ of the requirements\nof a large number of observed ground data in the B solving\
    \ process, this approach is unavailable for\nmany regions.\nMany thermal inertia\
    \ models have treated thermal rock and soil characteristics as a simpliﬁed\nlinear\
    \ function of temperature [23,26]. However, Engman [112] considered that this\
    \ relationship is\nnonlinear and includes factors such as the effects of night\
    \ frost. When combined with microwave data\nto solve the thermal inertia in vegetated\
    \ areas and validate in situ measurements, the obtained results\nwere reasonable\
    \ [113].\nBased on the above-mentioned models, Price [111] proposed using the\
    \ classical apparent thermal\ninertia (ATI) by removing the latent heat of evaporation.\
    \ The ATI can be expressed as follows:\nATI = 1000π\n(1 − α) · C1\nT (1 : 30 p.m.)\
    \ − T (2 : 30 a.m.)\n(9)\nwhere 1000π is used to make the ATI range from 0 to\
    \ 255. C1 is the constant term. T is the land surface\ntemperature, and α is the\
    \ surface albedo.\nThe ATI model is accepted by many scholars, and extensive studies\
    \ have been conducted in different\nareas. Combined with the ATI model and MODIS\
    \ data, Stephen et al. [114] quantitatively estimated\nthe SM and sediment availability\
    \ for a White ShashaQiu field in New Mexico. Verstraeten et al. [115]\nSensors\
    \ 2016, 16, 1308\n8 of 29\nused the ATI model to obtain the SM conditions in Xinjiang\
    \ and the soil moisture content by using\na two-source water balance model at\
    \ a depth of 1 m. The results were veriﬁed by using TDR\nmeasurements, and the\
    \ drought distribution and trends were analyzed in Xinjiang. Frank et al. [116]\n\
    ﬁt the diurnal temperature variation curve of the in-situ measured surface temperature\
    \ in combination\nwith the albedo to obtain the ATI and used AMSR-E soil moisture\
    \ data for validation. The greatest\nadvantage of this method is that surface\
    \ temperature can be obtained from the observation sites,\nwhich is beneﬁcial\
    \ for the equatorial regions. Chang et al. [117] studied the soil moisture conditions\
    \ of\ndifferent types of land in tropical mountains using the ATI model.\nTo accurately\
    \ derive the SM, Chen et al. [118] monitored the spring drought by using the improved\n\
    ATI model for the Hebei Plain. Next, 1 km pure pixels were merged with images\
    \ with 30 m resolution\nfrom the 1st environmental satellite (HJ-1) and the drought\
    \ was accurately monitored in the vegetated\nmixing zone. It was concluded that\
    \ the traditional ATI model was the most suitable for bare land areas\nand that\
    \ the inversion accuracy of the mixed pixels was poor.\nThe physical thermal inertia\
    \ model can provide information regarding hydrothermally relevant\nprinciples\
    \ and the relationships with SM; however, this model requires detailed atmospheric\
    \ forcing\ndata inputs and a complex calculation process. ATI is used as a proxy\
    \ of thermal inertia, and because\nmany factors are truncated, accuracy is often\
    \ not guaranteed. In addition, ATI is not applicable in\nvegetated regions. For\
    \ vegetated areas, FVC should be used to estimate thermal inertia. Moreover, the\n\
    ATI can be combined with other soil moisture indexes to calculate the SM [115].\
    \ Because ATI is simple\nand easy to operate, it is promising for broad applications.\n\
    3.1.2. The Model Based on the Amplitude and Phase Information of LST\nXue and\
    \ Cracknell [119] introduced land surface temperature phase information to simplify\
    \ the\nanalytical thermal inertia model, in which only the ground auxiliary data,\
    \ the time that the maximum\nLST occurs, is required and the real thermal inertia\
    \ can be obtained. This approach greatly simpliﬁes\nthe sophisticated calculation\
    \ process. Thus, many scholars have subsequently estimated SM using this\nmethod.\
    \ Cai et al. [120] used the full thermal inertia model of [119] and a second order\
    \ approximation\napproach to retrieve the thermal inertia surface that was applied\
    \ to north China to monitor the SM\nstatus and achieve good results.\nThe main\
    \ equation of the full model [121] is\nP = (1 − A)S0Ct\n∆T√ω\nA1[cos(ωt2 − δ1)\
    \ − cos(ωt1 − δ1)]\nq\n1 + 1\nb +\n1\n2b2\nδ1 = ωtmax − 2mπ, m = 0, 1, 2 . . .\n\
    (10)\nwhere A is the albedo, S0 is the solar constant. b is a synthesized term.\
    \ Ct is the atmospheric\ntransmittance in the visible spectrum (typically 0.75).\
    \ w is the Earth rotation velocity. δ is the phase\nangle. ∆T is the temperature\
    \ difference. If n = 1, P can reach a maximum value. In addition, t is the\ntime\
    \ at which the maximum LST occurs.\nThe model proposed by Xue and Cracknell requires\
    \ important auxiliary parameters from the\nground-based observations (the time\
    \ of the maximum LST occurs) but, in practical applications, the\nmaximum air\
    \ temperature observation time is used as an input value. Because the maximum\
    \ LST and\nair temperature occurred differently with time, the model induces uncertainties\
    \ by using the maximum\nair temperature. Because polar-orbiting satellites are\
    \ limited by the times that they pass over the same\narea and cannot obtain constant\
    \ observations, the method proposed by Sobrino includes a certain\ndegree of difﬁculty.\
    \ However, the emergence of geostationary satellites would support this method\n\
    and many observations can be obtained for the same study area in one day. In addition,\
    \ the use of\nobservation periods in the model has not been speciﬁcally validated.\n\
    Based on the model proposed by Xue and Cracknell, Sobrino et al. [122,123] developed\
    \ the\nFour Temperature Algorithm (FTA) to calculate soil thermal inertia by using\
    \ three surface temperatures\nat different times on the same day from all the\
    \ calibrated remote sensing results, including viewing\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n\
    9 of 29\ngeometry and atmospheric correction. The results were reasonable and\
    \ veriﬁed for the Iberian\nPeninsula and Morocco.\nThe key process of the FTA\
    \ model is:\nδ1 = arctan(ξ) + (2mπ + 1), m = 0, 1, 2 . . .\nξ =\n(Tj−Tk)[cos(ωti)−cos(ωtj)]−(Ti−Tj)[cos(ωtj)−cos(ωtk)]\n\
    (Ti−Tj)[sin(ωtj)−sin(ωtk)]−(Tj−Tk)[sin(ωti)−sin(ωtj)]\n(11)\nwhere the symbols\
    \ in the above equation is the same as the Equation (10). This method used three\n\
    different time phases to solve the equations, and the phase angle information\
    \ can be written as\na function of LST and satellite overpass time, which eliminates\
    \ the ground auxiliary data; thus,\nthe soil thermal inertia can only be obtained\
    \ from remotely sensed data. Because it is difﬁcult to\nobtain more than two high-quality\
    \ remotely sensed images in one day from remote sensing satellites\n(except geostationary\
    \ satellites) and because of night clouds and atmospheric effects, this method\
    \ has\nencountered many problems in practical applications and is difﬁcult to\
    \ use universally.\nRecently, people actively sought high-accurate methods for\
    \ solving thermal inertia. Wang [106]\nproposed using a simple thermal inertia\
    \ estimation method based on idealized soil temperature to\nobtain an analytical\
    \ solution for diffusion in the sinusoidal form. Thermal inertia can be expressed\
    \ as\na scale factor in a linear relationship between the soil heat ﬂux and surface\
    \ temperature amplitude;\nthus, the estimation accuracy was improved. The biggest\
    \ advantage of this method is that the available\ninput parameters can be easily\
    \ obtained from remotely sensed data. Moreover, fewer model input\nparameters\
    \ are needed and the precision is high.\nMaltese [124] analyzed the applicable\
    \ conditions of a thermal inertia model in sparsely vegetated\nareas and introduced\
    \ a correction factor for cloud effects to rectify downward shortwave radiation.\n\
    The applicability of the thermal inertia model was evaluated under changeable\
    \ weather conditions.\nMeanwhile, Robock et al. [125] studied the data quality\
    \ of a thermal inertia model combined\nwith a two-source model to separate skin\
    \ temperature for vegetation and bare soil and conducted\na sensitivity analysis\
    \ of the input parameters, such as solar radiation and meteorological data.\n\
    The thermal inertia was obtained by using thermal budget model.\n3.1.3. Analysis\
    \ Method Based on Energy Sources\nVerhoef [126] indicated that the direct energy\
    \ source of thermal inertia is soil heat ﬂux rather than\nnet radiation and developed\
    \ a surface temperature difference method between sunset and sunrise for\nsolving\
    \ thermal inertia. If the latent heat ﬂux and sensible heat ﬂux are both zero\
    \ and the net radiation\nremains constant on clear windless nights, the following\
    \ formula can be used:\n(Ch\np\nDh)r = 2\n\f\fRn\n\f\f √\n∆t\n∆Ts\n√π\n(12)\n\
    where\n\f\fRn\n\f\f is the average net radiation ﬂux between sunset and sunrise\
    \ (W·m−2), ∆t is the time\ninterval (s), and ∆Ts is the decrease in LST between\
    \ sunset and sunrise (◦C), Ch is the soil heat capacity\n(MJ·m−3·K−1), Dh is the\
    \ thermal diffusivity (m2·s−1).\nBy comparing different methods to estimate thermal\
    \ inertia and soil heat ﬂux, Murray and\nVerhoef [127–129] conﬁrmed that this\
    \ approach is relatively simple and reliable. However, because\nof the harsh applicable\
    \ conditions, this method has rarely been used. First, this method requires\n\
    a clear and windless night with constant net radiation. These weather conditions\
    \ are generally difﬁcult\nto satisfy. In addition, it is difﬁcult to guarantee\
    \ image quality at night, which results in incorrect\nestimation results.\nSensors\
    \ 2016, 16, 1308\n10 of 29\n3.1.4. Remote Sensing Methods Combined with Soil Physical\
    \ Parameters\nA relationship with soil moisture can be established based on the\
    \ deﬁnition of thermal inertia if\nsoil characteristics and remotely sensed data\
    \ are available for estimating thermal inertia. Lu et al. [130]\nproposed using\
    \ a simple model that considers the soil solid composition and other known pivotal\
    \ soil\ncharacteristics, such as soil composition and density.\nThe main equations\
    \ are calculated as follows:\nP = Pdry + (Psat − Pdry)Kp\n(13)\nKp = exp[γ(1 −\
    \ Sγ−δ\nr\n)]\n(14)\nwhere Pdry and Psat are the dry and wet soil thermal inertia,\
    \ respectively, and Kp is the Kersten correction\nfunction. γ and δ were soil\
    \ texture dependent model parameters and Sr was the degree of saturation.\nIn\
    \ addition, Verstraeten et al. [106] used the apparent thermal inertia and soil\
    \ moisture\nsaturation index (SMSI) combined with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)\
    \ data to estimate the\nSM. When verifying the analysis by using in-situ data\
    \ and the microwave moisture content, the results\nshowed that the values and\
    \ trends ﬁt well. M. Minacapilli [131,132] normalized the Kp function by\nusing\
    \ ATI with remotely sensed data to obtain the actual thermal inertia based on\
    \ the soil porosity.\nThermal inertia methods focus on soil thermal characteristics\
    \ and have clear physical meanings\nthat are relatively easy to understand. Different\
    \ methods are compared in Table 3. In practical\napplications, clear day and night\
    \ images are difﬁcult to obtain for the same area of interest because of\nclouds,\
    \ and the accuracy for night image is difﬁcult to conﬁrm. Simultaneously, the\
    \ assumption that\nthe soil properties at the horizontal and vertical scale are\
    \ consistent is not readily satisﬁed. Moreover, in\nareas with high vegetation\
    \ cover, vegetation conceals the soil information, which affects the estimation\n\
    accuracy. Thus, this method is only applicable to bare and sparsely vegetated\
    \ areas.\nTable 3. Comparisons of the common thermal inertia methods.\nMethods\n\

    \ temperature is an initial indicator that the vegetation is\nsubject to water\
    \ stress. Therefore, the LST can be used to monitor the SM.\nSensors 2016, 16,\
    \ 1308\n11 of 29\n3.2.1. Normalized Difference Temperature Index\nConsidering\
    \ the seasonal variations of the LST, Mcvicar et al. [133] developed the normalized\n\
    difference temperature index (NDTI) to reﬂect the SM conditions. The NDTI is calculated\
    \ as follows:\nNDTI = (LST∞ − LST)/(LST∞ − LST0)\n(15)\nwhere LST∞ and LST0 are\
    \ the simulated LSTs of the inﬁnite and zero surface impedance, respectively,\n\
    which are the upper (extremely dry state) and lower (extremely wet state) boundary\
    \ conditions for the\nLST at speciﬁc atmospheric forcing and surface impedance.\
    \ The surface energy balance principle and\naerodynamic impedance model can be\
    \ used to obtain the extreme LSTs.\nNDTI eliminates the effects of the seasonal\
    \ variations of LST. The SM is very similar to the\nNDTI [134]. Thus, the NDTI\
    \ can accurately reﬂect the spatial-temporal variations of SM. However, this\n\
    model requires solar radiation, wind speed and LAI as input values, which could\
    \ limit the operability\nof the model.\n3.2.2. Crop Water Stress Index\nSoil water\
    \ availability is a basic variable for the evapotranspiration process. In addition,\
    \ the SM\naffects the evapotranspiration rate. Evapotranspiration and energy are\
    \ closely related to the SM.\nWhen the energy is high and the SM is sufﬁcient,\
    \ strong evapotranspiration occurs and the canopy\ntemperature is lower. By contrast,\
    \ evapotranspiration is weak and the canopy temperature increases\nwhen the vegetation\
    \ is subjected to water stress. For a speciﬁc atmospheric condition, the ratio\
    \ of\nactual and potential evapotranspiration can be used as a proxy for crop\
    \ water stress. Based on the\nsurface energy balance model, Jackson et al. [135]\
    \ proposed using the crop water stress index (CWSI)\nto mirror the ratio between\
    \ vegetation transpiration and maximum potential evaporation. The CWSI\nis obtained\
    \ from the vegetation canopy temperature, ambient air temperature and net solar\
    \ radiation.\nThe CWSI formula is shown as follows:\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc −\
    \ Ta)min\n(Tc − Ta)max − (Tc − Ta)min\n(16)\nwhere Tc is the vegetation canopy\
    \ temperature, Ta is the air temperature, and (Tc–Ta)max and (Tc–Ta)min\nare the\
    \ difference between the canopy and air temperature without transpiration and\
    \ potential\nevaporation, respectively.\nThe CWSI uses thermal infrared temperatures\
    \ and meteorological data to indirectly reﬂect the SM\nunder crops. This method\
    \ has clear physical meaning based on the surface energy balance principle.\n\
    In addition, this method is highly precise in regions covered by vegetation and\
    \ the estimation accuracy\nis higher than that of the thermal inertia method [136].\
    \ However, the CWSI was established based on\nthe single canopy energy balance\
    \ model, which is less effective for early crop growth. In addition,\nthis approach\
    \ requires meteorological data and the calculation process is complex. Furthermore,\n\
    the extrapolation methods used for meteorological data, which are mainly obtained\
    \ from ground\nweather stations, have important impacts on the accuracies of the\
    \ CWSI determinations.\n4. SM Estimations from Visible and Thermal Infrared Remote\
    \ Sensing Data\n4.1. The Spatial Information-Based Method\nMany studies have demonstrated\
    \ that LST and VI (vegetation index/vegetation coverage) can\nprovide vegetation\
    \ water stress conditions and SM information [137–148]. If the number of pixels\
    \ in\nthe study area is sufﬁcient and the clouds and water bodies are removed,\
    \ the spatial distribution of\nLST and VI constitute triangular or trapezoidal\
    \ feature space. The SM can be obtained from the pixel\ndistribution in the LST-VI\
    \ feature space.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n12 of 29\nBecause the surface energy\
    \ maintains balance in the LST-VI feature space, lower latent heat ﬂux\nresults\
    \ in more available energy for the surface sensible heat ﬂux. For transpiration,\
    \ which is a crucial\nparameter, the stomatal resistance is inﬂuenced by the soil\
    \ moisture availability. In sparsely vegetated\nregions, the thermal soil inertia\
    \ affects the LST because it affects the transfer of heat into the soil and\n\
    the soil heat ﬂux [149,150]. These thermal characteristics are a function of soil\
    \ type and soil moisture\nvariations [151]. In addition, the surface available\
    \ energy (Rn-G) also inﬂuences the LST. The control\nof the surface temperature\
    \ by radiation means that low net shortwave radiation areas have lower\ntemperatures.\
    \ In addition, the surface albedo is affected by soil type, soil moisture and\
    \ vegetation cover.\nFurthermore, incident radiation affects transpiration and\
    \ stomatal resistance, and the net radiation can\nbe decomposed to sensible and\
    \ latent heat ﬂux. The transfer of energy as heat from the surface to the\natmosphere\
    \ is an important component for surface temperature and explains why the temperatures\n\
    in areas with high vegetation coverage roughness are lower than those in areas\
    \ with bare soil, which\ninﬂuences the shape of the LST-VI space.\nThe LST-VI\
    \ feature space is restricted by the dry and wet edges. The wet edge in the feature\n\
    space represents maximum evapotranspiration and adequate soil moisture and the\
    \ dry edge indicates\nthat the vegetation is subjected to water stress in which\
    \ evapotranspiration reaches the minimum and\nthe SM is 0 (no water can be used).\
    \ For different vegetation types, the dry edge includes the driest\npoints and\
    \ the vegetation evapotranspiration varies depending on the amount of vegetation\
    \ coverage.\nFor certain types, the available energy (Rn-G) is considered nearly\
    \ equal. Because cooling affects\nevaporation, the surface temperature is maximized\
    \ at the dry edge and minimized at the wet edge.\nDifferent views of the surface\
    \ temperature in the fully vegetated area resulted in the development of\nthe\
    \ triangular and trapezoidal methods. The triangular method assumes that the surface\
    \ temperatures\nof fully vegetated areas are equal to the wettest surface temperature.\
    \ However, the trapezoidal method\nassumes that the surface temperatures of fully\
    \ vegetated surfaces are much higher than those of the\nwettest surface.\n4.1.1.\
    \ The Triangle Method\nWith the feature space constructed by LST and VI, Price\
    \ [152] ﬁrst proposed the concept of\ntriangular space. The triangle method is\
    \ proposed based on surface temperatures and VI scatter plots\nobtained using\
    \ satellites (Figure 2). Combined with the simulation results of the land surface\
    \ model,\nthe simulated feature space is stretched to the satellite by analyzing\
    \ the position of the image element\nin space to infer the SM.\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308 \n12 of 29 \n \ncrucial parameter, the stomatal resistance is influenced\
    \ by the soil moisture availability. In sparsely \nvegetated regions, the thermal\
    \ soil inertia affects the LST because it affects the transfer of heat into \n\
    the soil and the soil heat flux [149,150]. These thermal characteristics are a\
    \ function of soil type and \nsoil moisture variations [151]. In addition, the\
    \ surface available energy (Rn-G) also influences the \nLST. The control of the\
    \ surface temperature by radiation means that low net shortwave radiation \nareas\
    \ have lower temperatures. In addition, the surface albedo is affected by soil\
    \ type, soil moisture \nand vegetation cover. Furthermore, incident radiation\
    \ affects transpiration and stomatal resistance, \nand the net radiation can be\
    \ decomposed to sensible and latent heat flux. The transfer of energy as \nheat\
    \ from the surface to the atmosphere is an important component for surface temperature\
    \ and \nexplains why the temperatures in areas with high vegetation coverage roughness\
    \ are lower than \nthose in areas with bare soil, which influences the shape of\
    \ the LST-VI space. \nThe LST-VI feature space is restricted by the dry and wet\
    \ edges. The wet edge in the feature \nspace represents maximum evapotranspiration\
    \ and adequate soil moisture and the dry edge \nindicates that the vegetation\
    \ is subjected to water stress in which evapotranspiration reaches the \nminimum\
    \ and the SM is 0 (no water can be used). For different vegetation types, the\
    \ dry edge \nincludes the driest points and the vegetation evapotranspiration\
    \ varies depending on the amount of \nvegetation coverage. For certain types,\
    \ the available energy (Rn-G) is considered nearly equal. \nBecause cooling affects\
    \ evaporation, the surface temperature is maximized at the dry edge and \nminimized\
    \ at the wet edge. Different views of the surface temperature in the fully vegetated\
    \ area \nresulted in the development of the triangular and trapezoidal methods.\
    \ The triangular method \nassumes that the surface temperatures of fully vegetated\
    \ areas are equal to the wettest surface \ntemperature. However, the trapezoidal\
    \ method assumes that the surface temperatures of fully \nvegetated surfaces are\
    \ much higher than those of the wettest surface.  \n4.1.1. The Triangle Method\
    \ \nWith the feature space constructed by LST and VI, Price [152] first proposed\
    \ the concept of \ntriangular space. The triangle method is proposed based on\
    \ surface temperatures and VI scatter \nplots obtained using satellites (Figure\
    \ 2). Combined with the simulation results of the land surface \nmodel, the simulated\
    \ feature space is stretched to the satellite by analyzing the position of the\

    \ much lower for high spatial\nresolution images because it is more difﬁcult to\
    \ reﬂect heterogeneity within the pixels.\nThe main assumptions of the triangle\
    \ method are that (1) the complete underlying vegetation\ncover from the bare\
    \ soil to full vegetation is know; (2) the variations in the space are not primarily\n\
    caused by differences in atmospheric conditions but are caused by variations in\
    \ the available SM;\nand (3) the sensitivity of LST to the canopy and soil is\
    \ different. Due to the special characteristic of\ntriangular space, the major\
    \ advantages of this method include the following: (1) it can estimate the\nSM\
    \ from entirely remotely sensed data without any ground auxiliary data; and (2)\
    \ it is simple and\neasy to operate and can monitor drought conditions over large\
    \ regions. Meanwhile, the limitations\ninclude the following: (1) the LST-VI space\

    \ pixels is large enough to span a wide range of soil wetness and vegetation cover\

    4.1.2. The Trapezoid Method\nUsing experiments, Jackson [155] explored the relationships\
    \ between drought and differences in\nvegetation leaf and air temperature by using\
    \ measured data and proposed a drought index—CWSI.\nTo calculate the pixel values\
    \ of intermediate vegetation cover and SM for a speciﬁc time, four vertices of\n\
    the trapezoid are required that correspond to (1) well-watered, full-cover vegetation;\
    \ (2) water-stressed,\nfull-cover vegetation; (3) saturated bare soil; and (4)\
    \ dry bare soil. These values should be computed\nﬁrst by using the CWSI theory\
    \ and Penman-Monteith equation. This index can only be used for fully\nvegetated\
    \ areas and is not applicable in sparsely vegetated areas.\nBased on the theory\
    \ of the CWSI, Moran [31] developed the water deﬁcit index (WDI) (Figure 3) to\n\
    overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. This index can be used in all areas\
    \ covered by vegetation\nand in areas with sparse vegetation. Relying on the surface\
    \ energy balance principle, the soil adjusted\nvegetation index (SAVI) and the\
    \ temperature difference form a trapezoidal space, and the index can\nbe directly\
    \ calculated from remotely sensed data without requirements for measuring leaf\
    \ and air\ntemperature. After the model test and in situ data validation, the\
    \ WDI was evaluated to overestimate\nthe water deﬁcit situations in many sparsely\
    \ vegetated regions.\nCompared with the triangular space, the trapezoidal space\
    \ does not require a large number of\npixels. The advantages of the trapezoidal\
    \ method are that (1) it has a robust physical basis and that\n(2) the space determined\
    \ from the four vertices is the main limiting condition that is close to the true\n\
    conditions of the land surface. In contrast, the disadvantages include that this\
    \ method (1) requires\nmore ground-based parameters to calculate the soil moisture\
    \ index and that (2) the inﬂuences of water\nstress on vegetation cover have a\
    \ time lag that induces uncertainties for SM estimations.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\

    \ method relies on the temporal changes of NSSR and LST to \nestablish a relationship\
    \ with the SM. The elliptical model parameters were used to determine the \nSM.\
    \ Accurate estimation results were achieved for specific atmospheric conditions.\
    \ The main \nadvantages of this method include the following: (1) the proposed\
    \ model is independent on the soil \ntypes; (2) the quantitative SM is determined\
    \ by using the method rather than from the empirical \nrelationship between SM\
    \ and the remotely sensed parameters; and (3) the diurnal changes of the \nland\
    \ surface parameters are used rather than the instantaneous parameters that have\
    \ many \nuncertainties at some moments. However, the limitations of the proposed\
    \ model are discussed \nbelow. (1) The model is suitable for bare soils on cloudless\
    \ days and the accuracy is greatly reduced \nin the vegetated areas. This reduction\
    \ in accuracy occurs because the elliptical shape constructed by \nthe NSSR and\
    \ LST appears under bare soil conditions. When the surface is covered by vegetation,\
    \ \nthe surface energy distribution is more complex than that of the bare soil\
    \ and the elliptical shape is \naffected by the vegetation interference; (2) the\
    \ coefficients of the proposed model change with \natmospheric conditions. Thus,\
    \ it is difficult to fix to the coefficients to establish a universal equation\
    \ \nfor estimating SM. Additionally, how to acquire these model parameters at\
    \ the regional scale must \nbe addressed before applying the proposed SM model\
    \ to remotely sensed data [156]. Therefore, \nthese two problems are important\
    \ issues that concern the application of the model with remotely \nsensed observations\
    \ and are promising as a foundation for future work. Moreover, investigating the\
    \ \nrelationships between the model parameters and atmospheric conditions is probably\
    \ a promising \navenue for making the SM retrieval model universal.  \n5. Current\
    \ Problems and Discussions \nDespite significant progress made since the 1960s\
    \ in SM retrieval methods, from empirical \nsimplified equations to more complex\
    \ physically based models using remote sensing technology, \nand to estimate regional\
    \ SM and resulting in many SM missions (as shown in Table 4), many \nproblems\
    \ have still not been solved. These problems are mainly associated with the input\
    \ \nparameters of SM models, the estimation accuracy and the physical interpretation\
    \ of different \nsurface variables from satellite data at the temporal and spatial\
    \ data/model scales, and the validation \nof SM obtained from remotely sensed\
    \ data at the regional/global scale. These issues will be discussed \nbriefly\
    \ below. \n \n \nFigure 5. The ellipse change with the different soil moisture\
    \ content.\nThe temporal information-based method relies on the temporal changes\
    \ of NSSR and LST to\nestablish a relationship with the SM. The elliptical model\
    \ parameters were used to determine the SM.\nAccurate estimation results were\
    \ achieved for speciﬁc atmospheric conditions. The main advantages\nof this method\
    \ include the following: (1) the proposed model is independent on the soil types;\
    \ (2) the\nquantitative SM is determined by using the method rather than from\
    \ the empirical relationship between\nSM and the remotely sensed parameters; and\
    \ (3) the diurnal changes of the land surface parameters\nare used rather than\
    \ the instantaneous parameters that have many uncertainties at some moments.\n\
    However, the limitations of the proposed model are discussed below. (1) The model\
    \ is suitable for bare\nsoils on cloudless days and the accuracy is greatly reduced\
    \ in the vegetated areas. This reduction in\naccuracy occurs because the elliptical\
    \ shape constructed by the NSSR and LST appears under bare\nsoil conditions. When\
    \ the surface is covered by vegetation, the surface energy distribution is more\n\
    complex than that of the bare soil and the elliptical shape is affected by the\
    \ vegetation interference;\n(2) the coefﬁcients of the proposed model change with\
    \ atmospheric conditions. Thus, it is difﬁcult to\nﬁx to the coefﬁcients to establish\
    \ a universal equation for estimating SM. Additionally, how to acquire\nthese\
    \ model parameters at the regional scale must be addressed before applying the\
    \ proposed SM\nmodel to remotely sensed data [156]. Therefore, these two problems\
    \ are important issues that concern\nthe application of the model with remotely\
    \ sensed observations and are promising as a foundation for\nfuture work. Moreover,\
    \ investigating the relationships between the model parameters and atmospheric\n\
    conditions is probably a promising avenue for making the SM retrieval model universal.\n\
    5. Current Problems and Discussions\nDespite signiﬁcant progress made since the\
    \ 1960s in SM retrieval methods, from empirical\nsimpliﬁed equations to more complex\
    \ physically based models using remote sensing technology, and\nto estimate regional\
    \ SM and resulting in many SM missions (as shown in Table 4), many problems\n\
    have still not been solved. These problems are mainly associated with the input\
    \ parameters of SM\nmodels, the estimation accuracy and the physical interpretation\
    \ of different surface variables from\nsatellite data at the temporal and spatial\
    \ data/model scales, and the validation of SM obtained from\nremotely sensed data\
    \ at the regional/global scale. These issues will be discussed brieﬂy below.\n\

    \ Used in Soil Moisture Estimation Models\nThe accuracy of the estimated SM is\
    \ inﬂuenced by the input variables that must be accurately\nobtained from in situ\
    \ measurements or remote sensing. Inaccurate input parameters can induce many\n\
    uncertainties in soil moisture estimations. For example, one advantage of the\
    \ model proposed by Xue\nand Cracknell [182] is to apply the variations in the\
    \ surface temperature phase to estimate thermal\ninertia. However, in the derivation\
    \ process, the equation requires a priori knowledge of the time\nat which the\
    \ maximum LST occurs. In practical applications, authors always use the maximum\
    \ air\ntemperature observed at ground meteorological stations instead, since the\
    \ maximum air temperature\nis easy to obtain. In addition, according to previous\
    \ studies, the maximum LST is lower than the\nmaximum air temperature by up to\
    \ 4–5 ◦C [155]. Thus, accurate maximum air temperature estimation\nusing the remotely\
    \ sensed data provides an effective means to obtain precise real thermal inertia.\n\
    In addition, based on the model proposed by Xue, Sobrino et al. developed a new\
    \ remotely sensed\nmodel, the FTA model, to estimate thermal inertia by using\
    \ the phase differences between the different\noverpass times of the NOAA satellite.\
    \ Current problems include: (1) the polar-orbiting satellite data\ncannot satisfy\
    \ the requirements of high quality images; and (2) the observed surface times\
    \ are 2:30,\n7:30, 14:30 and 19:30, respectively, and the surface difference is\
    \ obtained at 2:30 and 14:30. The phase\ndifferences are determined at 7:30, 14:30\
    \ and 19:30. In addition, with the development of the satellites,\nthe geostationary\
    \ meteorological satellite can provide many data in one day, which can compensate\
    \ for\nthe limitations of polar-orbiting satellites. Moreover, large errors can\
    \ be induced by the LSTs twice each\nday to simulate the daily LST variations,\
    \ and more data are required to simulate the diurnal variations\nin surface temperature\
    \ [183].\nThe accuracy of the input parameters partially determined the robustness\
    \ of the SM estimation\nmodels. In practical applications, many studies have ignored\
    \ the limitations of these models or have\nselected approximate parameters. Consequently,\
    \ although the soil moisture estimation can satisfy\na certain degree of accuracy,\
    \ they are usually not used correctly. Soil moisture estimation models\nare obtained\
    \ using many preconditions and assumptions. Therefore, model selection based on\
    \ the\nunderlying conditions and the required input parameters is very important.\
    \ It is worth noting that\nthe mismatch in scale between the point-based observations\
    \ and the remotely sensed data remains\na problem to be solved.\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n17 of 29\n5.2. Soil Moisture under Vegetation\nThe sensors receive\
    \ the composite signal from the surface, which includes the soil and vegetation.\n\
    In the vegetated regions, removing the vegetation effect to estimate SM becomes\
    \ a problem. Currently,\none-source models consider the soil and vegetation as\
    \ a composite leaf that is called the big leaf\nmodel. These models cannot separate\
    \ the soil from the mixed remotely sensed pixels. Thus, the\nSM in the vegetated\
    \ area is manifested by the vegetation index or temperature vegetation dryness\n\
    index. However, the quantitative SM is not easy to be obtained under vegetation\
    \ cover. To solve the\nabove-mentioned problems, two-source models (such as ALEXI,\
    \ N95 et al.) were used to separate\nthe soil and vegetation information and describe\
    \ the energy exchange among the soil, vegetation and\natmosphere. The SM may be\
    \ accurately estimated if pure soil information can be separated from the\ncomposite\
    \ context.\nAdditionally, because many soil physical parameters cannot be obtained\
    \ by using remotely\nsensed data, this method only can use empirical equations\
    \ or in situ measurements to determine these\nvariables. Soil texture information\
    \ exhibits considerable heterogeneity and is difﬁcult to obtain for large\nregions.\
    \ In addition, it is difﬁcult to establish a universal relationship for SM across\
    \ different study\nareas. To simplify the physical formula and facilitate calculation,\
    \ the soil physical variables can be\nparameterized to establish a correlation\
    \ with the obtained variables from remote sensing. This method\nmay be ultimately\
    \ a robust method that not only considers the soil physical properties but also\
    \ can be\nrealized using remote sensing techniques.\n5.3. Uncertain Quantitative\
    \ Relationships between the Remotely Sensed Indices/Thermal Inertia and SM\nNo\
    \ determinate quantitative relationships between the thermal inertia/drought indices\
    \ and SM\nare widely accepted by all the experts. However, many authors have considered\
    \ this linear relationship\nas a simple method for determining SM. Several authors\
    \ have indicated that these variables are not\nlinearly related in empirical statistical\
    \ experiments. Currently, the commonly applied equations are\nlinear or exponential.\
    \ However, although the SM estimation methods have matured and the thermal\ninertia/drought\
    \ indices can be determined relatively accurately, determining the SM from thermal\n\
    inertia/drought indices remains uncertain. Thus, a universal and quantitative\
    \ relationship between\nthe SM and thermal inertia/drought indices must be accurately\
    \ determined.\n5.4. Lack of Surface Data for Validating Remotely Sensed SM\nRemotely\
    \ sensed soil moisture validation is a problem in SM estimation research. The\
    \ most\ncommonly used methods are validated by single point-based or multiple\
    \ point-based measurements.\nIn addition, many researchers have attempted to use\
    \ up-scaling or down-scaling methods to validate\nSM estimates from remote sensing\
    \ data [184]. Remotely sensed data have wide spatial coverage of the\nunderlying\
    \ surface, such as 30 m, 1 km, or even several kilometers. In addition, the retrieved\
    \ SM is\nthe pixel value of the satellite data that indicates the situation of\
    \ the entire region. However, surface\nmeasurements are always conducted at single\
    \ points and cannot represent the entire region due to the\nspatial and temporal\
    \ changes of the SM [185]. Remotely sensed SMs are frequently validated by many\n\
    measured point values in study areas, which results in many uncertainties. Moreover,\
    \ the developed\nSM indices serve as proxies that indicate drought conditions\
    \ and are not true SM contents. To obtain\nthe actual SM, the wilting and saturation\
    \ points of the soil in the study area must be known, which can\nresult in errors.\
    \ Therefore, a surface-to-surface validation method should be developed to solve\
    \ this\nproblem. Aerial photography or UAV may provide the actual state of the\
    \ ground surface, which could\nbe used to verify the derived SM.\n5.5. Uncertainties\
    \ in the Application of Soil Moisture Estimation Models\nAs described above, each\
    \ soil moisture estimation model is developed with preconditions and\nassumptions.\
    \ Many uncertainties are introduced by key processes when applying soil moisture\n\
    Sensors 2016, 16, 1308\n18 of 29\nestimation models. For example, the spatial-information\
    \ based method includes two important\nprocesses, determining the limiting edge\
    \ and interpolation between the dry and wet edges.\nFirst, determining the dry\
    \ and wet edges is important for estimating soil moisture from the LST-VI\nspace,\
    \ which directly affects the retrieval accuracy. In practice, most studies use\
    \ the least squares\nmethod to directly ﬁt scattering at the dry and wet edge.\
    \ However, due to underlying heterogeneity and\ndifferent atmospheric forcing,\
    \ the extracted wet and dry edges are unstable and introduce uncertainties,\n\
    which eventually lead to SM estimation errors. Currently, two main methods are\
    \ used to derive the\ndry and wet edges from scattering in the feature space,\
    \ the auto-determined edge algorithm and the\ntheoretical edge determination method.\
    \ The main advantages of the auto-determined edge method\nare that it is simple\
    \ to operate, highly accurate, and has wide application. However, one limitation\
    \ is\nthat the auto-determined edges are changeable with the size of the study\
    \ area and that the extreme dry\nand wet points must all be present in the LST-VI\
    \ space. Sometimes, true dry or wet edges do not exist\nbecause energy and water\
    \ balance must be met under extreme conditions. Thus, many experts have\ntried\
    \ to derive theoretical edges based on the surface energy balance principle as\
    \ a boundary condition.\nThe auto-determined edge method can be used to estimate\
    \ soil moisture from remote sensing data\nbut results in large errors due to its\
    \ subjectivity and the effects of atmospheric conditions. The surface\nenergy\
    \ balance method for solving theoretical edges has a robust physical basis because\
    \ the requirement\nfor more underlying surface auxiliary data results in a complicated\
    \ calculation process. It is difﬁcult\nto obtain pure remote sensing data, and\
    \ many parameters introduce uncertainty. Therefore, a simple\nand applicable method\
    \ for remote sensing to obtain theoretical dry and wet edges is a promising\n\
    approach. The two-source models can provide wizards for solving this problem that\
    \ can separate\nthe soil and vegetation surface temperatures. This method can\
    \ be used to obtain a true dry point for\nbare soil and full vegetation before\
    \ deriving theoretically limiting edges by using an energy balance\nmodel. Second,\
    \ many authors have found that LST and SM are negatively correlated in the LST-VI\n\
    space; thus, numerous studies have been based on the assumption that surface temperature\
    \ and soil\nmoisture vary linearly with changes in vegetation cover [141]. However,\
    \ Carlson et al. [186] observed\nthat this change is not linear according to the\
    \ SVAT model simulation. In practical applications, most\nscholars still assume\
    \ that the soil moisture varies linearly in the scatter space. The interpolation\
    \ of the\nfeature space represents the relationships among SM, LST and FVC. The\
    \ linear interpolation is simple\nand easy to operate but cannot truly reﬂect\
    \ the SM variations in the feature space [187]. Although the\nnon-linear interpolation\
    \ is complex and difﬁcult to operate, it is highly accurate [188]. Thus, how can\n\
    we develop a method to interpolate the space based on a physical mechanism and\
    \ the SM? Thermal\ninertia is a physical property of the substance itself. Thus,\
    \ if thermal inertia is too complicated to use,\nthe ATI could be used to replace\
    \ it. The ATI may be helpful for interpolating the feature space in\nfuture research.\n\
    In summary, comprehensive analyses of the aforementioned SM estimation methods\
    \ based on\noptical and thermal remote sensing were performed. Although remote\
    \ multi-monitoring and inversion\nmethods involve different types of ﬁelds and\
    \ relatively broad scopes, they have many shortcomings.\nIn general, despite their\
    \ susceptibility to clouds, vegetation effects and limited penetration, optical\
    \ and\nthermal remote sensing data have high spatial resolutions with multi-satellite\
    \ sensors and large spatial\ncoverage. Moreover, soil moisture and surface temperatures\
    \ are strongly correlated. Thus, soil moisture\nestimations are more promising.\
    \ Although some models are relatively simple and have clear physical\nmeaning,\
    \ some methods, such as thermal inertia and apparent thermal inertia methods,\
    \ are mainly\nsuitable for bare soils or for early crop growth conditions. In\
    \ addition, due to the impacts of soil texture\nand type, the relationships between\
    \ thermal inertia and soil moisture are often nonlinear. However,\nthe method\
    \ is derived under certain assumptions, and the effects of these assumptions on\
    \ the retrieval\nresults must be further validated. The triangle/trapezoid method\
    \ mainly uses the spatial distribution\nof pixel information when the requirements\
    \ of study area are large enough and contain a variety of\nground conditions,\
    \ including different vegetation coverage and soil moisture. In some cases, this\n\
    condition is not easily satisﬁed. The temporal information-based methods require\
    \ observation data for\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n19 of 29\nlong time series from\
    \ remote sensing on cloudy days. Additionally, the simulated model accuracy and\n\
    subjective cognitive and empirical descriptions for the study area affect the\
    \ inversion results. Due to\nexisting problems, some recommendations or solutions\
    \ may provide references for SM estimations,\nas described below.\n6. Conclusions\
    \ and Perspective\nWith the problems pointed out above, this paper proposes our\
    \ recommendation and potential\nsolution in SM estimations.\n6.1. Combining Optical\
    \ and Microwave Remote Sensing to Estimate SM\nVisible and thermal infrared remote\
    \ sensing has ﬁne spatial resolutions and broad coverage.\nThe primary differences\
    \ between these methods are the use of the electromagnetic spectrum and\nthe source\
    \ of the electromagnetic energy [84]. Visible infrared remote sensing uses characteristic\n\
    changes in the soil reﬂectance or vegetation physiology to estimate SM. By contrast,\
    \ thermal infrared\nremote sensing uses the responses of soil thermal properties\
    \ to soil moisture to determine SM.\nUsing integration, the SM may be estimated\
    \ from soil thermal properties (soil temperature, thermal\ninertia, etc.) and\
    \ soil spectrum differences (absorption amplitude, spectrum combination, etc.).\n\
    In addition, microwave remote sensing is less disturbed by the bad weather or\
    \ rain. However,\nit can be easily perturbed by vegetation, and optical and thermal\
    \ remote sensing can be helpful for\nremoving vegetation disturbances. Therefore,\
    \ the combination of optical and thermal and microwave\nremote sensing may have\
    \ broad application prospects. Additionally, microwave remote sensing can\nobtain\
    \ data all-time and all-weather, which can provide great help for soil moisture\
    \ products over long\ntime series, especially in humid tropical regions.\nMoreover,\
    \ the combination of the thermal inertia method and the LST-NDVI space method\
    \ may\nprovide a robust method for estimating the SM. Thermal inertia is a soil\
    \ physical property with\nsoil moisture, and the LST-NDVI method can restrict\
    \ changes in soil moisture in a speciﬁc space.\nThis combination has a strong\
    \ physical basis, is easy to operate, and may be promising.\n6.2. The Development\
    \ of Comparable Soil Moisture Indices\nCurrently, many drought indices are based\
    \ on instantaneous remotely sensed data that cannot be\ncompared with other data\
    \ because of the inﬂuences of different atmospheric conditions. For visible\n\
    infrared remote sensing, long time-series remote sensing data are difﬁcult to\
    \ obtain and the reference\nstandards are not properly determined. For thermal\
    \ infrared remote sensing, the derived indices\ncan represent the drought conditions\
    \ of the study area for a speciﬁc time but cannot be compared\nwith each other\
    \ day by day. The driest and wettest points may not exist in the study area. Thus,\n\
    determining the dry and wet edge is somewhat subjective and results in errors\
    \ in the soil moisture\nestimations. For this problem, the normalization method\
    \ can be used to normalize the indices to\na uniform reference or statistical\
    \ data can be used to standardize the indices. Only the drought indices\nfrom\
    \ a uniform reference can be physically compared with each other and accurately\
    \ reﬂect the true\nsoil moisture conditions.\n6.3. The Measured Surface Data for\
    \ True Validation\nTrue validation is the process of assessing the uncertainty\
    \ of the data products derived\nindependently from the system outputs for the\
    \ same scale, time and location. Without validation,\nany methods, models, algorithms,\
    \ and parameters derived from remotely sensed data cannot be\nused with conﬁdence\
    \ [189,190]. True validation must be conducted because validation can help\nunderstand\
    \ the uncertainties of the remotely sensed data, the errors in soil moisture inversion\
    \ models\nand uncertainty in the retrieved land surface variables.\nCurrently,\
    \ the estimated soil moisture is mostly validated by point-based measurements.\n\
    The surface SWC data derived from remote sensing are only validated by one or\
    \ several points’\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n20 of 29\ndata measured using techniques.\
    \ The scale differences can induce large errors in soil moisture retrieval\noutputs\
    \ and methods. So, a surface to surface or pixel to pixel validation method should\
    \ be developed\nto deal with this problem.\n6.4. Improvements to the Soil Moisture\
    \ Estimation Theory\nThe physical principles of many SM estimation methods include\
    \ energy balance equations that\nserve as boundary conditions. According to previous\
    \ studies, the energy balance is not always closed.\nThus, it is relatively easy\
    \ to induce uncertainties. Moreover, the SM is an important link in the water\n\
    cycle and the water balance for a speciﬁc region should be considered. In addition,\
    \ the laws and\ntheories regarding soil hydrothermal characteristic can be combined\
    \ with remotely sensed parameters\nto reveal the interaction mechanisms of soil\
    \ moisture. To accurately estimate the SM, the energy and\nwater balance should\
    \ be considered as well as the soil hydrothermal properties.\nTherefore, several\
    \ limitations exist in the current use of optical and thermal remote sensing SM\n\
    estimation methods. These methods are based on polar-orbiting earth observation\
    \ satellite advances,\nand polar-orbiting satellites usually obtain three or four\
    \ ground observations each day. Lacking data\nsources limits the development of\
    \ soil moisture retrieval methods. Fortunately, the geostationary\nmeteorological\
    \ satellites can achieve high frequency and continuous ground observations and\
    \ high\ntemporal resolution data that polar-orbiting satellites cannot do. Geostationary\
    \ meteorological satellites\ncan provide favorable conditions and opportunities\
    \ for estimating surface soil moisture [191–203].\nAcknowledgments: This paper\

    \ by 2050 than it is today, with the world population rising to more than 9\n\
    billion, 34% higher than it is now. The farmers have been forced to produce more\
    \ with the same resources. This pressure means that\noptimizing productivity is\
    \ one of the main objectives of the producers but also in a sustainable way. Not\
    \ only does agriculture face a\ndecline in production, but it has also had to\
    \ face limitations in data collection, storing, securing, and sharing, climate\
    \ change,\nincreases in input prices, traditional food supply chain systems where\
    \ there is no direct connection between the farmer and the\nbuyer, and limitations\
    \ on energy use. Existing IoT-based agriculture systems have a centralized format\
    \ and operate in isolation,\nleaving room for unresolved issues and major concerns,\
    \ including data security, manipulation, and single failure points. This\npaper\
    \ proposes a futuristic IoT with a blockchain model to meet these challenges.\
    \ Further, this paper also proposes and novel\nenergy-eﬃcient clustering IoT-based\
    \ agriculture protocol for lower energy consumption and network stability and\
    \ compares its\nresults with its counterpart low-energy adoptive clustering hierarchy\
    \ (LEACH) protocol. The simulation results show that the\nproposed protocol network\
    \ stability is 23% higher as compared to LEACH as ﬁrst node of LEACH dies at 168\
    \ rounds while\nIoT-based agriculture ﬁrst node dies after 463 rounds. Similarly,\
    \ IoT-based agriculture protocol energy consumption is 68%\nlower than that of\
    \ LEACH. The proposed protocol also extends the network life to more rounds and\
    \ demonstrates an increase\nof 112%.\n1. Introduction\nThe United Nations Population\
    \ Division expects the world\npopulation, currently 7.8 billion (2020), to reach\
    \ 10.9 billion\nafter the end of the 21st century [1]. Due to rapid population\n\
    growth, there is a high pressure on agriculture to increase\nfood production sustainably.\
    \ Food distribution and con-\nsumption simultaneously promote human well-being\
    \ and\npreserves scarce natural resources. As a result, policymakers,\ndevelopment\
    \ agencies, civil society organizations, and pri-\nvate enterprises have shown\
    \ interest in investigating the role\nof the food and farm markets in supporting\
    \ sustainable\ndevelopment for people and the world [2]. Agriculture is\nexperiencing\
    \ drastic changes and is facing numerous envi-\nronmental and social problems.\
    \ Many farmers are still\ndepending on traditional farming practices and having\
    \ no\ndirect access to the market, and it has proven diﬃcult to bal-\nance the\
    \ demands on limited natural resources such as land\nHindawi\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nVolume 2021, Article ID 5580179, 14 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5580179\n\
    and water. Both changes in diets and consumer preferences\nand the fact of climate\
    \ change contribute to the complexity\nof providing high-quality food to the end-user.\
    \ Sustainable\nfood and agricultural production cannot be accomplished\nby the\
    \ conventional agriculture systems that have led to sub-\nstantial deforestation,\
    \ water scarcity, or soil erosion. Thus,\nadvanced systems must be used which\
    \ conserve and rein-\nforce the basis of natural resources and increase production.\n\
    A phase of transition to “holistic” methods is like smart agri-\nculture [3].\
    \ Smart agriculture is an approach that guides\nagricultural ﬁeld supervision\
    \ in the era of climate change.\nThe idea of smart agriculture was ﬁrst introduced\
    \ in 2009\nand revived through the involvement and input of many\nstakeholders\
    \ involved in design and implementation. In\nresponse to the debate on agricultural\
    \ policy on climate\nchange and sustainable development work, the main features\n\
    of the smart agriculture approach have been developed. [4].\nSmart agriculture\
    \ aims to provide universally applicable sys-\ntems for climate change management\
    \ and agricultural food\nsecurity. Smart agriculture uses advanced technologies\
    \ such\nas the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and cloud comput-\ning to monitor\
    \ the ﬁeld environment, analyze crop growth,\nand provide information to the farmer\
    \ for decision-\nmaking. An information-based management cycle for smart\nagriculture\
    \ is presented in Figure 1. [5].\n1.1. Internet of Things (IoT). The Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) is a\ncutting-edge computing and networking technology that\n\
    reﬂects the future. Smart computing will be focused on the\nInternet of Things\
    \ in the future. IoT is now playing a signif-\nicant role in the transformation\
    \ of existing technologies from\nthe home to the workplace [6]. IoT technology\
    \ is used to link\ncomputers or nodes to networks for the sharing of informa-\n\
    tion and communication [7]. The Internet of Things (IoT)\nhas the potential to\
    \ link billions of devices (smart objects).\nThese smart objects can gather data\
    \ and interact with other\nsystems over the internet. IoT has evolved into a next\
    \ gener-\nation technology with several agricultural applications [8].\n1.2. Internet\
    \ of Things in Smart Agriculture. In the ﬁeld of\nsmart agriculture IoT provides\
    \ a wide range of applications\nsuch as soil and plant tracking, crop growth observation,\n\
    and selection, assistance for irrigation assessment, and mon-\nitoring of the\
    \ agriculture environment. In smart agriculture\nInternet of Things (IoT) technology\
    \ is applied in diagnostics\nand control. To optimize agriculture, the implementation\
    \ of\nIoT in the ﬁeld has increased the productivity and eﬀective-\nness of farmers.\
    \ It may help to determine ﬁeld variables such\nas soil quality and plant biomass.\
    \ It can also be used to test\nand monitor variables including temperature, soil\
    \ moisture,\nand crop diseases. Besides, IoT can be used to track crop\ngrowth\
    \ and yield inﬂuencing factors. Farmers can also ﬁgure\nout which crops are most\
    \ suited for which conditions and can\nrotate crop accordingly [9]. IoT applications\
    \ support farmers\nduring crop planting, irrigation, crop processing, harvesting\n\
    and postharvest, crop storage and transportation, and many\nother beneﬁts in agricultural\
    \ IoT systems. Soil moisture sen-\nsors, humidity sensors, leaf moisture sensors,\
    \ solar radiation\nsensors, infrared light sensors, and rainfall predictors are\n\
    among the ﬁeld sensors used in IoT-based systems. In IoT\nscenarios, sensors can\
    \ be installed in a variety of locations,\nincluding greenhouses, seed banks,\
    \ cold rooms, agricultural\nmachinery, transportation systems, and livestock,\
    \ and the\ndata collected can be processed in the cloud for monitoring\nand control\
    \ [10].\n1.3. Food Supply Chain Management. Food supply chain\nmanagement is a\
    \ process that explains how food from an\nagricultural ﬁeld ends up on our tables.\
    \ Supply chain man-\nagement deals with production, reﬁning, delivery, selling\n\
    consumption, and disposal [11]. The process of the supply\nchain is summarized\
    \ in Figure 2. In developing countries,\nthe food supply chain faces several challenges,\
    \ such as the\nneed for conﬁdence among stakeholders which often corre-\nlated\
    \ with their credibility and traceability required by the\nend-users, and the\
    \ diﬃculty of managing risks, delays, or\ndisruptions is often occurred due to\
    \ insuﬃcient or lacking\ninformation [12]. Blockchain technology is one of the\
    \ best\nways to meet these challenges [13].\n1.4. Blockchain Technology. Blockchain\
    \ is a distributed data-\nbase where data can be recorded and shared via a decentra-\n\
    lized computing network while also providing security and\nprivacy. And if the\
    \ data is spread, only the owner who has\nthe private key can make transactions.\
    \ The other machines\nor computers on the network serve as validators. It safely\n\
    records transactions between nodes in a public ledger with-\nout the need for\
    \ a trusted third party [14]. In a centralized\ncloud approach where an asset\
    \ or object is owned, it is either\nheld under the control of the owner or through\
    \ a trusted\nintermediary or a centralized authority such as a bank. A cen-\n\
    tralized computing system always has a single server for sev-\neral clients, the\
    \ server has higher resources than its client\nsystems, and all processes are\
    \ made through a single server\nwhich now has become a traditional approach [15].\
    \ Block-\nchain records transactions in block units, and every block\nincludes\
    \ the hash of the block history, hash of the current\nblock, date, other details,\
    \ and transactions for the block.\nWhen a sender node makes a transaction, it\
    \ distributes it to\nthe other nodes on the network. The receiving nodes verify\n\
    the transaction and have proof of work. The node that suc-\nceeds in the proof\
    \ of work will broadcast it to all the other\nnodes and connect the block to the\
    \ chain. The transaction\nshall contain the public key of the recipient and shall\
    \ be\nsigned by the sender. Therefore, any other node will verify\nthe validity\
    \ of the transaction. Each block includes a hash\nof the previous block, which\
    \ means that each block is\nconnected to each other [16]. The key characteristics\
    \ of\nblockchain are shown in Figure 3 [17].\nBecause of its unique characteristics,\
    \ blockchain may be\nan evolutionary next step in the food supply chain also to\n\
    add accountability to the supply chain system by exchanging\naccurate data between\
    \ supply chain stakeholders. After the\nintegration of IoT with blockchain, the\
    \ overall visibility of\nfood products across the supply chain will become a reality.\n\
    The major advantages of blockchain and IoT in the food sup-\nply chain are real-time\
    \ monitoring and sensing of original\nfood items from the origin which identify\
    \ major bottlenecks.\n2\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nAs in the\
    \ agricultural sector, farmers use chemical fertilizers,\ninsecticides, and other\
    \ materials to increase crop production,\nespecially vegetable growers often use\
    \ harmful pesticides to\nspray vegetables to improve their proﬁtability, and con-\n\
    sumers buy the same vegetables to eat which is a major health\nhazard. Secondly,\
    \ food frauds and data alternation are also\nbig challenges for supply chain stakeholders.\n\
    1.5. Blockchain in Food Supply Chain. Blockchain is an\nemerging technology for\
    \ the agriculture sector, applying\nblockchain to the agricultural supply chain\
    \ provides a digital\ndatabase that monitors, tracks records, and processes digital\n\
    and physical resources. Blockchain allows greater traceabil-\nity and higher quality\
    \ transactions. This technology can\nmanage and integrate all procedures and dealings\
    \ in real-\ntime across the agricultural supply chain. Every transaction\ntreated\
    \ in a distributed manner may contain product-\nspeciﬁc attributes and transactions\
    \ that will be added by\nplayers in the supply chain. The supply chain players\
    \ can\nrecognize and investigate the association of products along\nwith all stages\
    \ of the supply chain and zoological technology\npractices (fertilizers, feed,\
    \ and veterinary services [18]. The\nblockchain stores invariant records that\
    \ are transparent\nand digitally accessible to all users in the supply chain;\
    \ this\ntechnology has the potential to produce massive eﬃciency\ngains for each\
    \ actor. The blockchain oﬀers a forum for\ntraceability in the agricultural supply\
    \ chain, allowing end-\nusers to monitor product from origins and ensure their\n\
    authenticity. Figure 4 illustrates the beneﬁts of using block-\nchain in the food\
    \ supply chain. The ability to monitor a\nSensors\nSofware\nAI\nImplements\nFigure\

    \ for infringe-\nment on the product’s authenticity, making regulation easier\n\
    to regulate. The blockchain keeps the mechanism and the\ndata connected at all\
    \ times [19].\n1.6. IoT Integration with the Blockchain. Industry 4.0 has\nshown\
    \ that the Internet of Things is a fundamental technol-\nogy and a key player\
    \ in the digital revolution. In diﬀerent net-\nwork topologies, IoT is expected\
    \ to depend more on sensing\ndevices, a wide range of data, and more connected\
    \ devices. As\na result, it must be referred to as the Internet of Things 2.0.\n\
    The Internet of Things 2.0 is now transitioning away from\nsensors and data technology\
    \ and toward actionable intelli-\ngence technology [20]. IoT becomes more eﬃcient\
    \ when it\nis combined with cloud computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nand machine\
    \ learning [21]. Integration of blockchain tech-\nnology with IoT is another signiﬁcant\
    \ contribution to the\ndigital transformation of various domains. By integrating\n\
    with IoT, blockchain is projected to add $176 billion to the\nglobal economy by\
    \ 2025 and $3 trillion by 2030 [22].\nFigure 5 depicts the most important blockchain\

    \ Advantages of Blockchain Technology in Food Supply Chain.\n4\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nIn the present world, the problem of health and food\n\
    safety is deteriorating day by day because a proper food trace-\nability system\
    \ is not available. The biggest reason for food-\nborne disease is contamination\
    \ which is hard to track in the\nconventional food supply chain because the mechanism\
    \ is\nnot visible [23]. However, IoT with a blockchain system will\nﬁx the problem\
    \ by creating a distributed system and elimi-\nnating the third party participating\
    \ in the system at the same\ntime. Consumers have questions about the nature of\
    \ the food\nproducts they purchase and the sources of the product they\nbuy in\
    \ the conventional supply chain. The key point here is\nto create customer interest,\
    \ which is diﬃcult to do as the sys-\ntem is not open. By building customer conﬁdence,\
    \ IoT and\nblockchain technology could eradicate these issues. Each\nproduct has\
    \ a digital identity in this framework, which stores\ninformation from the point\
    \ of origin up to the end of the\nretailer [24]. IoT with blockchain can provide\
    \ a more\ntransparent and connected system.\n1.7. Communication Protocols. Communication\
    \ protocols\nhave been commonly used in various types of networks to\nimprove\
    \ communication eﬃciency. The LoRaWAN protocol\nwas created to migrate data from\
    \ sensor nodes and the IoT\nnetwork platform that introduced the LoRaWAN backend\n\
    service to the cloud for data sharing. In terms of integrating\nwith other IoT\
    \ systems and introducing new services, the\nplanned framework was scalable and\
    \ versatile. It is also hor-\nizontally scalable, which means it can improve eﬃciency\
    \ by\nreplicating new server occurrences [25]. Heizelmann created\nthe low-energy\
    \ adaptive wireless sensor network routing\nLEACH protocol, which was the ﬁrst\
    \ hierarchical cluster-\nbased routing protocol for a wireless sensor network.\
    \ The\nprotocol nodes had been distributed across clusters, and each\ncluster\
    \ had its head (CH). Member nodes of cluster sensory\ndata share them via their\
    \ selected CHs with the base station.\nSmart agriculture has been able to ensure\
    \ that it not only\nmeets the general needs of crops but also anticipates their\n\
    speciﬁc needs, taking into account a variety of environmental\nfactors. The challenge\
    \ is to accurately predict potential crop\nlosses to take appropriate measures.\
    \ IoT nodes enable eﬃ-\ncient routing protocols to obtain data and share information\n\
    with farmers [26].\n2. Literature Review\nThis section provides a thorough review\
    \ of the related\nliterature.\n2.1. Review on IoT in Smart Agriculture. In paper\
    \ [26], the\nauthors proposed a smart agriculture system to provide\ninformation\
    \ on soil, water supply, and the general state of\nthe ﬁeld to farmers. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system\nwas to make agriculture and irrigation more eﬃcient\
    \ and to\nmake it easier for farmers to take appropriate decisions to\nincrease\
    \ agricultural production. The use of IoT networks\nto monitor environmental factors\
    \ and the combination of\nthis information with a user-speciﬁc web service enables\n\
    farmers to make eﬀective use of their knowledge to obtain\nthe best results from\
    \ their agriculture. In paper [27],\nresearchers have developed an IoT-based agriculture\
    \ data\nanalysis system using IoT devices such as environmental ﬁeld\nreal-time\
    \ monitoring sensors. The ﬁeld observation was col-\nlected and transferred to\
    \ the farmers through a web-based\napplication with the help of a node and a Wi-Fi\
    \ module.\nThe system consists of sensors such as a soil moisture sensor\nand\
    \ an ultrasonic sensor. The system has a low cost but uses\nhigh energy. The authors\
    \ of the paper [28] used IoT to build a\nsmart agriculture system for Indian farmers.\
    \ Farmers in India\nhave begun to commit suicide as a result of low agricultural\n\
    output. To address this problem, an IoT-based smart agricul-\nture system was\
    \ created that uses a variety of sensors to mon-\nitor pests and soil moisture.\
    \ Crop distribution companies\nwere also involved in providing high-quality seeds\
    \ to farmers\nto boost yields. The system architecture, on the other hand, is\n\
    extremely durable, but it comes at a high price.\nResearchers explored the potential\
    \ beneﬁts of using smart\nagriculture technologies such as smart soil and air\
    \ sensors in\npaper [29], to assist farmers by covering the initial installa-\n\
    tion costs and providing smart farming advice through the\nintegrated use of heterogeneous\
    \ information sources. The\nwork helped farmers in growing their ecological footprint\n\
    by providing opportunities for innovation targeting and cli-\nmate change adaptation\
    \ options. The authors of the paper\n[30] used sophisticated Internet of Thing\
    \ (IoT) agricultural\napplications to make accurate measurements, using sensor\n\
    data from 60 scientiﬁc papers published between 2016 and\n2018. Previous research\
    \ has shown the importance of smart\nagriculture in water, grain, livestock, and\
    \ irrigation manage-\nment. When it came to sensor data collection, the best results\n\
    were obtained when calculating temperature and humidity.\nSensors for soil moisture\
    \ and soil reaction are also available.\n2.2. Review on Blockchain in the Supply\
    \ Chain. Researchers in\nthe paper [31] proposed a theoretical model to investigate\
    \ the\nimpact of blockchain on operational supply chain transpar-\nency and collaboration\
    \ by establishing rapid trust between\nkey partners involved in disaster relief\
    \ supply chains. Collabo-\nration enables stakeholders to work together, leads\
    \ to produc-\ntive and eﬃcient real-time information exchange between\npartners,\
    \ and provides many beneﬁts such as increased trans-\nparency, ﬂexibility, and\
    \ reduced lead–time, as well as helping\nto improve supply chain resilience. The\
    \ authors of the paper\nGovernment\ncurrency \nDigital energy and\nsmart grids\n\
    World trade and\nsupply chain\nSelf-sovereign\ndigital identify \nBlockchain and\
    \ IoT\nprediction by 2030\nToken-based digital\neconomy \nFigure 5: Blockchain\
    \ and IoT prediction by 2030.\n5\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n\
    [32] suggested blockchain adoption as a way to improve the\nentire supply chain,\
    \ from safe, accurate, and open transactions\nto increasing supply chain participants’\
    \ trust and eﬃciency by\nexchanging all transactions and related information across\
    \ the\nentire network. The authors of [14] focused on weakening\nsupply chain\
    \ resilience in the era of information asymmetry,\nwhich occurs when one of the\
    \ supply chain’s members has sig-\nniﬁcantly more product information than the\
    \ others. They\nadmitted that data inaccuracies or discrepancies might lead\n\
    to incorrect decisions and an increase in technological risks\nincluding cybercrime,\
    \ hacking, and theft, both of which\ncould harm the company’s credibility. One\
    \ of these solutions,\naccording to the writers, is establishing “conﬁdence” among\n\
    supply chain participants using a decentralized information\nsharing framework\
    \ based on blockchain technology.\n2.3. Motivation. In terms of technology, although\
    \ the litera-\nture in smart agriculture using IoT is very rich, there is still\n\
    a gap for improvement, whereas the use of blockchain tech-\nnology in the food\
    \ supply system literature is very limited.\nBesides, no solid research papers\
    \ are published yet using a\ncombination of IoT and blockchain technology for\
    \ agricul-\nture and food supply systems for addressing the information\nreliability\
    \ issues. Most of the solutions are ad hoc-based or\nwork separately. Limitations\
    \ in the existing literature moti-\nvated us to develop a futuristic smart model\
    \ based on smart\ntechnologies to meet the requirements of all stakeholders\n\
    involved in agriculture and food supply chain by using IoT\nwith blockchain technology\
    \ through which traceability man-\nagement can be applied through the food supply\
    \ chain and\naddresses the main centralized format challenge that is\nasymmetric,\
    \ opaque, and monopolistic. These limitations\nhave driven us to build a distributed,\
    \ eﬃcient, and safe sys-\ntem to enhance crop production, ensure the end-to-end\n\
    traceability of food products, and stop food fraud in the sup-\nply chain. The\
    \ goal would be to develop a distributed and\nautomatic agriculture food supply\
    \ chain traceability model\nthat enables various quality levels to be implemented\
    \ based\non consumer needs. The model that not only uses transac-\ntion data but\
    \ also smart contract and enables end-to-end\ntraceability and data security.\n\
    3. Materials and Methods\nThis section presents the smart model architecture and\
    \ smart\nmodel protocol design.\n3.1. Smart Model Architecture. As shown in Figure\
    \ 6, a futur-\nistic smart model for agricultural environmental monitoring\nand\
    \ food supply chain consists of three layers: physical data\nlayer, logical data\
    \ layer, and web interface layer. This type\nof layered approach allows for scalable,\
    \ extendable, and eﬃ-\ncient framework implementation. In the physical data layer,\n\
    a variety of IoT nodes are used to track the farm environment\nand crop growth.\
    \ IoT nodes collect data from the cluster farm\nand send it to the base station\
    \ via IoT gateway and wireless\nrouter, which then sends it to the database. A\
    \ GPRS router\nis integrated into a single central board device that serves as\n\
    a remote Radio Frequency Gateway (RFG) for wireless telem-\netry. To achieve eﬀective\
    \ control management and synchro-\nnization of two relatively unrelated data sources,\
    \ data\ncollection through IoT nodes for soil parameters and IoT\ncrop monitoring\
    \ information, the RFG gateway acts as a\ncoordinator between two separate data\
    \ streams and supports\nremote access, allowing for complete remote control of\n\
    devices in the cluster farm. The logical data layer in an SQL\ndatabase server\
    \ stores the data obtained from the cluster\nfarm. The SQL server, as a more intermediate\
    \ layer, covers\nthe complexity of multiple physical layer devices and allows\n\
    database server data validation. Raw data is stored in the\nSQL database, which\
    \ is then extracted to a local ﬁle system.\nEnergy is the core part of every network,\
    \ and energy con-\nservation is one of the key objectives of this research. To\n\
    reduce energy consumption, this research proposed an IoT-\nbased agriculture protocol\
    \ that can be divided into three\nphases: IoT nodes, IoT cluster head, and sink.\
    \ IoT nodes\ngathered data and transferred it to CH in the ﬁrst phase,\nCH broadcasted\
    \ information to sink in the second phase,\nand sink transferred data to the base\
    \ station in the third\nphase. This research work implements an RFG server using\n\
    a robust ultra-low-power Single Board Chip to seamlessly\ncombine a variety of\
    \ devices in the cluster farm (SBC TS-\n7260). The monitoring system switches\
    \ between active and\nsleep mode automatically. The optional battery backup mod-\n\
    ule supports the SBC sleep mode, which also operates with a\nbuilt-in uninterrupted\
    \ power supply (UPS). Diﬀerent devices\nin the cluster farm are normally equipped\
    \ with an RS232\nserial port. Wireless routers are switched oﬀ during the sys-\n\
    tem’s sleep cycle to conserve electricity. SQL server obtains\ndata by either\
    \ pull or pushes operations. In a pull method,\nSQL server connects to the data\
    \ source regularly and extracts\nthe data. In a push operation, this server opens\
    \ a port\nthrough which data can be passed through the data source.\nThis design\
    \ allows the server to adapt to diﬀerent data source\ntypes with ease. The data\
    \ was sent to the SQL server. The data\nmanager may also require the RFG server\
    \ to recollect data\nand retransfer data packets that were omitted. For each new\n\
    data source, a new data manager is included with limited\nmodiﬁcations to the\
    \ database and web visualization layers,\nimproving extensibility. Speciﬁc IoT\
    \ identiﬁcation codes link\nthe nodes and observations. As a consequence, once\
    \ they are\nlinked to the database, the web application layer will recog-\nnize\
    \ them right away. This design allows for ﬂexible model\ndevelopment and web interface\
    \ design. It also allows for data\nconversion to IoT networks, allowing for data\
    \ sharing and\ninteroperability between IoT devices through web services.\n3.2.\
    \ BlockChain Integration with IoT in the Smart Model.\nExclusive blockchain characteristics\
    \ will combine agricul-\ntural and food supply chain processes into a single smart\
    \ sys-\ntem to ensure that consumers receive healthy food. Figure 7\nshows a functional\
    \ overview of the blockchain.\nThe role of stakeholders in the overall system\
    \ is also\ndiscussed. The research used blockchain smart contracts to\nexchange\
    \ data between mining nodes in the system. All busi-\nness transactions are recorded\
    \ in the shared ledger by min-\ning nodes, and smart contracts receive all transactions\
    \ in\nthe blockchain in the form of function calls and generate\n6\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nactivities, as well as providing access to parties involved\
    \ in\nthe transaction to exchange control track and receive alerts\nin the event\
    \ of a violation. Finally, smart contracts help to\nmaintain the best conditions\
    \ and respond to food supply\nchain misappropriations.\n3.2.1. Seed Seller. Seed\
    \ sellers, also known as seed vendors,\norganize and produce a wide range of seeds\
    \ before selling\nthem to farmers. They are obligated to sell high-quality seeds\n\
    to growers to produce a high-quality crop. The seed seller\nuses blockchain to\
    \ store information about seed germination\nand chemical composition, which all\
    \ stakeholders can access\nand share. Seeds are stamped with a unique number,\
    \ similar\nto serialized Global Trade Identiﬁcation Numbers, that\nallows all\
    \ parties to be electronically identiﬁed and track\nproducts in the seed trade.\n\
    3.2.2. Farmer. A farmer is someone who buys high-quality\nseeds and plants them.\
    \ The farmer is responsible for record-\ning information about fertilizers use\
    \ and plant growth data in\nthe form of MPEG ﬁles in the IPFS, where diﬀerent\
    \ nodes\nkeep the data with high reliability throughout the entire pro-\ncess\
    \ from planting to harvesting. Farmers can also use block-\nchain to communicate\
    \ with crop buyers and sell their crops\nwithout relying on middlemen, who often\
    \ get proﬁt by medi-\nating between sellers and buyers.\n3.2.3. Crop Buyer. Crop\
    \ buyer is a company that buys crop or\na grain from a farmer and sells it to\
    \ a processor.\n3.2.4. Processor. The processor buys grain that does a mois-\n\
    ture analysis to convert the raw grain to the ﬁnal product.\nThe processor is\
    \ responsible for all operations in the block-\nchain where other players in the\
    \ supply chain have access\nto this information.\n3.2.5. Crop Storage. The storing\
    \ of crops or grains is an\nimportant and unavoidable part of the crop production\
    \ pro-\ncess and supply chain process. In warehouse, grains or crops\nare stored,\
    \ and information is recorded in the blockchain\nwhere supply chain stakeholders\
    \ can view and exchange this\ninformation.\nBlock chain \nsmart contracts\nFarmer\n\

    \ Computing\n3.2.6. Distributor. Distributors have a business arrangement\nwith\
    \ the suppliers or producers. Many distributors maintain\nexclusive purchasing\
    \ agreements which limit or allow distrib-\nutors to cover a certain area through\
    \ the number of partici-\npants. The distributor is the producer’s exclusive point\
    \ of\ncontact with prospective purchasers of those products. Dis-\ntributors,\
    \ though, seldom sell the goods of the manufacturer\ndirectly to the retailer.\
    \ Distributors tend to work with whole-\nsale agents who may buy large quantities\
    \ of one commodity\nregardless of the very large quantity of one commodity they\n\
    have on hand or can purchase from the manufacturer. The\ndistributor is responsible\
    \ for registering all food product\ninformation in the blockchain.\n3.2.7. Retailer.\
    \ Retailers are proﬁt-making companies that\ndirectly sell products to consumers.\
    \ Retailers search for prod-\nucts that suit their market objectives and ﬁnd vendors\
    \ at the\nmost advantageous prices to make a proﬁt. Generally, small\nquantities\
    \ of an item can be ordered from a distributor by a\nretailer. In this setup,\
    \ the retailer orders goods in batches of\ntraceable identiﬁers which make it\
    \ easy for the customer to\nverify product life cycle records.\n3.2.8. Customer.\
    \ The customer is the ﬁnal user of the food\nproduct who purchases the food product\
    \ from the retailer.\nThis research smart model provides full access to the cus-\n\
    tomer to trace production information from the origin to\nthe sale point. In this\
    \ setup, all supply chain stakeholders\nare bound to digitally sign blockchain\
    \ smart contracts and\nto record information fairly and in case of dishonest block-\n\
    chain automatically conﬁgure the incident into smart con-\ntracts to ﬁne the concerned\
    \ party. Another option is to\ninstall cameras in the ﬁeld to automatically capture\
    \ and\ntransfer images to the blockchain for preaudit. The advantage\nof using\
    \ product traceability technology in the food supply\nchain is the availability\
    \ of reliable and real-time information\nto all stakeholders.\n3.3. IoT-Based\
    \ Agriculture Protocol for the Smart Model. IoT\nnodes are ideal for cluster farms\
    \ because they consume less\nenergy than WSN and can be further reduced through\
    \ an eﬃ-\ncient clustering protocol. Therefore, this research proposed a\nnew\
    \ clustering protocol IoT-based agriculture, as shown in\nFigure 8, based on the\
    \ LEACH protocol, to reduce energy\nconsumption and extend network life.\n3.3.1.\
    \ Assumption for Simulation. Assumptions for simula-\ntion are given below.\n\
    (i) IoT nodes are installed on a cluster farm randomly\n(ii) IoT nodes send hello\
    \ messages to the base station\nwith local information\n(iii) The initial number\
    \ of clusters is calculated by taking\nthe optimal values to vary with the node\
    \ density\nbefore the node starts to expire, and the smaller clus-\nters become\
    \ larger clusters\n(iv) The base station and sink are installed outside the\n\
    cluster farm as presented in Figure 9\n3.3.2. Initialization Phase. A cluster\
    \ farm with a total area of\n500 × 500 m2 was chosen and distributed into clusters,\
    \ with\n100 IoT nodes placed in each cluster at random. The IoT\nnodes were chosen\
    \ based on their capabilities, such as soil\nmoisture monitoring, temperature\
    \ monitoring, and crop dis-\nease tracking. Nodes in clusters are distributed\
    \ in such a way\nthat one cluster node does not communicate with other clus-\n\
    ter nodes, but only with the cluster heads of their respective\nclusters. Each\
    \ cluster’s CH is in charge of sharing sensed data\nwith the BS via the sink node.\
    \ To achieve a satisfactory SNR,\na widely used LEACH “First Order Radio Model”\
    \ is used to\ntransmit a small message over a distance of d.\n3.3.3. LEACH First\
    \ Order Radio Model. As shown in\nFigure 10 and Table 1, the ﬁrst order radio\
    \ model dissipates\nEelec = 50 nJ/bit to run the transmitter or receiver circuit\
    \ sys-\ntem and Eamp = 100 pJ/bit/m2 for the transmit ampliﬁer to\nachieve a satisfactory\
    \ signal-to-noise ratio. These parameters\nare slightly better than the existing\
    \ radio system second\nassumption that was an energy loss due to channel transmis-\n\
    sion. To transmit an m-bit message over a distance of d using\na radio model,\
    \ the radio dissipates as follows:\nETx m, d\nð\nÞ = ETx−elec m\nð Þ + ETx−amp\
    \ m, d\nð\nÞ,\nð1Þ\nETx m, d\nð\nÞ = Eelec × m + ∈amp × m × d2,\nð2Þ\nand to get\
    \ this message, the radio expands\nERx m\nð Þ = Eelec × m:\nð3Þ\nWith those parameters,\
    \ transferring or receiving a packet\nis not a low-cost method; so, protocols\
    \ must strive to reduce\nnot only transmission distances but also the number of\
    \ trans-\nmission and receiving operations per message.\n3.3.4. Clustering Mechanism.\
    \ IoT nodes are divided into\ngroups in a cluster farm, and these groups are known\
    \ as clus-\nters; each cluster is represented by G and has a head node.\nEach\
    \ cluster’s nodes sense data and send it to a single head\nnode; they do not communicate\
    \ with other head nodes.\nCluster\nCluster member\nBase station\nSink\nDatabase\n\

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n(1) Cluster Head (CH) Selection.\
    \ The CH is responsible for\ncollecting data from member nodes and transmitting\
    \ aggre-\ngated data to the base station, it requires a lot of energy to\ndo so,\
    \ and the transmission process must be boosted with\nhigh power ampliﬁcation.\
    \ Two parameters are considered\nin the CH selection process: the history of nodes\
    \ acting as\nCH and the optimal percentage of a node. The generation\nof a random\
    \ number is used to make each node decision\n(between 0 and 1). The node will\
    \ be selected as CH if the gen-\nerated random number is threshold (Tn) for that\
    \ round.\nThe following formula is used to calculate the thresh-\nold (Tn):\n\
    T n\nð Þ =\nP\n1 − Px r mod 1/P\nð\nÞ\nð\nÞ\nn ∈ G\n0\notherwise\n:\n8\n>\n<\n\
    >\n:\nð4Þ\nIn equation (4), p represents the percentage of CH, r\nrepresents the\
    \ number of rounds, and G represents the\nset of nodes that were not selected\
    \ as CH in the previous\n1/p rounds. Every node in the cluster has a 1/p chance\
    \ of\nbeing a CH in each round in this situation. When a node\nis chosen as CH,\
    \ it sends an advertisement message to its\nnearby nodes, inviting them to be\
    \ CH. The advertisement\nmessage is accepted by the member nodes, and they enter\n\
    the CH.\n(2) Data Transmission. Following CH selection, the data\ntransmission\
    \ schedule kicks oﬀ, with member nodes sending\ndata to their assigned CH during\
    \ their designated transmis-\nsion time. Low-energy transmission was required\
    \ for this\ntype of transmission. Before transmission time is allocated,\nthe\
    \ member node can be turned oﬀ to save energy. The CH\nmust keep the receiver\
    \ to receive the full data and then com-\nbine all of the data into a single signal\
    \ before transmitting it\nto the base station via a sink node.\n(3) Routing Phase.\
    \ The way to pick a traﬃc route in a net-\nwork is routing. The IoT agricultural\
    \ network is comprised\nof numerous modes of communication and protocols in\n\
    the long and short range, which form the backbone for these\nnetworks to gather\
    \ information and exchange this data with\nthe farmers for review and decision-making.\
    \ The IoT-based\nagriculture protocol has three levels of data routing in the\n\
    ﬁrst stage member node sense data and transfer it to their\nCHs, while in the\
    \ second stage, the CHs accumulate and\ntransfer data to the nearest sink, and\
    \ in the third and last\nstage, sink sends this data into the base station. In\
    \ such data\ncommunication, the function of the sink minimizes CH’s\nenergy consumption\
    \ and reduces packet losses, especially\nfor long haul communication. Figure 8\
    \ demonstrates the full\ndata routing method.\n(4) Setup Phase. For the ﬁrst round,\
    \ CHs are generated using\nthe standard LEACH algorithm, and the cluster heads\
    \ are\nchosen using equation (4). After transferring data, each node\nin the network\
    \ consumes a speciﬁc amount of energy, and\neach node has consumed a diﬀerent\
    \ amount of energy. The\ndistance between the sending and receiving nodes, denoted\n\

    \ by (6).\nIn the above equation, WEconsumed is the amount of\nenergy consumed\
    \ in each round, and do denotes the distance\nbetween two nodes. The consumption\
    \ of energy is assumed\nas ETX and ERX, and their parameters can be determined\n\
    by using (2) and (3). To meet the objective mentioned in\n(5), this research divides\
    \ the total node energy into diﬀerent\nequivalent parts and presented as “EL”\
    \ and can be calculated\nfrom (7)\nEL = Eo\nTL :\nð10Þ\nIn the equation (10),\
    \ EL stands for energy level, Eo\nstands for initial static node, and TL stands\
    \ for total energy,\nwhich is dependent on the amount of energy consumed by\n\
    each node as well as network density and packet size. The\nrelationship between\
    \ EL and TL is inverse. When the TL\nvalue is low, the EL value is high. The node\
    \ in the cluster\nfarm performs the role of CH until the values of EL do\nnot\
    \ reduce the residual energy, at which point, a termina-\ntion of CH selection\
    \ message is sent to all nodes, and a\nnew process for CH selection begins. Only\
    \ those nodes that\nare supposed to transfer data remain active in this mecha-\n\
    nism to reduce energy consumption. When member nodes\nﬁnish their data sensing\
    \ process, CH begins to collect data\nfrom all member nodes, aggregate the data\
    \ to remove any\nduplication, combine data into a single signal to save band-\n\
    width, and transmit data in a single hop to the sink, where it\nis then transferred\
    \ to the base station. The ﬂowchart is\nshown in Figure 11, and the algorithm\
    \ for the entire process\nis shown below.\n4. Simulation Results and Discussion\n\
    To test the eﬃciency of our proposed IoT-based agriculture\nprotocol, the MATLAB\
    \ simulation is compared with the cur-\nrent LEACH protocol. IoT nodes were installed\
    \ randomly in\neach simulated technique in the simulation of 5000 rounds.\nIn\
    \ the farm of 500 × 500m2, all active IoT nodes transfer data\nto their respective\
    \ cluster heads, and cluster heads transfer\ndata to the base station via sink\
    \ node. The simulation results\nare presented below.\n4.1. Network Stability Period.\
    \ The time it takes for the ﬁrst\nnode to die is known as the network stability\
    \ period.\nFigure 12 depicts the LEACH network stability period and\nthe proposed\
    \ IoT-based agriculture protocol. LEACH has a\nshorter stability period than the\
    \ proposed protocol. The rea-\nson for the improvement is that data is only transferred\
    \ in the\nproposed protocol when there is a diﬀerence between previ-\nously taken\
    \ data and current data. The results show that the\nLEACH ﬁrst node dies after\
    \ 168 rounds, while the proposed\nprotocol ﬁrst node dies after 463 rounds, indicating\
    \ that the\nIoT-based agriculture protocol is 23% more eﬃcient in terms\nof network\
    \ stability.\n4.2. Energy Consumption. The energy consumed by the nodes\nduring\
    \ data transmission is referred to as energy consump-\ntion. Figure 13 shows the\
    \ simulation results for both proto-\ncols. The energy consumption of the nodes\
    \ in the IoT-\nbased agriculture protocol is 68 percent lower than that of\nLEACH,\
    \ which can extend network life.\n4.3. Network Life. The network’s life is determined\
    \ by the\ntime it takes to ﬁnish the energy at the ﬁrst node. Figure 14\n0\n0\n\

    \ network life and IoT-based\nagriculture. LEACH assumes that CHs dissipate the\
    \ same\namount of energy for each round, resulting in unsuccessful\nCH selection\
    \ and a reduction in network life, whereas the\nIoT-based protocol selects CHs\
    \ based on the residual energy\nof the nodes and the optimal number of clusters,\
    \ resulting in\na 112 percent increase in network life.\n5. Conclusions\nThe use\
    \ of blockchain in the food supply chain has yielded\nvarious beneﬁts, including\
    \ the potential to expand and step\ntowards the distributed network, as well as\
    \ the ability to build\na trustless environment for all processes. Despite the\
    \ trustless\nexistence of blockchain, it is diﬃcult to completely establish\n\
    trust between the agricultural product seller and buyer. Cur-\nrent blockchain-based\
    \ food supply chain systems focus solely\non the supply chain, with no choice\
    \ to track food products\nback to their source to ensure product quality, while\
    \ existing\nIoT-based agriculture systems are often isolated, with roles\nrestricted\n\
    to\nagriculture\nenvironment\nmonitoring\nand\nfarmers unable to directly communicate\
    \ with market buyers.\nIn this paper, we have provided complete solution for agri-\n\
    culture and food supply chain by integrating IoT with the\nblockchain. In addition,\
    \ we have developed an energy eﬃ-\ncient routing protocol for the proposed system\
    \ to extend sys-\ntem life by reducing energy consumption. A novel approach\n\
    has been applied in this research and developed a futuristic\nsmart model for\
    \ agriculture and the food supply chain, which\noﬀers an innovative way for farmers\
    \ to acquire information\non crops. IoT can provide farmers with information on\
    \ crop\nyields, soil temperature, pest infestation, and soil quality that\nis\
    \ essential for high crop production and provides precise\ndata that can be used\
    \ to improve farming techniques. Crop\n0\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nRounds\n\

    \ Another unique aspect of\nthe smart model is blockchain, which oﬀers real-time\

    \ signiﬁcantly eliminates the vulnerability of centralized\ninformation networks,\
    \ and makes them secure, more widely\navailable, more accessible, and more interactive.\
    \ The smart\nmodel will greatly boost the eﬃciency and reliability of the\nfood\
    \ supply chain, which will inevitably increase food safety\nand regain customer\
    \ trust in the food industry.\nData Availability\nData is available upon requesting\

    offer new convenience, comfort, and efficiency possibilities to their residents.
    Changes will occur to the way people live as technology involves people''s lives
    and information processing is fully integrated into their daily living activities
    and objects. The future expectation of smart buildings includes making the residents''
    experience as easy and comfortable as possible. The massive streaming data generated
    and captured by smart building appliances and devices contain valuable information
    that needs to be mined to facilitate timely actions and better decision making.
    Machine learning and big data analytics will undoubtedly play a critical role
    to enable the delivery of such smart services. In this paper, we survey the area
    of smart building with a special focus on the role of techniques from machine
    learning and big data analytics. This survey also reviews the current trends and
    challenges faced in the development of smart building services. The major machine
    learning tasks that are relevant to smart buildings include: data collection and
    acquisition, data pre-processing, and dimensionality reduction. Published in:

    term “smart building” (SB) may bring a thought of a fictional smart space from
    science-fiction movies, but the reality is that SBs exist today, and their number
    is getting increased. With recent advances in machine learning (ML), big data
    analytics, sensor technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), regular buildings
    can be cost-effectively transformed into SBs with bare minimum infrastructural
    modifications. There are smart office, smart library, smart home, smart health
    care facilities, smart hospital and many other types of SBs that can provide automated
    services that can provide many value-added services (such as reduction of wasted
    energy) and also help to ensure the comfort, health, and safety of the occupants.
    The hyperconnectivity that will be brought about by the emergence of IoT will
    increase the promise of SB since now all the basic building amenities and commodities
    ranging from your house electronics to your plant vases will be interconnected.
    But this hyperconnectivity will at the same time complicate the process of managing
    SBs. In particular, SBs and their inhabitants are expected to create large volumes
    of streaming data. ML, sampling, compression, learning, and filtering technologies
    are becoming more significant to manage the stream of big data of individuals.
    In 1981, the term Intelligent Buildings (IBs) was initially coined by United Technology
    Building Systems (UTBS) Corporation in the U.S. In July 1983, IBs became a reality
    with the opening of the City Place Building in Hartford, Connecticut [1]. Today,
    the number of SBs is growing at an unprecedented rate including smart office,
    smart hospitality, smart educational facilities etc. [2]. An SB is recognized
    as an integrated system that takes advantage of a range of computational and communications
    infrastructure and techniques [3]. Examples of SB services include smart thermostats
    that allow the temperature to be controlled based on the time of the day/year
    and the users’ preferences with minimal or no manual configuration. Using data
    analytics to “learn” the users’ preferences before taking the appropriate actions
    is probably the most important enabling technology for IBs [4]. Lately, smart
    coffee machines appeared in the market with the capability to make coffee automatically,
    according to users’ preferences and schedules. Fridges can offer allocated programming
    interfaces for their control [5]. IBs aim to provide their users with safe, energy
    efficient, environment-friendly, and convenient services. In order to maximize
    comfort, minimize cost, and adapt to the needs of their inhabitants, SBs must
    rely on sophisticated tools to learn, predict, and make intelligent decisions.
    SB algorithms cover a range of technologies, including prediction, decision-making,
    robotics, smart materials, wireless sensor networks, multimedia, mobile computing,
    and cloud computing. With these technologies, buildings can cognitively manage
    many SB services such as security, privacy, energy efficiency, lighting, maintenance,
    elderly care, and multimedia entertainment. The massive volume of sensory data
    collected from sensors and appliances must be analyzed by algorithms, transformed
    into information, and minted to extract knowledge so that machines can have a
    better understanding of humans than their environment. Furthermore, and most importantly,
    such knowledge can lead to new products and services that can dramatically transform
    our lives. For example, readings from smart meters can be used to better predict
    and balancing the usage of power. Monitoring and processing sensory data from
    wearable sensors attached to patients can produce new remote healthcare services.
    The main philosophy behind ML is to create the analytical models automatically
    in order to permit the algorithms to learn continuously from available data. The
    application of ML techniques increased over the last two decades due to the availability
    of massive amounts of complex data and the increased usability of current ML tools.
    Today, ML is already widely applied in different applications including recommendation
    systems offered by online services (e.g., Amazon, Netflix) and automatic credit
    rating services used by banks. Alphabet’s Nest thermostat utilizes ML to “learn”
    the temperature preferences of its users and adapt to their work schedule to minimize
    the energy use. Other widely publicized examples of ML applications include Google’s
    self-driving car, sentiment analysis of Amazon and Twitter data, fraud detection,
    and Facebook’s facial-recognition technology that is used to tag the suggested
    person on images uploaded by users. A. SB Trends and Market Impact In this section,
    we look at the statistics related to SBs, to allow us to understand the current
    trends and motivations in industry marketplaces and academic researches toward
    SBs. According to the report by MarketsandMarkets [6], The SB market is estimated
    to grow from 7.42 billion dollars in 2017 to 31.74 billion dollars by 2022, at
    a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.7% from 2017 to 2022. In yet another
    report Zion Market Research [7], 2016 and it is expected to reach 61,900 million
    dollars by 2024. It is expected to exhibit a CAGR of more than 34% between 2017
    and 2024. The market is primarily driven by government initiatives globally for
    SB projects and the increasing market for integrated security and safety systems
    as well as energy efficient building systems. Figure 1 shows the Statista [8]
    forecast market size of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 (in billion
    U.S. dollars). FIGURE 1. Forecast market size of the global smart home market
    from 2016 to 2022 [8]. Show All According to the Gartner report [9], it is expected
    that the number of smart connected homes grows to 700 million homes by 2020, supplied
    by mass consumer adoption and an increase in the number of devices and apps available.
    Figure 2 shows Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle expectation for deep learning, ML, connected
    homes, and smart workspace. FIGURE 2. Hype Cycle for the Connected Home, 2018
    [7]. Show All According to report by Research and Markets [10], [11], the global
    IoT SB market will reach approximately $51.44B USD globally by 2023. The report
    also forecast that 33% of IoT SB market will be supplied by artificial intelligent
    technologies by 2023, and automation systems of SB will grow at 48.3% CAGR from
    2018–2023. Frost & Sullivan also predict that by 2025, the growth of connected
    home living will reach 3.7 billion smartphones, 700 million tablets, 520 million
    wearable health-related devices and 410 million smart appliances in the connected
    person world. B. Related Survey Papers Although many of survey papers focused
    on SBs have been published, none of them is focused on the role of data analytics
    and ML in the context of SBs. We describe the relevant survey papers next and
    will compare these survey papers to our paper in Table 2. Chan et al. in 2008
    provided an overview of smart home research [12]. It also discusses assistive
    robots, and wearable devices. The article reviews smart home projects arranged
    by country and continent. Alam et al. [13] provided details about sensors, devices,
    algorithms, and communication protocols utilized in smart homes. The paper reviews
    smart home works according to their desired services and research goals; namely,
    security, comfort, and healthcare. Lobaccaro et al. [14] presented the concept
    of smart home and smart grid technologies and discuss some challenges, benefits
    and future trends of smart home technologies. Pan et al. [15] reviewed the works
    on efficient energy consumption in SBs using microgrids. The survey investigates
    research topics and the recent advancements in SBs and the vision of microgrids.
    A few survey papers have reviewed works on facilitating independent living of
    the elderly people in smart homes. Ni et al. [16] conducted a survey on the features
    of sensing infrastructure and activities that can assist the independent living
    of the elderly in smart homes. A survey on ambient assisted living technologies
    for elderly people has been presented Rashidi and Mihailidis [17]. Peetoom et
    al. [18] focused on monitoring technologies to recognize life activities in-home
    such as fall detection and changes in health status. Salih et al. [19] presented
    a review of ambient intelligence assisted healthcare monitoring services and described
    the various application, communication, and wireless sensor network technologies
    that have been employed in the existing research literature. A number of papers
    have focused IoT: (a) Perera et al. [20] discussed IoT applications from the perspective
    of context-awareness and self-learning; (b) Tsai et al. [21] surveyed the applications
    of data mining technologies in IoT; and (c) Mahdavinejad et al. [22] reviewed
    some ML methods that can be applied to IoT data analytics. TABLE 1 List of Important
    Acronyms Used TABLE 2 Comparison of Relevant Survey Papers C. Contributions and
    Organization of This Paper To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey
    that covers SBs jointly from the perspectives of application, data analytics,
    and ML. The main contributions of our paper are: Exploration of the potential
    of ML-based context-aware systems to provide SB services; Identification of research
    challenges and directions for SBs and how ML models can help in resolving such
    challenges; Identification of SB applications including comfort, security, energy
    efficiency, and convenience and the role of ML in such applications. Our research
    can provide an impetus to ML researchers to investigate new exciting ML-based
    SB services. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces
    the concept of SBs and its underlying architecture. Section III introduces the
    various components of the SB ecosystem and its underlying architecture. Section
    V presents context recognition and activity modeling and the role of ML in SBs.
    Section VI highlights research and development challenges and provides a future
    perspective of SB projects. Finally, Section VII presents a summary of lessons
    learned and concludes the paper. For the convenience of the readers, we have enlisted
    the important acronyms used in Table 1. SECTION II. Smart Buildings: Concept and
    Architecture In 1984, The New York Times published an article that described that
    real estate developers are creating “a new generation of buildings that almost
    think for themselves called intelligent buildings.” Such an intelligent building
    (IB) was defined as “a marriage of two technologies - old-fashioned building management
    and telecommunications.” [23]. Since then, many definitions of SBs have been suggested.
    This is due to the fact that the life-cycle of building planning, design, implementation,
    and operation involves different industry players that have different roles. In
    addition, the rapid changes in technology are affecting this definition. For instance,
    the advent of IoT and smart city concepts is impacting the definition of SB. Therefore,
    it is hard to compose a unique view of IBs with a single definition that is accepted
    worldwide. However, it is vital to have a good understanding of the main standard
    bodies and companies involved in shaping the development of SBs [1]. The Institute
    for Building Efficiency [24] focuses on the operation of buildings to provide
    efficient healthy and comfortable environment [25]. IBM [26] focuses also on the
    operation of SBs to provide integrated physical and digital infrastructures that
    provide reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective occupancy services. According
    to the European Commission’s Information Society [27], SBs means buildings that
    are supplied by information and communication technologies in the context of the
    combining Ubiquitous Computing and the IoT: In general, the buildings that are
    supplied with sensors, actuators, microchips, micro- and nano-embedded systems
    in order to enable collecting, filtering and producing more information locally,
    to be further incorporated and managed globally according to business functions.”
    In SBs, a variety of AI and multi-agent system techniques are employed including
    [28]: Reasoning and knowledge representation including ontologies and rules to
    represent devices and building services. ML for human activity recognition. Multi-agent
    systems for distributed intelligence and semantic interoperability. Intelligent
    approaches such as planning, intelligent control, adaptive interfaces, and optimization
    for efficient management of resources and services. An SB is therefore the integration
    of a wide range of systems and services into a unified environment that involve
    energy management systems, temperature monitoring systems, access security systems,
    fire and life safety, lighting control and reduction, telecommunications services,
    office automation, computer systems, area locating systems, LANs, management information
    systems, cabling and records, maintenance systems, and expert systems [29]. Figure
    3 shows examples of SB appliances including air-conditioning systems, lighting
    systems, solar energy generators, power-supply systems, temperature sensors, humidity
    sensors, power usage sensors, and surveillance cameras. For example, centralized
    control of these elements can promote the efficient use of energy through the
    intelligent control of lights and air conditioning units and the intelligent management
    of multiple green and brown energy sources. In most cases, an SB uses an Ethernet
    backbone with bridges to a Controller Area Network (CAN) [26]. FIGURE 3. Example
    of SB appliances. Show All It is easier to introduce smart services in residential
    buildings compared to commercial buildings since residential buildings have less
    technical equipment and less stringent efficiency requirements. Because the commercial
    buildings usually have more public visitors and therefore building models for
    commercial buildings are usually more challenging than building models for residential
    buildings which usually have a limited number of the occupants most of the time.
    In addition, the costs associated with the purchase and installation of smart
    devices and infrastructure at commercial buildings is more than residential buildings.
    Figure 4 shows an integrated framework in a residential building that employs
    a network of intelligent sensors. These sensors control systems such as energy
    generation, metering, HVAC, lighting, and security. A building automation system
    manages a set of smart appliances, sensors, and actuators, which collectively
    deliver services for the well-being of the inhabitants. Examples of such smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators include washers and dryers, refrigerators,
    heaters, thermostats, lighting systems, power outlets, energy meters, smoke detectors,
    televisions, game consoles, windows/door controllers and sensors, air conditioners,
    video cameras, and sound detectors. More advanced smart devices are constantly
    being developed like smart floors and smart furniture [28], [30]. FIGURE 4. Smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators in a smart residential building. Show All The
    IoT will enable the integration and interoperability of heterogeneous devices
    in SBs as well as the real-time processing of the data generated by sensors in
    support of optimal control and operation of the building. In this paper, We propose
    a layered architecture for SBs based on the layered architecture of IoT. Figure
    5 shows the layered architecture of SBs. FIGURE 5. Layers of the base IoT architecture
    that serves as the foundation for SBs. Show All As can be seen from the sensing
    layer (the bottom layer in Figure 5), input data is obtained from different types
    of physical sensors that monitor environmental parameters, collect data about
    residents and detect anomalies (e.g., fire and water pipe bursts). This layer
    also includes actuators that can be controlled to save energy, minimize water
    consumption, etc. The network layer (the second layer in Figure 5), includes access
    and core networks that provide transparent data transmission capability. This
    layer serves as a bridge between the sensing layer and the upper layers which
    are mainly responsible for data processing. An intermediary software layer called
    the middleware layer is needed (the third layer in Figure 5) to provide seamless
    integration of heterogeneous devices and networks covered by the sensing layer
    of the architecture. That layer serves as a bridge between the embedded software
    that runs of smart sensors and back-end software services. This layer provides
    interoperability using standardized programming interfaces and protocols [31].
    Therefore, this layer performs the process of converting the collected data from
    various data formats into a common representation. SB middleware can be based
    on open standards or proprietary, in addition, application-specific or general-purpose.
    Most often, proprietary middleware is application-specific while general-purpose
    middleware is based on open standards [28]. The context and semantic discovery
    layer (the fourth layer in Figure 5) is responsible for managing context and semantic
    discoverers including context and semantics generating, configuring, and storing.
    The processing and reasoning layer (the fifth layer in Figure 5) is responsible
    for processing the extracted information from the middleware then according to
    the application’s type it will make decisions. In this layer, there are various
    techniques of information processing applied to fuse, extract, contextualize.
    massive data into useful actionable knowledge. In this layer, two phases should
    be identified: context consumer and context producer of the middleware. In the
    context consumer phase, the data processing techniques are applied on the data
    produced by the middleware; while in context producer phase the process of decision-making
    is implemented to supply the service layer with valuable knowledge. while in the
    second stage, further context information can be provided to the middleware for
    registration in the ontology context. Specific services and applications are abstracted
    in the application layer (the top-most layer in Figure 5). This layer presents
    a framework with direct access to the underlying functionalities to serve in the
    implementation of various types of applications. Moreover, control panels should
    be installed in the building to control the automated indoor spaces and to support
    a local human-machine interface. For instance, in a multi-story building, each
    floor could have a control panel to automate the operations, such as control opening
    the windows, control of air conditioning to achieve the desired temperature, control
    close/open the blinds according to the preferred light intensity before using
    artificial lighting [32], [33]. Summary: Still there is no single standard definition
    for SBs. In this section, we reviewed many definitions for SBs by many institutes,
    counties, regions and different disciplines; each has their own definition for
    SBs. We presented the layered architectural pattern for adapting services in an
    SB environment. We wanted to provide a general design for adapting actions according
    to the different versions of context in SBs. This architecture may be used in
    different smart environments such as intelligent transport systems, security,
    health assistance, and SBs among others. We layered the architecture into six
    layers starting from the sensing layer, which includes various types of sensors
    that are installed to collect environmental information in SBs. While network
    layer providing data stream support and data flow control and ensuring that messages
    arrive reliably by using data transport protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet
    etc. Data Acquisition layer to collect the data from the heterogeneous sources
    of data. Context and semantic discovery layer to generate, configure, and store
    context and semantic information. Context processing and reasoning layer to process
    the information and extract the knowledge that making the decisions according
    to the application context. And the last layer which is application layer such
    as health assistance and elderly home care, comfort and entertainment services,
    security, tele-management, smart watering, energy efficiency, etc. After discussing
    the main components of commercial and residential buildings, we have now set the
    stage for a detailed discussion on the components of SBs in the next section.
    SECTION III. Smart Building Components Advances in smart building technology have
    driven to the extensive development of SBs to generate economic and environmental
    benefits for building owners through the convergence of IT and building automation
    systems. Figure 6 shows the key components of SB systems, these include extensive
    sensors and actuators systems, networking and communication systems, software
    platform system, HVAC system, and smart control devices. FIGURE 6. Components
    of smart buildings. Show All Current systems utilize control devices and smart
    sensors that are connected to a central system. These control devices and smart
    sensors are placed throughout the environment. Each particular system has its
    own collection of networking and communication systems that enable it to communicate
    with the central system. SBs are performing connected networks that serve as a
    communication backbone for multiple systems. In many ways, HVAC equipment is the
    most complicated building system, with numerous components arranged to produce
    heating, cooling, and ventilation. The functionality of HVAC system not only makes
    the building healthy and comfortable for its inhabitants, but it also manages
    a big part of the energy consumed, as well as plays a significant role in life
    safety. SBs adopt technology to monitor and control facility systems and perform
    any required modifications. The objective of an SB is to utilize computers and
    software to control lighting, alarm systems, HVAC, and other systems through a
    single computer interface. A. Sensors and Actuators for SBs Sensors and actuators
    are mechanical components that measure and control the environmental values of
    their environment. Sensors collect information from the environment and make it
    ready for the system. For instance, IR sensors can be utilized for human presence
    detection in a room. While actuator is a device to convert an electrical control
    signal to a physical action, such that it takes decisions and then performs proper
    actions according to the environment, which enables automated and remote interaction
    with the environment.For example, a light actuator is capable of switching on/off,
    dimming one or more electric lights [34]. The rapid development of micromechanics,
    microelectronics, integrated optics, and other related technologies has facilitated
    the development of different types of smart sensors integrated into daily objects
    and infrastructure at smart building environment or worn by the users, and are
    connected by network technologies in order to collect contextual information about
    daily living activities more efficiently and faster, with lower energy consumption
    and less processing resources. Environmental sensors are utilized for detecting
    the human activity of a specific object that performed in specific locations in
    the building, while wearable sensors are utilized for controlling and observing
    mobile activities and physiological signals [35]. 1) Environmental Sensors It
    is found that data collected from environmental sensors can form important information
    to monitor human behaviors within an SB. These sensory data are then analyzed
    to identify and observe basic and instrumental daily living activities made by
    occupants such as bathing, dressing, preparing a meal, taking medication etc.
    The environmental sensing is generally based on several simple binary sensors
    in every part of the home, RFID technology, and video cameras. This variety of
    sensing may implement important insight into contexts and actual activities although
    it might come with possible costs such as complexity. Motion sensors are utilized
    for detecting the occupant’s presence and location everywhere in the house. There
    are different types of motion sensors. IR presence sensor is one of the most utilized
    kind of motion sensors in SBs to detect occupants’ presence. Pressure sensors
    can be attached to the objects such as beds, chairs, sofas, and floors in order
    to track the actions and locations of the occupants. While Contact switches are
    usually placed on the doors of fridge, rooms, or cabinets to detect the actions
    that the occupant makes with these objects [36]. Light sensors, humidity sensors,
    temperature sensors, or power sensors are other types of sensors that are deployed
    and utilized in SB to recognize the activities. Light sensors are utilized to
    measure the light intensity in a particular room in the building. Humidity sensors
    are utilized to detect the air humidity of a specific location in the building.
    Temperature sensors are utilized to measure the temperature of the specific environment.
    while the power sensors are utilized to identify the power usage of electric devices.
    2) Wearable Sensors and Biosensors These sensors are attached directly or indirectly
    to the user body. Their small size enables these sensors to be attached to clothes,
    wristwatches, glasses, belts, shoes etc. These sensors can be categorized into
    inertial sensors and vital sign sensors (or biosensors). Wearable inertial sensors
    are highly transportable and no stationary units that can give accurately detailed
    features of occupant’s action and body posture. Those sensors are composed of
    accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetic sensors. There is a need for receivers
    and cameras in the process of data collection, therefore can be used outside laboratory
    circumstances [37]. Wearable biosensors such as blood pressure, skin temperature,
    and heart rate are significant for collecting vital signs to monitor the health.
    The most commonly utilized inertial sensors for mobile activity monitoring are
    accelerometers and gyroscopes. Accelerometers can be utilized to measure the rate
    of acceleration accompanying a sensitive axis, they are useful to monitor the
    motion’s activities such as doing exercise, standing, sitting, walking, or walking
    upstairs and downstairs. While the gyroscopes can be utilized to measure angular
    velocity and maintain orientation. Some examples of primary vital signs are Electrocardiogram
    (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and respiratory
    rate. There are various vital sign sensor utilized to measure different vital
    signals such as Electroencephalography sensors (EEG) for observing electrical
    brain activity, Electrooculography sensors (EOG) for observing eye movement in
    ocular activity, Electromyography sensors (EMG) for observing muscle activity.
    Electrocardiography sensors (ECG) for observing cardiac activity, pressure sensors
    for observing blood pressure, CO2 gas sensors for observing respiration, thermal
    sensors for observing body temperature and galvanic skin response for observing
    skin sweating [38], [39]. 3) Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
    HVAC system plays an essential role in SB services. HVAC system plays a remarkable
    role in efficient energy consumption in SBs, as well as it offers new operating
    options to increase the occupants’ comfort. In addition to meeting the desired
    temperature, HVAC control systems are produced in order to sustain comfort within
    an enclosed space by producing a specific level of humidity, pressure, air motion,
    and air quality in an SB [40]. CO2, humidity and temperature levels in a building
    can affect occupant’s health and comfort; consequently measuring CO2, humidity,
    and temperature in this context can improve personal wellbeing [41]. Heating and
    cooling systems consume a huge amount of energy in the buildings, so it is necessary
    to optimize it utilizing smart controllers and sensors in order to save operational
    costs. Smart HVAC systems can sense and control efficiently different air quality
    parameters inside the building by utilizing distributed sensors and VAV fans throughout
    the building to perform an optimal ventilation [42]. Most of the current HVAC
    actuation systems in smart buildings are based on the data collected about the
    occupants using sensors and cameras, which are utilized specifically for HVAC
    systems. Certainly, There is a specific cost for the design, maintenance, setup
    and hardware of the data collection network [43]. Table 3 shows a summary for
    different types of smart sensors in the SBs. TABLE 3 Various Smart Sensors Useful
    in the Context of SBs B. Smart Control Devices Smart control devices collect data
    from a variety of sensors, process this data, and activate actuators to react
    to the events detected by the sensors. A smart control device can operate independently,
    without control by a central server. But there might be a needed communication
    amongst various control devices or they can connect with each other using the
    smart gateway. WeMo [44] is a Wi-Fi enabled switch utilized to turn electronic
    devices on/off from anywhere. It can control LED motion sensors, light bulbs,
    mart wall switches and plugs, and lighting devices, all from the smartphone app
    or browser. There is no hub needed for WeMo devices, everything can be managed
    through the free cloud service provided by Belkin. You can use the specific channel
    to connect the device to e-services such as Gmail to trigger specific actions.
    WeMo devices also support context-aware feature, it turns on/off automatically
    according to the time of day, whether it is sunrise or sunset etc. The Nest thermostat
    [45], a smart device developed by Nest—which has been acquired by Google—adjusts
    to your life and seasons change automatically. Just use it for a week and it programs
    itself. It learns about the level of temperatures that the occupants prefer and
    creates a context-aware personalized schedule. The smart thermostat turns to an
    energy-efficient mode automatically when the residents leave the building. It
    could start warming up the area when it senses activity, such as an occupant’s
    returning back home from work. The Nest Thermostat is controllable via a smartphone
    and an installed app. If you are away for a while, this device has also a capability
    to sustain a particular temperature in your house. Lockitron [46] is a door lock
    that can control the door remotely over the Internet to open and close it by phone.
    Lockitron app can be installed and used by any iOS or Android smartphone. Homeowners
    can directly grant family and friends the access to open a given door by providing
    authorization over the Internet. Lockitron can also utilize Bluetooth low energy
    technology, which means that it will keep controlling even in the event of Internet
    or power outages. Lockitron can also connect to the Internet with Bridge, through
    which occupants can control the bolt anywhere in the world. The SmartThings [47]
    SB automation system comprised of a communications smart hub, that supports various
    smart appliances and devices; the smart hub supports various technologies and
    protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, as well as IP-accessible devices and lets you
    control appliances using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. SmartThings provides
    kits that include smart plugs, in addition, the basic sensors that can be utilized
    to measure temperature, as well as to detect presence, motion, orientation, and
    vibration. SmartThings also includes an open platform that enables smart device
    vendors and third-party software to provide hardware and software that can be
    utilized alongside the platform. Philips Hue [48] is a combination of LED lighting
    with mobile technology. An accompanying mobile app that allows you to control
    lighting systems and changing color sets depending on your mood utilizing Wi-Fi
    technology. The new Philips Hue bridge supports the required authentication to
    enable Apple HomeKit technology to control and enable your Philips Hue to connect
    to other HomeKit enabled accessories and take control of your home. Blufitbottle
    [49] this bottle records the drinking habits of the users and sends them notifications
    about the time and amount of the water that they are supposed to drink to keep
    them healthy and hydrated. The app collects data about users such as their weight
    and age, plus other factors such as the current levels of temperature and humidity
    to estimate the amount of the needed water to keep them hydrated. When the user
    falls behind with hydration, an alert sounds, as well as a simple glance from
    the LEDs, will indicate when it’s time for the next drink. Canary [50] is an all-in-one
    home security system that comprises a set of sensors such as temperature, air
    quality, sound, motion vibration, in addition, an HD video camera in one unit.
    The system utilizes ML algorithms to let the users know what is happening at home
    and take action by sending notifications to your phone if something happens. Those
    ML models learn over time and send the users smarter notifications as it detects
    motion. So that, the longer you have the system, the more effective it becomes.
    Canary is able to decrease the rate of false alarms by learning the user behavior
    and the ambient noise level and the home temperature patterns. Amazon Echo [51]
    is a small cylinder enable the users to control anything in the home via the voice.
    Amazon Echo has a powerful voice recognition capability, the user does not have
    to worry about the complexities of their voice. Amazon Echo is connectable via
    Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, the users can send voice commands to control the speakers
    as well as other compatible devices such as Belkin’s WeMo and Philips Hue. It
    can also use Amazon cloud Lambda service to send commands. To send any command
    It requires to include the name of the program, for instance, “Alexa, turn on
    TV”. It also includes a network to distant servers, which slows down the response
    time. Honeywell Total Connect Remote Services [52] this device merges personal
    smart home automation with security monitoring task. It enables the occupants
    to control and monitor everything in the home from lighting and window shades
    systems to security cameras and smoke alarms. the user can utilize a smartphone
    app or desktop-mounted hardware console for controlling and monitoring. It can
    provide real-time alerts, GPS vehicle and asset tracking, video viewing, and mobile
    control. The system only supports Z-Wave devices, it needs to be installed by
    an authorized Honeywell dealer. It does not work with Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostats.
    In addition, the Honeywell provides security cameras and sensors, it also supports
    other smart devices from third parties, such as Yale locks and Lutron lighting.
    Table 4 shows a comparison among various smart control devices in the SBs. TABLE
    4 Comparison Among Various Smart Control Devices in SB C. Networking and Home
    Gateway An SB combines a communication network in order to control smart devices
    and services within the building. The communication network of a smart building
    can be based on diverse communication media such as twisted pair cable, as the
    traditional computer networks. The networking in building automation system has
    a tendency to utilize a heterogeneous network that is made up of diverse communication
    media and network standards. The building automation network is identified by
    physical technology and communication protocols. There is an internal network
    that connects devices inside the building, as well as the external networks, can
    be integrated separately. Public Internet, ISDN, and mobile phone networks are
    some examples of external networks [28], [53]. A typical SB may comprise a number
    of different components, such as sensors, actuators, communication and processing
    devices. Because of their nature, these components have limited capabilities and
    computational capacity in term of battery capacity and capability of data processing.
    To deal with this issue, most of the SB systems have been utilized as a central
    gateway to collect, process, and analyze context data from different sensors and
    actuators in the building. Several protocols such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    and Z-wave can be utilized for communicating the gateway. The home gateway can
    also collect and store data for a specific time period. Typically, these gateways
    can connect to the cloud services and perform data processing and reasoning tasks.
    The centralized gateway usually does not have any interface. They can be controlled
    and managed utilizing smartphones, tablets, or computers [54], [55]. In general,
    depending on the communication media used, SB network technology can be classified
    by interconnection method into three main types: Powerline, Busline, and Wireless
    [15], [56], which we describe next. 1) Powerline Communication (PLC) PLC method
    reuses the building electrical network; such that devices, appliances, and services
    are directly connected to the main power supply utilizing the already available
    electrical outlets in a building. The data is sent through the normal cable system
    to activate or deactivate the devices in the building. PLC system is historically
    the oldest technology in SB and is generally cheap but less reliable and scalable
    [3]. Originally, the application of PLC was mainly to secure the typical operation
    of the electric power supply system in case of failures or breakdowns through
    the direct exchange of information between the distribution center, and power
    plant. Therefore, this approach has become a competitive choice for SB networking,
    benefiting from availability, robustness, and ready connectivity of this method.
    Some of the protocols of this method offer a single-way communication, which enables
    the device to only receive information but not to communicate. There are different
    mainstream protocols of PLC method such as X-10, INSTEON, HomePlug, BACnet, and
    Lonworks. 2) Busline Busline systems in SBs networks use a separate physical media,
    usually twisted-pair cabling similar to the physical cables utilized for network
    services for transporting electrical signals. This type of systems is pleasant
    the building’s occupants, albeit the configuration process is complex, and it
    requires some knowledge of networking. Although the configuring complexity and
    installation cost of this system, the use of a separate cable could present a
    positive note about this approach, as it allows this method of networking to provide
    higher bandwidth, and to make it the most reliable of the three approaches. In
    addition, this technology usually supports a completed two-way communication protocol
    that enables the appliances to easily communicate with each other [57]. Some of
    the protocols in Busline technology are Konnex (KNX), CAN (Controller Area Network),
    Modbus, Meter-Bus (M-Bus). 3) Wireless Interconnection Many of the new SB applications
    use wireless technologies such as infrared and radio frequency, which are more
    convenient for users due to their untethered nature and the elimination of cables.
    The devices within the smart building can communicate wirelessly as radio wave
    can penetrate through floors, cabinets, and walls [56]. Because of the complexity
    and cost of potential modifications and of the re-wiring process in a smart building,
    several different wireless technologies are rising to produce flexible networking
    patterns convenient to occupants without taking to consider the physical wiring
    and deployment of such wire in the building. Typically, there are various protocols
    for the wireless system such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WLAN, Z-wave, RFID etc., which
    essentially work in the industrial scientific medical bands, particularly in the
    2.4GHz frequency range. These wireless technologies are usually related to some
    control network concept in an SB such as low power consumption, high cost-effectiveness,
    low speed, flexibility in networking, deployment as well as building coverage
    [3]. The gateway is the central server of an SB that is commonly used in IoT solutions.
    The services provided by the gateway essentially concern to system management
    functionalities such as monitoring, controlling, and configuring the systems and
    their devices. It also supports some processing and data storage capabilities
    required for complex applications. D. Software Platform For a building to be “smart,”
    it is important that all the appliances and systems in the building communicate
    and exchange data securely with each other as well as with smartphones, tablets,
    and servers in the cloud. Software platforms play a critical role in exchanging,
    archiving and disseminating information through different protocols. These platforms
    use push, pull, publish/subscribe, etc. The goal of the joint commercial enterprises
    is to develop an open source software platform in order to make the process of
    data exchanging easier between the devices of different manufacturers. Therefore,
    the users will not have to worry in the future about the compatibility issues
    when utilizing electric and electronic devices of different manufacturers at home.
    In addition, the new platform can also offer a variety of different building services
    such as entertainment, energy efficiency, and security technology. Hence, this
    will enable creating different apps for these areas of use [58]. ABB, Robert Bosch
    GmbH, and Cisco Systems Inc. established an open-software platform called Mozaiq
    Operations GmbH [59] to unify smart building technology and offer interoperability
    across for all devices and services in the building, to simplify the experience
    for residents. It will enable users to seamlessly and intuitively customize their
    appliances and devices, regardless of manufacturers and brands of these devices,
    in order to improve energy efficiency and achieve a unique level of control and
    comfort. For instance, the user can close the blinds in the home either by a click
    from a smartphone or through a pre-set instruction; and switch off automatically
    all screen devices for the children to go outside to play. In a smart building,
    many devices and appliances can simply and securely share information with one
    another and with smartphones and other smart devices; and the Internet in general.
    Indigo Domotics [60] is to implement the do-it-yourself smart building platform.
    Indigo home automation software controllers available for the Mac OS enables residents
    to combine an array of common INSTEON, Z-Wave and X10 devices for unparalleled
    control of your building lighting, sensors, thermostats, and appliances. With
    Indigo Touch (sold through iTunes app store, iOS only), users will easily achieve
    remote control of their appliances utilizing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. They
    also can use a web browser on any device to control their appliances virtually
    anywhere in the world. The users can receive texts or emails about specific events
    has been detected for doors opening/closing, power failures etc. Indigo, from
    Perceptive Automation, is the newest home automation software for the Mac. OpenHAB
    [61] is an open-source software platform that follows a middleware approach for
    integrating different technologies in smart building systems into a single solution.
    OpenHAB platform address a variety of network technologies and appliances in the
    area of a smart building. Currently, the dependency on a particular vendor becomes
    a problem due to the lack of a common language that bridges the different devices
    with building automation system. The main goal of the OpenHAB platform is to integrate
    the new devices and technologies in a smart building system through a community-based
    approach. OpenHAB utilizes an OSGi based modular system for communicating between
    different technologies and devices. Bindings can be developed and deployed as
    an OSGi bundle to bridge a particular technology and device. There are different
    supported technologies exist such as EnOcean, KNX, Z-Wave, and others are supported
    through special bindings [62]. SmartThings [47] this platform composed of hardware
    devices, sensors, and software applications. Context information is collected
    from the sensors, this context is contributed to the reasoning and action that
    are performed by the application. For instance, the sprinkler in the garden can
    detect the rain, and switch itself off accordingly to save water. SmartThings
    kit comprises sensors, smart devices, and hub. While the SmartThings application
    is configured to enable users to control and monitor their building environment
    through a smartphone device. The SmartThings Hub works to connect the sensors,
    devices and building’s internet router to one another and to the cloud. It is
    compatible with different communication protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, and
    IP-accessible devices. In addition, the SmartThings is compatible with other sensors
    and devices such as thermostats, moisture sensors, motion sensors, presence sensors,
    locks and garage door openers [63]. HomeOS [64] is Microsoft’s home operating
    system platform, that can be installed on a personal computer. It is an open platform
    that is not limited to Windows-based devices [65], [66]. with HomeOS platform,
    applications can be installed to maintain various context-aware functionalities,
    for example, taking an image by a door camera and sending it to the occupant when
    someone rings the doorbell. HomeOS provides a PC-like abstraction that manages
    and extends the technology of network devices to the users and developers in the
    smart building environment. Its design enables the users to map their protocol-independent
    services to support the applications with simple APIs, a kernel, and protocols
    of specific devices. HomeOS usually runs on an allocated computer such as a home
    gateway, it does not need any adjustments to commodity devices. HomeOS usually
    utilizes (i) Datalog-based access control to facilitate the process of managing
    technology in the smart home (ii) a kernel to incorporate the devices and applications
    and (iii) protocol-independent services to allow the developers manageable access
    to the devices. Lab of Things (LoT) [67], [68] is an experimental research platform
    that utilizes connected devices in the buildings. LoT offers a framework that
    provides deployment capabilities such as remote monitoring and updating of system
    health, and logging data collected from different appliances in cloud storage.
    It enables data sharing and collecting, sharing codes, connect hardware sensors
    to the software platform, and participants using HomeOS. The platform is designed
    to make it simple to design solutions that can be deployed in IoT based smart
    services such as healthcare, energy management services as it works in combination
    with HomeOS. Eclipse Smarthome [69] is a framework that has a focus on heterogeneous
    environments such as smart building and ambient assisted living. This platform
    takes to consider a variety of existing communication mechanisms. Eclipse SmartHome
    works as an abstraction and translation framework that enables communications
    across system and protocol boundaries. It provides many relevant implemented extensions,
    protocols, and standards that are significant for smart building services. Those
    implementations can be of Java library or an OSGi bundle shapes so that they can
    be utilized independently from the rest of the project. The framework can work
    on different embedded devices such as a BeagleBone Black, an Intel Edison, or
    a Raspberry Pi. Extensions of Eclipse SmartHome are compatible with the solutions
    provided by different vendors. This means your code that is written for a specific
    purpose can be extended easily on commercial platforms. Eclipse SmartHome offers
    a variety of characteristics to allow you to design a special Smart Home solution
    for your expectations [70]. Apart from discussing various SB solutions, we will
    also highlight the popular simulator called Cooja is used widely by the research
    community to produce small simulations for relatively large wireless networks
    of embedding sensors and actuators; and connected devices, in order to develop,
    debug and evaluate systems based on the wireless sensor network technology. Cooja
    simulator is a Java-based wireless sensor network simulator. It is distributed
    with Contiki OS project. Cooja enables the emulation of the set of sensor nodes,
    in addition, it can simulate physical and application layers of the system [71].
    There are three basic properties for the simulated node in Cooja: Its hardware
    peripherals, node type, and data memory. The node type can be shared among multiple
    nodes and defines properties that are common to all these nodes [72]. Summary:
    The field of SBs contains a variety of technologies, across commercial, industrial,
    institutional and domestic buildings, including building controls and energy management
    systems. Several organizations and institutions are working to supply buildings
    with technology that enables the residents to adopt a single device to control
    all electronic devices and appliances. In this section, we discussed the various
    components for SBs including sensors and actuators, smart control devices, smart
    gateway, networking and software platforms. SECTION IV. Ml Background for SBS:
    Models, Tasks, and Tools Massive data generated from sensors, wearable devices,
    and other IoT technologies provide rich information about the context of users
    and building status and can be used to design SB management. This context information
    is needed to extract useful and interesting insights for various stakeholders.
    When the data volume is very high, developing predictive models using traditional
    approaches does not provide accurate insight and we require newly developed tools
    from big data. Big data is primed to make a big impact in SBs and is already playing
    a big role in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries
    [73], notably for waste analytics [74] and waste minimization [75]. ML is a powerful
    tool that facilitates the process of mining a massive amount of data that have
    been collected from different sources around us and make sense of a complicated
    world. ML algorithms apply a model on new data by learning the model from a set
    of observed data examples called a training set. For example, after being trained
    on a set of sample accelerometer data marked as walking or jogging, an ML algorithm
    can classify the future data points into walking and jogging classes. ML makes
    it relatively easy to develop advanced software systems without much involvement
    from the human side. They are applicable to many real-life problems in SB environments.
    One can also design and develop self-learning and collaborative systems. ML does
    not remove the human element from data science—it draws on computers’ strengths
    in handling big data to complement our understanding of semantics and context.
    It only needs training data to extract better features or parameters required
    to improve a given system. ML algorithms can be used to make predictions based
    on data patterns. It enables the computer to learn from the fed input data without
    being explicitly programmed so that ML algorithms can learn from and make predictions
    on input data [76], [77]. Nest thermostat is an example of a device that applies
    a specific temperature in a specific room and at a certain time of day according
    to the occupants’ preference. There are devices such as Amazon’s Echo that can
    learn from voice patterns, and the others those learn from much more complex behavior
    and activity patterns. A. Ml Models ML techniques have been widely used to develop
    smart systems which can sense and react according to context modifications in
    SBs [78]. There are many different ML algorithms, according to the two well-known
    theorems No Free Lunch theorem and Ugly Duckling theorem. No Free Lunch theorem
    states “there are no algorithms that can be said to be better than any other”,
    without prior information about the problem, any two algorithms may perform equally
    well in solving a problem. While Ugly Duckling theorem states “we cannot say that
    any two different patterns would be more similar to each other than any other
    pairs.” [79]. Mainly, ML is categorized into four categories handling different
    types of learning tasks as follows: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
    semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms Figure 7 shows
    ML styles. These categories are described next and a summarized comparison between
    these ML techniques is presented in Table 5. TABLE 5 Comparison of ML Techniques
    FIGURE 7. ML styles. Show All 1) Supervised Learning refers to developing algorithms
    based on a labeled training dataset, from which the learner should generalize
    a representation by building the system model that represents the relations between
    the input, output and system parameters. ML model is developed through a training
    process that continues on the input training data until the model reaches the
    desired level of accuracy [80], [81]. Some examples of common supervised ML algorithms
    are: naive Bayes model, decision tree, linear discriminant functions such as support
    vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), hidden Markov models
    (HMMs), instance-based learning (such as k-nearest-neighbor learning), ensembles
    (bagging, boosting, random forest), logistic regression, genetic algorithms, and
    logistic regression [82], [83]. Supervised learning approaches are extensively
    used to solve different problems in smart buildings. Application in SBs: Boger
    et al. [76] proposed a supervised learning system using Markov decision processes
    to help people with dementia the process of hand washing. Altun et al. [84] make
    a comparative study on the supervised human activity classification approaches
    using body-worn miniature inertial and magnetic sensors. Mozer [85] developed
    the occupant comfort control of the home environment system using neural networks
    and reinforcement learning to control air heating, lighting, ventilation, and
    water heating in the smart home environment. Bourobou et al. [86] presented a
    hybrid approach using ANN and K-pattern clustering to identify and predict user
    activities in the smart environments. Hsu et al. [87] proposed a TV recommendation
    system using a neural network model based on user personalized properties such
    as activities, interests, moods, experiences, and demographic information data.
    Fleury et al. [88] proposed a healthcare-focused smart home system using the SVM
    algorithm to classify daily living activities based on the data from the different
    sensors. Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into classification,
    regression, time series, and ensemble method problems. a: Classification The task
    of classification algorithms is to classify an instance into a specific discrete
    set of possible categories. Given two sets of data (labeled and unlabeled datasets),
    the labeled dataset is used for the training process, while the unlabeled dataset
    will be used to evaluate of the classification results. The normal process is
    to count the number of instances that are assigned to the right category, which
    is also known as the accuracy rate (AR) defined by [21]. The classification algorithm
    can mathematically be described as follows: AR= N c N t (1) View Source where
    N c denotes the number of test instances that are correctly assigned to their
    categories to which they belong; N t the number of test instances. The precision
    ( P ) and recall ( R ) are used to measure the details of the classification results.
    The four possible outcomes are true positive ( TP ), false negative ( FN ), false
    positive ( FP ), and true negative ( TN ), the precision ( P ) and recall ( R
    ) are generally defined as: P= TP TP+FP (2) View Source Given P and R , a simple
    method to describe the precision and recall of the overall classification results,
    called F-score or F-measure, is defined as: F= 2PR P+R (3) View Source Commonly
    used classification techniques include decision trees, SVM, rule-based induction,
    neural networks, deep learning, memory-based reasoning, and Bayesian networks
    [89]. b: Decision Tree Algorithms The decision tree method is an important predictive
    ML modeling approach, which constructs a model of decisions presented based on
    the actual values of features in the data. Decision trees can be utilized for
    both classification and regression problems. In tree structures, leaves represent
    class labels and branches represent conjunctions of attributes that drive to those
    labels [90]. The decision trees that the target variable takes continuous values
    called regression trees. Decision trees are often one of the favorites of ML algorithms
    because of its speed and accuracy. The most common algorithms for decision tree
    are [91]: classification and regression tree, ID3, C4.5 and C5.0, Chi-squared,
    M5, and conditional decision trees. Application in SBs: Delgado et al. [92] propose
    an ML technique based on decision trees to extract the most frequent activities
    of human behavior and the temporal relationship of those activities in order to
    produce the human behavior quickly in a smart environment. Viswanathan et al.
    [93] introduce a prototype distributed data mining system for healthcare environment
    using C4.5 classification algorithm that can provide the patient monitoring and
    health services. Decision trees algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm that is
    easy to interpret and explain. The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that
    it can easily overfit. c: Bayesian Algorithms Bayesian methods utilize Bayes’
    theorem for classification and regression problems. The most common Bayesian algorithms
    are [94]: Naive Bayes, Gaussian naive Bayes, Bayesian belief network, Bayesian
    network. Application in SBs: Parnandi et al. [95] propose an indoor localization
    approach based on Naive Bayes classification and dynamic time warping, they exploit
    the embedded sensors of smartphones to determine the building that the user entered
    and the activities that the user is performing inside the building. Verbert et
    al. [96] proposed an ML approach based on Bayesian network to diagnosis the fault
    in HVAC systems. The model has been constructed based expert knowledge concerning
    conservation laws, component interdependencies, and historical data using virtual
    sensors. Naive Bayes classifier approaches have been applied with potential results
    for human activity recognition in [97], [98]. Naive Bayes approach recognizes
    human activities that identify with the highest probability to the set of sensor
    readings that were observed. d: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML
    algorithm which can be applied for both classification and regression problems
    though mostly used in classification challenges [140]. SVM is one of the most
    popularly utilized for many statistical learning problems, such as face and object
    recognition, text classification, spam detections, handwriting analysis etc. [141].
    is maximizing the margin that separating between the hyperplane of two classes’
    closest points. Support vectors are the points lying on the boundaries, and the
    optimal separating hyperplane is the middle of the margin [142]. Application in
    SBs: Fu et al. [105] proposed an SVM method to predict the system level electricity
    loads of public buildings that have electricity sub-metering systems. A real-time
    human tracker system proposed Nguyen et al. [106] using SVM for predicting and
    recognizing human motion based on the input images from a network of four cameras
    in the ubiquitous smart homes. Petersen et al. [107] developed an SVM model to
    predict the times where visitors are present in the home using only the data provided
    by wireless motion sensors in each room. Fleury et al. [88] presented a study
    for automatic recognition of daily living activities in a smart home based on
    SVM. They collected the data from various sensors such as Infra-Red Presence Sensors,
    door contacts, temperature and hygrometry sensor, and microphones. Das et al.
    [108] proposed a one-class classification approach for a real-time activity error
    detection in smart homes using one-class SVM. Zhao et al. [143] proposed an ML
    approach based on SVM and RNN to detect the occupancy behavior of a building through
    the temperature and heating source information for the energy efficiency consumption
    purposes. e: Artificial Neural Network Algorithms (ANNs) ANN models are inspired
    by the process of biological neural networks. ANN models are commonly utilized
    for regression and classification problems. The common ANN algorithms are [94]:
    Perceptron, Back-Propagation, Hopfield Network, and Radial Basis Function Network
    (RBFN). ANNs provide a number of advantages including it requires less statistical
    training, it has the capacity to detect complex nonlinear relationships between
    the predictor and response variables, as well as the ability to detect all possible
    relationships between predictor variables [104]. On the other hand, disadvantages
    include its “black box” nature, heavy computational burden and proneness to overfitting.
    However, due to the inherent features of neural networks, it has the following
    main limitations: challenge in training with no local optima, its accommodation
    to modifications in the behavior, the validation process of the results, and the
    complexity of network performance interpretation. Application in SBs: Badlani
    and Bhanot [99] developed a smart home system for energy efficiency applying pattern
    recognition based on ANNs, the system incorporates an RNN to capture human behavior
    patterns and an ANN for security applications in smart homes. Other researchers
    have applied ANNs to present context-aware services. Campo et al. [100] developed
    a system that calculates the probability of occupation for each section of the
    building and compares the probability with the current situation systematically.
    See [101] for a survey paper focusing on the role of ANNs for smart home services.
    Ermes et al. [102] proposed a hybrid classifier approach using a tree structure
    comprising a priori knowledge and ANN to recognize the activities such as rowing,
    biking, playing football, walking, running, sitting, or hiking. Ciabattoni et
    al. [103] proposed a home energy management system design using the neural network
    algorithm to predict the power production of the photovoltaic plant and the home
    consumptions during the given time. f: Deep Learning Algorithms: Deep learning
    methods represent an evolved form of ANNs in which a deep architecture (many layers
    comprising multiple linear and non-linear transformations [144]) is used. One
    of the promises of DL is replacing the manually selected features with efficient
    unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction
    algorithms. The most common DL algorithms are [145]: Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Deep Belief
    Network (DBN), and Stacked Auto-Encoders. Deep learning has been used successfully
    in varieties of big data analytics applications, particularly natural language
    processing (NLP) applications, medical diagnosis, stock market trading, network
    security, and image identification. Deep learning is now ubiquitously used in
    major businesses and companies. Microsoft research on a deep learning system presented
    real-time speech translation system between Mandarin Chinese and English languages
    [146]. Apple’s Siri uses a deep learning trained model, and the voice recognition
    in the Google Android phone also uses a deep learning trained model [147]. DL
    utilizes a number of techniques such as drop-out and convolutions that enables
    the models to learn efficiently from high-dimensional data. However, DL requires
    much more data to train compared to other algorithms because of the magnitudes
    of parameters for estimation required by the models. Application in SBs: Choi
    et al. [114] propose two prediction algorithms deep belief network and restricted
    Boltzmann machines based on the DL framework for predicting different human activities
    in a building. They also presented a hybrid model which combines for predicting
    human behavior. The paper [115] proposes a generic deep learning framework based
    on convolutional and RNNs for human activity recognition that is suitable for
    multimodal wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes or magnetic field
    sensors. Alsheikh et al. [116] proposed a hybrid approach of DL and hidden Markov
    model for human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers. Baccouche
    et al. [117] propose a two-steps neural-based deep model to classify human activities,
    the first step of the model is automatically learned spatiotemporal features based
    on Convolutional Neural Networks. Then the second step of the model uses an RNN
    to classify the entire sequence of the learned features for each time-step. In
    [118], they propose an acceleration-based human activity recognition method using
    Convolution Neural Network. In [119] a deep convolutional neural network as the
    automatic feature extractor and classifier for recognizing human activities is
    proposed using the accelerometer and gyroscope on a smartphone. Hammerla et al.
    [148] explore the performance of deep, convolutional, and recurrent approaches
    of deep learning for human activity recognition using wearable sensors. For the
    sake of measuring the performance, the authors used three representative datasets
    that comprise motion data collected from wearable sensors. g: Hidden Markov Models
    (Hmm) An HMM is a doubly stochastic process with a hidden underlying stochastic
    process that can be observed through the sequence of observed symbols emitted
    by another stochastic process. Application in SBs: Wu et al. [113] proposed an
    improved HMM to predict user behaviors in order to provide services for people
    with disabilities. They developed a temporal state transition matrix to be utilized
    instead of the fixed state transition matrix. Lv and Nevatia [112] used hidden
    Markov models for both automatic recognition and segmentation of 3-D human activities
    to allow real-time evaluation and feedback for physical rehabilitation. Cheng
    et al. [110] proposed an inference engine based on the HMM that provides a comprehensive
    activity of daily living recognition capability. They integrated both Viterbi
    and Baum-Welch algorithms to enhance the accuracy and learning capability. Chahuara
    et al. [111] proposed sequence-based models for online recognition of daily living
    activities in an SB environment. They presented three of sequence-based models:
    HMM, conditional random fields, and a sequential Markov logic network. h: Time
    Series Analysis A time series is a collection of temporal instances; time series
    data set usually have the following characteristics include the high dimensionality,
    large number of instances, and updating continuously [149]. One of the important
    purposes for time series representation is to reduce the dimension, and it divides
    into three categories: model-based representation, non-data-adaptive representation,
    and data-adaptive representation [150], [151]. Application in SBs: Survadevara
    et al. [125] proposed a wellness model using seasonal autoregression integration
    moving average time series with sleeping activity scenario in a smart home environment
    to forecast the elderly sleeping tendency. Zhou et al. [126] proposed a time series
    analysis framework to explore relationships among non-stationary time series in
    the case of data sensors in SBs. Jakkula and Cook [127] propose a time series
    based framework to determine temporal rules from observed physical and instrumental
    activities of occupants in a smart home. i: Regression The aim in regression problems
    is to estimate a real-valued target function. It is related to representing the
    relationship between variables that are repeatedly processed utilizing a measure
    of error in the predictions made by the model [152]. The most common regression
    algorithms are [153]: linear regression, logistic regression, stepwise regression,
    and ordinary least squares regression. Application in SBs: Chen et al. [120] used
    the regression technique of orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to identify
    the physical and environmental parameters that providing the energy efficiency
    in an SB. Bouchard et al. [121] presented a gesture recognition system using linear
    regression combined with the correlation coefficient to recognize the gesture
    direction and estimate the segmentation of continuing gestures of daily usage
    activities in a smart environment. j: Ensemble Methods A combination of multiple
    classifiers often referred to as a classifier ensemble, group of classification
    models that are trained separately and the predictions of those models are then
    combined in a way to produce the overall prediction [154]. The most popular ensemble
    learning based classification techniques are [155]: random forest, boosting, gradient
    boosting machines, AdaBoost, bagging, and blending. Application in SBs: Jurek
    et al. [122] proposed a cluster-based ensemble approach solution for activity
    recognition within the application domain of smart homes. With this approach,
    activities are modeled as cluster collections built on different subsets of features.
    Fatima et al. [123] proposed an ensemble classifier method for activity recognition
    in smart homes using genetic algorithm optimization to merge the prediction output
    of multiple classifiers that make up the ensemble. They used the ANN, HMM, conditional
    random field, and SVM [13] as base classifiers for activity recognition. Guan
    and Ploetz [124] proposed a deep LSTM ensemble method for activity recognition
    using wearables: more specifically, the authors developed modified training procedures
    for LSTM networks and proposed the combination of sets of diverse LSTM learners
    into classifier collectives. 2) Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning refers
    to developing algorithms that use data with no labels to analyze the behavior
    or the system being investigated [156]. Thus, the algorithm does not know about
    the truth of the outcome. In other words, the unsupervised learning algorithm
    classifies the sample sets to different clusters by investigating the similarity
    between the input samples. Clustering is done using different parameters taken
    from the data which enable us to identify correlations which are not so obvious.
    The inferring structures existing within the input data is used to prepare the
    model to prepare and extract general rules of the model. A mathematical process
    might be used to systematically reduce redundancy, or organize data by similarity
    [129]. The unsupervised approach has been applied to recognize various activities
    in smart buildings when it is challenging to have labels for input data [130].
    Common unsupervised learning problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction,
    and association rule learning. There are a variety of commonly used unsupervised
    learning algorithms, some of those algorithms are based on supervised-learning
    algorithms: the Apriori algorithm and k-Means. In unsupervised learning, usually
    there is no a measure for the output; we recognize only the features and the target
    is to define the patterns and relationships among a set of input measures [80].
    The major disadvantage of unsupervised learning is the absence of direction for
    the learning algorithm, hence, there might not be any useful detected knowledge
    in the selected set of attributes for the training. Clustering is a method of
    unsupervised learning that involves detecting patterns in the data by placing
    each data element into a group of K-clusters, where each group holds data elements
    most similar to each other [157]. Unsupervised learning problems can be categorized
    into clustering and association problems, which are described next. a: Clustering
    A clustering problem explores the internal groupings in the input data, such as
    grouping customers by their purchasing habits. Clustering techniques are usually
    organized by modeling strategies such as centroid-based and hierarchical. All
    methods are concerned with handling the internal structures in the input data
    to properly organize the data into groups of maximum commonality [158]. The quality
    of the clustering result is evaluated depends on the type of application that
    utilizes a clustering algorithm. For example, the sum of squared errors is generally
    utilized for data clustering while the peak-signal-to-noise ratio is used for
    image clustering [21]. The most common clustering algorithms are [153]: k-Means,
    k-Medians, expectation maximization, and hierarchical clustering. Application
    in SBs: Fahad et al. [128] propose an activity recognition approach that combines
    the classification with the clustering, in their approach the activity instances
    are clustered using Lloyd’s clustering algorithm. Then, they apply evidence theoretic
    K-Nearest neighbors learning method that combines KNN with the Dampster Shafer
    theory of evidence. The paper [86] proposes a hybrid approach to recognize and
    predict user activities in a smart environment. They use the K-pattern clustering
    algorithm to classify so varied and complex user activities, and ANN to recognize
    and predict users’ activities inside their personal rooms. Lapalu et al. [82]
    used an unsupervised learning approach to address the issues of daily living activities’
    learning in smart home. They utilize the Flocking algorithm for clustering analysis
    of a use case in cognitive assistance service that assists the people suffering
    from some type of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. Aicha et al. [83] present
    an unsupervised learning approach for detecting abnormal visits of an elderly
    in a smart home environment based on a Markov modulated Poisson process model.
    The model combines multiple data streams, such as in the front-door sensor transitions
    and the general sensor transitions. The other cases of social communication services,
    Rashidi and Cook [129] applied an unsupervised learning approach to detect social
    interaction and monitor activity daily living in a smart space, their approach
    can adapt and update automatically to reflect the changes in discovered patterns
    from implicit and explicit identified feedbacks of the occupant. Rashidi et al.
    [130] introduce an unsupervised method that identifies and tracks the normal activities
    that commonly occur in an individual’s routine in a smart environment. The activity
    discovery method of the system is produced to cluster the sequences based on the
    simple k-means algorithm. Fiorini et al. [159] proposed an unsupervised ML approach
    to identify the behavioral patterns of the occupants using unannotated data collected
    from low-level sensors in an SB. Their approach involves processing and analyzing
    collected data related to the daily living activities of 17 older adults living
    in a community-based home supplied with a variety of sensors. They extract activity
    information from collected data at different times of the day. b: Association
    The association rule learning problem is utilized to identify the rules that define
    large portions of input data, such as people that buy X item also tend to buy
    Y item. Association analysis is performed on rules discovered by analyzing input
    data for frequent if/then statement and using the criteria of support and confidence
    to discover relationships between unrelated data in a relational database or another
    information repository. Here “support” indicates how frequently the items appear
    in the database while “confidence” indicates the number of times the if/then statements
    have been found to be true. Many algorithms for generating association rules have
    been proposed. Apriori algorithm is the most well-known association algorithm
    [160]. Application in SBs: Aztiria et al. [161] proposed system that learns the
    frequent patterns of human behavior using association, workflow mining, clustering,
    and classification techniques. The core part of the system is the learning layer
    which is made up of two modules: the language module, which provides a standard
    conceptualization of the patterns; and the algorithm module, which discovers the
    patterns. Kang et al. [162] proposed a service scenario generation scheme for
    interpreting association rules extracted from the states of all devices in SB
    environments. Typically, These states are collected periodically at a specific
    time interval from the devices. Nazerfard et al. [163] propose a framework to
    discover the temporal features of the activities, including the temporal sequencing
    of activities and their start time and duration using the temporal association
    rule techniques in a smart home. 3) Semi-Supervised Learning Semi-Supervised learning
    lies between supervised and unsupervised methods. Input data is a composite of
    labeled and unlabeled samples. These hybrid algorithms aim to inherit the strengths
    of the main categories while mitigating their weaknesses. The model learns the
    patterns present in the data and also make predictions. Example problems are classification
    and regression [164]. There are some common semi-supervised learning models, including
    generative models, heuristic approaches, semi-supervised SVM, graph-based methods,
    self-training, help-training, mixture models, co-training and multi-view learning
    [94]. Application in SBs: Cook [131] combined fully-supervised and semi-supervised
    learning to recognize and follow activities that support health monitoring and
    assistance context-aware services for people experiencing difficulties living
    individually at smart homes. Liu et al. [132] proposed a vision based semi-supervised
    learning approach for fall detection and recognizing other activity daily living
    in smart environments to overcome the labeling challenges of human activities
    by systematic interpreting the activities with the highest confidence. Fahmi et
    al. [133] proposed a semi-supervised fall detection approach in which a supervised
    algorithm utilizing decision trees in the training process and then profiles are
    used to implement a semi-supervised algorithm based on multiple thresholds. Radu
    et al. [134] present semi-supervised ML method using only the low power sensors
    on a smartphone to consider the problem of determining whether a user is indoors
    or outdoors. Guan et al. [135] propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm for
    activity recognition named En-Co-training to make use of the available unlabeled
    samples to enhance the performance of activity learning with a limited number
    of labeled samples. The proposed algorithm extends the co-training paradigm by
    using an ensemble method. 4) Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is
    a learning approach to control a system in order to maximize performance measure
    that represents a long-term objective [165]. Reinforcement learning, an area of
    ML inspired by behaviorist psychology, is concerned with the way that software
    agents have to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the concept
    of cumulative reward. RL algorithms learn control policies, particularly when
    there is no a priori knowledge and there is a massive amount of training data.
    However, RL algorithms suffer from some drawback such as the high computational
    cost required to find the optimal solution, such that all states need to be visited
    to choose the optimal one. The well-known approaches of RL are Brute force, Monte
    Carlo methods, Temporal difference methods, and Value function [166]. Q-learning
    [167] is a model-free reinforcement learning approach based on learning the required
    utility given a state decision. Application in SBs: Mozer [136] applied Q-learning
    for lighting regulation to predict the time of turning the lights ON/OFF in a
    building. This prediction model can be utilized to schedule the lights’ activations
    in a building for efficient energy consumption proposes. Li and Jayaweera [137]
    proposed a Q-learning based approximate dynamic programming algorithm to provide
    a more efficient, flexible and adaptive method. This approach can enable customers
    to make an optimal on-line decision making in SB environment to maximize the profits
    based on both local fully observable and the estimated hidden information of the
    building. Khalili and Aghajan [138] proposed a temporal differential class of
    RL method for autonomous learning of a user’s preference of music and lighting
    service settings in presence of different states of the user in SB environment.
    The preferences are learned by the model by using the explicit or implicit feedback
    from users when they react to the provided service. Xu et al. [139] give a survey
    of developments in RL algorithms with function approximation. They evaluated and
    compared different RL algorithms using several benchmark learning, prediction,
    and learning control tasks. B. ML Tasks for SBS In this section, we will describe
    the major ML tasks that are relevant to SB. The reader is referred to Figure 8
    for a general depiction of ML tasks in SBs and the steps taken to implement ML
    in an SB environment. FIGURE 8. ML tasks in SB environment. Show All 1) Data Collection
    and Acquisition A variety of data collection approaches are used, each of which
    has different deals in terms of capabilities, energy efficiency, and connectivity.
    Sensors and similar objects in SBs produce raw data simultaneously in an automated
    way and such devices may store the data for a specific period of time or report
    it to controlled components [168]. Data can be collected at gateways; the collected
    data is then filtered and processed, fused into compact forms for efficient transmission.
    A variety of communication technologies such as Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and cellular are
    utilized to transfer data to collection points. Data collected from a global-scale
    deployment of smart things defines the basis for decision making and providing
    services. It is possible that the decisions are unreliable when the quality of
    utilized data is poor [169]. Zhao et al. [170] propose a data acquisition and
    transmission system which could be used for monitoring systems to collect energy
    consumption data (e.g., electricity, water, gas, heating, etc.) from terminal
    meters which are installed in buildings. The system stores the data periodically
    after analyzing and processing it and finally transmits the data to servers through
    the Ethernet. Rowley et al. [171] propose the data acquisition and modeling approaches
    that can support the delivery of building energy infrastructure in both new building
    and renovated real-world contexts. Such methods provide a means to achieve short,
    medium and long-term forecasting of possible scenario pathways to multi-objective
    sustainable outcomes. CLEEN MMEA [172] platform that collects, processes, and
    manages the data and initiates contextual knowledge extraction. The purpose is
    to establish an online marketplace to collect data and provide services for different
    companies. The interfaces are made public so that any company can easily join
    the network to buy or sell services. The analysis results can be given to an energy
    services company in order to allow offering the service to the owners. A typical
    example of open access data collection system is e3Portal [173] developed by VTT
    in collaboration with Finnish municipalities. e3Portal offers information and
    tools when planning savings measures and energy retrofitting in municipal buildings.
    It also involves frequently updated data regarding energy and water consumption
    in thousands of public buildings like schools, kindergartens, offices, hospitals,
    other health care facilities, etc. Decision makers, designers, operation and maintenance
    personnel, as well as buildings users, can utilize it. There are projects that
    provide publicly available SB datasets for researchers to conduct further studies;
    A list of “Home Datasets” [174] includes the datasets collected by projects from
    UC Berkeley, MIT, Washington State University, University of Amsterdam, University
    of Edinburgh, and the University of Tokyo. The WARD [175] project supported by
    NSF TRUST Center at UC Berkeley provides a benchmark dataset for human action
    recognition using a wearable motion sensor network. The dataset was collected
    from 13 repetitive actions by 13 male and 7 female participants between the ages
    of 19 and 75. An MIT project [176] collected daily live activities dataset from
    two single-person apartments within a period of two weeks. Eighty-four sensors
    to record opening-closing events were attached to different appliances and devices
    such as drawers, refrigerators, containers, etc. Banos et al. [177] introduced
    an open benchmark dataset collected from various inertial sensors attached to
    different parts of the body. They considered 33 fitness activities, recorded using
    9 inertial sensor units from 17 participants. The CASAS project [178] at Washington
    State University provides a publicly-available dataset for a three-bedroom apartment
    with one bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Different types of motion and
    digital sensors are installed to support temperature readings, in addition, the
    analog sensors are installed to support readings for hot water, cold water, and
    stove burner use [179]. The PlaceLab project [180] of MIT provides a dataset collected
    from a one-bedroom apartment with more than 900 sensors, including those coming
    from motion, switch and RFID sensors. That is being used to monitor activity in
    the environment in the context of a smart home [181]. A collection of smart meters
    data from five houses in the UK [182] That consists of 400 million instances.
    The active power is formed by different appliances and the whole-house power demand
    every 6 seconds. The major challenges that arise for data collection are scalability,
    privacy, security, and heterogeneity of resources [183]. Automated sensor data
    collection process collects a large amount of data that overwhelms the collection
    and analysis centers in comparison to the data collected from other sources such
    as IoT devices and social media. This leads to a huge number of small synchronous
    write operations to the database storage system, consequently, resulting in serious
    performance bottlenecks to the storage system design [184]. Because of the extensive
    use of RFID technology, privacy issues arise in data collection; for example,
    the RFID tags carried by a person may become a unique identifier for that person.
    Also, other security concerns appear, for example, the radio signals of RFID technology
    are easily jammed. Hence, that can disrupt the data collection process [185].
    The heterogeneity of data that is being collected from different resources is
    another major challenge, such that the data are usually very noisy, large-scale,
    and distributed. This makes it very difficult to use the collected data effectively
    without a clear description of existing data processing techniques [184]. 2) Data
    Preprocessing A large amount of data are generated by sensors in SBs; this data
    comes from various sources with diverse formats and structures. Usually, this
    data is not ready for analysis as it might be incomplete or redundant due to low
    battery power, poor calibration, exposure to various malicious elements and interference.
    Therefore, raw data typically needs to be preprocessed to deal with missing data,
    discard noisy and redundant data and integrate data from various sources into
    an integrated schema before being committed to storage. This preprocessing is
    called data cleaning. The quality of data can be improved substantially by applying
    some cleaning techniques to the data before it arrives its end user [168], [186].
    Data cleaning is one of the significant tasks in the data processing phase. Data
    cleaning is not a new process particular for the IoT data processing. It has already
    been applied as a process for database management systems. Presenting a data cleaning
    method would further aid the applications to focus on their core logic without
    worrying about data reliability post-processing overheads [184]. There are many
    different techniques that have been utilized to deal with the problem of cleaning
    noisy data streams such as Kalman filters [187], statistical models [186] and
    outlier detection models [184]. One of the major challenges with data cleaning
    techniques in the SBs is the heterogeneity of data collected from different sources
    particularly WSN- and RFID-enabled data streams. The utilized data cleaning techniques
    should be able to deal with several different variables of interest to satisfy
    IoT applications’ requirements, for example, setting home temperature based on
    observed outer temperature, user habits, energy management, etc. [169] Any type
    of failures such as a failed sensor, network issues, camera failure, or database
    crashes in the process of collecting data would invalidate the data. Consequently,
    this type of impediment will dramatically increase the time required to collect
    data [179]. 3) Dimensionality Reduction There are huge volumes of raw data that
    are captured from heterogeneous and ubiquitous of sensors used in SBs. Most of
    the data collected from those sensors are redundant and they need to be brought
    down to a smaller number of features by applying dimensionality reduction techniques
    without losing significant information [188]. The main idea from the dimensionality
    reduction strategy is to find a new coordinate system in which the input data
    can be represented with much fewer features without losing significant information.
    The dimensionality reduction can be made in two different ways: by extracting
    of the features that represent the significant data characteristics (this technique
    is called feature extraction), or by only selecting the most relevant features
    from the original dataset, this method is called feature selection [189], [190].
    Like clustering methods, the dimensionality reduction approach explores and exploits
    the internal structure of the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner
    using less information. Most of these techniques can be utilized in classification
    and regression problems. Examples of some salient algorithms are [153]: Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LDA). Chen et al. [191] propose a framework using the classification
    information of local geometry of data to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset
    on human activity recognition from wearable, object, and ambient sensors. a: Feature
    Extraction The main components of the original data are the features. After extracting
    the features from the raw dataset, such features contain important information
    that is used by the learning algorithms for the activities discrimination. The
    most common methods of feature extraction work in time, frequency, and discrete
    domains [192]. Among time domain method, mean and standard deviation are the key
    approaches for almost all sensor types. While the frequency domain method focuses
    on the periodic structure of the collected data. Wavelet Transformation and Fourier
    Transform are the most common approaches. And discrete domain methods such as
    Euclidean-based distances, dynamic time warping, and Levenshtein edit distance
    are key approaches implemented in several applications such to string similarity,
    classifying human activities and modeling human behavioral patterns [16], [193].
    b: Feature Selection The main role of feature selection is to discriminate the
    most related subset of features within a high dimensional vector of features,
    so that reduces the load of noise and computational expense on the learning models.
    In order to map the high dimensional vector of features into a lower dimensional
    vector, there are several common algorithms used such as Linear Discriminant Analysis
    (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent Component Analysis
    (ICA) [194]. Hausmann and Ziekow [195] proposed an approach for automatically
    adapting the feature selection for SBs application ML models from the time-series
    data based on wrapper methods and genetic optimization. Fahad et al. [196] propose
    an activity recognition approach for overlapping activities using K-Nearest neighbors
    approach that distinguishes the most important features from the collected information
    obtained from deployed sensors in multiple locations and objects. Fang et al.
    [197] determine that the different feature sets generate different levels of accuracy
    for recognizing human activities, and selecting inappropriate datasets increases
    the level of computational complexity and decreases the level of prediction accuracy
    in smart home environments. The wrapper and filtering are the two main statistical
    methods of feature selection problem. It is argued that although the wrapper approach
    may obtain better performances, filters are less resource intensive and faster
    [198]. In [199], different feature selection methods are utilized for the process
    of dimensionality reduction of the learning problem to recognize the human activities
    from observed sensors. The authors show that the performance of the learning models
    to recognize the human activity has a strong relationship with the utilized features.
    c: Feature Projection feature projection can be represented as a mapping from
    the original set of features to an appropriate set that optimizes the learning
    criterion, such that the feature projection approach allows the process of visualizing
    and mapping the high-dimensional feature vectors to low dimensional one, in addition,
    it enables analyzing the distribution of the reduced feature vectors [200]. Consequently,
    the feature projection approach reduces the pattern recognition’s processing time
    and enables selecting the best-performed classifier for the reduced feature vectors.
    Hence, it makes real-time implementation possible [198]. Chu et al. [201] proposed
    a linear supervised feature projection that utilizes the LDA algorithm for EMG
    pattern recognition that attempted to recognize nine kinds of hand motion. C.
    ML Tools & Platforms for SBs There are a variety of existing ML platforms and
    tools to support the learning process. With the current increasing number of those
    kinds of toolkits, the task of selecting the right tool for processing big data
    streaming from various sources can still be difficult. Typically, there is no
    single toolkit that truly fits and provides solutions for all different problems.
    Many of the available toolkits might have overlapping uses, and each has advantages
    and disadvantages. Most of those toolkits might require experiences in the domains
    of programming languages and system architecture. In addition, usually many people
    lack a full understanding of the capabilities and how to use those available platforms
    [202]. The important factors that must be considered when selecting a specific
    ML tool are scalability, speed, coverage, usability, extensibility, and programming
    languages support. With respect to the scalability factor, the size and complexity
    of the data should be considered to determine if a specific toolkit will be fit.
    The processing platform that the library is running on and the complexity of the
    algorithm affect the speed factor. Not all the projects prioritize the speed factor;
    if the models require frequent updates, the speed may be a crucial concern; but
    not otherwise. Coverage represents the number of ML algorithms implemented in
    the tool. With the massive amount of data capturing from heterogeneous sources,
    ML community faces the challenges of how the ML model can efficiently process
    and learn from the big data. In general, the available big data tools do not implement
    all varieties of different classes of ML algorithms, and typically their coverage
    ranges from a few algorithms to around two dozen. The usability factor includes
    elements such as initial setup processing; continuous maintenance; the available
    programming languages and user interface available; the amount of documentation,
    or availability of a knowledgeable user. The extensibility factor means that the
    implementations introduced in the tools can be utilized as building blocks towards
    new systems. It is necessary to evaluate tools in terms of how well they are able
    to meet this factor. There are a variety of ML libraries that are available in
    different programming languages. Depending on the task you are trying to accomplish,
    certain languages, libraries, and tools can be more effective than others. The
    following provides a detailed observation of the strengths and weaknesses of the
    top used deep learning and ML tools. The reader is also referred to Table 6 for
    a concise tabulated summary of the described deep learning and ML tools. TABLE
    6 Comparison Between Deep Learning and ML Tools 1) H2O H20 [203] is an open-source
    in-memory, distributed, and scalable ML framework for big-data analysis that supports
    ML libraries, along with tools for parallel processing, analytics, data preprocessing
    and evaluation tools. It is produced by the H2O.ai, which launched in 2011 in
    Silicon Valley. The most notable feature of this product is that it provides numerous
    tools for deep neural networks. The H2O software APIs can be called from Python,
    Java, R, and Scala. Users without programming expertise can still utilize this
    tool via the web-based User Interface. In addition to the processing engine provided
    by H2O framework, it also allows the users to integrate their models with other
    available frameworks such as Spark and Storm. Depending on what is suitable for
    the algorithm, The H2O’s engine uses multiple execution methods to process data
    completely in memory. The general technique used is distributed Fork/Join, which
    is reliable and suitable for massively parallel tasks. The H2O software can be
    run on different operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
    (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04; CentOS), It also runs on Apache Hadoop Distributed File System
    (HDFS) and Spark systems for big-data analysis. In addition, it can operate on
    various cloud computing environments such as Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine,
    and Microsoft Azure. As of July 2016, the algorithms supported in H2O cover the
    tasks classification, clustering, generalized linear models, statistical analysis,
    ensembles, optimization tools, data preprocessing options and deep neural networks.
    2) MLlib (Spark) MLlib [204] is Apache Spark’s ML library. MLlib aims to provide
    scalable and easy to use ML methods. It includes common ML algorithms for classification,
    regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, as well as lower-level optimization
    primitives and higher-level pipeline APIs. The classification techniques of SVM,
    random forest, logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, decision trees, and gradient-boosted
    trees are supported whereas for clustering, k-means, Gaussian mixture, and power
    iteration clustering are supported. MLLib supports implementations for linear
    regression and isotonic regression, and incorporates a collaborative filtering
    algorithm using alternating least squares. PCA is supported for dimensionality
    reduction. MLlib includes APIs for development in Scala, Java, Python, and SparkR.

    an open source software library for numerical computation and deep ML in a variety
    of perceptual and language understanding tasks utilizing data flow graphs. TensorFlow
    was originally developed by the Google Brain team and was released in November
    2015 under an Apache 2.0 open source license. TensorFlow has tools that support
    deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other algorithms. TensorFlow implements
    data flow graphs, where “tensors” are batches of data that can be processed by
    a set of algorithms defined by a graph. The movements of the data through the
    system are called “flows”—hence, the name. TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs
    and GPUs. It can run on Linux, Mac OS X desktop, and server systems, and Windows
    support on roadmap, as well as on Android and Apple’s iOS mobile computing platforms.
    TensorFlow is written with a Python API over a C/C++ engine that makes it run
    fast. TensorFlow utilizes a symbolic graph of vector operations method, in order
    to easily define a new network. However, TensorFlow has a weakness that is related
    to modeling flexibility. Such that each computational flow has to be constructed
    as a static graph. That makes some computations such as beam search difficult.
    4) Torch Torch [206] is an open source ML computing framework that supports a
    variety of ML algorithms. Torch was originally developed at NYU. It is efficient

    and easy to use in development. Some version of Torch is employed by large companies
    such as Google DeepMind, the Facebook AI Research Group, IBM, Yandex, and the
    Idiap Research Institute. In addition, it has been extended to run on Android
    and iOS platforms. A variety of community-contributed packages for Torch, giving
    it a versatile range of support and functionality. It provides various deep learning

    processing. Deeplearning4j relies on Java programming language, in addition, it
    is compatible with Clojure and includes a Scala API. Deeplearning4j is designed
    to be utilized in business environments, rather than as a research tool. It is
    applied in a variety of applications such as fraud detection, anomaly detection,

    of Waikato, New Zealand. It includes a set of learners and stream generators that
    can be used from the GUI, the command-line, and the Java API. MOA supports a variety
    of ML algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, outlier detection,
    as well as some tools for evaluation [223]. 7) Caffe Caffe [224] is a DL framework,

    In addition, it allows developers to connect.NET and Java libraries to Storm.
    Azure ML studio supports a variety of modules for training, scoring, and validation
    processes. Azure ML comes with a large library of algorithms for predictive analytics.
    The popular families of algorithms are regression, anomaly detection, clustering,
    and classification. D. Real-Time Big Data Analytics Tools for SBS Several applications
    need to have real-time data analysis for stream data and waiting for the information
    to be archived and then analyzed is not practical for these type of applications.
    Generally, Stream processing is intended to analyze a massive amount of data and
    act on real-time streaming data utilizing continuous queries such as SQL-type
    queries to handle streaming data in real-time utilizing scalable, available and
    fault-tolerant architecture. Essential to stream processing is Streaming Analytics.
    More and more tools offer the possibility of real-time streaming data. The following
    presents some of the common and widely used options. 1) Apache Storm Storm [227]
    is an open source distributed real-time data processing framework that provides

    Appliance to manage all of its big-data technologies. Oracle has also produced
    multiple low-latency technologies for Oracle Fast Data components includes Oracle
    Event Processing, Coherence, NoSQL, Business Analytics, and Real-Time Decisions.
    Oracle Event Processing provides solutions for building applications to filter,
    correlate and process events in real-time. It supports IoT services by delivering
    actionable insight on data streaming from a variety of data sources in real-time
    [229]. Oracle Stream Explorer (OSX) and Oracle R Enterprise (ORE) aim to support
    equipment monitoring applications for the systems that made of a variety of components
    through sensors, anomaly detection and failure prediction of such systems. ORE
    [230] is utilized to handle low-frequency streams in batch mode, while OSX handles
    the high-frequency streams making real-time predictions and sends the results
    back to user applications that are communicating with the output channels. OSX
    [231] is a middleware platform has the capability to process large amounts of
    streaming data in real-time for a variety of streaming data applications, from
    a multitude of sources like sensors, social media, financial feeds, etc. It streamlines
    real-time data delivery into most popular big data solutions, including Apache
    Hadoop, Apache HBase, Apache Hive, Apache Flume, and Apache Kafka to facilitate
    improved insight and timely action. Oracle Real-Time Decisions [232] is a decision
    management platform with self-learning that determines optimized recommendations
    and actions with messaging, imagery, products, and services within business processes.
    4) Amazon Kinesis Streams Amazon Kinesis [233] is a platform for collecting and
    processing large streams of data on AWS in real-time, AWS launched Kinesis in
    November of 2013, offering powerful services for loading and analyzing streaming
    data, in addition, it provides custom streaming data applications for specialized
    needs. Sometimes Terabytes of data per hour can be generated - that need to be
    collected, stored, and processed continuously from various application services
    such as web applications, mobile devices, wearables, industrial sensors etc. Typically,
    Amazon Kinesis Streams application can use the Amazon Kinesis Client Library and
    reads data from an Amazon Kinesis stream as data records. These applications can
    run on Amazon EC2 instances. 5) Apache Spark Streaming Apache Spark [234] is an
    open-source platform for real-time data processing, it can implement using four
    different languages: Scala, the syntax in which the platform is written; Python;
    R; and Java. Spark Streaming is an extension of core Spark API. It allows building
    fault-tolerant processing of real-time data streams. Spark Streaming allows the
    processing of millions of data among the clusters, and Spark SQL which makes it
    easier to exploit the data through the SQL language. Spark Streaming divides the
    live data stream into a predefined interval of batches, then handles each batch
    of data as Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then we can apply operations
    like map, reduce, join, window etc. to process these RDDs. The last results of
    these operations are then returned in batches. Spark Streaming can be utilized
    for a variety of application such as real-time monitoring and analyzing of application
    server logs. These logs messages are considered time series data. Examples of
    such type of data are sensor data, weather information, and clickstream data.
    This data can also be utilized for predicting future states based on historical
    data. Apache assures a computation speed that performs the operations quicker
    by 100 times than what is currently offered by Hadoop MapReduce in memory, and
    10 times better than in disc. Spark can be executed either in independent cluster
    mode or in the cloud on different frameworks such as Hadoop, Apache Mesos, and
    EC2. In addition, Spark can access numerous databases such as HDFS, Cassandra,
    HBase or S3, Amazon’s data warehouse. 6) Apache Flume Flume [242] is a distributed,
    reliable and open-source log data aggregation framework. Apache Flume is applied
    in many applications ranging from log data aggregation, to transport massive quantities
    of event data including network traffic data, social-media-generated data, email
    messages and pretty much any data source possible into the HDFS. The architecture
    of Flume is simple and flexible, it is also robust and fault tolerant with tunable
    reliability mechanisms for failover and recovery. log manufacturing operations
    is an example of Flume’s application. The a massive log file data can stream through
    Flume. The log file data can be stored in HDFS and analyzed by utilizing Apache
    Hive. 7) Apache Samoa SAMOA [243] is a distributed streaming ML framework that
    contains programming abstractions for distributed streaming ML algorithms. Its
    name stands for Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis and was originally developed
    at Yahoo! Labs in Barcelona in 2013 and has been part of the Apache incubator
    since late 2014. SAMOA is both a platform and a library. It enables the algorithm
    developer to reuse their code to run on different underlying execution engine.
    In addition, it supports plug-in modules to port SAMOA to different engines. By
    utilizing SAMOA, the ML algorithm developer does not need to worry about the complexity
    of underlying distributed stream processing engines. They can run it locally or
    utilizing one of stream processing engines, such as Storm, S4, or Samza. SAMOA
    provides the ML algorithms for a variety of tasks including classification, regression,
    clustering, along with boosting, and bagging for ensemble learning. Additionally,
    it offers a platform for the implementation of these ML algorithms, as well as
    a framework that enables the user to write their own distributed streaming algorithms.
    For example, there is CluStream for clustering, as well as Vertical Hoeffding
    Tree, which uses vertical parallelism on top of the decision tree, or Hoeffding
    tree for classification. There is also Adaptive Model Rules Regressor, which uses
    both vertical and horizontal parallelism implementations for regression [244].
    A summarized comparison between various real-time data analytics tools is provided
    in Table 7. TABLE 7 Comparison Between Real-Time Data Analytics Tools TABLE 8
    Categorized Applications of SB SECTION V. Applications of Ml-Based Context-Aware
    Systems for SBs The potential uses of ML in an SB environment can be divided into
    four categories: detection, recognition, prediction, and optimization [79]. We
    discuss these categories separately next. In general, detection is the extraction
    of particular information from a larger stream of information. Many detection
    applications in SBs such as fire detection, leak detection, and anomaly detection
    [245]. Many different applications have been studied by researchers in activity
    recognition in SBs; examples include fitness tracking, health monitoring, fall
    detection. [246]. The goal of recognition is to classify an object or an event
    to a predefined category. It focuses on how to make computer programs perform
    intelligent and human-like tasks, such as the recognition of an object from an
    image. The goal of prediction is to determine the temporal relations’ model between
    specific events to predict what will happen in the near future. Prediction can
    be either for classification or regression problems [247]. Event prediction when
    the goal is to predict the most probable event or subsequent activity is an example
    of classification problems, while latency prediction when the output takes on
    continuous values is an example of the regression problem. The general steps of
    applying ML processes to predict an event in an SB environment is shown in Figure
    9. FIGURE 9. Steps involved in applying ML models in an SB environment. Show All
    The goal of optimization, on the other hand, is to maximize the long-term profits
    by making proper decisions in different situations. reinforcement learning can
    be utilized with these problems. Some optimization problems can be managed as
    prediction problems such that the profits for different actions are predicted
    and the action with the highest profit would be selected. Decision making is the
    most common case of the optimization problem. It takes to consider a variety of
    variables and solving deals between the profits of different locations of the
    environment [248]. Smart buildings are becoming increasingly supplied with a variety
    of sensors that measure different parameters, and data from these sensors is analyzed
    by ML algorithms and used for a range of services and applications for the activities
    of the building occupants. SBs go far beyond saving energy and contributing to
    sustainability goals. The application and services provided by the SBs can be
    both residential and commercial ranging from e-health, e-marketing, intelligent
    car parking system, intelligent transportation system, automation, and logistics
    services. Figure 10 shows the taxonomy of basic domains of SB services. Lighting
    services are associated with the well-being of occupants depending on their activities
    in SBs that have sensors to conserve energy when lights are not needed. The power
    and electrical system may have onsite renewable energy sources to provide a percentage
    of power consumption in SBs. Waste management is related to the activities and
    actions required to collect, separate, transport, together with monitoring and
    regulation of waste management system in SBs. The security is related to managing
    automated locks, biometric devices as well as video surveillance systems in SBs.
    The communications center is related to connecting sensors and actuators in the
    building as well as the operations control center. The operations control center
    supports system analytics and decision making for the operations. Visual interfaces
    provide a dashboard that shows the status of SB services and human operators to
    better manage the building resources. These interfaces also allow the occupants
    to set up their optimal parameters for comfort and productivity improvement on
    daily activities. HVAC stands for the humidity, ventilation and air conditioning
    system, intended for the convenience of occupants that have effective interaction
    with the environment. Parking services aim to minimize the area and volume required
    for parking cars. It could support car sharing, electric vehicles and a place
    for bicycles as well. Finally, the water management services aim to increase savings
    and manage water reclamation for flushing, landscaping and air-cooling systems.
    FIGURE 10. SB services taxonomy. Show All Based on our literature survey, we have
    identified that the application areas of SBs can be elderly care, comfort/entertainment,
    security/safety, energy management, and other projects. In the rest of the section,
    we will briefly describe the major domains in providing the following SB services:
    (1) care of the elderly population; (2) enhancing energy efficiency; (3) enhancing
    comfort or providing entertainment; (4) enhancing safety and security; and (5)
    miscellaneous projects. a: Elderly Population’s Home Care SB technology such as
    sensors, voice activation, GPS, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity via mobile phones,
    smartphone monitoring apps and sophisticated computers can be especially useful
    for elderly or disabled individuals who live independently. Elderly persons can
    take the advantages of such technologies (e.g., monitoring system, emergency system,
    dangerous kitchen appliance detection, fall detection), to maintain a safe and
    healthy lifestyle while living independently [56], [249]. Smart technology in
    the SBs aims to collect real-time information on human daily activity and then
    learn of their personal patterns. ML techniques have the potential for a very
    wide array of new innovations in healthcare that will be transformative for both
    providers and their patients. Whenever a deviation from the norm patterns is detected,
    SB systems send the alerts to family members and the caregivers in order for them
    to take urgent response action. By using big data analytics and ML algorithms
    it is possible to analyze large-scale data contained in electronic medical records—e.g.,
    to learn automatically how physicians treat patients including the drugs they
    prescribe [250]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Chernbumroong
    et al. [56] proposed an activity recognition and classification approach for detecting
    daily living activities of the elderly people applying SVM. They used wrist-worn
    multi-sensors namely accelerometer, temperature sensor and altimeter for detection
    basic five activities namely feeding, grooming, dressing, mobility, and stairs.
    And other instrumental activities such as washing dishes, ironing, sweeping and
    watching TV. Taleb et al. [251] proposed a middleware-level solution that integrates
    both the sensing and the monitoring services for assisting elders at smart homes
    environment. The appliances used in the proposed framework include RFID readers
    that cover of the whole building, sound sensors, video cameras, smart door lock,
    microphone and speakers for interaction with the system. CAALYX [252] is a European
    Commission-funded project that supports older people’s autonomy and self-confidence.
    The service is formed of three distinct subsystems including elderly monitoring
    subsystem, home monitoring subsystem and the caretaker’s monitoring subsystem.
    The system delivers a high priority message to an emergency service including
    the geographic position and clinical condition of the elder user. EasyLine+ [253]
    project funded by the European Commission to support elderly people with or without
    disabilities in carrying out a longer independent life at home. The system uses
    a neural network, assistive software, and a variety of sensors such as illumination
    sensor, temperature sensor, door sensors, and RFID giving the capacity of controlling
    the white goods. Hossain et al. [254] proposed a cloud-based cyber-physical multi-sensory
    smart home framework for elderly people that supports gesture-based appliance
    control. Suryadevara et al. [255] proposed a model for generating sensor activity
    pattern and predicting the behavior of an elderly person using household appliances.
    b: Energy Efficiency When temperatures rise or fall in various zones of your home,
    heaters, air conditioners, fans, and other devices will turn on or off (or increase
    or decrease in speed or temperature). In order to perform an efficient energy
    consumption of the supply systems, a significant step that is necessary by analyzing
    the way that current energy consuming system is using in buildings [256]. In the
    last decade, analysis of the energy efficiency in the smart spaces has received
    increasing attention. Various approaches for energy efficiency have been proposed
    utilizing predictive modeling based on profile, climate data, and building characteristics
    [32], [257]. For instance, lights throughout your home might turn on and off depending
    on the time of day. In the past, various attempts have been made to improve energy
    efficiency in the SBs through the use of smart metering and sensor networks at
    the residential level facilities. It is a fact that these types of infrastructure
    are becoming more widespread but due to their variety and size, they cannot be
    directly utilized to make conclusions that help to improve the energy efficiency.
    ML approaches will be the key to the handling of energy efficiency problem in
    SBs. Learning about the occupants’ consumption habits is capable of generating
    collaborative consumption predictions that help the occupant to consume better
    [258]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Reinisch et al.
    [259] developed an optimized application of AI system for SB environment. The
    system focuses on some capabilities like ubiquity, context awareness, conflict
    resolution, and self-learning features. The system operates on a knowledge base
    that stores all the information needed to fulfill the goals of energy efficiency
    and user comfort. Jahn et al. [260] proposed an energy efficiency features system
    built on top of a Hydra middleware framework [261]. The system provides both,
    stationary and mobile user interfaces for monitoring and controlling a smart environment.
    Pan et al. [262] proposed an IoT framework that uses smartphone platform and cloud-computing
    technologies to improve the energy efficiency in SBs. They built an experimental
    testbed for energy consumption data analysis. Fensel et al. [263] proposed the
    SESAME-S project (SEmantic SmArt Metering - Services for energy efficient houses).
    The project focuses on designing and evaluating the energy efficiency services
    to enable the end-consumers in making the right decisions and controlling their
    energy consumption. The system combines a variety of smart building components,
    such as smart meters, a variety of sensors, actuators, and simulators that can
    integrate virtual appliances such as the washing machine. Vastardis et al. [264]
    proposed a user-centric smart-home gateway system architecture to support home-automation,
    energy usage management, and smart-grid operations. The gateway is supported by
    ML classification algorithms component such as C4.5 and RIPPER that is able to
    extract behavioral patterns of the users and feed them back to the gateway. Irrigation
    systems monitoring and smart watering system that keep track of rain and soil
    conditions and irrigate appropriately are a very cost-effective way to reduce
    outdoor water consumption. Investment in water management software and services,
    water-efficient plumbing, and irrigation management delivers economic and sustainability
    benefits. Water conservation and management is an example of such benefits [265].
    c: Comfort/Entertainment One of the main goals of SB research is to facilitate
    user daily life activities by increasing their satisfaction and comfort level.
    SBs supports automated appliance control and assistive services to offer a better
    quality of life. They utilize context awareness techniques to optimize the occupant’s
    comfort based on predefined constraints of conditions in a building environment.
    Typical examples of comfort services include lighting, background music, automation
    of routine activities, advanced user interfaces based on voice or gestures, etc.
    [30]. Other services related to comfort services in SB environments are Indoor
    Climate Control and Intelligent Thermostat [265]. Indoor Climate Control: Measurement
    and control of temperature, lighting, CO2 fresh air. In the SB environment, HVAC
    systems play an essential role in forming indoor environmental quality. Typically,
    HVAC systems are produced not only to heat and cool the air but also to draw in
    and circulate outdoor air in large buildings [266]. Kabir et al. [267] present
    a context-aware application that provides the service according to a predefined
    preference of a user. They use the KNN classifier to infer the predefined service
    that will maximize the user’s comfort and safety while requiring minimum explicit
    interaction of the user with the environment. Ahn et al. [268] proposed a deep
    learning model that estimates periodically the atmospheric changes and predict
    the indoor air quality of the near future. d: Safety/Security As the SB technology
    progresses, the role of ML and deep learning in security and connected devices
    will increase. Deep learning will continue to help gain insights using big data
    that were previously inaccessible, particularly in image and video. Advanced technologies
    such as behavioral analysis and ML to detect, categorize, and block new threats
    will be beneficial. In a traditional home system, as soon as a fire is detected
    the Fire/smoke detectors are activated and start sending a fire alarm. However,
    SB can perform much better than the traditional system. It not only sends an alarm
    but also turns on the light only in the safest route and guides the occupants
    of the building out, as well as it will unlock the doors and windows for smoke
    ventilation, turn off all the devices and call the nearest fire service station.
    Other than this, it can take video of the areas surrounding the building, provide
    the status of window breakage alarms, and automatically lock all the doors and
    the windows when the last person of the house leaves [30]. The main services for
    security and safety in SBs are: Perimeter Access Control, Liquid Presence, Intelligent
    Fire Alarm, Intrusion Detection, and Motion Detection Systems [265]. Perimeter
    Access Control service provides control to restricted areas and detects non-authorized
    users that access the areas. Access card provides a variety of solutions that
    allow staff members, vendors or contractors to access specific areas at specific
    times you designate. The same access card can also be utilized to check employee
    attendance. In addition, there is widespread use of biometric technology including
    fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scans [269]. Additionally, liquid presence
    detection technique has been utilized in data centers, warehouses, and sensitive
    building grounds to prevent breakdowns and corrosion in such areas [270]. Intelligent
    Fire Alarm and its corresponding safety systems are crucial parts of an intelligent
    building. It is a system with multi-function sensors (i.e., chemical gas sensors,
    integrated sensor systems, and computer vision systems) These sensors enable measuring
    smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the building. They also can give warnings,
    howling alarms, and tell with a human voice about the place and level of smoke
    and CO. In addition, they can give a message on a smartphone if the smoke or the
    CO alarm goes off [271]. Examples of intrusion detection systems including window
    and door opening detection and intrusion prevention [265]. An infrared motion
    sensor is utilized to detect the motion in a specific area in the building. This
    sensor can reliably send alerts to the alarm panel, with the system implementing
    algorithms for adaption to environmental disturbances and reducing any false alarms
    [265]. Image recognition solution can be used in security software to identify
    people, places, objects, and more. It can also be used to detect unusual patterns
    and activities. Clarifai [272] specializes in a field of ML known as “computer
    vision” that teaches computers to “see” images and video. Clarifai’s technology
    can play a key role in security surveillance and at present, the company works
    only with home security. Each image is processed on a pixel by pixel basis through
    convoluted neural networks. Bangali and Shaligram [273] proposed a home security
    system that monitors the home when the user is away from the place. The system
    is composed of two methods: one uses a web camera to detect the intruder—whenever
    there is a motion detected in front of the camera, a security alert in terms of
    sound and an email is delivered to the occupant. And the other one is based on
    GSM technology that sends SMS. A home security system that sends alert messages
    to the house owner and police station in case of illegal invasion at home is proposed
    in [274]. The system consists of different sensor nodes as the input components
    while the output components respond to the signal received from the input components.
    The sensor nodes consist of a thief alarm, presence detecting circuit, and the
    break-in camera. Zhao and Ye [275] proposed a wireless home security system that
    utilizes low cost, low power consumption, and GSM/GPRS. The system has a user
    interface and it can respond to alarm incidents. e: Miscellaneous Projects CASAS
    [178] is a project by Washington State University that provides a noninvasive
    assistive environment for dementia patients at SBs. The project focuses on three
    main areas for SBs: medical monitoring, green living, and general comfort. CASAS
    project comprises of three layers: physical layer, middleware layer, and software
    applications layer. Aware Home Research Initiative (AHRI) [276] is a project that
    has constructed by a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology for SB services
    in the fields of health and well-being, digital media and entertainment, and sustainability.
    AHRI utilizes a variety of sensors such as smart floor sensors, it also utilizes
    assistive robots for monitoring and helping the elderly. House_n [277] is a multi-disciplinary
    project leads by a group of researchers at the MIT. The main objective of the
    project is to facilitate the design of the smart home and its associated technologies,
    products, and services. The home is supplied with hundreds of various sensors
    that are installed almost in every part of the home that and being utilized to
    develop user interface applications that enable the users to control and monitor
    their environment, save resources, remain mentally and physically active, and
    stay healthy. The EasyLiving project [278] at Microsoft Research is concerned
    with the development of a prototype architecture and technologies to aggregate
    diverse devices into a coherent user experience for intelligent environments.
    The EasyLiving project was designed to provide context-aware computing services.
    The project utilizes a variety of sensors and cameras to track and recognize the
    human activities in the room by using the geometric model of a room and taking
    readings from sensors installed in the room. The Gator Tech Smart House project
    [279] is a programmable space specifically designed for the elderly and disabled
    developed by The University of Florida’s mobile and pervasive computing laboratory.
    The project’s goal is to create SB environments that can sense themselves and
    their residents. The project provides special cognitive services for the residents
    such as mobility, health, and other age-related impairments. A generic middleware
    is utilized to integrate system components in order to maintain a service definition
    for every sensor and actuator in the building. The components of the middleware
    including separate physical, sensor platform, service, knowledge, context management,
    and application layers [280]. Other well-known smart home projects include DOMUS
    [281] which is a research project, by the University of Sherbrooke in Canada,
    that supports mobile computing and cognitive assistance in smart buildings. The
    project aims to assist people suffering from Alzheimer’s type dementia, schizophrenia,
    cranial trauma, or intellectual deficiencies. Adaptive House project [136] at
    The University of Colorado has constructed a prototype system that is equipped
    with a variety of sensors that provide different environmental information including
    sound, motion, temperature, light levels. In addition, actuators that control
    the space and water heaters; lighting units, and ceiling fans. In Asia, there
    are also some other smart building projects have been developed, such as “Welfare
    Techno House” project, which is equipped with different sensors such as ECG, body
    weight, and other temperature measured indicators [282]. Ubiquitous Home project
    [283] is another smart building project in Japan, which utilizes RFID, PIR, pressure
    sensors, as well as cameras and microphones for monitoring elderly adults. Summary:
    Recently, several different context-aware and ML techniques have been utilized
    to support SB services. ML-based approaches are capable to perform better prediction
    and adaptation than others. The philosophy behind ML is to automate the learning
    process that enables algorithms to create analytical models with the support of
    available data. ML can be applied in different learning styles including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement
    learning when the learning is the result of the interaction between a model and
    the environment. The general uses of ML for SB services are detection, recognition,
    prediction, and optimization. In the section, we also talked about how to acquire
    the context from multiple distributed and heterogeneous sources and the techniques
    for modeling and processing such context to be used in the application services
    of SBs. We also talked about the most used tools and platforms ML and others for
    real-time data analytics by ML community to efficiently process and learn from
    big data. Without such ML tools, one would have to implement all of the techniques
    from scratch requiring expertise in the techniques and in efficient engineering
    practices. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Future Research Directions Research on
    SBs has made great strides in recent years, but a number of challenges remain.
    We present some major challenges related to SBs in this part of the work. These
    challenges will channelize the research directions for future SBs. A. Security
    and Privacy Wherever there is an interconnection of two systems or networks (wired
    or wireless), there are issues of security and privacy and the same is true in
    the case of SB. Security is an essential role in SB environments. Any SB application
    should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. Access control must be
    included in SB systems, for instance, the unauthorized users should not be able
    to disconnect the alarm system by connecting the pervasive system [284]. There
    is a massive amount of streaming that is collected from the various installed
    sensors and appliances, such data needs to be processed and stored. Hence, cloud
    computing services can be utilized for this purpose. However, with all of this
    data that is transmitted, the issue of losing the privacy increases. Therefore,
    different encryption techniques are needed to preserve personal privacy [285].
    There are specific challenges related to the user’s privacy including challenges
    related to the data privacy of personal information and the privacy of the individual’s
    physical location and tracking. That needs for privacy enhancement technologies
    and relevant protection laws and tools for identity management of users and objects
    [286]. The recent trend of ML research has focused on handling security and privacy
    issues in SB environments. There are different security-related services have
    utilized ML techniques, such as determining safe device behavior by detecting
    and blocking activities and potentially harmful behavior [287]. ML techniques
    have the potential to reduce security gap because of their capability to learn,
    identify and detect the users’ habits and behaviors. Consequently, it can detect
    the abnormal behaviors predicting risks and intrusions before they happen. For
    instance, ML models learn the routine of the users, such as the time they get
    home or go to sleep. These models can suggest rules based on those detected behaviors
    from all connected devices [288]. B. SBS and Context-Aware Computing In the SB
    environment, there exists a massive amount of raw data being continuously collected
    about the various human activities and behaviors. It is important to develop techniques
    that convert this raw data into valuable knowledge [289]. Context awareness and
    ML techniques are expected to provide great support to process and store big data
    and create important knowledge from all this data [290]. The process of data interpretation
    and knowledge extraction has the following challenges including addressing noisy
    real-world data and the ability to develop further inference techniques that do
    not have the limitations of traditional algorithms. Usually, It is very complex
    to formalize and model the contextual information related to human behaviors in
    a standard way due to the complex physiological, psychological and behavioral
    aspects of human beings [291]. The humans communicate through rich languages as
    well as gestures and expressions. Modern ubiquitous computer systems lack an automatic
    mechanism of inferring information as the humans do. New research is necessary
    to raise human activities and behaviors recognition to understand the complex
    dependencies between the apps and humans [292], [293]. The context-aware prompting
    systems have essential applications in SBs such as emergency notifications, medication
    prompting, heart rate monitoring, generation of agenda reminders, and weather
    alerts. However, issuing prompts for all detected errors can possibly be false
    positives, and consequently, lead to annoyance and sometimes prove to be unsafe
    for specific activities. ML methods can be used for an accurate and precise prediction
    when a person faces difficulty while doing daily life activities [294]. C. Personal
    Data Stream Management in SBS The data streaming management system is able to
    process and transfer raw data collected from a variety of sensors to information,
    it is also able to fuse this information to a feature and directly process features
    [295]. While the data processing for a single SB is simple, it is more complex
    when processing the data from multiple SBs, because there are different people
    that tend to share less common interests and have opposing interests concerning
    the processed data [296]. The simple sensors in an SB environment can detect different
    events related to temperature, motion, light, or weather. Moreover, other appliances
    like a television and a telephone can also send their status or other data as
    events. All this data from different sensors can be used by SB services to detect
    specific states and send a request to some actuators according to specific predefined
    rules, for instance, turn on the light if the television is used [297]. However,
    this approach is not generalizable in case of a group of people residing in the
    same building. Although it can work well for one certain person when personal
    preferences can be automatically learned for an individual person, therefore each
    of the residents has to define their own set of rules [298]. Because of the increasing
    number of sensors that produce data streams, the traditional analyzing and processing
    techniques of these data streams are mostly impractical now [299]. Despite the
    availability of new tools and systems for handling massive amounts of data continuously
    generating by a variety of sensors in SBs, however, the real promise of advanced
    data analytics to still lies beyond the realm of pure technology [296]. In [300]
    discuses research challenges for data streams of real-world applications. They
    analyze issues concerning privacy, timing, preprocessing, relational and event
    streams, model complexity and evaluation, availability of information, and problems
    related to legacy systems. D. Big Data Challenges in SBS Nowadays, a variety of
    sensing technology in the SBs can be utilized to collect a massive amount of heterogeneous
    data at a reasonable cost. Typically, hundreds of thousands of transactions can
    be generated by a single SB every day. The process of storing this data over the
    long-term is challenging [258]. We can imagine the challenges and opportunities
    that the companies or government will encounter in the future to manage incoming
    data from dozens of SBs. This new data could provide us with more contextual information
    that consequently leads to much better services to the occupants [301]. In the
    world of big data, despite the availability massive amount of data, however, it
    is not necessarily easy to obtain valuable information from this data utilizing
    the traditional approaches like trial and error to extract meaningful information
    from this data. Analyzing these massive amounts of data requires new technologies
    to store, organize, and process big data effectively, it needs high-performance
    processors that enable uncovering the insights in big data. It also requires flexible
    cloud computing services and virtualization techniques, as well as software such
    as Apache Hadoop and Spark [302]. It requires providing appropriate ML techniques
    which differ from the traditional approaches for effective and efficient solution
    of the above issues. For these reasons, researchers have recently started to think
    about the problems and opportunities resulting from the adoption of big data in
    SB environments [303], [304]. The information extracted from this big data has
    significant value and could greatly contribute in the future of SBs as assistive
    tools and for better services delivery. That is why it is necessary that the researchers
    start to analyze and think about the solutions for the current and future challenges
    of big data in SBs [305]. E. Interoperability Interoperability means that two
    (or more) systems work together unchanged even though they were not necessarily
    designed to work together. When equipment, devices or appliances having different
    communication and networking technologies can communicate effectively, interoperability
    is satisfied. It is a challenge to ensure that an SB that has various components
    will be intelligible. Typically, each of these components might have been produced
    by different vendors, each of which may have created under different design constraints
    and considerations [306]. Therefore it becomes essential to satisfy interoperability
    so that a number of heterogeneous communication and networking technologies could
    coexist in various parts of SBs. For example, an energy management system may
    use Wi-Fi and ZigBee for communication purposes. A lot of work can be done in
    this context [307]. F. Reliability We can expect that the reliability is one of
    the main concern of occupants and developers of SB systems. A variety of appliances
    and devices present in SB such as televisions, microwave, washing machines etc.
    are required exceedingly to be reliable. Achieving expected levels of reliability,
    especially when linked with communication technologies utilized with these devices
    that may be expected in SBs, is a great challenge. There are different reasons
    for these challenges differences in technological approaches, regulations, development
    culture, and the expectations of the market [306]. G. Integration The key to a
    successful SB implementation is integration: linking building systems such as
    lighting, power meters, water meters, pumps, heating, and chiller plants together
    using sensors and control systems, and then connecting the building automation
    system to enterprise systems. Integration allows executives to gain smart-building
    benefits, both in new construction and by gradually transforming existing buildings
    into SBs. What these SBs have in common is integration. Generally, the integration
    in SB systems brings a range of benefits from energy savings to productivity gains
    to sustainability. The SB systems can be attached to enterprise business systems
    to add another level of intelligence that enhances decision-making and improves
    building performance [2]. However, integrating multiple systems is very challenging
    as each individual system has its own assumptions, strategies to control the physical
    world, and semantics. As an example of integrating two systems in SB, assume a
    system that is responsible for energy management, and another system for health
    care are running concurrently. In this case, the integrated system should not
    turn off medical appliances to save energy while they are being used as suggested
    by the health care system [292]. As a future perspective for SBs, You will wake
    up to the sound of the alarm, at the same time the available sensors will be aware
    that you are waking up. The other sensors such as light sensors will automatically
    turn on the light in the building, while the thermostat will warm the area that
    you are about to use in the building. Your coffee will start to brew, you will
    also get a notification on your phone about the weather. The other sensors in
    the kitchen and refrigerator will remind you with a list of items that you will
    need to pick up on your way from your workplace to home to make dinner. When you
    leave your house, you can press a button from your phone to self-drive your car
    out of the garage. After that, the security system will start monitoring and controlling
    the home. Such the doors will automatically lock. Appliances will switch to an
    energy-saving mode. When the home sensors sense utilizing geofencing technology
    that you are way back home, it will get ready again for your arrival, the thermostat
    will warm things up, the garage door will open as you pull up, and your favorite
    music will start to play when you walk in [141]. Summary: Although the recent
    researches have been done in the SBs field, there is a need for a lot more efforts;
    however, we believe that SBs are possible for the mass market in the near future.
    The main challenges and future research directions of this eld can be summarized
    as follows: User context in term of behavior and intention should be studied and
    respected whenever possible; Further research is needed into context-aware prompting
    systems, personal data streaming and big data analysis of occupants in SB environment;
    Some of the other challenges like the interoperability, reliability, and integration
    still require more attention. SECTION VII. Conclusions The promise of smart buildings
    (SBs) is a world of appliances that anticipate your needs and do exactly what
    you want them to at the touch of a button. Since SBs and their inhabitants create
    voluminous amounts of streaming data, SB researchers are looking towards techniques
    from ML and big data analytics for managing, processing, and gaining insights
    from this big data. This paper reviewed the most important aspects of SBs with
    particular focus on what is being done and what are the issues that require further
    research in ML and data analytics domains. In this regards, we have presented
    a comprehensive survey of the research works that relate to the use of ML and
    big data particularly for building smart infrastructure and services. Although
    the recent advancements in technologies that make the concept of SBs feasible,
    there are still a variety of challenges that limit large-scale real-world systems
    in SBs field. Addressing these challenges soon will be a powerful driving force
    for advancements in both industrial and academic fields of SB research. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

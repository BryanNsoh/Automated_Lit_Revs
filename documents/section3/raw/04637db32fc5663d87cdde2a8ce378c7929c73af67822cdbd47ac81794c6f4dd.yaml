    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\
    \ yield via cloud dashboards for\nfarmers. A schematic of the digital twin concept\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\

    \ of products (e.g., farm machinery) re-\nquires (I) geometric (e.g., size, shape)\
    \ and physical properties of an object, (II) in the\ndetailed information of the\
    \ product which can illustrate dynamic processing of the object,\n(III) integration\
    \ of geometric, physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin ap-\nproaches\
    \ make it possible to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery\n\
    that would yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efﬁciencies.\n\
    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be mod-\neled in digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors\
    \ on energy consumption can\nalso be explored there [62]. In the agricultural\
    \ context, ref. [40] reported that a commercially\navailable digital twin platform\
    \ for agricultural machinery is able to track the machines\nin real-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efﬁciency of crop management,\nand trajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the speciﬁc conditions of the farm. It has also\n\
    been reported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training of\
    \ unskilled\nharvester operators and lead to high macro-economic beneﬁts [63].\n\
    Within the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important technology\
    \ in crop\nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization and has\
    \ been drawing more\nattention in recent years. To optimize the robotic application\
    \ process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efﬁciency of the product,\
    \ the digital twin concepts can be used for\nvirtualization of the robot environment\
    \ by introducing a remote operating system [64].\nBy providing simulation and\
    \ remote operation possibilities and modeling various inter-\nactions between\
    \ robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\nand\
    \ ﬂexibility may enhance, and the ﬁnal product cost may decline. Ref. [65] analyzed\n\
    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) have recently established their capacity to provide cost-effective
    and credible solutions for various real-world scenarios. UAVs provide an immense
    variety of services due to their autonomy, mobility, adaptability, and communications
    interoperability. Despite the expansive use of UAVs to support ground communications,
    data exchanges in those networks are susceptible to security threats because most
    communication is through radio or Wi-Fi signals, which are easy to hack. While
    several techniques exist to protect against cyberattacks. Recently emerging technology
    blockchain could be one of promising ways to enhance data security and user privacy
    in peer-to-peer UAV networks. Borrowing the superiorities of blockchain, multiple
    entities can communicate securely, decentralized, and equitably. This article
    comprehensively overviews privacy and security integration in blockchain-assisted
    UAV communication. For this goal, we present a set of fundamental analyses and
    critical requirements that can help build privacy and security models for blockchain
    and help manage and support decentralized data storage systems. The UAV communication
    system''s security requirements and objectives, including availability, authentication,
    authorization, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and non-repudiation, are thoroughly
    examined to provide a deeper insight. We wrap up with a discussion of open research
    challenges, the constraints of current UAV standards, and potential future research
    directions. Published in: IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology ( Volume:

    I. Introduction The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has gained a great
    attention due to their high mobility, affordability, and ease of use. UAVs are
    considered valuable service enablers for innovative city applications, healthcare
    domains, real-time surveillance and monitoring, disaster management, and wireless
    communication. Approximately 102.4 billion dollars will be spent annually on UAVs
    by 2030, a compound annual growth rate of 19.6%, surpassing 19.78 billion dollars
    in 2020 [1]. Solely devoted UAVs could be deployed as aerial base stations (ABSs),
    access points (APs), or relays to assist terrestrial wireless communications from
    the sky, resulting in an innovative approach known as UAV-assisted communications.
    This approach has several upgrading processes, including potential on-demand deployment,
    high network reconfiguration flexibility, and a high probability of line of sight
    (LoS) communication links. UAVs have the potential to meet these requirements
    concerning user mobility, random channel fluctuations, and blocking effects. UAVs
    can broaden the coverage area, decrease the blind spots of terrestrial BS, and
    increase the probability of a direct LoS. The environmental challenges UAVs face
    cannot be solved using conventional optimization techniques. A. Background In
    recent years, UAVs have been utilized for various applications such as surveillance,
    mapping, remote sensing, search and rescue, disaster control, and entertainment,
    among others [2]. These technical UAVs often work collectively as UAV swarm intelligence.
    Designing them requires joint optimization problems of UAVs and blockchain, including
    flight trajectory, time scheduling, altitude optimization, aerial and relay base
    stations, energy harvesting, power transfer, optimal power consumption, and resource
    allocation [3]. Specialized drones and swarm units are also used as temporary
    base stations in disaster areas and emergencies. It is anticipated that UAVs will
    become increasingly prevalent and capture a significant market share by 2025 [4].
    However, there are still significant barriers to their widespread use in various
    applications, such as optimal UAV deployment in 3D space, trajectory optimization,
    wireless and computational resource allocation, and flight duration when deploying
    UAVs as base stations (BS) in UAV communications. Additionally, wireless network
    deployment and expansion require considerable time and capital investments. Moreover,
    the broadcast nature of UAV-assisted wireless networks makes them highly susceptible
    to privacy and security breaches, including distributed denial-of-service (DDOS),
    replay, impersonation, message injection, spoofing, malware infection, eavesdropping
    links, and line-of-interference attacks. Consequently, UAV-assisted communication
    presents significant privacy and security challenges that must be addressed [5].
    Cryptographic keys and hash-based blockchain techniques can provide security against
    global positioning system (GPS) spoofing, wormhole attacks, jamming, DOS, and
    eavesdropping in UAV swarm applications [6]. Multiple consensus algorithms are
    restricted in their capacity to provide high throughput in a distributed network.
    In addition to the shortcomings of the current architecture, blockchain''s security
    algorithms impose a high computational delay on the UAV swarm network, rendering
    it unsuitable for applications requiring high availability and low latency. UAV
    communication faces several challenges and limitations, including: Security and
    Privacy: UAV communication systems are vulnerable to cyber threats, including
    unauthorized access, data tampering, and spoofing attacks. Ensuring secure and
    private communication between UAVs and ground stations is crucial to maintaining
    the integrity and confidentiality of data. Trust and Accountability: UAV communication
    involves multiple stakeholders, including UAV operators, service providers, and
    regulatory authorities. Establishing trust and accountability among these entities
    is essential for reliable and transparent operations. Centralized trust models
    may introduce single points of failure and raise concerns about data manipulation.
    Interoperability and Standardization: UAV communication systems often involve
    heterogeneous devices and protocols, leading to interoperability challenges. Lack
    of standardization hinders seamless communication and coordination among UAVs
    from different manufacturers or service providers. Spectrum Management: UAVs require
    access to radio frequency spectrum for communication and control purposes. Efficient
    spectrum allocation and management are crucial to prevent interference, ensure
    reliable communication, and maximize spectrum utilization. Blockchain technology
    offers potential solutions to address these challenges in UAV communication: Enhanced
    Security: Blockchain inherent immutability and cryptographic properties provide
    a robust security framework for UAV communication. The decentralized nature of
    blockchain ensures that transactions and data are tamper-proof, enhancing the
    integrity and security of UAV communications. Trust and Decentralization: By utilizing
    a distributed ledger, blockchain eliminates the need for a centralized authority
    in UAV communication. This fosters trust and transparency among stakeholders,
    as transactions and interactions are recorded and verifiable by all participants.
    Smart Contracts and Automation: Smart contracts on the blockchain enable automated
    and self-executing agreements between UAVs and other entities. This can streamline
    operations, ensure compliance with regulations, and facilitate secure and transparent
    transactions. Data Integrity and Transparency: Blockchain can provide a secure
    and transparent platform for recording and sharing UAV data. This ensures data
    integrity and traceability, enabling auditable and accountable UAV operations.
    Interoperability and Standardization: Blockchain-based protocols can facilitate
    interoperability and standardization by providing a common framework for communication
    and data exchange among UAVs and ground systems. This promotes seamless integration
    and collaboration across different platforms. Blockchain technologies are a promising
    security solution for UAVs with limited capacity. However, further research is
    required as these technologies are still in their preliminary stages of development.
    Improvements in consensus algorithms and software-based cryptographic key impairments
    could lead to more effective security solutions for UAVs in the future. B. Motivations
    The wireless channel in UAV networks is prone to security vulnerabilities that
    can impact reliability. Moreover, the current centralized communication and control
    system for drones is constantly threatened by external attacks. Therefore, in
    recent times, researchers have paid more attention to making the UAV-assisted
    network more secure by using different techniques such as differential privacy
    and homomorphic encryption [7]. Federated Learning (FL) evolved to ensure privacy
    by training machine learning (ML) models without data sharing. A global model
    is trained collaboratively in FL [8] by sharing the model parameters only. Combining
    FL with a blockchain-assisted UAV network can revolutionize future intelligent
    applications, especially in healthcare and wireless networks. Consequently, this
    survey comprehensively analyzes the impact of combining FL, blockchain, and UAV
    with beyond 5G (B5G) communication networks for privacy and time-sensitive applications.
    Some attacks aim to steal information through security holes [9] in communication
    links; others use obfuscating sensors, such as GPS spoofing. The standard attacks
    on UAV networks are flight control manipulation and GPS attacks. Though UAVs have
    many potential applications, they also raise social concerns and challenges related
    to public safety, privacy, and cyber security. For instance, cyber-attacks like
    hacking UAV networks are a potential threat that can be misused by malicious entities,
    resulting in cybercrime [10]. These vulnerabilities lead to information theft,
    property destruction, and loss of life. In addition, a UAV network must have safe
    and reliable correspondence for privacy-sensitive and time-sensitive applications.
    Therefore, considering the broader perspective of combining UAV and blockchain
    technology for data-driven applications is paramount. C. Related Existing Surveys
    Recently, some surveys in the literature deal with UAV-assisted communication
    enabled by blockchain. The comparisons of the existing surveys are presented in
    Table 1. In the literature, a detailed survey [11] provides comprehensive information
    on the six-generation (6G) network-based blockchain-envisioned UAV communication.
    In addition, the architecture, specifications, and use cases of 6G technology
    are discussed. This study also covers the security and communication facets. Finally,
    it identifies the potential privacy challenges that blockchain can solve. Similarly,
    another similar survey [12] introduces PHY-layer security to UAV communication
    networks to address the difficult problem of information leakage caused by potential
    eavesdropping. A UAV network of this kind aims to achieve information exchange
    confidentiality. The article [13] first emphasises UAV energy constraints, high
    altitude, and 3-D mobility, and then the authors present a literature review on
    5G communication. The next work [14] specifics on UAV networks and BC technology,
    including their security problems, limitations, and solutions. Moving on to general
    blockchain surveys, a very thorough survey [15] covers the integration of 5G and
    6G with blockchain in UAV communications. Maintaining the present trend, this
    article [16] provides a comprehensive overview of recent developments in blockchain-based
    FL. According to studies, blockchain is widely used to solve the challenges of
    drone networks. The UAV layer connects drones for specific tasks, such as blockchain
    mining. On the other hand, the resource layer is about setting up the blockchain
    and allocating resources. A service provider at the network''s edge sets up the
    management layer to manage resources and make decisions, like sending work to
    drones to do computation. While research on blockchain-assisted UAV communication
    systems is an emerging field, there are still several gaps and limitations that
    need to be addressed. Some of the key gaps and limitations in existing research
    include: TABLE 1 Comparisons of Existing Survey Papers. 1: 5G-Concentrated, 2:
    Blockchain-Concentrated, 3: UAV-Concentrated 4: Performance Comparisons With Other
    Technologies Scalability: Blockchain scalability remains a significant challenge,
    especially in the context of real-time UAV communication systems. As the number
    of UAVs and transactions increases, the scalability of blockchain networks becomes
    crucial to ensure timely and efficient communication. More research is needed
    to develop scalable blockchain solutions specifically tailored for UAV communication
    systems. Performance and Latency: Blockchain transactions typically require multiple
    confirmations, leading to latency issues in UAV communication. Reducing transaction
    confirmation times and minimizing latency is crucial, especially in time-critical
    applications. Exploring novel consensus algorithms and optimization techniques
    to improve the performance of blockchain-assisted UAV communication systems is
    an area that requires further investigation. Energy Efficiency: UAVs are often
    resource constrained in terms of battery life and computing power. Integrating
    blockchain technology into UAV communication systems can introduce additional
    energy overhead due to computational requirements and network communication. Developing
    energy efficient protocols and mechanisms to minimize the energy consumption of
    blockchain operations in UAV communication is an important research area. Real-World
    Deployments and Testing: While there are theoretical studies and simulations exploring
    blockchain-assisted UAV communication, real-world deployments and comprehensive
    testing in operational environments are limited. More empirical studies and field
    trials are necessary to validate the feasibility, performance, and effectiveness
    of blockchain solutions in practical UAV communication scenarios. Regulatory and
    Legal Considerations: Blockchain technology introduces regulatory and legal challenges
    in UAV communication systems, such as data privacy, compliance, and liability
    issues. Understanding and addressing these regulatory and legal considerations
    are essential for the widespread adoption of blockchain-assisted UAV communication
    systems. Cost and Infrastructure Requirements: Implementing blockchain technology
    in UAV communication systems may require significant infrastructure and resource
    investments. The cost implications and feasibility of deploying blockchain solutions
    in UAV communication need to be carefully evaluated, especially for small-scale
    UAV operations and resource-constrained environments. Addressing these gaps and
    limitations will be crucial for advancing the field of blockchain-assisted UAV
    communication systems and realizing their full potential in enabling secure, trusted,
    and efficient UAV operations in various applications. Whereas our study presents
    a comprehensive review covers several aspects, including some potential factors.

    UAV communication systems, including their scalability, latency, energy consumption,
    and fault tolerance. Regulatory and Legal Aspects: This aspect covers data privacy,
    intellectual property, liability, and safety regulations. Economic Aspects: This
    aspect covers the implementing and maintaining the system, the potential cost
    savings and revenue opportunities, and the impact on the UAV industry. D. Contributions
    and Organization Few recent research focuses on improving the privacy and security
    of UAV communication networks using blockchain technology. However, there needs
    to be more research on combining technologies such as blockchain, UAVs, FL, and
    B5G communication. This gap motivates us to investigate the potential benefits
    of these technologies when combined. The key contributions of this article are
    highlighted as follows: This article provides a comprehensive exploration of the
    integration of multiple technologies such as UAVs, blockchain, next-generation
    wireless communication, and FL for future intelligent applications. We also cover
    the necessary enabling technologies for a reliable UAV network, such as B5G communication
    for massive connectivity, ultra-reliable low latency (uRLLC), and higher data
    rates. In addition, blockchain is used for security and privacy, while FL is used
    for distributed learning and collaborative intelligence. We throughly discuss
    privacy and security of data in UAV communication as blockchain technology has
    the potential to enhance the privacy and security of drone communication by providing
    a decentralized and tamper-proof system for data storage and transmission. Furthermore,
    this study covers various aspects and provides a holistic view of the technology,
    its benefits, and potential challenges of more secure and privacy-aware systems
    capable of integrating distributed learning. The rest of the article is organized
    as follows; Section II presents an overview of preliminary topics such as blockchain
    technologies, data security and privacy concerns in communication systems, and
    UAV communication systems. Section III explores the role of blockchain in UAV
    networks, while Section IV analyzes data privacy and security concerns in blockchain-enabled
    UAV security solutions. Section V discusses the challenges and open research directions.
    Finally, Section VI provides concluding remarks. SECTION II. Blockchain-Enabled
    UAV Networks: Preliminaries and Overview This section presents a summary of the
    blockchain-enabled UAV network and preliminary information. It briefly discusses
    the evolution of UAV technology, related applications, a conceptual communication
    framework, and the challenges that come with it. Furthermore, a primer on the
    fundamentals of blockchain technology explains. A. UAV Communication Systems The
    UAVs or drones are operated remotely by ground control systems (GCS), also known
    as ground cockpits, either by human pilots or autonomous systems such as autopilot,
    which require no human intervention. Initially, UAVs were designed for military
    and surveillance applications, however, rapid research and development significantly
    reduced the cost of UAV manufacturing. As a result, UAV technology is being adopted
    in many commercial and non-military applications like intelligent city surveillance,
    delivery services, agriculture, search and rescue, weather monitoring, filmmaking
    [18], photography and innovative healthcare [19]. The communication system is
    vital to UAV applications because it connects the flying node, the GCS, the stationary
    nodes, and the infrastructure. Therefore, the entire system has the communication
    capacity of drone-to-ground communication (D2G), drone-to-drone communication
    (D2D), drone-to-satellite communication (D2S) and drone-to-cellular communication
    (D2C). D2G: In D2G communication, the ground station controller monitors the UAV''s
    flight path. Then, on-duty technicians or field staff start the flight control,
    upload the path to the flight control, and set up parameters for automatic takeoff
    and landing, such as closing speed, lift angle, climb height, and end altitude.
    D2G communication ensures the smooth operation of the task assigned to UAVs. Moreover,
    the job of the GCS is to collect data captured by the UAVs and send the control
    command based on adherence. Therefore, a secure connection between the UAV and
    the GCS is required. D2D: In most existing applications, multi-UAV systems and
    ad hoc networks are used, where two or more UAVs participate in completing the
    task. The fundamental design challenge for the multi-UAV system [20] is communication
    and coordination among multiple devices. UAVs serve as mobile ad hoc networks
    (MANETs) for communication while in flight. As a result, in a MANET environment,
    each UAV is considered a mobile node. An open system interconnection (OSI) framework
    is commonly used, including the OSI model''s data link, network, transport, and
    application stages, which include the physical layer security [21], data link,
    network transport, and application stages. The communication of each UAV with
    the ground station limits the system''s capabilities when there are multiple UAVs.
    D2S: UAV satellite communication is predominantly used beyond LoS communications.
    Due to the earth’s rotation, standard LoS datalinks are rendered unusable over
    long distances. Moreover, drones may fly beyond the range of terrestrial networks,
    including 5G and other cellular services. A satellite can instead relay and amplify
    radio or microwave frequency signals between a vehicle and its BS. In regions
    without wireless communication infrastructure, the military-based application
    uses D2S. GPS devices ensure real-time location tracking for drones and facilitate
    drone communication via satellite links. However, this setup can also be useful
    in exceptional emergencies like earthquakes and floods. D2C: Communication between
    aircraft, or air-to-air (A2A) communications, occurs during missions involving
    multiple UAVs. In these cases, UAVs work together and coordinate using low-power
    wireless technologies (like bluetooth and zigbee) to send and receive data directly
    or via a series of intermediate nodes. Here, a single UAV operates within a network
    of UAVs, where they all share information and complete the flight mission. But
    the throughput and transmission bandwidth of D2D communications is extremely low.
    B. Data Security and Privacy Specifications in UAV Network Internet-connected
    UAVs are prone to cyber-attacks, posing profound uncertainty to the security and
    privacy of their users. Such attacks fall into five broad categories: confidentiality,
    integrity, availability, authenticity, and privacy attack. Fig. 2 presents the
    percentage of attacks compiled in recent surveys [22]. The following section describes
    the specifications of each intrusion. The risk of passive and active attacks is
    heightened by the lack of security measures for UAVs operating in the national
    airspace. In this article, we categorize the potential vulnerabilities of UAVs
    into four groups: sensor level attacks, hardware level attacks, software level
    attacks, and communication level attacks. In Fig. 3, we provide a detailed breakdown
    of the threats and vulnerabilities that UAVs face based on their functional level.
    We then review the various attacks and their corresponding countermeasures currently
    available in the literature. Figure 1. Illustrative overview of structure survey
    and reading map. Show All Figure 2. Percentage of different attacks on UAV network
    [22]. Show All Figure 3. Exploitable security gaps and solutions. Show All Communication-level
    Attacks: UAV flight control and data transmission require effective communication
    protocols. Typically, UAVs communicate with the GCS wirelessly. This section examines
    the vulnerabilities, threats and attacks that can compromise the confidentiality,
    integrity, authenticity, and accessibility of UAV communication. Communication-level
    vulnerabilities and threats can be categorized based on the following communication
    layers. Physical & MAC Layer Vulnerabilities and Attacks: The security of UAV
    communication networks is compromised due to vulnerabilities at different layers
    of the communication protocol. In this regard, physical MAC layer vulnerabilities
    and attacks have been identified in the complex D2G wireless communication network.
    A recent study [23] reports three zero-day attacks on commercial Wi-Fi-based UAVs,
    including the Parrot Bebop UAV. Network Layer Vulnerabilities and Attacks: Additionally,
    the ad hoc mode of UAV networks known as the flying ad hoc network (FANET) poses
    serious threats due to its dynamic topology. A previous study [24] highlights
    the security risks of a UAV public safety network. UAV routing protocols are particularly
    vulnerable due to the limited resources and lack of wireless encryption in these
    networks, as discusses in [25]. Eavesdropping Attacks: Sniffing or snooping attacks
    are like eavesdropping on communication''s confidentiality, integrity, authenticity,
    and availability to access information, which is information theft. The UAV sends
    or receives data to the user; attacks are undetectable. Typically, this is due
    to the nature of the operation, i.e., standard network transmission. DoS Attacks:
    In the DoS, the communication protocol layers and services during this threat
    result in a degradation in system performance. This attack will originate from
    a sole source and deal in several ways. Some commonly used techniques to deal
    with DoS attacks include network firewalls and intrusion detection systems. Man-in-the-Middle
    Attacks: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks involve interfering with user-to-UAV
    communication. It is also the most effective scenario for an active eavesdropper
    attack, in which the person conducting the availability communicates directly
    with the person being eavesdropped upon. Then it starts sending messages back
    and forth between the two. As a result, the user and the UAV believe they are
    communicating with one another, but the attacker has complete control over the
    interaction. Replay Attacks: Eavesdropping is a potential attack in UAV networks,
    where the adversary intercepts multiple requests and replays legitimate data to
    the UAVs. This can result in the UAVs receiving repeated data, and without the
    implementation of replay protection, they may be unable to distinguish between
    genuine and malicious requests. Forgery Attacks: By sending a spoof request to
    unauthenticated UAVs, an adversary can compromise their ability to communicate
    securely. An adversary disrupts D2G communication by creating a malicious request
    that looks legitimate. FANETs Routing Attacks: MANETs routing protocols are vulnerable
    to passive and active attacks, such as injecting malicious nodes, controlling
    network traffic, or interrupting routing features. Most of these attacks can also
    target routing protocols on FANETs. We categorize these attacks based on their
    routing functionality into three categories. The first category is path discovery
    attacks, which aim to control traffic and include blackhole [26], sleep deprivation
    [27], sybil attacks [28], and wormhole [29] attacks. The second category is route
    maintenance attacks, which attempt to corrupt routing control packets and include
    flooding and byzantine [30] attacks. The third category is data forwarding attacks
    that affect payload traffic, such as real-time video traffic [31]. Jamming Attacks:
    The UAV network is built with epidemic routing, one of the best delay-tolerant
    routing protocols. As a result, it is impossible to predict when or where an attack
    will occur, how long it will last, who it will target, or what tactics will be
    used. When a UAV goes into autopilot flight mode, communication is lost with the
    control station, and the drone is vulnerable to a GPS spoofing attack. This type
    of connection break happens when an attack, jamming, is sent from an enemy''s
    ground station. Even if the drone is still in range of the control unit, a jamming
    attack will cause it to enter autopilot mode. Attackers use jamming techniques
    to gain access to the UAV and then spoof GPS signals to ensure it lands in a designated
    area if the UAV loses contact with the control station, as it would in the more
    common and unpredictable circumstances, it will be unable to activate the safety
    return-to-home (RTH) feature. Transport Layer Vulnerabilities and Attacks: Communication
    protocols used by UAVs are vulnerable to attacks if they lack proper security
    measures to ensure privacy, integrity, availability, and authenticity. The MAVLink
    protocol is one of the widely used communication protocols for UAVs, and recent
    studies suggest that it is susceptible to attacks such as internet control message
    protocol (ICMP) flooding and packet injection. Therefore, it is critical to implement
    secure transport layer protocols to protect UAV communication from potential attacks.
    The authors of [32] classify MAVLink attacks into four types based on how data
    is compromised includes interception, modification, interruption, and fabrication
    attacks. Since the MAVLink protocol lacks authentication and encryption, attackers
    can intercept communication traffic and collect data exchanged between the GCS
    and UAVs. On the other hand, uranus link only provides integrity protection through
    the checksum field in the messages, according to the design and implementation
    of uranus link for real-world applications [33]. However, an attacker capable
    of intercepting exchanged packets can exploit this vulnerability and reveal mission-critical
    information [34]. Sensor-level Attacks: GPS data jamming, false sensor data injection,
    and sensory-channel attacks are examples of sensor-based attacks. GPS Data Jamming:
    During a UAV''s mission, the GPS receiver receives coordinates from satellites
    and sends them to the GCS. However, an adversary can disrupt the GPS signals,
    causing a GPS data jamming attack that can disorient the UAV [35]. Such attacks
    can lead to loss of control over the UAV and potential hijacking of the drone.
    False Sensor Data Injection: The injection of false sensor data into a UAV''s
    flight controller can have severe consequences on external sensors such as electro-optical
    and infrared sensors (EO/IR), leading to instability of the UAV [36]. Such attacks
    can be initiated by injecting false sensor data into the flight controller system
    or by sending false signals to the sensors. GPS spoofing is a common technique
    used for injections or data. As GPS signal broadcasts are typically unencrypted
    and unauthenticated, attackers can alter the GPS receiver of the UAV and gain
    control over it [37]. In this study, authors in [38] demonstrates the effect of
    GPS spoofing on UAVs, which causes the drone to respond to false signals and leads
    to the malfunction of its navigation system. Sensory-channel Attacks: UAVs use
    a variety of sensors, and their sensory channels (e.g., infrared, acoustic, and
    light) serve as attack vectors. Software-level Attacks: Malicious software and
    zero-day vulnerabilities contain software-level vulnerabilities and threats on
    UAVs. Zero-day Vulnerabilities: Zero-day vulnerabilities and malicious software
    pose serious threats to the security and privacy of UAVs. The flight stack or
    GCS software of UAVs may contain unknown defects, such as buffer overflow or DoS,
    which can be exploited by adversaries until patches are released by manufacturers.
    Promptly updating UAV systems for each patch released is therefore essential for
    operators to mitigate such vulnerabilities. Malicious Software: Malicious software,
    such as UAV malware, can infiltrate the GCS and flight controller, leading to
    sensitive data loss and loss of control over the UAV system. Attackers who gain
    access to the UAV''s flight stack can shut down the system, causing DoS and disrupting
    the flight mission. Moreover, malware such as Maldrone, SkyJack, and Snoopy can
    compromise the security and privacy of UAVs. Maldrone infects the flight controller,
    enabling the attacker to control the UAV and act as a proxy for the drone''s flight
    controller and sensor communications, allowing the compromised drone to land anywhere.
    SkyJack is a hijacking malware that can be installed on an infected drone, taking
    over other legitimate drones [39]. Through a Wi-Fi de-authentication attack, compromising
    the entire system. On the other hand, Snoopy can be installed on a drone to steal
    personal information from public users. It tricks users into connecting to a fake
    Wi-Fi network, allowing it to follow its users and collect their personal information.
    Therefore, UAV operators must be aware of the risks posed by malicious software
    and take necessary precautions to secure their systems [40]. Hardware-level Attacks:
    Hardware-based attacks on UAVs include hijacking, supply chain attacks, battery
    attacks, and RF module attacks. These attacks target the physical components of
    the UAV, such as its hardware and electronics, to compromise its security and
    disrupt its operation. In addition to hardware-based attacks, UAVs are also vulnerable
    to attacks that involve hardware reverse engineering. By analyzing the internal
    structure and characteristics of the UAV''s hard chip, an attacker can gain valuable
    information about the system and potentially exploit its vulnerabilities. It is
    essential to implement robust security measures to protect against hardware-based
    attacks and hardware reverse engineering to ensure the safety and security of
    UAV operations [41]. C. Fundamentals of Blockchain Technology Blockchain is a
    decentralized, distributed ledger that facilitates secure and transparent tracking
    of transaction records within a network. Transactions can involve physical assets
    such as cars and houses or intangible assets such as intellectual property, patents,
    and copyrights. The core components of blockchain technology include distributed
    ledgers, immutable records, and smart contracts. Additionally, blockchain''s innovation
    ensures data security and confidentiality, enabling trust without the involvement
    of third parties. Furthermore, the blockchain system is resistant to monopolies,
    allowing any node to withstand a monopoly threat and participate in the decision-making
    process, thus promoting the democratization of blockchain. The key components
    of blockchain technology are straightforward, despite its distributed nature.
    Six distinct zones make up the fundamentals of blockchain technology: The transmission
    control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) network [42], peer-to-peer protocols
    [43], cryptography algorithms [44], execution, and transactions [45] and smart
    contract. Additionally, the simplest architecture of blockchain technology consists
    of digital signatures and hash functions, as well as Dapps and smart contracts.
    Cryptographic hashing and digital signature systems are employed by blockchain
    technology for data security. Although blockchains do not always use cryptographic
    hashing or digital signatures, the distributed ledger system of the technology
    enhances security through blockchain hashing, digital signatures, and digital
    ledgers. Figure 4. Simplified operation of blockchain technology. Show All Figure
    5. Asymmetric key cryptography secure blockchain transactions. Show All Hash Functions:
    Each result in the cryptographic hashing process is associated with a unique digital
    fingerprint. The length of a string can serve as an input for the cryptographic
    hash function, while the result is always of a fixed length. Moreover, the hash
    possesses properties that render it collision-free, concealed, and capable of
    easily solving puzzles. The National Security Agency (NSA) developed secure hash
    algorithms (SHA), namely SHA-256 and SHA-512, as well as message digests such
    as MD2, MD3, and MD6. As a result, they are unable to obtain the input that was
    initially introduced or perform the inverse function [46]. A Digitized Ledger:
    A digitized ledger system was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 [47]. This
    system facilitates the replication of transactions between computers, linked together
    to prevent record tampering. An immutable record-keeping system eliminates the
    need for third parties. Chaining together the hashes of previous blocks create
    a chain of blocks. A single block stores nonces, previous block hashes, merkle
    roots of timestamps, block numbers, and hashes. Private blockchains fall into
    two categories: public [48] and consortium blockchains. Fig. 4 illustrates a simplified
    model of how a blockchain system operates. Integrating drones and blockchain technologies
    is a practical possibility, with both technologies being investigated and refined
    simultaneously across many industrial applications. Blockchain technology for
    drones has the potential to increase operational effectiveness and circumvent
    many of the current potential barriers to drone attacks, as outlined in this article.
    Digital Signatures: Similar to hash functions, digital signatures are an underlying
    cryptographic building block. As with a digital signature, the key difference
    is that, unlike a traditional signature, this one cannot be copied and pasted
    from one manuscript to another. It must instead be signed only once and interpreted
    by any third party. Decentralization: The decentralized nature of blockchain is
    a distinct advantage that is leveraged in all blockchain-related applications.
    In [49], the authors propose a blockchain-based key management scheme for heterogeneous
    FANET, in which all drones collectively maintain the public key information through
    blockchain in a decentralized and distributed way, without any participation from
    a third party, thus avoiding a single point of failure. If each drone stores the
    details of the other''s flight paths in the blockchain, the effects of jamming
    attacks can be reduced, as collisions can be avoided. Asymmetric-Key Cryptography:
    The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) [50] garners and affirms
    digital signatures to use public-private vital tuples. Specific domain parameters
    specified for a particular period are subject to validation. The measures of the
    advertised blockchain transactions are shown in Fig. 5. Consensus Mechanisms:
    The next block acknowledgement is one of the most important parts of blockchain
    technology. This problem can be tackled by incorporating a consensus model. Different
    blockchain consensus mechanism and their working is present in Fig. 6. A blockchain
    network''s basic structure must acknowledge that a blockchain network should start
    with a public genesis block, making it the only pre-configured block. This is
    required for participation, and the primary objective of the consensus mechanism
    is to produce an acceptable outcome. For instance, preventing double spending,
    aligning economic incentives, and objecting to fair, equitable, and fault tolerance
    [51]. Consensus algorithms are used in blockchain networks to reach an agreement
    among various distributed nodes. Blockchain is vital since its distributed ledger
    keeps track of all module activities and makes the relevant information accessible
    to anyone using AI for in-depth analysis. Second, there is the potential for adversarial
    exploitation of smart contract codes that use AI to identify potential contract
    limitations. Such risks can be reduced by utilizing AI to increase the adaptability
    and intelligence of the smart contract. Third, more smart contracts and consumption
    optimization can reduce transaction authentication times by half, making them
    more sustainable and accessible to more participants. Other benefits include superior
    energy efficiency, increased reliability, and quicker decision-making. Figure
    6. Different blockchain consensus mechanisms. Show All SECTION III. Role of Blockchain
    in UAV Networks The use of blockchain technology in UAV networks can have significant
    meaning the data security and privacy by providing immutability, decentralization,
    encryption, smart contracts, and audibility. To assure data integrity, immutability,
    and transparency, distributed ledge simultaneously, the technology works together
    seamlessly to store decentralized data. However, a central server is sometimes
    required to keep a blockchain framework running smoothly. The decentralization
    of private and federated blockchains is only partial. In comparison to other centralized
    platforms, the blockchain provides greater security. It also needs cryptography
    to protect sensitive data in the ledger system. Cryptography is a complex process
    for encrypting data as a barrier against malicious cyber-attacks [52]. Safety
    is one of the most appealing uses of blockchain for UAVs. Unfortunately, highly
    centralized blockchains are inconvenient, even though UAVs can gather data from
    numerous sources. Which uses recognize fraudulent recommendations. Technology
    can identify fraudulent offers, and automated systems reject the request for an
    effective method of thwarting cyber-attack audibility centralized Domain Name
    System (DNS). Furthermore, there needs to be a key-entry point because of various
    centralization. Additionally, blockchain works best for organizations to stop
    DDoS attacks concealed in fake hardware. No viruses can enter the network thanks
    to hardware provenance on blockchain-based devices. A comprehensive review of
    blockchain-assisted UAV communication systems can cover several aspects listed
    below. Confidentiality: It entails preventing unauthorized users from accessing
    data. Like other network systems, UAV networks are vulnerable to confidentiality
    attacks such as data theft, sniffing, eavesdropping, and replay attacks. Several
    scenarios have been put forth in which a low-cost, tamper-proof blockchain-based
    system would protect the privacy of UAV networks [53]. Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA) regulations use an ID management system [54] on drones to authenticate and
    authorize users. Furthermore, they take advantage of delta drone international
    limited (DLT) ability to keep the information about the drones'' flight paths
    secret. The authors explained that blockchain employs asymmetric encryption and
    homomorphic obfuscation to raise the secrecy of the network. On the other hand,
    [55] utilize blockchain to preserve the confidentiality of the cached content
    by revealing only the essential vehicle substance for specific vehicles. A distributed
    crowd-monitoring system supported by drone swarms, this task aims to ensure that
    the supervision data is kept up-to-date, secure, and confidential [56]. Integrity:
    The study in [57] proves the data''s integrity while lowering the overall volume
    of direct requests made to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers. A blockchain,
    in contrast, enhanced their performance and the accuracy of the data shared between
    drones in an internet of drones (IoD) environment. Their technology chooses the
    miner to swarm UAVs to protect plants smartly. They use the DLT to keep data safe;
    in addition, ensuring the availability of services for UAVs in the airspace is
    a significant concern. A blockchain is decentralized; an excellent blockchain
    network should resist malicious entity attacks. Non-repudiation: Non-repudiation
    is another critical criterion for UAV network cybersecurity. This phrase refers
    to the incapacity to deny or avoid responsibility for one''s conduct using critical
    public infrastructure, such as when a UAV signs messages before sending them over
    the internet. As a condition for UAV networks, non-repudiation meets the requirement.
    Therefore, it suggests that a UAV may refuse to provide photographs of illegal
    content. In conclusion, A UAV system protects the required IoD infrastructure,
    and the study of [54] argues for four blockchain-based concepts to improve drone
    security. These facets digital fingerprint, data structure, consensus process
    and access control, underpin consensus methods and aid in preventing security
    breaches by empowering network nodes to determine an invoice. Availability: All
    the blockchain-based solutions proposed for unmanned aircraft system traffic management
    (UTM) [58] architectures are fundamentally similar regarding a single point of
    failure. However, they are decentralized, requiring little or no centralization
    authority. For example, the authors [59] present a zone-based, decentralized system
    for registering and validating drones. They designate a reliable ground-based
    source in their architecture. The authentic is a drone control agent within a
    predetermined boundary. They maintain availability by allowing neighbours to participate
    in the authentication scheme. Drone controllers will stand in for failed ones
    at the UTM. In this context, the authors in [60] deny blockchain architecture''s
    existence. According to them, their architecture eliminates latency between nodes
    by securing communication. In decentralized systems, it presents an advantage
    for sensitive applications. Additionally, smart contracts with transparency and
    immutability support the model. Thus, the task is accomplished using a decentralized
    method resistant to attacks on Ethereum and the interplanetary file system (IPFS).
    Authenticity: Finally, UAV networks must ensure the legitimacy of users and messages.
    Authentication is the capacity to detect real user identity authentication issues
    in UAV network attacks, such as cloaking. The UAV network also includes cryptographic
    data for authentication and privacy, as discusses in [61]. However, placement
    improves total spectral network efficiency a straightforward blockchain paradigm
    that is secure allows for anonymity and work accreditation [62]. They reject an
    adversary''s request for a surveillance UAV, an attack model that permits altering
    a blockchain before verifying it. Users reject both the handoff problem and the
    malleability attack. Applying a unique blockchain architecture adds a delay every
    time a UAV moves between GCS. A. Building a Secure UAV Communication System A
    secure blockchain-assisted UAV communication system and it''s technical considerations
    and best practices involve several technical aspects few of them listed below.
    Blockchain Architecture Design: The first step in building a blockchain-assisted
    UAV communication system is to design the blockchain architecture. This involves
    selecting the appropriate blockchain platform, such as Ethereum or Hyperledger,
    and determining the consensus mechanism, block size and transaction rate that
    best suits the system''s requirements. Smart Contract Development: Smart contracts
    are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain network. They are used to
    automate certain functions in a blockchain-assisted UAV communication system,
    such as data authentication and access control. Developing smart contracts involves
    coding the contract logic in a programming language such as Solidity and testing
    the contracts using a development environment like Remix. Network Infrastructure
    Setup: Setting up the network infrastructure for a blockchain-assisted UAV communication
    system involves configuring the nodes that make up the blockchain network, including
    full and light nodes. It also involves setting up communication channels between
    the UAVs and the blockchain network, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks.
    Cryptography Implementation: Cryptography plays a critical role in securing the
    data transmitted between the UAVs and the blockchain network. Implementing cryptography
    involves selecting appropriate cryptographic algorithms and protocols, such as
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), which configure
    them in the system''s software. Authors in [63] present a BETA-UAV blockchain-based
    efficient authentication for secure UAV communication that promises how BETA-UAV
    resists attacks. The objective is to enable mutual authentication and freshness
    identification so that the UAV networks can establish secure communication channels.
    Proof-of-freshness or authentication protocols allow UAVs to integrate with these
    systems with minimal hassle and maximum security. User Interface Design: The user
    interface is the front end of the blockchain-assisted UAV communication system
    that allows users to interact with the system. User interface design involves
    designing the screens, menus, and buttons that users will interact with, as well
    as designing the user experience to be intuitive and easy to use. System Testing
    and Evaluation: Once the system has been built, it needs to be thoroughly tested
    and evaluated to ensure that it works as intended. This involves conducting functional
    testing, performance testing, and security testing to identify any bugs, performance
    issues, or security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. Table 2 compares
    consensus algorithms and how blockchain interacts with other languages. Cyberattacks
    are less likely to occur on the UAV network after integrating blockchain. This
    also results in a fork resolved by creating the longest chain. Table 3 describes
    cybersecurity-related problems in UAV networks. To prevent further forking, the
    longest chain can be built; for example, [64] utilize blockchain technology to
    protect data with cryptography. Data is therefore verified and encrypted to stop
    unauthorized modification. TABLE 2 Comparison Among Consensus Algorithms TABLE
    3 Cybersecurity-Related Requirement in UAV Networks B. Solution Taxonomy: Challenges
    and Constraints in UAV Networks Due to the unique characteristics of the UAV network,
    such as fluid topology, node mobility, and finicky links, it faces unique communication
    challenges compared to other wireless networks. Therefore, we categorize them
    in three directions: Security Constrain: Some drones lack encryption on their
    onboard chips due to price or energy consumption considerations, leaving them
    vulnerable to attackers. This poses a threat to privacy, as attackers can easily
    access communication contents. Additionally, according to [9], drones without
    encryption can be easily hijacked, which is dangerous as it can lead to loss of
    control and heavy damage. Encryption, authentication is also crucial for UAV network
    communications. Without authentication, security threats such as tampering, replay
    attacks, spoofing, and impersonation can occur. For example, in the logistics
    industry, an attacker can impersonate a valid drone in the network and tamper
    with address information, resulting in cargo being sent to the wrong destination
    and causing property damage to the company and customers. Availability is also
    a significant concern, with DoS attacks being a common method that damages availability.
    During a DoS attack, the whole network could fail if the attacker goes after the
    GCS, which would be even worse. Power Constraint: The energy sources for drones
    in UAV networks are more expensive than those of vehicles in VANETs or mobile
    phones in MANETs. Moreover, drones'' battery lives may need to be increased even
    for routine tasks, much less bolstering the safety of human-to-human communications.
    Consequently, schemes designed for UAV networks must be compact and have low power
    consumption. Scalability Constrain: Drones in a UAV network constitute a dynamic
    3D topology in which the number of nodes, their positions, and their speeds constantly
    change. Consequently, links may form and disappear sporadically, and the network
    may frequently partition, resulting in unstable communications. Airborne jamming
    attacks exacerbate the situation. These communication stability issues may lead
    to drone collisions and task failure in self-organized UAV networks, which rely
    on cooperation to maintain performance. C. A Systematic Review of Security Issues
    in Blockchain-Assisted Systems A review of security issues in UAV-assisted systems
    is present in [20], where the authors employ blockchain technology to mitigate
    security threats. In a similar survey, the authors investigate blockchain applications
    in UAV communication, such as network security and decentralization [65]. Furthermore,
    the authors in [47] propose a comprehensive survey of blockchain-based communication
    systems for UAV networks. They introduce an IPFS for data storage to ensure user
    privacy and decrease transaction storage costs. The study in [66] also presents
    a systematic review of blockchain applications in UAV-assisted networks. The study
    summarizes how blockchain is used to ensure the security of UAV networks and divides
    UAV applications into several innovative categories. Blockchain technology offers
    a promising solution to data privacy concerns in UAV applications. As a distributed
    ledger, the blockchain securely records and tracks data without any centralized
    authority [67]. Blockchain technology ensures more reliability than other centralized
    systems. In particular, decentralization encrypts data to encode the information
    in the ledgers. Cryptography is a complex process for encrypting data as a barrier
    against malicious cyber-attacks [68]. In addition, this technology can identify
    fraudulent recommendations via an automated system and deny unauthorized requests.
    However, with the rising use of UAVs in various intelligent applications, collaborative
    intelligence, continuous learning, low latency, privacy, and massive connectivity
    are important. FANET dramatically improves the interoperability of UAVs and innovative
    solutions by providing a framework for AI to enhance its capabilities. As stated
    previously, traditional encryption techniques based on cryptography and trust
    are widely used in UAVs; however, this has changed with the advent of enabling
    technologies like AI, ML, FL etc. Blockchain Assisted UAV Solution: Multiple applications
    recruit UAVs with wireless connectivity, including health care services, armed
    services, precision agriculture, urban planning, maritime communication, wildlife
    conservation, and rescue operations. As mentioned above, commercial and social
    gains result from effective UAVs in various intelligent applications. However,
    although 5G and beyond blockchain with the UAV network have many benefits, some
    problems still need to be solved. Data Manipulation: 6G communication technology
    operates in a frequency range of 95 GHz–3 THz, has a data rate of 1 Tbps (uplink
    and downlink), and a bandwidth of 1 THz, which is high. Faster than the current
    5G, it generates massive data, requiring ML, deep learning, and Big Data analytic
    techniques to convert it into usable data [15]. Data Protection in UAV: Data security
    is essential when D2D and D2G communication occurs. ML and physical layer security
    techniques can protect the UAV system from hackers. It is possible for cyberattacks
    like DoS, masquerades, and spoofing to happen. However, there is a prospect that
    the data will modify a lot due to quantum attacks, which might result in errors.
    Therefore, the blockchain-based system offered can address these data security
    issues. Nevertheless, its efficient real-time deployment is still in its infancy
    [65]. Standardization: According to organizations, the IEEE and international
    telecommunications union (ITU) have yet to finalize standards and regulations
    for blockchain technology. As a result, good rules, regulations, and advice for
    the real-time deployment of blockchain on the UAV network mean that standards
    and guidelines for using UAVs over the 6G communication channel must be simple
    and easy to follow. As a result, it is only elementary to implement blockchain
    in real-world 6G networks with standardization of the blockchain technology. Vulnerability
    Assessment in Secure Systems: Programming languages such as Solidity, Kotlin,
    and Java are designed for implementing smart contracts (SCs). For trusted members
    of the public, it builds trust agreements take place without any central authority.
    Therefore, it may be vulnerable to eavesdropping and MITM phishing attacks [69].
    As a result, appropriate testing solutions require before deployment and verification
    of the security of SC vulnerabilities. Energy-efficiency: UAVs are battery-powered
    flying machines with limited processing power, storage capacity, and response
    times. Implementing smart contract and consensus mechanisms [70] on UAVs in a
    blockchain and 6G-based UAV network requires more processing power, leading to
    a computational power bottleneck. Therefore, optimizing the UAV network and operations
    is necessary to lessen bottleneck occurrences. Handover Delays: UAV communication
    data''s safety and privacy are paramount. Centralized cloud and currently available
    fog systems offer some security, but there is only one point of failure. This
    survey also lists other gaps in the current state-of-the-art solutions researchers
    have proposed worldwide. Cyber-attacks, such as spoofing, eavesdropping, connecting,
    jamming, fabrication, and access control attacks, might compromise centralized
    solutions. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, may be a viable solution
    to the above problems. However, for applications where confidence assurance is
    necessary, it is essential to use it effectively. The hash of the previous block
    links the blocks. A block header contains hashes, headers, prior blocks, Merkle
    root nonces, and timestamps in a block''s data structure. Here are some practical
    examples of blockchain-assisted UAV communication that showcase the real-world
    applications of this research: Drone Delivery Networks: Blockchain can be used
    to create decentralized and secure drone delivery networks. Smart contracts on
    the blockchain can facilitate automated delivery operations, including order verification,
    payment processing, and tracking. This enables transparent and efficient delivery
    services while ensuring trust and accountability among the involved parties. UAV
    Traffic Management: Blockchain can play a vital role in managing and coordinating
    UAV traffic in urban airspace. By recording flight plans, permissions, and real-time
    flight data on the blockchain, multiple UAVs can securely and autonomously communicate
    and coor- dinate their movements. This improves airspace safety, minimizes collisions,
    and allows for more efficient use of limited airspace resources. Emergency Disaster
    Response and Management: During natural disasters or emergency situations, UAVs
    are often deployed for search and rescue missions, damage assessment, and communication
    support. Blockchain can enhance these operations by providing a decentralized
    communication network for UAVs, ensuring secure and reliable data transmission,
    and enabling coordination among multiple response teams in a transparent manner.
    Environmental Monitoring: UAVs equipped with sensors can collect valuable environmental
    data, such as air quality, temperature, or water pollution levels. By leveraging
    blockchain, this data can be securely stored and shared among stakeholders, including
    researchers, government agencies, and environmental organizations. Blockchain
    ensures data integrity, authenticity, and traceability, enabling more effective
    environmental monitoring and decision-making processes. Precision Agriculture:
    UAVs are increasingly used in precision agriculture for crop monitoring, pest
    detection, and irrigation management. Blockchain can enable secure and transparent
    data sharing among farmers, agronomists, and other stakeholders. Smart contracts
    can automate agreements for sharing agricultural data, ensuring fair compensation
    and fostering collaboration within the ecosystem. UAV Swarm Coordination: Blockchain
    technology can facilitate the coordination and synchronization of UAV swarms.
    By recording swarm parameters, mission objectives, and individual UAV behavior
    on the blockchain, swarm members can autonomously interact, exchange information,
    and collaboratively perform complex tasks. This enables efficient and robust swarm
    operations for applications such as surveillance, mapping, or infras- tructure
    inspection. These practical examples highlight the diverse applications of blockchain-assisted
    UAV communication across various industries and domains. They demonstrate how
    blockchain technology can address critical challenges, enhance operational efficiency,
    and enable new possibilities in UAV-based services and applications. Blockchain-assisted
    UAV challenges and their deployment scenarios are highlighted in Fig. 7. The safety
    and privacy of UAV communication data are of paramount importance. Currently available
    centralized cloud and fog systems offer some level of security, but there is only
    one point of failure [72]. This survey also lists other gaps in the current state-of-the-art
    solutions researchers propose worldwide. Cyber-attacks, such as spoofing, eavesdropping,
    meaconing, connecting, jamming, fabrication, and access control assaults, might
    compromise centralized solutions. Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology,
    may be a viable solution to the above problems. However, for applications where
    confidence assurance is necessary, it is essential to use it effectively. The
    hash of the previous block links the blocks. A block header is a piece of information
    such as hashes, headers, prior blocks, Merkle root nonce''s, and timestamps in
    a block''s data structure. Blockchain-Assited FL via UAV Network: The use of UAVs
    and blockchain technology is in its infancy due to blockchain''s immutable nature;
    UAV-assisted [71] communication enables shelter from cyber threats. Fig. 8 represents
    the blockchain layer, data sensing, application layer, or UAV application and
    control environment for blockchain-assisted UAV networks. The benefits of blockchain
    in UAV-assisted FL communication networks include scalability, privacy, security,
    immutability, transparency, and efficiency [73]. Combining FL and blockchain in
    UAV-assisted applications provides additional benefits [74]. In light of this,
    multiple kinds of research have recently been proposed to exploit the potential
    of UAVs and blockchain in distributed model training. For instance, the authors
    in [75] proposes a federated blockchain (FedBlock), which records and updates
    the local model parameter via a specific distributed ledger. This approach replaces
    the centralized FL server used for aggregation and operates a chain for consensus.
    The study in [76] introduces blockchain for the spectrum sharing of drones in
    the wireless network. The proposed architecture uses consortium blockchain technology
    to develop a secure spectrum-sharing mechanism in a UAV-assisted cellar network.
    The proposed architecture uses consortium blockchain technology to provide a safe
    spectrum-sharing means in a UAV-assisted cellar network. The authors in [77] propose
    a novel serverless architecture for FL enabled by blockchain and UAV technologies.
    The simulation outcomes affirm the advantages of blockchain by correlating the
    system''s end-to-end efficiency in terms of latency and confidentiality. Figure

    Show All SECTION IV. Data Security Analysis in BC-Enable UAV Network The use of
    blockchain in UAV communication has the potential to enhance data privacy and
    security in various ways. Data Encryption: Blockchain technology can encrypt the
    data being transmitted between UAVs to prevent unauthorized access or interception
    of the data. Authentication: Blockchain can help to verify the authenticity of
    the UAVs communicating with each other. By using public-key cryptography, each
    UAV can be assigned a unique digital identity, which can be verified by the blockchain
    network. Immutable Record Keeping: Blockchain can maintain an immutable record
    of all communication between UAVs, ensuring that any tampering or modification
    of the communication is easily detected. Access Control: Blockchain can implement
    access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to UAV communication
    channels. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts can be used to automate certain security
    processes and ensure that certain conditions are met before communication is allowed
    between UAVs. Consensus Mechanisms: Blockchain can use consensus mechanisms to
    ensure that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the communication between
    UAVs. Blockchain is transparent, meaning that all participants in the network
    have access to the same information, making it easier to identify and track any
    attempts to access or modify the data. In the context of drone communication,
    blockchain can provide data security by creating a tamper-proof ledger of all
    the data and transactions exchanged between drones and GCS. This includes flight
    data, sensor readings, and other mission-critical information. By using blockchain,
    the data is secured and cannot be modified or deleted, ensuring that the data
    remains accurate and trustworthy. Additionally, blockchain''s decentralized nature
    makes it more difficult for hackers or malicious actors to interfere with the
    communication between drones and GCS. Moreover, blockchain employs cryptographic
    techniques to secure the data. For instance, data is encrypted and stored in blocks,
    and each block is linked to the previous one using a cryptographic hash function,
    creating an immutable and tamper-proof chain. Furthermore, blockchain can provide
    secure authentication and identity management for UAVs. Each UAV can have a unique
    digital identity, and the blockchain can be used to verify the identity of each
    UAV and ensure that only authorized UAVs can access the network. While numerous
    initiatives have been taken to realize a blockchain-based communication network,
    the dynamic network characteristics and real-time data processing requirements
    of a V2X communication scenario render the straightforward adoption of existing
    blockchain technology inappropriate. Even though blockchain has much potential
    to improve security and network management, the technology has much latency. This
    means that new blockchain algorithms with exceptionally low latency must be made
    before they can be used in 6G-V2X. However, the current blockchain technology''s
    limited throughput and scalability are also significant open issues that require
    extensive investigation. For example, the use of public blockchains can expose
    sensitive data to the public, and the integration of UAVs into blockchain networks
    can also introduce new vulnerabilities, such as rogue devices and DoS attacks.
    Therefore, further research is needed to address these concerns and develop effective
    solutions that can ensure the privacy and security of data in blockchain-enabled
    UAV communication. The blockchain-based UAV on communication can help with supply
    chain management [78], disaster response [79], relief operations [80], product
    delivery [81], aerial photography [82], and surveillance [83]. According to surveys,
    they have developed blockchain technology as one of the security solutions for
    UAV communications and outlined research challenges on blockchain-enabled UAV
    network security. This section discusses the functionalities and constraints of
    blockchain-enabled UAV communication and provides a comparative data security
    analysis. In contemporary computing systems, the decentralization of DNS using
    blockchain technology has emerged as a promising alternative to mitigate software
    attacks. By distributing content across multiple sites and enabling users to regulate
    the space between them, blockchain-based DNS [84] makes it impractical for malevolent
    actors to launch software attacks. Additionally, this approach confers legal ownership
    of the associated assets to authorized users, thereby preventing unauthorized
    access or alterations. Consequently, to ensure data privacy and security and the
    risk of unauthorized manipulation of the information is minimized. A hierarchical
    intrusion detection and reaction scheme to enhance the security of UAV networks
    against debilitating cyberattacks such as false information diffusion, GPS spoofing,
    jamming, and black hole and grey hole attacks [85]. The security of blockchain
    technology is heavily dependent on the cost required to breach the system and
    alter newly generated data, as this is essential for maintaining the integrity
    of the blockchain-enabled UAV between the security of blockchain products. Therefore,
    brand identity is crucial, particularly in situations where a single excavator
    (or pool) holds the majority of computational power, leading to a 51% attack on
    the current blockchain history. Furthermore, such an attack may result in undesirable
    consequences, such as the manipulation of transactions, double-spending, and other
    forms of cyber-attacks. This occurs because the dominant excavator gains more
    power in the administration process and generates more results in work verification
    than any other excavator on the blockchain network [86]. SECTION V. Challenges
    and Open Research Directions The field of UAV communication presents both challenges
    and opportunities through the integration of key technical drivers. This article
    focuses on the holistic integration of several critical technical drivers, including
    confidentiality, variable latency constraints, bogus parameter updates, obstruction
    detection, communication delay, and encouraging the edge, safety, and integrity
    of UAV traffic management devices to participate in the mining process. Maintaining
    the confidentiality of sensitive information while allowing for effective communication
    and collaboration among UAV data security is a primary challenge associated with
    this integration. Additionally, variable latency constraints pose a significant
    challenge, requiring the development of sophisticated algorithms and communication
    protocols to ensure UAVs can operate safely and efficiently despite unpredictable
    delays. Bogus parameter updates and obstruction detection also present significant
    challenges, as they can compromise the safety and reliability of UAV operations.
    Communication delays are another critical challenge, leading to miscommunication
    and coordination errors between UAVs and traffic management devices. Despite these
    challenges, integrating key technical drivers presents significant opportunities
    for improving UAV communication''s safety, efficiency, and effectiveness. Encouraging
    the edge, security, and integrity of UAV traffic management devices to participate
    in the mining process can improve the accuracy and reliability of traffic management
    data in UAV delivery services while providing valuable insights into the behaviour
    of UAVs in different operational contexts. Effective solutions will require innovative
    approaches and collaboration among various stakeholders, including UAV manufacturers,
    UAV delivery service providers, and researchers. The use of blockchain technology
    can increase the reliability and efficiency of data transfer and storage by employing
    protocols and guidelines to prevent unauthorized access. Apart from trust issues,
    the UAV industry is grappling with several challenges, including the need for
    effective air traffic management and the trustworthiness of operations in crowded
    areas. Strict safety protocols and regulations must be implemented to address
    these concerns, including robust encryption mechanisms and strict access control
    policies to ensure confidentiality. Ensuring compliance with flight regulations
    is also critical to maintaining public trust and safety. In the realm of UAV communication
    systems, several attributes are deemed advantageous, including low cost, high
    adaptability and agility, and the ability to cover a larger area than terrestrial
    systems, resolve traffic issues promptly, and deploy easily. However, challenges
    persist, such as dynamic channel conditions and difficulties integrating UAVs
    into established networks due to limited battery capacity and load. In exceptional
    cases, such as in highland areas with limited communication resources, cellular
    networks present the most promising option in terms of range and scalability.
    Nevertheless, several issues must still be addressed, including connection reliability,
    network availability, energy efficiency, and security concerns in real-world situations.
    A. Communication Perspective Challanges UAVs are envisioned as a vital part of
    future 6G mobile networks. The demanding prerequisites of these applications require
    the guidance of advances like reconfigurable intelligence surfaces (RIS), terahertz
    (THz) communication, AI, and small cell systems. Remote and real-time control
    (RRC), high-precision positioning and seamless coverage, and multimedia transmission
    UAV lightweight authentication schemes include industrial IoT, UAV, healthcare
    IoT, satellite IoT, and self-driving vehicles [94]. UAVs'' major principles are
    deployment flexibility, LoS connectivity, and controlled mobility [95]. In addition,
    the UAV-to-everything (U2X) networks are being grown alongside 6G and IoE [96].
    Furthermore, for self-driving UAVs to work efficiently beyond the visual line
    of sight, a solid UTM system is required [97]. UTMs need efficiency, security,
    and hazard communication to manage their movement in urban airspace. Consequently,
    6G established a UTM ecosystem centred on terrestrial and non-terrestrial capabilities
    that enable mobile, aerial, and satellite communication. Embracing UAVs as ABS
    raises ground station reach, resulting in better coverage and cell-free communications.
    6G heterogeneous network integration requires a coherent framework composed of
    key enabling technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, visible
    light communication (VLC), quantum communications, and THz communications [98].
    The significant concerns are listed below: The Aerial Nature of Drones: Presents
    a significant challenge in cellular communication. Most existing cellular antennas
    are designed to point downward, complicating drone communication in several ways.
    Firstly, drones have a weaker signal to work with, making it difficult to maintain
    a stable connection. Secondly, drones may need to switch between multiple BS,
    resulting in frequent handoff discussions. Security Scrutinize: Recently, the
    use of UAVs has become increasingly popular among criminals and youth due to their
    small size and ease of use. This has raised concerns, as terrorists have also
    begun using UAVs for their operations, taking advantage of their affordability
    and accessibility. UAVs can be used to transport weapons, hazardous chemicals,
    and even explosives that can cause damage to buildings and structures. Furthermore,
    military analysts are worried about the potential of UAVs being used for espionage,
    surveillance, and gathering political and military intelligence. While research
    has focused on addressing security concerns for nations and organizations, the
    security and structure of UAVs remain critical areas of study. Safety Concerns:
    Ensuring drone flight safety is crucial for conducting drone operations in specific
    circumstances while maintaining an acceptable level of protection. Therefore,
    the drone industry offers a four-phase model for developing drones. Assessment
    of Risk of UAVs: This critical approach determines the acceptable solution in
    correspondence with the effort required. In any organization, usability is essential,
    as it establishes a framework for securing and maintaining reliable operations
    through permission and insurance. Additionally, the documented procedures must
    provide constant safety assurance, as the results determine the overall threat
    to unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) safety. The combination of two technologies
    presents several challenges that must be addressed. Implementing 5G requires a
    thorough examination of various structural and technical aspects. Clear regulatory
    frameworks should be developed and identified to facilitate the implementation
    of smart contracts. The scalability of blockchain technology should also be improved
    to accommodate numerous devices, each requiring a unique address. The presence
    of rogue devices may lead to network instability, making it difficult to inter-operate
    blockchain platforms and hindering the addition of new information. Scalability
    of Drone-chain Networks: Combining multiple drones to accomplish various tasks
    can create a drone network, which helps reduce the possibility of counterfeit
    drones and other security risks [99]. 5G is a significant leap in wireless communication
    technology, and it can achieve all the objectives using existing technology. A
    flying base station serves as both a user device and a relay, and each 5G use
    case has its unique requirements. Utilizing drones for communication during disasters
    is a creative and intelligent idea that can enable first responders and remote
    cities in attack zones to share orders and coordinate forces in war zones effectively.
    However, novel techniques and standards must be established before UAVs become
    more prevalent in UAV-assisted 5G communications. Integrating the three emerging
    technologies of blockchain, UAVs, and AI (FL, ML) can lead to revolutionary applications
    characterized by security, intelligence, and support for mission-critical scenarios.
    However, this integration presents several challenges that require further research
    to be useful [100]. Unfortunately, few studies have considered this research direction,
    and there is still ample room for contribution and improvement. Regarding latency,
    UAV networks require significant resources and extremely low latency when communicating
    with GCS to support real-time surveillance. In addition, adding blockchain to
    the UAV network architecture can induce further delay; for instance, transactions
    can take seconds or minutes to include in a block, and multiple blocks can exacerbate
    this delay. Furthermore, using FL algorithms can aggravate the latency problem
    due to the need to train models and transfer model updates between clients and
    a third-party server [101]. Thus, more research is necessary to accurately predict
    the system''s latency and address this issue. Another promising research direction
    is to consider power consumption accompanying various processes such as communication,
    sensing, training, and mining. Given that UAVs are resource-limited devices, designing
    a low-power scheme of lightweight blockchain and ML models can reduce the computational
    complexity of the integrated system, help scale the operations of UAVs, and generate
    a cost-effective and reliable network. Furthermore, UAVs will primarily be involved
    in many applications that require information exchange over wireless links. Therefore,
    designing a scheme that can classify operations based on their importance and
    prioritize transmission resources would also be an exciting research direction.
    B. Blockchain Perspective Challenges The 5G network is a decentralized system
    that eliminates the need for trusted external authority. The decentralization
    method also eliminates bottlenecks, resulting in more effective service delivery.
    Furthermore, the blockchain-enabled verification approach can improve quality
    of service (QoS), i.e., low latency and high throughput, but requires robust confidentiality
    security with the abolition of malicious BSs [102]. Recently, communication networks
    for UAVs can reimburse for insufficient wireless network coverage [103]. All whilst
    UAVs can deliver products [104] and collect real-time traffic flow data [105].
    According to new findings, UAVs can support content-centric networking and mobile
    edge computing [106]. However, ensuring trustworthiness and restricting disobedient
    UAVs in decentralized, untrusted UAV networks is tricky. The convergence of blockchain
    technology into UAV networks can ensure UAVs'' confidence. In addition, International
    Business Machines Corporation (IBM) resubmitted a patent application to create
    a blockchain-based system to safeguard the privacy and security of UAV data [107].
    To be precise, blocks in blockchains store information about UAVs, such as product
    lines, manufacturers, and adjacency to a specified territory. And inappropriate
    UAV behaviour can be recognized and identified regularly. There are several security
    challenges associated with blockchain-assisted UAV communication, including: Private
    Key Management: Private keys are used to sign transactions and secure the blockchain
    network. If a private key is lost or stolen, it can lead to unauthorized access
    and transactions. In a UAV network, private key management becomes more challenging
    due to the dynamic and distributed nature of the network. Malware and Cyber Attacks:
    UAVs are vulnerable to malware and cyber attacks, which can compromise the security
    and integrity of the blockchain network. Attackers can use malware to take control
    of UAVs or exploit vulnerabilities in the blockchain network to steal data or
    disrupt operations. Network Congestion: UAVs generate a large volume of data that
    needs to be processed and stored on the blockchain network. This can lead to network
    congestion and slow down the transaction processing time. As a result, the UAV
    network may become less efficient, and data may become more vulnerable to attacks.
    Scalability: Blockchain networks are not inherently scalable, and the addition
    of UAVs can exacerbate this problem. As the number of UAVs in the network increases,
    the amount of data generated also increases, which can lead to scalability issues.
    Interoperability: UAV networks that rely on different blockchain platforms may
    not be interoperable, making it difficult to share data between different networks.
    This can lead to data silos, which can reduce the efficiency and effectiveness
    of the UAV network. Regulatory Compliance: Blockchain-assisted UAV networks may
    be subject to regulatory compliance requirements, such as data privacy and security
    regulations. Compliance with these regulations can be challenging, especially
    if the UAV network operates across different jurisdictions. Blockchain technology
    has the potential to revolutionize wireless communication networks by providing
    enhanced security, trust, and decentralized operations. Here are some notable
    use cases where blockchain can be applied to improve wireless communication networks:
    Secure and Trustworthy Communication: Blockchain can ensure secure and tamper-proof
    communication between devices in wireless networks. By recording communication
    transactions on the blockchain, it becomes challenging for malicious actors to
    alter or manipulate the data. This enables secure and trustworthy communication,
    especially in critical applications such as UAV communications. Spectrum Management:
    Blockchain can help optimize spectrum allocation and management in wireless networks.
    With blockchain, different entities can register their spectrum usage and negotiate
    access rights through smart contracts. This decentralized approach enables efficient
    spectrum sharing, reduces interference, and improves overall network performance.
    Identity and Access Management: Blockchain can provide a decentralized identity
    management system for wireless communication devices. Each device can have a unique
    identity stored on the blockchain, enabling secure and verified access to network
    resources. This eliminates the need for centralized authentication authorities
    and enhances privacy while ensuring authorized access to the network. Resource
    Sharing and Trading: Blockchain-based smart contracts can facilitate peer-to-peer
    resource sharing and trading in wireless communication networks. For example,
    UAVs can autonomously negotiate and share resources like computing power or network
    bandwidth using smart contracts. This decentralized resource management improves
    efficiency, reduces costs, and enables dynamic resource allocation. Billing and
    Micropayments: Blockchain can streamline billing and payment processes in wireless
    networks, particularly for microtransactions. Smart contracts on the blockchain
    can automatically execute payments between devices or service providers based
    on predefined rules. This enables efficient and transparent payment mechanisms,
    supporting new business models and incentivizing participation in the network.
    Network Monitoring and Management: Blockchain can provide a distributed and transparent
    network monitoring and management system. By recording network statistics, performance
    metrics, and events on the blockchain, network administrators and stakeholders
    can have real-time visibility into the network''s health and performance. This
    promotes proactive network management and troubleshooting. Overall, blockchain-assisted
    UAV communication offers several benefits, but it also presents several security
    challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the security and integrity of the
    network. Here are some potential research directions for blockchain-assisted UAV
    communication: Scalability: Developing methods to scale blockchain technology
    to handle the large amounts of data generated by UAV communication systems. Security:
    Exploring new cryptographic techniques and other security mechanisms to enhance
    the security of UAV communication systems. Privacy: Investigating ways to ensure
    the privacy of data transmitted between UAVs, such as using zero-knowledge proofs
    or homomorphic encryption. Energy Efficiency: Developing techniques to reduce
    the energy consumption of blockchain-based UAV communication systems, such as
    using more efficient consensus mechanisms or optimizing smart contract execution.
    Consensus Mechanisms: Investigating new consensus mechanisms that can provide
    better scalability, latency, and energy efficiency for UAV communication systems.
    Standardization: Developing standards for blockchain-based UAV communication systems
    to ensure interoperability and facilitate the adoption of the technology. Integration
    with other technologies: Exploring ways to integrate blockchain technology with
    other emerging technologies, such as AI, IoT, and edge computing, to create more
    advanced and efficient UAV communication systems. Real-world Testing: Conducting
    real-world testing of blockchain-assisted UAV communication systems to evaluate
    their effectiveness and identify potential challenges and limitations. SECTION
    VI. Conclusion Blockchain technology seems to have promising features for a wide
    range of applications. However, deploying these advanced technologies faces numerous
    challenges, including scalability and portability. Cost, computational and storage
    resources, and the compatibility of different blockchain ledgers are all barriers.
    This article highlights the blockchain-enabled UAV communication environment.
    There are several security concerns about UAV communications and the integration
    of blockchain and FL to enhance UAV wireless communications. One major dilemma
    is privacy and security challenges, which are discussed in depth, and blockchain
    offers a promising solution. Subsequently, our survey potentials and future trends
    are thoroughly discussed. Finally, we provide a thorough explanation of certain
    challenges and future research directions that require the attention of blockchain

    \ With the commencement of new technologies like IoT and the Cloud, the sources\
    \ of data generation have increased\nexponentially. The use and processing of\
    \ this generated data have motivated and given birth to many other domains. The\
    \ concept\nof a smart city has also evolved from making use of this data in decision-making\
    \ in the various aspects of daily life and also\nimprovement in the traditional\
    \ systems. In smart cities, various technologies work collaboratively; they include\
    \ devices used for\ndata collection, processing, storing, retrieval, analysis,\
    \ and decision making. Big data storage, retrieval, and analysis play a vital\n\
    role in smart city applications. Traditional data processing approaches face many\
    \ challenges when dealing with such voluminous\nand high-speed generated data,\
    \ such as semi-structured or unstructured data, data privacy, security, real-time\
    \ responses, and so on.\nProbabilistic Data Structures (PDS) has been evolved\
    \ as a potential solution for many applications in smart cities to complete this\n\
    tedious task of handling big data with real-time response. PDS has been used in\
    \ many smart city domains, including healthcare,\ntransportation, the environment,\
    \ energy, and industry. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review\
    \ of PDS and its\napplications in the domains of smart cities. The prominent domain\
    \ of the smart city has been explored in detail; origin, current\nresearch status,\
    \ challenges, and existing application of PDS along with research gaps and future\
    \ directions. The foremost aim of\nthis paper is to provide a detailed survey\

    \ [4]. As the data is increasing day by day, to access this data in an efﬁcient\
    \ and\nwell-structured manner, the government and public sector require technologies\
    \ and expertise to convert urban cities\nto smart cities. The research interest\
    \ in smart cities has continuously increased in the current and coming years and\n\
    it is economically justiﬁed by the progress of state-of-the-art technologies [21].\
    \ New inventions like the internet, the\ncloud, and IoT have increased data generation\
    \ speed as well as introduced a variation in data. The smart city impacts\ntowns\
    \ and cities around the world with the evolution of the internet and the use of\
    \ new technologies. But in the\ncurrent context, rapid population growth is creating\
    \ challenges for the government and its services. So, smart cities\nare the most\
    \ acceptable solution to such situations of better metropolitan living conditions\
    \ [146]. The emergence of\na smart city has the potential to manage all these\
    \ issues (Fig. 1). But, expeditious urbanization also quickly presents\na major\
    \ challenge worldwide. Though movement from rural to metropolitan areas is unavoidable,\
    \ that’s why cities\npersist in facing many challenges like transport, healthiness,\
    \ air quality, agriculture, and many more [87]. Smart\ncities face many issues\
    \ like pollution, health assistance, overburden on both public and private sectors,\
    \ trafﬁc, etc.\ndue to the rapid growth in population in metropolitan cities [126].\
    \ In this connection, the problems associated with\nthese issues in cities require\
    \ ingenious solutions. They include human strength, ingenuity, and collaboration\
    \ with\ndifferent stakeholders [117].\nIn a recent survey, the United Nations\
    \ estimated that the world’s population will grow by 32% from 2015 to\n2050 and\
    \ that the population will grow by 63% in the metropolitan area. Several researchers\
    \ also stated that by\n2030, more than 60% of the population will be living in\
    \ cities, with the southeast United States experiencing the\ngreatest growth [74,275].\
    \ The extensive and rapid growth of information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\
    has provided possible solutions and mechanisms to various problems in metropolitan\
    \ areas [13] this approach can\nbe used as a tool [267] to increase the effectiveness\
    \ of the city system. In this regard, the thinking or mentality of\nhumans is\
    \ required to be changed, like a smart mind, to raise the standard of living for\
    \ sustainability in the smart\ncity. Furthermore, remote monitoring and management\
    \ systems are being used to improve energy efﬁciency in smart\ncities [316].\n\
    Since the advent of the coronavirus and its declaration as a worldwide epidemic,\
    \ all public and private sectors have\nbeen affected. This virus has affected\
    \ daily routines and activities like education, communication, daily movement,\n\
    labor, and many more. Some public and private sectors have worked with 50% manpower\
    \ on alternative days. Many\nsectors, like IT companies, schools, etc. have run\
    \ Work From Home (WFH). Even doctors have their OPD or patients\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n231\ndiagnosed online.\
    \ The key solution to this epidemic’s key problems for daily life can be solved\
    \ through the smart\ncity. Jasim et al. [129]made a wise decision to help society\
    \ and expand the resources available to individuals in areas\nsuch as healthcare,\
    \ communication, transportation, education, and many others.\nThe Government of\
    \ India (GoI) has a long-term vision for smart cities. GoI deﬁnes smart cities\
    \ as a mission\nto conduct monetary growth and improve the quality of life by\
    \ allowing the development of regional zones and\nutilizing technology that directs\
    \ to smart results. They also designed a workbook “Making a City Smart: Learnings\n\
    from the Smart Cities Mission” with activities in each section to help cities\
    \ plan their smart city journeys. Creating\na smart city incorporates lessons\
    \ from the smart city mission to clarify what, why, and how a smart city works.\n\
    Consolidated at the national level, 100 smart cities have proposed to undertake\
    \ 5,151 projects worth Rs. 2,05,018\ncrores in 5 years from their selected dates.\
    \ New ﬁnancial innovations are built on investment plans. The distribution\nis\
    \ estimated to be from a variety of sources as follows: 6480 projects worth Rs.\
    \ 185,905 Cr are tendered, 5845\nprojects worth Rs. 157,369 are in work order\
    \ stages and 3145 projects worth Rs. 53,256 Cr are completed. The\ncities like\
    \ Gwalior, Thiruvananthapuram, Satna, Udaipur, New Town Kolkata, Bhubaneshwar,\
    \ and Ahmedabad are\ncovered under various smart city projects [183].\n1.1. Role\
    \ of big data in smart city\nBig Data basically stands for velocity, volume, and\
    \ variety of information, which includes complexity in terms\nof speed of data\
    \ generation, the structure of data (variety), and the amount of data to be generated.\
    \ Big data has\na number of deﬁnitions and’V’ principles to make big data processing\
    \ clear and accurate [118]. Anything beyond\nthe human and traditional infrastructure\
    \ and techniques required to store, process, and analyze big data provides\nthe\
    \ solutions for it. With the advent of new technologies such as IoT, ICT, sensors,\
    \ and so on, big data systems are\nbecoming more efﬁcient in sophisticated data\
    \ infrastructures [170].\nThe role of big data in smart cities is heavily inﬂuenced,\
    \ particularly in recognizing patterns, analyzing, and\nprocessing data collected\
    \ from various IoT devices (Fig. 2). Every city is evolving towards being a smart\
    \ city. These\ncities combine basic needs with high technology for a carefree\
    \ and basic lifestyle. To extract important information\nfrom such huge data sets,\
    \ big data analysis is the key [7]. The data collected from different sensors\
    \ and devices in\na smart city’s various gates installed in the city is used for\
    \ better decisions. This growth in data requires efﬁcient\nstorage and handling,\
    \ which is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96]. Big data has different\
    \ effects in\ndifferent parts of the city.\nThe protection of the general public:\
    \ The security and privacy of citizens is the main concern in smart cities.\n\
    To protect their citizens from anything mishappening within the city, various\
    \ analyses of geographical data can be\ndone. This can all be recorded through\
    \ Close Circuit Televisions (CCTVs) and sensors installed on street lights or\n\
    trafﬁc lights. An enormous amount of data is developed and signiﬁcant expansion\
    \ is required when the desired data\ntransforms the city into a considerably safer\
    \ location.\nUrbanism: Cities are investing heavily in transforming to become\
    \ smart cities. The current needs of the city\ncan be identiﬁed through the effective\
    \ use of data, which can aid in identifying areas that require development and\n\
    improvement. As a result, cities can invest by volunteering in areas where they\
    \ are needed.\nFig. 2. Inﬂuence of big data in smart cities.\n232\nM. Kumar and\
    \ A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nTransportation: After\
    \ Covid-19 both public and private transportation are affected after COVID-19.\
    \ Most people\nrely on their own reasoning to get to work and so on. The congestion\
    \ on the roads is increasing, so the risk of\naccidents or anything else going\
    \ wrong has also increased. To handle or manage trafﬁc on roads, the system requires\n\
    big data and well-structured data. Large data sets will also help reduce risks.\n\
    Sustainable Growth: This is also the main part of a smart city. For sustainable\
    \ growth, a huge amount of past and\npresent data is required. Likewise, storing\
    \ this data is one of the challenges for the smart city. This data is updated\n\
    on a daily basis. Data is a special factor in determining the impact of improvement\
    \ in the city.\nInfrastructure: To maintain sustainability, smart city infrastructure\
    \ needs to improve consistently. Obviously, for\nthis data, a smart city is required\
    \ and used in a good manner to improve or maintain the infrastructure.\nSo, the\
    \ role of big data in smart cities is signiﬁcant for efﬁcient and quick results.\
    \ Big data is the brain of the\nsmart city. The main challenge is the lack of\
    \ awareness of using this data to create smart solutions to fulﬁll the\nrequirements\
    \ of citizens. Citizens are the main stakeholders of smart cities. So, to improve\
    \ the standard of living,\nthe developer needs new data processing tools and techniques.\
    \ There is computational, time, and space complexity\nby using the deterministic\
    \ data structure. Probabilistic Data Structures are one of the key solutions for\
    \ smart storage\nand searching of data in real-time scenarios.\nThe traditional\
    \ methods may also produce accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off\
    \ in space and time,\nwhich is not acceptable due to the massive amount of data.\
    \ Due to the huge and limitless evolution, the traditional\ndata structure is\
    \ shifted to PDS for retrieval and storage. PDS has given an approximation solution,\
    \ which may be\nor may not be the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction.\
    \ Since PDSs have some probabilistic compo-\nnents, they are efﬁcient in reducing\
    \ the time or space trade-offs. PDS also plays a key role in big data processing,\n\
    storing nonstructural data, helping with fast retrieval, and making approximate\
    \ predictions. Hash functions are used\nto represent these data structures [246].\
    \ The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\ntesting,\
    \ and cardinal counting. Low memory requirements and good processing speed are\
    \ two distinct features of\nPDS [136].\nThe extensive review of this paper has\
    \ found the key challenges faced during the handling of big data in smart\ncities.\
    \ In this regard, the PDS and its variants have provided the key solutions to\
    \ these challenges and also found new\npossibilities. In this paper, the importance\
    \ of big data in smart cities, generation (Section 2), architecture (Section 4),\n\
    and the detailed application (Section 7) of smart cities, worldwide running smart\
    \ city projects (Section 5) and\ncommonly used PDS (Section 6) have been discussed.\
    \ During the survey, it was found that big data has a high\ninﬂuence on smart\
    \ cities. PDS has evolved as a potential solution for many applications in smart\
    \ cities to complete\nthis tedious task of handling big data with real-time response.\
    \ PDS has been used in many smart city domains,\nincluding healthcare, transportation,\
    \ the environment, energy, and industry. This paper has thoroughly investigated\n\
    the prominent domain of smart cities, including the origin, current research status,\
    \ and existing applications of PDS,\nas well as research gaps and challenges (Section\
    \ 10).\n2. Generations of smart cities\nTo improve the standard of living there\
    \ is a need to change from rural to urban. Governments and citizens are\nincreasing\
    \ their attention in terms of technologies and new startups in smart cities. The\
    \ concept of a smart city for\nurban transformation has radically changed over\
    \ the years. The generation of smart cities has been concise (Table 1).\nBased\
    \ on analysis and study, several researchers have divided the technical advancement\
    \ in smart cities into different\ngenerations (generations 1.0–5.0) (Fig. 3) [140,265]:\n\
    Generations 1.0: – When the technology vendors started implementing their own\
    \ solutions in cities, it was deﬁned\nas the ﬁrst technology-driven smart city.\
    \ Due to the inﬂuential role of big corporations like IBM and Cisco, they\nare\
    \ criticized for their technology concerns. To improve the efﬁciency of public\
    \ and private services, the creators of\ntechnology development are encouraged\
    \ to use their own solutions in cities.\nGenerations 2.0: – Indirectly concerned\
    \ with citizens, issues like healthcare, transport, air quality, and water qual-\n\
    ity are arising. The technology and tools were developed to address such issues\
    \ in generation 2.0. The participation\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    \ in decision-making in cities [276]. The quality of life and local administration\
    \ was mea-\nsured by modern technology. For this, cities presented agendas and\
    \ schemes that support the execution of trendy\ntechnology.\nGenerations 3.0:\
    \ – Thus, the modern city represents the whole connected ecosystem that integrates\
    \ ICT into a\nsmart city. The modern city building programs were organized and\
    \ the local public participated. It was the time\nwhen the government acted as\
    \ a facility providing services to citizens. Here also, citizens are competent\
    \ to represent\ntheir thoughts and innovative ideas [251]. Here also, the urban\
    \ space is designed for users and their engagement.\nGenerations 4.0: – By adopting\
    \ 4.0 industrial transformation, the beneﬁts of smart cities are valued to outweigh\n\
    city costs through city establishment [298]. This generation of smart cities illustrates\
    \ the most useful parts of the\npast; for example, technology generation 1.0,\
    \ individual performance 2.0, and 3.0 engagement. Smart City Genera-\n234\nM.\

    \ by Industry Revolution 4.0, and they develop new technologies. In this, control\
    \ is over the use\nof existing resources and infrastructure.\nGenerations 5.0:\
    \ – In this generation 5.0, the concept of cognitive computing is introduced for\
    \ developing cities.\nIt is purely based on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI). Systems\
    \ are self-learned from past and present knowledge that\nreﬂects changes in real-time\
    \ like interest, barriers, etc [228]. Each public and private service can be handled\
    \ by an\nindependent agent, which gives fast and efﬁcient results. Generations\
    \ 5.0 is the main focus on decision-making for\nurban development by using behavioral\
    \ analysis and AI [264].\n3. Ranking of smart city\nWorldwide, there are different\
    \ ranking systems based on distinct parameters. Out of these, the most popular\
    \ are,\n“Liveable City Index (LCI)” [204],“intelligent cities” [292], “sustainable\
    \ cities” [28], “global cities” and “competi-\ntiveness cities” [266].\nThe center\
    \ smart city index is used for ranking by researchers’ organizations such as Smart\
    \ City Observatory, in\ncollaboration with IMD competitiveness [44]. To manage\
    \ the infrastructure of smart cities like transportation, trafﬁc,\nstreet light\
    \ etc. the technologies like AI and IoT may be used. Muhammad A.R. Tariq et al.\
    \ [266] tries to identify\nthe preferences of people living with different city\
    \ ranking systems, and the top ﬁve cities in the last three years are\ngiven in\
    \ Table 2. Another ranking criteria is that Juniper Research, an analyst ﬁrm based\
    \ in the UK, has ranked the\ncities as smart cities on various factors like transportation,\
    \ energy, healthcare, connectivity between urban areas, etc.\nShanghai, Seoul,\
    \ Barcelona, Beijing, and New York are among the top ﬁve global cities considered.\
    \ These cities\nmainly work on real-time data, which helps in managing the assets\
    \ and future-prooﬁng them. They also cover the\ndowntown to provide 5G and 99%\
    \ of ﬁber coverage across the city. To fully ﬁll, the needs of residents, these\
    \ smart\ncities are using the “Citizen Cloud App”, which uses ambient technologies\
    \ like AI, Cloud Computing, and Big Data,\nwhich come under Smart City Generation\
    \ 5.0 [20].\n4. Architecture of smart city\nSmart city development includes the\
    \ integration and implementation of digital and IoT. IoT provides essential\n\
    elements of smart cities like data production, data management, and application\
    \ management. The number of smart\ncity architectures proposed over time [226].\
    \ In Fig. 4 the most generic architecture has been represented with four\nlayers.\
    \ All these four layers are integrated with security modules because of sensitive\
    \ data.\nSensing layer: – The bottom-most layer of the architecture represents\
    \ the sensing layer or data collection layer.\nIoT devices are used to build this\
    \ layer. This layer uses various IoT devices like actuator, Zigbee, Radio Frequency\n\
    Identiﬁcation (RFID) sensors etc. to sens these various parameters like humidity,\
    \ temperature, pressure, etc. Data\ncollection on mobile devices is a huge burden\
    \ on the sensor layer, which resides under the structure. This layer\ncaptures\
    \ real-time data from sensors [26,192].\nTransmission layer: – With a variety\
    \ of communication technologies, the transfer layer carries data to higher\nlevels.\
    \ This layer acts as the spine of any smart city architecture. In this layer,\
    \ the various communication networks\nlike 3G, 4G, LTE, the internet, and satellite\
    \ also help in mobile networks. Fifth-generation (5G) telecommunication\nis embedded\
    \ in the base station for transferring huge wireless trafﬁc [100].\nData management\
    \ layer: – This layer resides between the transmission and application layers\
    \ and is the brain of\na smart city. The functions of this layer are deception,\
    \ editing, analysis, storage, and decision-making [195]. The\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n235\nFig. 4. Layered architecture\
    \ of a generic smart city [243].\nstored information in this layer is used to\
    \ provide services to various applications in the top layer. The primary role\n\
    of this layer is to preserve data integrity, data puriﬁcation, expansion, and\
    \ optimization [285]. As the ﬁnal function\nof the data management layer, the\
    \ conclusions obtained are transferred to the application layer for proper use.\n\
    Application layer: – An application layer is required to connect the data management\
    \ layer with urban residents.\nThis is the topmost layer of this architecture.\
    \ This layer provides assistance to the users. It operates applications\nthat\
    \ use IoT, for example, smart homes, grid distribution, smart transport, weather\
    \ forecasting, etc., and intelligent\nhealth [317]. As this layer is directly\
    \ connected to the end-users, the satisfaction of users may increase with the\n\
    improvement of services provided.\n5. Projects contributions related to smart\
    \ city\nThe research on smart city buildings has been accomplished worldwide.\
    \ Hence, the concept of smart cities was\nintroduced. The research was conducted\
    \ by various international organizations, universities, and businesses. Various\n\
    countries, like the US and China, have also accomplished research in intelligent\
    \ urban design [156]. The smart city\nencourages the planning of metropolitan,\
    \ oversight through ICT, IoT, CC etc [157]. The evaluation method proposed\nby\
    \ IBM is very focused on building standards and relevant standards. So far, the\
    \ various initiatives, contributions,\nachievements, and projects in smart cities\
    \ are listed in Table 3 [106].\n6. Probabilistic data structure\nThe exponential\
    \ increase in data production services is most evident in the last decade, due\
    \ to the emergence\nof ICT, IoT, etc. The traditional methods may also produce\
    \ accurate results in real-time, but there is a trade-off in\nspace and time,\
    \ which is not acceptable for a massive amount of data. Due to the huge and limitless\
    \ evolution, the\ntraditional data structure is shifted to PDS for retrieval and\
    \ storage. PDS has given an approximation solution, which\nmay be or may not be\
    \ the exact answer, but it moves in the right direction. Since PDSs have some\
    \ probabilistic\ncomponents, they are efﬁcient in reducing the time or space trade-offs.\
    \ PDS also plays a key role in big data\nprocessing, storing nonstructural data,\
    \ helping in fast retrieval, and making approximate predictions. In general,\n\

    \ and efﬁcient manner. Hash functions are used to represent these data structures\n\
    [246]. The PDS is used for membership checking, frequency testing, similarity\
    \ testing, and cardinal counting. Low\nmemory requirements and good processing\
    \ speed are two distinct features of PDS [136].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n237\nFig. 5. Overview of PDS [246].\n6.1. Bloom\
    \ ﬁlter\nIn 1970, the concept of Bloom Filter (BF) was introduced by Burton H.\
    \ Bloom [36]. The BF is a probabilistic\nmodel, a highly efﬁcient random data\
    \ structure. It is used to reduce space problems and is an effective way to query\n\
    the membership of any item in an extensive set. The BF consists of an array with\
    \ m-bits which is initialized to 0 and\nk hash functions. The hash function k\
    \ is used to query an element. To ﬁnd the position of elements in the array, put\n\
    them into the k hash functions.\nFor insertion into BF, the ﬁrst element has been\
    \ added using a hash function (Fig. 6). For elements to be inserted,\nhash functions\
    \ are computed and the corresponding bit is set with that index. In the query\
    \ process, an element is\nchecked to see whether it is a member of the set or\
    \ not. For querying, check all bits correspond to indexes. If all the\nbits are\
    \ set high, then the answer is “maybe” and if at least 1 bit is not set, then\
    \ the answer is “deﬁnitely not”.\nProperties of BF:\n– It is impossible to false\
    \ negative, but if the queried locations are set to 1, then a false positive is\
    \ possible (in\nstandard BF).\n– To process an element, the query time is O (k),\
    \ where k is the hash function.\n– The size of the union and intersection of BF\
    \ is the same and to implement hash functions, the operations bitwise\nOR and\
    \ AND are used.\nFig. 6. Insertion in bloom ﬁlter [246].\n6.2. Count min sketch\n\
    Count-min sketch (CMS) was introduced by G.Cormode and S.Muthukrishna in 2003\
    \ [64]. It is a streaming algo-\nrithm for probabilistic sub-linear space [244].\
    \ Its functionality is also hashing-dependent like BF. CMS is different\nfrom\
    \ BF in only that it uses a 2-dimensional array to handle a given data set, while\
    \ BF uses a 1-dimensional array\nfor representing hashed data.\n238\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 7. Count min\
    \ sketch [246].\nThe basic data structure of CMS consists of a 2-D array (d *\
    \ w) where w is used for storing the counts and it\ndepends on the maximum outputs\
    \ given by hash functions, and d is the hash function h(1 . . . d) and it is pairwise\n\
    independent. To update the counts, calculate the hash positions with the d-hash\
    \ functions. The values determined\nby the hash function are used to get the actual\
    \ occurrence of an item in an array. The minimum of the determined\nvalues by\
    \ the hash function is the actual occurrence of an item (Fig. 7). The space used\
    \ by CMS is equal to the count\nof (d * w). With the use of CMS and appropriate\
    \ values of d and w, we get efﬁcient results with very few errors.\nUse more hash\
    \ functions for more accurate results.\nProperties of Count-Min sketch:\n– It\
    \ supports union operations on cells.\n– The query time to process is O (k), where\
    \ k is a hash function.\n– The accuracy improves when an item appears multiple\
    \ times, with a higher frequency, or with heavy hitters.\n– CMS also has various\
    \ applications like compressed sensing, stream processing, frequency tracking,\
    \ etc.\n6.3. Locality sensitive hashing\nIn 1998, Indyk and Motwani introduced\
    \ the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) [123]. LSH works on the principle\nof using\
    \ low-dimensional space for high-dimensional data. The hash functions are selected\
    \ very carefully, which\nhas more chances of collusion in the hash bucket. The\
    \ LSH has three phases. These are: the ﬁrst phase is the\npreprocessing phase\
    \ where different measures are used for mapping data, in the second phase, hash\
    \ tables are\ncreated, and in the ﬁnal phase, these hash tables are used for recognizing\
    \ identical items (Fig. 8). The similar items\nare located in the same bucket,\
    \ so the whole data is located in buckets [104].\nFig. 8. Locality-sensitive hashing\
    \ framework [246].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n239\nA LSH family lshF() is deﬁned with probabilities P1 and P2, an approximation\
    \ factor c ⩾ 1, a threshold R ⩾ 0,\nand for a metric space M = (M, d). This function\
    \ lshF() maps the metric space to buckets sϵS with a set of functions\nh: M →\
    \ S [287]. The following conditions must be satisﬁed for p, qϵM and hash function\
    \ h chosen uniformly at\nrandom from F :\n– if d(p, q) ⩽ R, then h(p) = h(q) (i.e.,\
    \ p and q collide) with probability at least P1,\n– if d(p, q) ⩾ cR, then h(p)\
    \ = h(q) with probability at most P2.\nA family is interesting when P1 ⩾ P2. Such\
    \ a family lshF() is called (R, cR, P1, P2)-sensitive.\nProperties of Locality\
    \ Sensitive Hashing:\n– The same items are hashed to the same buckets as different\
    \ items, so LSH hashes the items a number of times.\n– Cosine, similarity, and\
    \ hammering distances are examples of item LSH functions.\n– The functions of\
    \ LSH are not limited to the same standard measures commonly used for data retrieval,\
    \ overlap,\nand dice coefﬁcient [54].\n6.4. Quotient ﬁlter\nMichael Bender et\
    \ al. proposed a quotient ﬁlter (QF) in 2011 [30]. It uses less memory to sample\
    \ an element that\nis a member or not of the set. Basically, it has performed\
    \ four operations add, delete, is a member, is not a member\non the set. QF uses\
    \ the single hash function for ﬁngerprint generation with a size of p (in bits).\
    \ For insertion of\nelement in QF, remainder fr ← (fp(x) mod 2r) and quotient\
    \ fp ← (⌊fp(x)2r⌋) are calculated, where fp is the\nindex of bucket and fr is\
    \ value inserted in fp bucket. QF gives the speciﬁc result to the query that is\
    \ either probably\nyes or deﬁnitely not the element of the set. There is some\
    \ probability after querying that the element is in the set, but\nactually, it\
    \ is not present (Fig. 9). The storage size is decreased with the increase of\
    \ ﬁlter size, so there is a trade-off\nbetween storage and false-positive [82].\n\
    Properties of Quotient Filter:\n– An Approximate Member Query (AMQ) ﬁlter is used\
    \ to speed up the answers in the storage system.\n– Insertion, deletion, and updating\
    \ are allowed in QF, resulting in the large usage of proxy databases.\n– There\
    \ is no need to re-hash the original key for merging and re-sizing of QF.\nPDSs\
    \ are used in many real-time applications like preserving patient data in healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc control, energy-\nsaving, and also for SEM and SAM, and many more. In\
    \ the next section, the PDS and their applications in smart\ncities and big data\
    \ will be explored in a more detailed manner.\nFig. 9. Quotient ﬁlter [89].\n\

    \ city application\nThe smart city needs to majorly focus on activities like healthcare,\
    \ trafﬁc, street lights. Intelligent technologies\nlike ICT, IoT, sensors etc.\
    \ and analysis of data are the key requirements to improving the citizen’s standard\
    \ of life.\nThe important application of smart city (Fig. 10) are smart healthcare,\
    \ smart trafﬁc management system, smart\nemergency system, smart street light,\
    \ a virtual power plant in smart grid etc.\nPeoples have a number of reasons like\
    \ job opportunities, education, and many more to move from one city to\nanother\
    \ even in an epidemic like Covid-19. In smart cities data is fetched and analyzed\
    \ through IoT devices like\nsensors, actuators etc. [102]. Further, this data\
    \ is used to improve social services, infrastructure, and decision-\nmaking. This\
    \ information plays an essential role in real-time application and services in\
    \ urban areas [202].\nFig. 10. Applications of smart city.\n7.1. Smart healthcare\n\
    Healthcare is an important service to the growth and development of any smart\
    \ city. In recent years, smart health-\ncare has emerged with the growth of ICT.\
    \ It is a process of managing one’s health by a couple of doctors themselves\n\
    or virtually [112]. The traditional medical system needs to be transformed into\
    \ smart healthcare in order to become\nmore efﬁcient and convenient for patients.\
    \ With the emergence in technologies like ICT, IoT, AI etc. the healthcare\nindustry\
    \ have transformed from old-fashioned like interaction between doctor-patient\
    \ to new i.e. remote health mon-\nitoring [113]. IBM (Armonky, NY, USA) came up\
    \ with the idea of smart healthcare in 2009 [269]. There are some\nchallenges\
    \ while transformation into smart healthcare, these are: healthcare systems, equipment\
    \ are under enormous\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in\
    \ smart city\n241\npressure, healthcare data is growing exponentially, inform\
    \ decision-making process with detailed information, ad-\nditional wisdom for\
    \ nurses, challenges in consolidating and resolving legal issues, making the patients\
    \ run from\none department to another for collecting reports, accurate precision\
    \ diagnostics, and right measurements. With the\nincrease of population, these\
    \ challenges are also heightened with demanding health services. The preponderance\
    \ of\nindustrialized nations is facing vital difﬁculties regarding the quality\
    \ and cost of numerous healthcare and wellbeing\nservices [3]. Due to limited\
    \ resources, some cities are deprived of proper healthcare services. In view of\
    \ this, there is\na need for new systems, smart healthcare. In the ﬁeld of smart\
    \ healthcare, devices, the internet, and IoT can connect\npeople with each other,\
    \ as well as manage healthcare activities and resources. Smart healthcare is one\
    \ of the highest\nlevels of knowledge building in the medical ﬁeld [108]. To collect\
    \ information dynamically, liking between insti-\ntutions and healthcare, smart\
    \ healthcare is used to take advantage of advanced technologies, devices like\
    \ wearable,\nmobile internet, and the IoT. Smart healthcare can reduce workload\
    \ at the information desk, and also Help patients\nand their wards.\n7.1.1. Evolution\
    \ of healthcare\nVarious authors and researchers in their studies are categories\
    \ the healthcare system in different generations\n(Fig. 11) (Healthcare 1.0–Healthcare\
    \ 5.0). The different functionality evolution of healthcare system are discussed\n\
    as:\nHealthcare 1.0: – In the year between 1970–1990 the ﬁrst evolution ‘Healthcare\
    \ 1.0’ was introduced. Due to\nlimited digital resources, it was restricted to\
    \ paper documentation. It was mainly focused on improving the efﬁciency\nof health\
    \ services and a reduction in paperwork. The revolution transformed the home remedy\
    \ system and the\nuntrained physicians who provide paternal care into a more sophisticated,\
    \ intelligent, and data-driven system that\ncan be called the “medical complex”.\
    \ In the 1830s the British government start piping the water to homes, when\n\
    the plague was caused due to drinking of polluted water [114,171]. Shortly thereafter,\
    \ the scientiﬁc vaccine theory\nwas established [48]. In the 19th century, a better\
    \ environment for healthy living integrated measures for sanitation,\ninfection\
    \ control, vaccination, and epidemiology surveys have been created.\nHealthcare\
    \ 2.0: – The era of Healthcare 2.0 was between 1991–2005, the main focus was to\
    \ combine with digital\ntechnology. Industrial machinery kept working and changing.\
    \ In the 20th century to increase the productivity of\ncheap products, the automobile\
    \ industry introduces the concept of mass production [120]. The healthcare system\n\
    also follows the same. At the end of the 19th century, few large pharmaceutical\
    \ companies were formed [214]. A few\nyears later various antibiotics were introduced,\
    \ with the advent of mass-industrial manufacturing technology [299].\nAlso at\
    \ that time in medical education importance was given to both clinical training\
    \ and basic science education\n[93]. Hospitals are expanding, being provided by\
    \ more specialists, and doctors are being trained to deal with more\npatients\
    \ with complex conditions. The main focus is on building a part of healthcare\
    \ 2.0 [58]. The second version of\nhealthcare is aimed at improving productivity\
    \ and data sharing. The focus on information sharing is not limited to\nwithin\
    \ the organization but among a group of other healthcare providers. The new version\
    \ is entrenched in response\nto the symptoms, illness, and needs of the individual.\
    \ Information was shared with other organizations with privacy\nand security.\
    \ It was electrical energy-oriented.\nHealthcare 3.0: – The era of healthcare\
    \ 3.0 was between 2006–2015. In this evolution, Electronic Health Records\n(EHRs)\
    \ were introduced. It helps the doctors in accessing patient records through cloud\
    \ gateway. It was a step\ntowards creating a value-based model based on Telecommunication\
    \ and information communication technology\n(TICT), which provides database enhancement\
    \ and additional data efﬁciency to prevent medical-related problems\n[1]. The\
    \ advent of microcontrollers in the 1980s allowed for the production of small\
    \ computers and fast-tracking\nenvironments, as well as large data storage [127,255].\
    \ With advanced computer technology, tomography jumped\nfrom single images to\
    \ redesigned images, and doctors could diagnose ulcers with more information and\
    \ diagnose\ndiseases earlier. Doctors are provide evidence-based medicine after\
    \ diagnosis disease [85]. They have additional\ninformation gathered from e-libraries\
    \ using fast computer technologies. Healthcare 3.0 focused on providing emer-\n\
    gency care and was able to ensure preventive care before the onset of illness\
    \ or symptoms of the disease. Internet\nchanges learning because much medical\
    \ literature is available at e-libraries. In Healthcare 3.0 major concern is to\n\
    use technologies like BDA and IoT-based wearable devices along with advanced E-Medical\
    \ record databases.\nHealthcare 4.0: – From 2016 to 2020, the era of Healthcare\
    \ 4.0 was introduced with patient-centric healthcare\nservices with the advent\
    \ of new technologies and IoT devices [261]. This healthcare evolution is inspired\
    \ by ‘In-\n242\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\nFig. 11. Health generation.\ndustry 4.0’ by establishing personalized\
    \ healthcare platforms and augmented virtualization [271]. It was focused on\n\
    smart devices, involving capabilities of empowering data analytics with ML, DL,\
    \ AI, and IoT for the detection of\ndiseases, [151]. It is the successive approach\
    \ of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0. Patients get medicine from suppliers by using their\n\
    websites and also get medical assistance through blogs [240]. In this case, patient\
    \ records are shared with healthcare\nprofessionals via an e-Health record over\
    \ the cloud or on the LAN, where many patients and healthcare workers\ncan be\
    \ connected. It helps the physician to access patient records anywhere and also\
    \ communicate with fellow doc-\ntors for better treatment. However, data sharing\
    \ has introduced new challenges such as authentication, security, and\nauthority,\
    \ and so on, [280]. New hands & a new brain, which includes robots, mini-laboratories,\
    \ wearable devices,\nand 3D printers. Every device works faster and more efﬁciently;\
    \ illnesses can be quickly diagnosed using a drop of\nblood; custom-designed surgery\
    \ of body joints can be performed, and bone framework can be prepared using 3D\n\
    printing [280]. Healthcare 4.0 also involves technologies like robotic surgery,\
    \ CC, CPS, information security, and\nmany more.\nHealthcare 5.0: – The era of\
    \ healthcare 5.0 began in 2020 and is going on. This machine includes AI features\n\
    such as a robot nurse, a smart IoT device, and a 6G network speed. [186]. With\
    \ latency (10–100 ms) and reliability\n(99.9999%) [150], and based on ultra-high\
    \ accuracy for remote connections [314], 6G communication addresses\nreliability\
    \ and latency issues in smart cities. Why not 5G? According to [141] 5G will fall\
    \ short of meeting future\ndemands for big data connections such as holographic\
    \ communications (e.g., 3D video conferencing), games, and\ntelesurgery. This\
    \ evolution comes up with device-to-device, machine-to-machine, and human-to-machine\
    \ commu-\nnication. The human-machine cooperation and participation improve the\
    \ diagnosis system and fast results. This\nsystem is more secure than its predecessors.\
    \ A blockchain-based architecture for healthcare applications that auto-\nmatically\
    \ collects data and removes unreliable systems from external companies. The system\
    \ is not dependent on a\nsingle-point failure due to a decentralized network [150].\n\
    The evolution of the healthcare system has also been succinct in Table 4.\nM.\

    \ in smart healthcare are research institutes and hospitals,\npatients, and doctors.\
    \ Smart healthcare has many beneﬁts, like disease prevention and monitoring, diagnosis\
    \ and\ntreatment, hospital management, health decision-making, and medical research.\
    \ ICT, IoT, AI, 5G internet, big data,\nand modern biotechnology are the foundations\
    \ of the intelligent healthcare room, according to [108]. Doctors use\nLaboratory\
    \ Information Management system, Electronic medical record etc. for managing health\
    \ data [207].\n7.1.2. Challenges in smart healthcare\nTrusted Communication: –\
    \ Many medical devices experience network failure, which is unacceptable when\
    \ real-\ntime data access is required. It is challenging to maintain connections\
    \ on mobile devices such as wearable devices\nwhile moving anywhere a patient\
    \ walks, crossing boundaries, and covering areas. In mobile devices, switching\n\
    the network to the most powerful available signal also affects data generation.\
    \ The different amounts of data are\ngenerated while switching to the network,\
    \ which is dependent on the roaming relationship between the SIM provider\nand\
    \ the location of the feed. As there are many subcategories for mobile connectivity,\
    \ we should also adjust the\nnetwork type and location to the value, speed, audio,\
    \ and video required by our device.\nCyber security: – Cyber security is one of\
    \ the challenges when we talk about smart healthcare. As it requires\ninternet\
    \ access and IoT devices, the data may be stolen or attackers may attack data\
    \ or modify the data. So the ﬁrst\npriority of the healthcare system is to ensure\
    \ the privacy of patients and their data. There are some private IoT-based\nnetworks\
    \ (e.g. APNs, VPNs, and IPsec protocol) that are available, which create private\
    \ areas only accessible by\nauthorized users or devices.\nScalable Platforms:\
    \ – The smooth functioning of a smart healthcare system, a scalable platform is\
    \ required. For\nthe effectiveness of a smart healthcare system to be enhanced,\
    \ it must be integrated and supported seamlessly with\npatients and their big\
    \ data. So, the authorized professionals, physicians, and patients use the devices\
    \ and system\neasily for monitoring remotely.\nCost: – Meet, the requirements\
    \ of the healthcare system are also cost-effective. The healthcare system may\
    \ take\nless time for decision-making and information gathering. So, it must require\
    \ new tools and techniques for efﬁcient\nstorage and retrieval.\n244\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nData Availability:\
    \ – The availability of data is facing some issues like resource management and\
    \ device identiﬁ-\ncation. Systems don’t need any redundancy; they only need consistent\
    \ data. So it requires identifying the resources\nand storage management with\
    \ new technologies in healthcare systems.\nData Security: – While accessing the\
    \ data, it is mandatory that only the authorized user can access the concerned\n\
    data. It still needs to be improved.\nUnique Identiﬁcation: – In the healthcare\
    \ system, it is required to uniquely identify patients by their doctor and\nvice\
    \ versa. This is required for providing or getting the best and correct treatment.\n\
    Privacy Issue: – This is one of the major issues while we are talking about big\
    \ data and IoT devices in a smart\ncity. Many kinds of research provide many tools\
    \ and techniques. But still, it needs to be improved.\nDevice Communication: –\
    \ Machine to machine, a device to machine, and human to machine communication\
    \ is\nchallenging. Patients need a quick response to their records, medical tests,\
    \ and medical reports. A 5G/6G network\nis required for the smooth transformation\
    \ of data communication. It is cost-effective, and also required some tools\n\
    and algorithms for privacy and data exchanges.\nData Integrity: – Ensuring the\
    \ integrity of healthcare data is also challenging because it is important for\
    \ providers\nto use it in making decisions about patient care. It is also required\
    \ for information exchange between doctors and\npatients.\n7.1.3. Application\
    \ of PDS in smart healthcare\nDue to the rapid growth in the population and an\
    \ epidemic, hospitals are overburdened and overcrowded. Patients\nare struggling\
    \ to ﬁnd the doctor’s ofﬁce and pre-body check-up center. Patients and their guardians\
    \ also face the\nissue of understanding medical terms, and they need someone’s\
    \ help to get the proper information. For that, a\nproper healthcare system is\
    \ required with the use of new technologies like sensors, IoT, ICT, etc. On one\
    \ hand, the\nIoT has beneﬁted patients, physicians, hospitals, and health insurance\
    \ companies. On the other hand, challenges\nhave increased. Because sensors and\
    \ IoT have produced massive amounts of data, To handle this data, the following\n\
    is the application of PDS which may be used in smart healthcare systems:\nData\
    \ Processing: – The data generated by devices is homogeneous or heterogeneous,\
    \ semi-structured or unstruc-\ntured, which will result in the trafﬁc load on\
    \ switches. The storage capacity of switches is limited, so the perfor-\nmance\
    \ of routing may be compromised. A scheme ‘BloomStore: Dynamic Bloom Filter-based\
    \ Secure rule-space\nmanagement’ is proposed for Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN)\
    \ [245]. The scheme uses two self-dependent hash\nfunctions for security checks\
    \ and also manages the network resources to handle the trafﬁc in data. Smart healthcare\n\
    systems provide system-assistance analysis for dedicated medical care to patients.\
    \ The security of this data is in dan-\nger. The data security features are improved\
    \ to prevent unauthorized access to information in healthcare systems.\nBF is\
    \ also useful in data transmission elimination [300].\nData Sharing: – The Garbled\
    \ Bloom ﬁlter is used to support authentic search results and secure data sharing\
    \ for\nmultiple users [260] in the Veriﬁable Multi-Key Searchable Encryption (VMKSE).\
    \ This scheme supports single-\nkeyword search. The author also compares his programme\
    \ with a modern solution to evaluate its effectiveness. This\nscheme helps in\
    \ doctor-patient data sharing. The multi-keyword search veriﬁcation mechanism\
    \ is introduced based\non pseudo-random and it is IoT-cloud-enabled for healthcare\
    \ data systems [283]. The mechanism also takes care\nof authentication and advanced\
    \ encryption with advanced privacy of data. BF is used in a secure two-dimensional\n\
    calculation protocol, to compare a unit of characters and record [277].\nData\
    \ Security and Privacy-Preserving System: – The use of IoT in smart cities plays\
    \ a big role in smart healthcare.\nA huge amount of data is exchanged between\
    \ machines, humans, and devices. This big data can be encrypted and\nthen stored\
    \ on a cloud so that only authenticated users can access it. There are also privacy\
    \ issues. A scheme for\nefﬁciently sharing data is proposed to address this issue.\
    \ The author uses attribute-based encryption with attribute BF\nto control access.\
    \ While transforming data or sharing sensitive information, a lot of privacy concerns\
    \ may arise. Xu\net al. propose a scheme using BF, which is privacy-preserving\
    \ for patient health information for sharing information\n[293]. The author uses\
    \ an encrypted search method that allows numerical search for encrypted data.\
    \ The BF and\nmessage veriﬁcation code are used to ﬁlter patient data and check\
    \ the accuracy of search results. Liu et al. design\ncooperative privacy preservation\
    \ for wearable devices that ensure authenticity and consideration for controlling\
    \ data\naccess in the context of space and time information [162]. In space-aware,\
    \ they use MinHash-based authentication,\nand in time-aware, attribute-based encryption\
    \ is applied. They adopted BF to determine the existence of sensitive\nM. Kumar\

    \ ledger’s block size with and without using BF. [11].\ndata in storage without\
    \ exposing secret information, and for secure data interaction, positive and negative\
    \ ﬁlters\nare used. Seham A., et al. [11] introduce a system for infection control\
    \ with the use of Blockchain for privacy-\npreserving. In this system, one leader\
    \ elected by authority updates the two BFs, one for infected users and the other\n\
    for close contact users. Two BF are used for infected and suspected users, which\
    \ reduces the storage space. The\nblock size of the COVID-19 status ledger with\
    \ and without using BF is also compared (Fig. 12).\nFast Response and Congestion\
    \ control: – The number of connected devices in the network (like trafﬁc lights,\n\
    vehicles, laptops, smartphones, etc.) is increasing exponentially. For resource\
    \ sharing and effective communication,\nall devices with different conﬁgurations\
    \ have to be integrated into the same network. Due to the rapid growth of\nthese\
    \ devices, the trafﬁc in the network also increases, causing difﬁculty in predicting\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. G. S. Aujla\net al. propose an approach to handle these issues.\
    \ “Blockchain-as-a-Service for Software Deﬁned Network (SDN)\nin Smart City Applications”\
    \ is mentioned [23]. Multiple etiquette ﬁrmware can be integrated into a single\
    \ network\nusing the SDN controller [22].\nIn “Software-deﬁned Content Dissemination\
    \ Scheme for Internet of Healthcare Vehicles in COVID-19 like Sce-\nnarios”, [111]\
    \ introduces a new way to ﬁnd the right online distribution channel described\
    \ in the healthcare ecosys-\ntem software. Internet of Healthcare Vehicle (IoHV)\
    \ is an emerging concept that depends on smart transport, includ-\ning ambulances\
    \ and additional healthcare vehicles (testing Covid-19 immediately). To connect\
    \ to the internet, espe-\ncially when possible, for testing COVID-19 immediately\
    \ and contact tracing, this IoHV is helpful and is deployed\nacross a smart city\
    \ setup. All healthcare vehicles are connected to each other through different\
    \ types of links: vehicle-\nto-pedestrian (V2P), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), infrastructure-to-infrastructure\
    \ (I2I), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I),\nand cellular links [147]. To overcome\
    \ congestion and improve response, the global information of devices is stored\n\
    in the deletable BF in the proposed framework. While implementing in the real\
    \ world, there are many ambient\nintelligence challenges. Some of them related\
    \ to healthcare are listed below:\nAdopting Advance healthcare technology: Almost\
    \ all medical devices are connected to IoT devices. The man-\nagement systems\
    \ like appointments, patient administration, laboratory information, etc. are\
    \ now handled by ML and\nAI. So it is necessary to develop a connected network\
    \ of healthcare leaders, clinics, manufacturers, and software\ndevelopment companies.\
    \ which enhances the new business models and also helps adopt the new technologies.\n\
    Integration between healthcare services: The massive amount of data is generated\
    \ while using medical devices\nand AI-integrated applications. Many top healthcare\
    \ companies lack data management systems and new architec-\nture.\nRising Healthcare\
    \ cost: The rising costs of healthcare are always a serious issue, which includes\
    \ the manufac-\nturing cost of healthcare vehicles and disease detection and testing\
    \ processes. Due to this, many patients skip lab\ntests and do regular follow-ups.\n\
    246\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nPayment\
    \ Veriﬁcation: – In this digital world and epidemic, the maximum number of transactions\
    \ is done digitally\nand payment veriﬁcation is required. In this lieu, Pratim\
    \ et al. a lightweight payment veriﬁcation based on the\nblockchain using BF is\
    \ proposed as IoT-Assisted e-Healthcare [223]. If BLWN simply asks for the full\
    \ location of\na small set of blocks/topics, there may be a chance for privacy\
    \ leaks as the full area can peer into BLWNs’ assets. It\nmay allow the full site\
    \ to call for Denial of Services (DoS) and the insigniﬁcant liaison service for\
    \ funds available\nfrom BLWN. Therefore, it may be completely overwhelmed by the\
    \ great difﬁculty in its ability to make a computer\nwhile crashing its system.\n\
    Real Time Analysis/Support: – Wearable devices are mainly used in real-time Electronic\
    \ Health Records (EHR)\ncollection. Obviously, encryption is required for searching\
    \ targeted EHRs by medical institutions. In this reference,\nYuan et al. [259]\
    \ propose a scheme in which medical institutions can search and access EHRs in\
    \ the cloud. They\nimprove the search accuracy and privacy of users in EHRs. To\
    \ improve search efﬁciency, the Cuckoo ﬁlter is used\nand gives a facility to\
    \ data owners for modiﬁcation (insert and delete) in their EHRs in the cloud.\n\
    7.2. Smart transportation\nFor moving from one place to another, horses and camels\
    \ were used for a long time in society. The world has\nentered the next phase\
    \ of the movement, namely smart transport, with the advent of new technologies\
    \ and smart\ntransportation systems [180]. “Moving smarter is not our future –\
    \ it is already our present”, says Lisa Jerram, senior\nanalyst at Pike Research,\
    \ simply to make sure the easy journey is acceptable as cities become more populous\
    \ and\nface potential budget crises by building new infrastructure, as is the\
    \ case in Europe, North America and Japan, [38].\nAccording to [274], the population\
    \ of the world’s urban areas increased from 29% to 50% between 1950 and 2008,\n\
    and it is expected to increase to 70% by 2050.\n7.2.1. Application of smart transportation\n\
    To meet the increased demand of citizens, the easy option is to provide then better\
    \ transport services. With this\nthe growth in supply of automobile is increases,\
    \ due to that the trafﬁc congestion is also increases. The attraction to\nthe\
    \ development of smart transport system took a lot of attention to addressing\
    \ trafﬁc congestion and rapid urban\ngrowth [71]. It is identiﬁed that the implementation\
    \ of smart technologies is the key factor in gaining intelligence\nand stability\
    \ [107,233]. Also several researchers shown that how this sustainability achieving\
    \ the environmental and\neconomic efﬁciency [71,115]. Therefore, sustainable transportation\
    \ is very important in today’s society. There are\nvarious application under smart\
    \ transportation are discussed as follows:\nSmart Street Light: – Smart city should\
    \ also needs to upgrade Road street light to smart street light. It helps in\n\
    reducing the energy consumption by dimming the lights. This saved energy are then\
    \ used for other services like\npollution monitoring, update about whether, GPS\
    \ etc. and also help in signing available parking in nearby area.\nBut smart street\
    \ lights are depending on its feature and requirements, and involve a combination\
    \ of cameras and\nsensors. Sensors and Cameras are collecting the data can either\
    \ process locally if street light have computing device\nor propagate through\
    \ network. These devices can detect the movement which enable dynamic lighting\
    \ and dimming\n[102]. Chen et al. present a system which used for controlling\
    \ the street lights using TX2 device and also help in\nupdating the parking status\
    \ to users (Fig. 13).\nIntelligent Transportation System (ITS): – Today, the state-of-the-art\
    \ transport system is heavily inﬂuenced by\nMachine Learning (ML) and Dynamic\
    \ Range Learning (DRL) based strategies to detect autonomous vehicles,\ndispatch\
    \ passengers in a safe manner and ensure the safety of vehicles. ITS uses the\
    \ various advance technologies\nlike senros, IoT devices, ICT and many more [302].\
    \ The huge amount of data is being generated by these IoT devices\nand sensors\
    \ which contributes to the concept of intelligent cities and the future of ITS\
    \ [312]. The techniques like\nAI, ML, and especially DRL play an important role\
    \ as an integral part of sustainable in precisely monitoring and\nmeasuring real-time\
    \ data trafﬁc ﬂow in an urban area [301,305].\nThe various applications of ITS\
    \ are discussed by [302] like: The intelligent highway in Britain, which reduces\n\
    the trafﬁc and accident rate, The CRITER system in Lyon, France, offers transportation\
    \ workers a schematic plan\nlike a map and also predicts the bottleneck points.\
    \ In Japan, electronic toll collections (ETC) measure the physical\ncharacteristics\
    \ of vehicles and check and deduct charges automatically if they are in ETC. It\
    \ is useful to avoid\nillegal entry into the city. Include IoT in ITS to build\
    \ a system where communication between road facilities,\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n247\nFig. 13. Smart street light\
    \ scenario [59].\nvehicles, and management equipment is done without barriers.\
    \ The Global Positioning System (GPS) is replaced by\nRadio Frequency Identiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID) in the IoT to become the Smart Transportation System (STS). The author\n\
    also discusses the services for passengers on public transport, like service range,\
    \ charging, security control, and\nadministration.\nAvailability of Parking: –\
    \ With the rapid growth of vehicles in the city, it is a trick for drivers to\
    \ ﬁnd available\nparking. This dilemma is seen as an opportunity to increase the\
    \ efﬁciency of parking facilities, thereby decreasing\nroad accidents and taking\
    \ less time to ﬁnd free space in a smart city. The troubles related to parking\
    \ and trafﬁc\ncongestion could be solved if drivers were aware in advance of the\
    \ availability of parking in the area and surround-\ning areas [39]. A smart and\
    \ automated system that can detect empty parking spaces can reduce search time,\
    \ by\nﬁnding out where parking is available and bypassing lawful information to\
    \ drivers. Maria et al. proposed an image\nprocessing system that takes video\
    \ as input from a drone and feeds it into a frame extraction block [176]. These\n\
    frames are then preprocessed to reduce complexity. These systems may be improved\
    \ if the availability of data and\nthe techniques to manage this data were improved\
    \ or changed with new technologies.\nStreet lights can also play an important\
    \ role in detecting empty parking spaces in open environments. Traditional\nparking\
    \ (sensor-based) occupancy systems are more expensive, as demonstrated by [59].\
    \ They use Jetson TX2, an\nNVIDIA’s Computer Uniﬁed Device Architecture embedded\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence supercomputer, which has high\npower efﬁciency. This\
    \ system works both day and night with an on-off street parking smart control\
    \ system. Parking\nspace is detected by marker-based image processing using the\
    \ onboard camera of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) [67].\nTrafﬁc Control: –\
    \ The authorities are facing chaos trying to manage the trafﬁc with an increase\
    \ of vehicles on the\nroads. Because of a lack of human resources, authorities\
    \ are moving toward smart trafﬁc control to manage the city’s\ntrafﬁc. To reduce\
    \ congestion in the context of VANETs, robots can play a key role. The aim of\
    \ smart robots is to give\ninformation to avoid ideal roads and manage trafﬁc\
    \ congestion in urban areas. To detect illegal trafﬁc behaviour or\ntrafﬁc violations,\
    \ the system uses street cameras [66]. But it is not possible to install street\
    \ cameras everywhere in\nthe city. Modern cars with video storage cameras have\
    \ been introduced to control trafﬁc violations in the city. These\ncars capture\
    \ the videos in the city and report any violations that happen to the authorities.\
    \ Rathore et al. propose a\nsystem to detect the front car and road line using\
    \ the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Hough transform\nfor self-driving.\
    \ A violation detection algorithm is designed for the fog device smart to identify\
    \ driving violations,\nU-turns, and driving central dividers [222]. Steve Mazur\
    \ has also presented a trafﬁc control system (Fig. 14) in\n[180].\nAutomated Toll\
    \ Collection: – To decrease the fuel consumption used in automobiles, the use\
    \ of the cream road\nis required. The government and road contractors are working\
    \ on making the new highways and ﬂyovers in the\ncities, and contractors are installing\
    \ their toll on those roads to complete their expenses. Motorists and commuters\n\
    are spending their valuable time at the toll plazas paying the amount of tax.\
    \ Due to this, the parking problem, trafﬁc\n248\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nFig. 14. Smart trafﬁc control [180].\ncongestion,\
    \ and pollution are increasing near the toll plaza. Commuters are also facing\
    \ delays, which increases\nthe travel time for their journey [34]. Automatic toll\
    \ collection is on the rise nowadays, both by governments and\nresearchers. The\
    \ main concern with this automated toll collection system, the RIFD tag, is that\
    \ it is installed on\nthe windshield of vehicles. To collect the required amount,\
    \ the vehicles pass through the sensor system before the\ntollgate [134]. Regular\
    \ user may also have facility of prepaid smart cards. So that the trafﬁc at tollgates\
    \ can be\navoided. M.A. Berlin et al. propose an alert message based toll collection\
    \ system using smart Road Side Unit (RSU)\n[34]. This system also helps in stopping\
    \ the payment violation by send the alert message if the any vehicle violate\n\
    the toll payment. This system is totally man free and barricade free, which also\
    \ help in rush hours to handle the\ntrafﬁc [34]. As the use RIFD tags not only\
    \ the time is saved but also eliminate the corruption in toll plazas [8].\nSmart\
    \ Mobility: – Smart mobility is also the main concern in smart transportation\
    \ as it is consistent with the\ndevelopment of a sustainable world [101]. In particular,\
    \ either ICT is the initiative to smart mobility or a complete\nfailure [31].\
    \ Smart Mobility is providing solutions to users by using new technologies like\
    \ IoT, ICT etc. Some\ntourists use apps to plan their journey, but they get limited\
    \ information and priorities for travel recommendations\n[205]. Smart mobility\
    \ is also helpful for citizens to roam and move freely in the vicinity of a smart\
    \ city. Smart\nmobility also helps in improving the trafﬁc control system by giving\
    \ access to other routes in emergencies or trafﬁc\njams. Intelligent navigators\
    \ facilitate providing routes and navigating to essential services like ambulances\
    \ and\ngovernment. can be facilitated by intelligent navigation. In the coming\
    \ year, smart mobility transform into mobility\nas a service paradigm, like car-sharing\
    \ [205].\n7.2.2. Beneﬁts of smart transportation\nFigure 15 explores a picture\
    \ of smart transportation in the city. Smart transportation has many beneﬁts,\
    \ some of\nthem are discussed as.\nSmart Transportation is safer: – In smart transport\
    \ the integration of ML with IoT, 5G help in reducing trafﬁc\nand road accidents.\
    \ In these IoT devices, cameras and other safety devices help in monitoring the\
    \ trafﬁc situation\nand intimate the same to users for improving road safety.\n\
    Smart Transportation is better managed: – Smart transportation facilitates the\
    \ public administration by allowing\nto monitor the performance of road safety\
    \ and trafﬁc. It also gives information on critical sources of problems and\n\
    tracks where maintenance is required.\nSmart Transport is very effective: – With\
    \ better management of resources in smart transport gives more efﬁcient\nresults.\
    \ If we are having quality data, then easily identify the areas where improvement\
    \ is required. It also provides\nbetter-quality ﬁlling rates.\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n249\nFig. 15. Smart transportation\
    \ [180].\nSmart Transportation is more cost-effective: – Smart transportation\
    \ also helps in reducing the cost by providing\nthe best shortest routes, giving\
    \ information regarding facilities available with approx distance and price, and\
    \ many\nmore. Commuters also take beneﬁt if they get affordable public transport\
    \ as compared to hiring a private CAB.\nSmart Parking Management: – In smart parking\
    \ the driver or car owner can’t face the problem of ﬁnding the avail-\nable space\
    \ for parking. The system provides the information by collecting real-time data\
    \ from connected devices\nand sensors.\nSmart Trafﬁc Management: – With the smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system users can get information about conges-\ntion on road.\
    \ So that they can plan their journey accordingly.\nSmart Transportation provides\
    \ instant information: – Smart transport system can also provide information in-\n\
    stantly regarding the issue in the city, trafﬁc congestion, and problem areas\
    \ using trafﬁc management centers. They\nalso ensure public safety and provide\
    \ information on affordable insurance plans.\nIntegrated Ticket Systems: – It\
    \ will also provide diverse services to citizens by providing the intelligent\
    \ ticket\nsystem in some local services.\n7.2.3. Challenges in smart transportation\n\
    A large number of vehicles in major cities around the world has posed major transportation\
    \ and stability chal-\nlenges, like air pollution, trafﬁc congestion and energy\
    \ problems [284]. Following are some challenges to smart\ntransportation.\nSecurity:\
    \ – Vulnerable to cyberattacks is one of the biggest fears among smart city dwellers.\
    \ Cyber attacks are\nmore common to criminals as the world’s connectivity to the\
    \ internet increases. The data ﬂow during the smart\ntransport management system\
    \ are may be hacked or used to thief the vehicle if there is no secure communication.\n\
    The security of data used in toll collection systems is also in danger. During\
    \ ﬁnding the available parking space user\nshare their location, this also may\
    \ create problems in user security.\nData Privacy: – User data cannot be retrieved\
    \ without their knowledge. The user’s personal identity must not be\nidentiﬁed\
    \ or traced. Data privacy in smart transport is the main concern. Under the new\
    \ law, data processing must\nhave legitimate.\nSupply Chain: – Due to epidemics\
    \ like Covid-19 the global supply chain is affected. While transportation may\n\
    face various problems during this epidemic. Due to that many businesses are affected.\
    \ When the drivers may ill and\nmove from one region to another it may cause public\
    \ health.\nEnvironmental Problem: – With the rapid growth in the automobile industry\
    \ the trafﬁc on roads also increases.\nThis may affect the air quality and water\
    \ pollution in nearby residential areas. The environmental problems caused\nby\
    \ the IoT devices are currently serious and need to be addressed urgently [180].\n\
    Health Concern: – Health concern is also one of the challenges to smart transportation.\
    \ If the transport system is\nnot connected to hospitals, then it may cause major\
    \ problems or may loss their lives in road accidents. The system\nneeds to improve\
    \ its service on road, and proper intimation of the concerns (hospitals and police\
    \ stations).\n250\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n7.2.4. Applications of PDS in smart transport\nThe trafﬁc on roads in\
    \ both rural and urban areas is increasing day by day. It needs to smartly manage\
    \ the trafﬁc\nand distribute the trafﬁc load by making the transport system to\
    \ be smart. It includes smart parking, smart street\nlights, violation check on\
    \ the roads, trafﬁc control system etc.\nData Dissemination: – It means the statistical\
    \ data is transmitted or distributed to end-users. In Pursuing a\nPub/Sub Internet(PURSUIT)\
    \ project use BF to store the path information in source routing. The main scenario\n\
    of this project is general data dissemination [16].\nPrivacy Preserving: – The\
    \ IoT devices and sensors are used to collect and exchange a huge amount of data,\
    \ to\nimprove the transport system. As Cloud Computing progressed, more sensitive\
    \ information (like vehicle registration\nnumber, chassis number, insurance detail,etc.)\
    \ was released to the cloud. The most accurate way to protect data\nprivacy is\
    \ to encrypt data before extracting it [253]. Enabling keyword searches directly\
    \ over encrypted data is a\ndesirable way to make the best use of encrypted data.\
    \ Wang et al. has proposed a brand new idea for acquiring\nmultiple keywords (compound\
    \ keywords) in random search [282]. Unlike most existing keyword search programs,\n\
    the program eliminates the requirement of a predeﬁned keyword dictionary.\n7.3.\
    \ Smart environment\nMany developed cities suffer from poor air quality as population\
    \ and industry growth rapidly. Increasing accep-\ntance of smart transport data\
    \ in smart cities around the world has provided unprecedented opportunities to\
    \ improve\nair quality management in transportation [284]. Government agencies\
    \ and residents are increasingly concerned with\nair grade, which contributes\
    \ to a wide range of human environments and human development. The most common\n\
    methods of predicting air pollution especially utilize low-level simulations.\
    \ These standards produce disappointing\neffects that have led to aspects inﬂuencing\
    \ the measurement of air corrosion based on the overall structure of the\nbuilding.\
    \ Estimating air quality using atmospheric scattering standards is time-consuming.\
    \ Modeling incorporated\ntesting is a new expansion to measure air pollution and\
    \ conservatory gases in an intelligent environment. Normally,\nmaximum houses\
    \ in a smart city are used solar and wind turbines for green energy [140]. Liu\
    \ et al. suggested a\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model in planning smart environment\
    \ in smart cities, which predict air quality\nthat assists Staked Auto-Encoder\
    \ (SAE) [165]. LSTM is used to evaluate air quality forecasts in smart cities.\
    \ The\ninternal components that occur due to air pollution are removed by optimizing\
    \ SAE. The total error rate is 0.46 and\nthe class accuracy of 91.22% is shown\
    \ by this model, it still needs to be improved.\nJovanovska et al. proposed and\
    \ air quality system based on IoT and Cloud computing [130]. They visualize and\n\
    control air pollution using mobile applications. Sulfur oxide (SO2), Ozone(O3),\
    \ Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and most\nimportant PM10 and PM2.5 are common indicators\
    \ of contamination that cause health risks like heart and lung\ndiseases. So,\
    \ improving the quality of air is a good effort by everyone for the weather and\
    \ health of every citizen.\n7.3.1. Challenges in smart environment\nThe major\
    \ challenges for the environment are water pollution, air quality, and radiation.\
    \ To achieve sustainable\ngrowth by maintaining a healthy society proper vigilance\
    \ is needed in the world. With the development of IoT and\nsmart sensors, Smart\
    \ Environmental Monitoring (SEM) is the system for environmental monitoring, in\
    \ the latest\nyears [273]. Figure 16 shows various issues of environment like\
    \ temperature, radiation, dust, humidity, ultraviolet\nsignal etc. For establishing\
    \ the system Silvia et al. used the WSN which provides an interface between smart\
    \ sensors\nand IoT Devices [273].\nAir quality Monitoring: – Due to the rapid\
    \ increase in trafﬁc and industries, air pollution is one of the primary\nconcerns\
    \ of our epoch. The earth is becoming increasingly polluted due to the emissions\
    \ of harmful gases like CO,\nNO2, SO2, and CO2. These toxic gases can’t be predicted\
    \ because there are dissolve in the air. So, the air quality\nneeds to be checked,\
    \ and for that, an IoT-based tool is required. An IoT device can collect and analyze\
    \ the data\nto predict the air quality either good or bad. Sensors using Raspberry\
    \ Pi/ Arduino and IoT devices can monitor\nthe local air quality [175]. Dhingra\
    \ et al. develop an application i.e. “IoT-Mobair”, which is mobile-based use to\n\
    monitor and detect the air pollution of the concerned area [76]. This mobile-based\
    \ application has various features\nlike air quality, daily forecasts, health-related\
    \ tips, and risks, air quality map generations etc. But, when dealing with\nbig\
    \ data generated from sensors, then this application has faced some computational\
    \ complexity problems. For that\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\n251\nFig. 16. Challenges in smart environment.\nDhingra et al.\
    \ have suggested using fog computing instead of cloud computing. The IoT is a\
    \ global system of “smart\ndevices” which can detect and communicate with the\
    \ environment and interact with users and other applications.\nQian et al. found\
    \ that due to low sensitivity and low accuracy the exiting monitoring system does\
    \ not work well and\nit also requires laboratory analysis [218]. The data is highly\
    \ correlated in the case of air pollution monitoring, where\nthese systems are\
    \ leads to a lot of obsolete information. To the data delivery cost and to alleviate\
    \ data neglect Qian\net al. the system i.e. ‘Content-centric IoT-based Air pollution\
    \ Monitoring (CIAM)’. In CIAM, the content method\nis used to compile and integrate\
    \ air pollution data.\nWater quality Monitoring: – Monitoring of water quality\
    \ is important in determining water safety and related pub-\nlic health [256].\
    \ Water quality parameters are determined by the same factors as physical, chemical,\
    \ and biological.\nBacterial contamination, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, dispersion,\
    \ free chlorine, and pH are the typical parameters\nof water quality [215,219].\
    \ The various research papers have been studied in terms of intelligent water\
    \ pollution\ncontrol systems using ML, IoT, and smart sensors. The pollution of\
    \ water in the lake can be predicted using an\nML-based neural network for machine-reading\
    \ which analyzes the sensed image [160]. The water is classiﬁed as\npure or polluted,\
    \ and we studied the separation of water pollution with the use of ML methods\
    \ and IoT devices [61].\nThe prediction of water quality parameters using AI and\
    \ neural networks and the amounts of sulfate or chloride\npresent in water were\
    \ studied [220]. In order to separate the pollutants in water using SVM, the analysis\
    \ of big data\nand problems faced during the separation of water pollution were\
    \ discussed [46]. AI-SVM is a classiﬁcation system\nused for real-time monitoring\
    \ and technology used for testing and its separation from non-drinking water [41,128].\n\
    Video-based monitoring of water quality and pollution was investigated, which\
    \ used IoT video surveillance and\nML tools to separate dirty and clean water\
    \ [208]. To predict the future and quality of water before use, another\nfunction\
    \ which is a feature-based model, also helped in analyzing the water suggested\
    \ [311]. Different ML models\nwere used to test the concentration of chlorophyll-A\
    \ in pond water and were also recommended for real-time water\nmanagement system\
    \ [163].\nAgriculture Monitoring System: – The growth of industrial and robust\
    \ agricultural production methods has ac-\ncelerated to ensure the quality and\
    \ quantity of the growing demand for food [249]. In “smart or green agriculture”,\n\
    Smart Environment Monitoring (SEM) plays an important role as agriculture is the\
    \ relevant growth factor for any\nnation [210]. It also helps in product development\
    \ and sustainable growth to handle major challenges in the agricul-\nture sector\
    \ [196,239]. Ullo et al. refer to the smart agriculture scenarios (Fig. 17), where\
    \ the SEM system is a smart\nagricultural monitoring system in real. In the agriculture\
    \ sector, various factors are very important for achieving\nsustainable production,\
    \ like water level, water pollution level, moisture analysis, soil health etc.\
    \ These features are\nincluded in the smart agricultural monitoring system, which\
    \ is monitored and controlled using IoT devices, smart\nsensors for agriculture\
    \ data capturing, and WSN to transmit data into the cloud [273].\n252\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig. 17. Smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system using IoT devices and sensors.\nIn the new agricultural era,\
    \ there is a growing market for IoT that offers a few creative solutions. The\
    \ various\nstudies and research on Smart Agricultural Monitoring systems (SAM)\
    \ are discussed, which include fertilizer con-\ntrol, crop monitoring measures,\
    \ pest control, etc. Kumar et al. propose a system for plant growth monitoring\
    \ i.e.\n‘gCrop’ using IoT, ML and WSN [148]. They use a 3rd-degree regression\
    \ model and provide a prediction with a\nhigh computational complexity of 98%\
    \ accuracy. Shinde and Pathak et al. performed a crop quality test to monitor\n\
    the quality of paddy rice using Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) data [242]. In the\
    \ rice quality test, SVMs were used\nwith limited sample size and back distribution\
    \ features. The land and its size play an important role in checking the\ngrowth\
    \ level of different crop species that are either satisfactory or not. To measure\
    \ the leaf index Hosseini et al.\npropose a system with a Gaussian process model\
    \ [91] and using SVM as ML method and reported 89% with a lim-\nited sample size\
    \ [119]. To determine the level of fertilizer, pesticides, and water quantity\
    \ used for plant irrigation, an\nexpert system using AI was developed [78] using\
    \ the Naive Bayes [17] method and studying ML using sensory data\ntaken from agriculture.\
    \ UAV is used [77] to investigated the crop quality tests [230] and soil health\
    \ for phenological\ndata of soybean crop [49]. Smart farming [42], pest monitoring\
    \ [164], and crop monitoring [311] are important in\nthe various uses of SEM systems.\
    \ Weather and the environment also affect the health and growth of plants. Ullu\
    \ et\nal. propose a technique that checks the condition of the soil, moisture,\
    \ air, and water quality, temperature etc. in the\ncontext of SEM using IoT devices,\
    \ AI, and smart sensors [273]. The data analysis is performed while smart agricul-\n\
    ture provides estimation, assisting protection, decision making, and storage management\
    \ [249]. The data is moving\nwhile performing the techniques to achieve smart\
    \ agriculture, and various challenges are faced by both farmers and\nresearchers.\
    \ Some of them are addressed below.\n7.3.2. Challenges in smart agriculture\n\
    To increase food production, farmers will face many challenges. The production\
    \ will increase 70% by the year\n2050 [122]. Various challenges in agriculture\
    \ have been discussed (Fig. 18) as.\nIrrigation management: – One of the objectives\
    \ of an irrigation system is to calculate the water requirement for\ncrops based\
    \ on collected data and water ﬂow without interference from humans. Irrigation\
    \ systems use dispersed\nsensors to monitor the different soils, water bodies,\
    \ vegetation, and microscopic elements. Climate is one of the\nmost important\
    \ variables in estimating agricultural water requirements. A farmer can adjust\
    \ his irrigation system in\na variety of ways according to soil and weather conditions\
    \ [216]. The entire farm can track, manage, and forecast\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\
    \ / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n253\nFig. 18. Challenges in smart\
    \ agriculture.\nweather from almost anywhere. IoT will help in developing the\
    \ new infrastructure for irrigation in a very exciting\nway. Smart IoT-operated\
    \ irrigation systems use embedded sensors in the ﬁeld to monitor soil structures,\
    \ climate,\nand agricultural irrigation conditions.\nSoil management: – Soil monitoring\
    \ is one of the most challenging agricultural activities for both businesses and\n\
    farmers. Various soil parameters like pH, humidity, etc. are involved in soil\
    \ management and IoT sensors can be\nused to calculate these parameters. Soil\
    \ management helps in ﬁnding the right kind of plants and helps to identify\n\
    fertilizer requirements in the soil. Crop production can be affected by soil testing\
    \ due to a number of environmental\nconcerns. The process and patterns of farming\
    \ can easily be understood, if these types of problems are well deﬁned.\nCrop\
    \ production may improve and fertilization practices can be promoted based on\
    \ ﬁndings of a soil survey study for\nfarmers [37]. The moisture and humidity\
    \ sensors can monitor the moisture in the soil, and IoT technology identiﬁes\n\
    the contaminated soil and shields the ﬁeld from over-fertilization and damage\
    \ to crops. Agricultural productivity\nand quality may increase, pollution can\
    \ be avoided, and input costs may be reduced due to soil management.\nClimate\
    \ management: – Climate has a profound effect on crop production. With the use\
    \ of an IoT-enabled weather\nforecast system, farmers can determine the best time\
    \ to plant, irrigate, and harvest. With the help of distant sensors\nattached\
    \ to the ﬁeld, farmers can learn about natural conditions like humidity, soil\
    \ moisture, and air temperature.\nOn the basis of historical results, to maximize\
    \ the yield, farmers should properly prepare and market the harvest and\nirrigation\
    \ season. By editing and updating the collected data, farmers should take immediate\
    \ steps to ensure a safe\ncrop yield. Many of the right things are put together\
    \ to maintain and establish a good plant environment while living\nunder stringent\
    \ limits like airﬂow, temperature, CO2, and O2 levels. With the use of IoT-enabled\
    \ systems, where for\nadvanced decisions data can be exchanged between intelligent\
    \ sensors and devices, this can be achieved [288].\nAccurate farming: – The traditional\
    \ method of farming to increase yields and preserve crops was based on phys-\n\
    ical examination. If any issue was found, then it was resolved by trial and error\
    \ after being involved in a serious\n254\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nincident on the farm. Farmers will face various\
    \ different types of challenges while farming, like less water, ﬂoods,\nlack of\
    \ suitable planting space, and cost control. Productivity can be improved with\
    \ the use of IoT in agriculture.\nWith the use of gathered information, farmers\
    \ can organize their farming activities, including what seeds they should\nsow,\
    \ what crop yields should be expected, the time to harvest, and how much fertilizer\
    \ to use. Example: The natural\nsoil diversity of a ﬁeld is an accurate agricultural\
    \ practice. The plants can be planted thicker and the irrigation can\nbe used\
    \ sparingly if the soil in a certain area holds more water. Alternatively, if\
    \ the site is used for grazing, we can\ntake more cattle than an equivalent area\
    \ with a lower level of the soil.\nNutritional management: – As the human body\
    \ needs proper nutrition to grow, the same plants may require\naccurate nutrition.\
    \ Nutrients help to produce the best yield when given at the right prices and\
    \ at the right times.\nToo much and too limited nutrients for plants will affect\
    \ the environment. For example, too much phosphorus,\nammonia, or nitrogen may\
    \ reduce water levels. To grow in one place, the selection of the best crop cycle\
    \ allows\nfor balancing soil fertility. While reducing environmental degradation\
    \ and economic costs, achieving sustainable\nagriculture, nutrition, and technology\
    \ are essential [6].\nGarbage Management: – The wastage of water, soil, and seeds\
    \ is common during farming. This needs to be\ncontrolled, but in an intelligent\
    \ manner. For garbage collection, create smart trash cans using IoT sensors, which\n\
    can smartly sense and collect the garbage. The collected data related to network\
    \ disposal is used to read, store and\ntransmit with the help of these smart trash\
    \ cans. Garbage management can be done with the help of some smart and\nsystematic\
    \ algorithms [10].\nLivestock monitoring: – Livestock plays an important role\
    \ in agriculture, so they need intention, proper care,\ntimely feeding, etc. It\
    \ is a growing worldwide issue to provide enough food to the world’s people with\
    \ the grow-\ning agricultural production. As a result, the importance of livestock\
    \ management on farms is crucial to survival.\nTo improve the quality and quantity\
    \ of agricultural products, new technology like IoT advances is important. It\n\
    also improves the quality of livestock by allowing farmers to make decisions based\
    \ on data-driven. To monitor the\nlivestock’s welfare remotely and identify their\
    \ habitats, cloud-based technologies are used with power communica-\ntion sensors\
    \ [50]. The health condition of livestock like respiratory rate, digestion, blood\
    \ pressure, heart rate, and\nother day and night vital signs can be checked by\
    \ farmers using connected sensors. But the data ﬂow between these\nsensors and\
    \ smart devices is interrupted or tempered, so it needs to be secure and well\
    \ managed to get efﬁcient\nresults.\nFarm Management System (FMS): – Smart farming\
    \ promotes productivity while minimizing environmental in-\nﬂuences, but this\
    \ smart agriculture technique is merely possible with the help of FMS [97]. With\
    \ the help of WSN\nand GSM in FMS, farmers can track the entire farm and capture\
    \ the data with a small controller [199]. With the\nuse of sensors and smart devices\
    \ in the ﬁeld, the identiﬁer is used to provide appropriate awareness of soil,\
    \ fertility,\nand weather, to the farmers. The data collection and storage, monitoring,\
    \ and analysis of the farm operations can\nbe automated using an IoT-based farm\
    \ management system. It can also help in managing agricultural budgets and\nbusiness\
    \ operations. The irrigation scheme helps in protecting the farms from animals\
    \ and pests. But also automatic\nirrigation systems can increase the water consumption\
    \ [105,137].\nTracing and tracking: – Satyanarayana et al. [236] develop the structures\
    \ to remotely track soil structure and\nits status in accordance with the needs\
    \ of plant culture. The different agricultural areas and locations are tracked\n\
    using GPS devices and wireless network connections. The real-time data processing\
    \ is tracked and approved by\nconnecting WSN and ZigBee to other devices like\
    \ the Central Monitoring Station (CMoS), GSM, and GPRS. The\nGPS also enables\
    \ the farmer to take actions based on notiﬁcations sent to the farm manager through\
    \ SMS or MMS.\nIt is often used in agriculture to detect precise location and\
    \ control capacity, despite it having high operating and\nmaintenance costs.\n\
    Plant management: – The growth of a farmer’s crop is most important in farming.\
    \ Farmers use good seeds,\norganic fertilizers, proper watering etc. for best\
    \ results. For farmers to protect themselves from them, they use\nchemical medicines\
    \ and fertilizers, which may later affect the human body. So, it required an intelligent\
    \ system that\nprotects the crop from insects and does not affect the human body.\
    \ This can be done by plant management, which\ninvolves monitoring and recording\
    \ the welfare of the crop. The plant and its diseases can be detected using RFID\n\
    chips and IoT sensors. The farmers can process the data remotely and take necessary\
    \ steps like keeping the insects\nfrom plants. The production of rice for a speciﬁc\
    \ country with a Chinese monitoring station using SVM [152].\nM. Kumar and A.\
    \ Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n255\nFarmers can also prevent\
    \ the risk and plan their farming practices by demonstrating an effective calculation\
    \ strategy\nfor coffee fruit [68].\nWater Management: – The major challenge in\
    \ greenhouses is to determine how much water is required i.e. wa-\nter management\
    \ [281]. Intelligent sensors are installed to control the waste of water and operate\
    \ them by using a\nvariety of IoT techniques. Automated drip irrigation is used\
    \ to control the soil moisture in irrigation and storage of\nwater in greenhouses.\
    \ The farmers are checking the water levels in a water tank with their Android\
    \ phones. With\nthe use of IoT devices and sensors, the whole water management\
    \ is done like the motor is automatically started and\nstopped by checking the\
    \ level water level. Due to over-irrigation in conventional irrigation systems,\
    \ up to 50% of\nwater is lost [241]. A smart Irrigation system(SIS) provides a\
    \ system to overcome this issue. This system helps the\nfarmers to avoid water\
    \ wastage and improve the quality of their crops through timely irrigation. SIS\
    \ also transmits\nthe knowledge of the ﬁeld to the farmer using temperature and\
    \ soil sensors. Farmers may also plan and modify their\nirrigation according to\
    \ the local weather information. For Water Distribution System (WDS) an architecture\
    \ WD-\nSchain’, which is blockchain-based in MATLAB, is proposed [172]. For security,\
    \ various consensus mechanisms\nare used, and results show a trade-off is required\
    \ between data validation and system complexity (Fig. 19).\nFig. 19. Water distribution\
    \ systems chain architecture [172].\nBlockchain with Agricultural IoT: – To improve\
    \ agricultural intelligence, data-driven technologies can be allowed\na secure\
    \ data storage system. The data collection is often very costly where the inventory,\
    \ agricultural contracts, and\ninformation about farm conditions from a reliable\
    \ source can be provided. Developing the trust between providers\nand consumers\
    \ and establishing a reliable food supply chain, the blockchain technology helps\
    \ in tracking the food\nfor timely payments to stakeholders [191].\nTo monitor\
    \ the farm and collect the data remotely, smart sensors and cameras were used.\
    \ To adopt the current\ncondition of agricultural land, farmers can use IoT devices\
    \ as they use smartphones anywhere in the world. New\ntechnologies like IoT have\
    \ the potential to increase global productivity and reduce the cost of crop production.\
    \ To\nface the challenges on the farm, the agricultural sector can be restructured\
    \ by providing different IoT-based tools\nand techniques. A massive amount of\
    \ unstructured data has also been generated and the PDS has the potential to\n\
    solve issues like handling big data with real-time response.\n7.3.3. Applications\
    \ of PDS in smart environment\nEnergy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness: – To improve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and trafﬁc awareness. Yousef et al.\npropose a scheme in underwater\
    \ WSN for water pollution monitoring [297]. BF is used in the preprocessing step\
    \ to\nreduce the number of transmissions and eliminate redundancy to save precious\
    \ energy. This type of project is mainly\nused in deep water like the sea and\
    \ ocean. Mahmoud et al. use BF for customer’s identity and privacy-preserving\n\
    of transferred data in WDS [173]. They also suggest the optimal parameters of\
    \ BF i.e. for 200 customers with 2000\n256\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\nnumbers of bits and 7 hash functions. In WDSchain,\
    \ BF is used to match the authentication of network nodes in\nproof-of-authentication(PoAuth).\n\
    High-performance communication networks: – IoT devices contain many sensors, routers,\
    \ actuators, and base sta-\ntions that need communications between them and send\
    \ millions of data that need to deliver with high-performance\ncommunication networks.\
    \ IoT devices that may have limited power resources or limited integration areas\
    \ have an\nimportant research challenge. To increase the performance of IoT communication\
    \ networks alassery et al. propose\nan efﬁcient mechanism based on BF [12]. BF\
    \ is used to store the routing information after aggregating packets to\nsend\
    \ receiving packets to upstream routers.\nQuery Optimization: – Under the big\
    \ data domain has been developed an air monitoring system, which poses\nmajor\
    \ challenges to data analysis. Peng et al. proposed a scheme for query optimization\
    \ of air quality big data using\nBF index [211]. The efﬁciency of data collected\
    \ in the air quality monitoring system is improved. They create a\nHive data repository\
    \ in the Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) ﬁle format and the Row Group Index (RGI).\
    \ For basic\ndata types 64-bits ThomasWang’s hash function is used and Murmur3\
    \ 64-bit hash algorithm for string and binary\ntype by BF in ORC.\nPrivacy-preserving\
    \ Data Aggregation and Analysis: – A data aggregation algorithm is proposed using\
    \ BF for\nprivacy data analysis in mobile crowdsensing system [212].\n7.4. Smart\
    \ industry\nIn world development, industrial growth plays an important role. When\
    \ the word comes to mind ‘Industry’, then\nmost people probably think that it\
    \ is a noisy and big place. The growth of the industry has increased by 18th century.\n\
    Due to the lack of technologies owned by the industry, it faces various challenges\
    \ like production, distribution,\nsupply chain management etc [279]. By the year\
    \ 2050, technology will have progressed to the level of autonomy\n[80]. The industries\
    \ are categorized into three economic sectors: primary, secondary, and tertiary\
    \ [24].\nPrimary industry: – This sector is concerned with the general people,\
    \ means to sell and supply the products.\nThis sector is place dependent because\
    \ the raw material is extracted from the earth. The operation of this sector for\n\
    economic growth revolves around minerals, earth water, vegetation etc. The example\
    \ of these sectors are farming,\nmining, and ﬁshing and they extract the raw material\
    \ like coal, foods, corn etc. There are two types of industries\nunder the primary\
    \ sector: The genetic industry and the Extractive Industry.\nSecondary industry:\
    \ – After the collection of raw material by primary industries the secondary industries\
    \ used this\nmaterial for construction and manufacturing the products. These industries\
    \ are used to make products like steel for\nautomobiles, textiles for cloths,\
    \ wood for furniture, etc. For manufacturing these products heavy machinery is\
    \ used\nin the production plant and also required manpower for packaging and distribution.\
    \ The example of these sectors\nare consumer goods, craft & fashion, construction,\
    \ manufacturing etc. There are two types of industries under this\nsector: Heavy\
    \ industry and Light industry.\nTertiary industry: – The product is manufactured\
    \ from raw material in the above sector and is now ready for use\nby consumers.\
    \ Tertiary industries generally they are not making any products but only provide\
    \ services to consumers\nand local industries & markets. The main feature of this\
    \ sector is discussion, experiences, access, etc. The ﬁnancial\nand education\
    \ sectors are two groups of tertiary sectors one for making money (ﬁnancial) and\
    \ the other (education)\nis non-proﬁtable. Examples of these sectors are banking,\
    \ educators, administrative, medical, ﬁnancial, insurance,\ntransportation retail,\
    \ wholesale, real estate, hotels, police, defense services, media and information\
    \ technology and\nso on. There are three types of industries under the tertiary\
    \ sector: Telecommunication, Professional, and Franchises.\nThese industries help\
    \ in growing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rate of the country.\n7.4.1. Industry\
    \ evolution\nThe farming and handicraft economizing processes changed to be monopolized\
    \ by industry and manufacturing\nmachines in the Industry Revolution. These changes\
    \ transformed society fundamentally in terms of living and\nworking styles. In\
    \ the 18th century Britain began this process and spread all over the world. The\
    \ production of\nmanufactured goods and the use of natural resources have increased\
    \ after these technological changes [294]. The\nindustrial evolution has been\
    \ categorized in Fig. 20 and succinct as given in Table 5.\nIndustry 1.0: – In\
    \ the years 1760–1850, the ﬁrst revolution was introduced with the mechanical\
    \ theme [225].\nIt used steam, coal, and water mechanization for the manufacturing\
    \ process. Production through machines had\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n257\nFig. 20. Industry 1.0–5.0.\nincreased, so\
    \ the rate of production had increased by eight times for conventional methods\
    \ [270]. It also increased the\nstandard of life by creating various goods in\
    \ massive amounts. Human productivity was increased by the use of steam\npower\
    \ [83]. Machines, stream power, and water power played an important role in the\
    \ ﬁrst industrial revolution’s\ngrowth. If we talk about the developing sectors\
    \ in this revolution, textile manufacture, chemicals, paper machines,\ncement,\
    \ iron industry, gaslighting, transportation, agriculture, railways, and many\
    \ more are existing there [291].\nIndustry 2.0: – In the year 1880–1973 this revolution\
    \ was introduced with industrialization [131]. With the adop-\ntion of new technologies\
    \ like telephone, electric power, sewage, internal combustion engine, etc. this\
    \ revolution\nmanufactured mass production. The sectors that are developed in\
    \ Industry 2.0 through technology are steel, paper\nmaking, petroleum, automobile,\
    \ fertilizer, Iron, chemical, rubber, electriﬁcation, machine tools, telecommunica-\n\
    tions, and many more. Mainly this revolution occurs in America, Britain, and Germany\
    \ [193].\nIndustry 3.0: – In the year 1989–2013, the industrial revolution ‘Industry\
    \ 3.0’ was started. In this industry the\nproduction was automatically done without\
    \ human interference so, the production sector grew in the engineering\nﬁeld.\
    \ The automation was fully computerized, which increases the efﬁciency and reliability\
    \ of the industrial system.\nBut automation also affects employment. With the\
    \ growth in technology, many industries start using robots and\nreducing manpower.\
    \ Industry robots are designed with programmable integrated circuits and give\
    \ accurate and efﬁ-\ncient results. Robots can do painting, welding, testing,\
    \ labeling, etc. It is estimated by the International Federation of\nRobotics\
    \ there are 1.64 million robots used in industry worldwide [51].\nIndustry 4.0:\
    \ – In 2011 the industrial revolution ‘Industry 4.0’ was ﬁrst proposed by the\
    \ German government. In\nthis revolutionary trend, computerization is used in\
    \ manufacturing [149]. The cyber-physical system was developed\nand all systems\
    \ are communicated using IoT devices, cloud computing, and machine learning [272,278].\
    \ These IoT\ndevices help ‘Industry 4.0’ for providing services and also in manufacturing.\
    \ This industry transform information\nthrough Industrial IoT (IIoT) [190]. The\
    \ key components of this revolution include IoT, Cloud Computing, Big\nData, Cyber\
    \ Security, Cognitive computing, etc. [286]. German was initiative the Industry\
    \ 4.0 as “smart manufac-\nturing for the future” [155]. This revolution has emerged\
    \ with the aim of achieving mass production and increasing\nproductivity using\
    \ innovative technologies i.e. similar to previous revolutions [25,213].\nIndustry\
    \ 5.0: – This revolution in the industry is declared by the European Commission,\
    \ after discussions with\nvarious funding agencies, and organizations in Research\
    \ and Innovation workshops in January 2021. To provide\nservices to humanity this\
    \ industry focuses on and highlights innovation and research. It uses the blockchain\
    \ concept\nto integrate the generated data from different industries. To achieve\
    \ social goals like employment, the standard of\nliving and development this industry\
    \ plays a key role [43].\nIndustry 5.0 is not entirely new it is the upgrade version\
    \ of industry 4.0. With growing technology, artiﬁcial\nintelligence uses in industries\
    \ also improved. The capability of humans, interaction with computers, and robot\n\
    workers gives efﬁcient and effective results [279]. This industry proposed the\
    \ 3D techniques (like 3D printing or\nadditive manufacturing is used for creating\
    \ 3D objects) with the use of IoT [80].\n258\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\

    Data Security: – As the rapid growth of technologies in the smart industry a huge\
    \ amount of data is moving\nbetween IoT devices. The security of data is also\
    \ a major challenge in the smart industry. The data protected and\nsafe from unauthorized\
    \ access is also a challenge to the industry.\nData Management: – This is also\
    \ the major challenge when a huge amount of data is following over the network\n\
    and between devices. Data need to be well structured and in a good manner to access\
    \ and get efﬁcient results.\nStorage: – Storage of industrial big data is very\
    \ tough both for users and developers. Data generated from various\nresources\
    \ IoT devices are scattered and not ﬁltered. The storage of that type of data\
    \ is not easy.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart\
    \ city\n259\n7.4.3. Applications of PDS in smart industry\nRemove ambiguity: –\
    \ The data generated in the smart industry is ambiguous. Wang et al. proposed\
    \ a technique\n“Fingerprint Summary” for cluster data de-duplication which is\
    \ time and space-efﬁcient. They use BF in this tech-\nnique in each node, for\
    \ reducing data duplication. For efﬁcient detect and remove duplicate data [57]\
    \ proposed a\nnew data structure i.e. ‘Improved Streaming Quotient Filter (ISQF)’.\n\
    Validation: – BF is used for data validation. BF is used to reduce memory consumption\
    \ and bypass the unneces-\nsary comparisons in the validation process [109]. This\
    \ process is space-efﬁcient.\n7.5. Smart energy\nSmart energy plays an important\
    \ role in solving the various issues of past, present, and future like healthcare,\n\
    agriculture, the environment, sustainable development, and many more [79]. The\
    \ energy-saving systems have al-\nready been developed in various cities and buildings,\
    \ in the last few years. A lot of studies for efﬁcient energy have\nalready been\
    \ done [142]. Instead of using the word “smart grid”, a broader approach is to\
    \ use the terms “Smart\nEnergy” or “Smart Energy Systems” (Fig. 21).\nFig. 21.\
    \ Smart energy.\nThe energy system is also facing various challenges like stability,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, cost control, operational\nefﬁciency, environmental issue,\
    \ service management etc. [90]. By achieving smart energy management big data\
    \ an-\nalytics provide new opportunities to deal with these challenges [18]. The\
    \ innovative storage solution and distributed\nresources for efﬁcient power transmission,\
    \ clean power generation, dynamic power distribution, and rational elec-\ntricity\
    \ consumption have been proposed [188]. Smart grid achieves the energy transmission\
    \ and data collection at\nthe same time by integrating energy and information\
    \ ﬂow [187]. The primary focus of smart grids is on electricity\n260\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nsectors like cooling,\
    \ heating, electricity, transportation, industry, building etc. It also provides\
    \ affordable, achievable\nsolutions for sustainable and renewable energy [168].\
    \ In the last few years, due to the huge growth in industry,\nenergy consumption\
    \ has also increased. It also increases data generation. With the emergence of\
    \ ICT, the energy\nsystems are being digitized [309]. The massive amount of generated\
    \ data from energy-related sources needs to be\nwell structured for efﬁcient and\
    \ fast results [177]. Due to the rapid increase in the population, energy consumption\n\
    has also increased. Renewable energy like wind and solar power is also in its\
    \ developing stage and has brought\nchallenges like energy security and the adoption\
    \ of new technologies [262]. Industries are using more than one-third\nof the\
    \ total electrical energy used by the country, for production, construction, and\
    \ mining. So in order to gather\nvaluable information, they have collected a big\
    \ database. This data is being used to raise the standard of living [231].\nThe\
    \ variety of big data, like the status of the device, consumption of electricity,\
    \ and interaction with the user, is\nbeing collected by the smart grid. To process\
    \ this big dataset, various techniques like analysis, optimization [310],\nclustering\
    \ [232], classiﬁcation [307] and forecasting [88] have been applied. So, the accurate\
    \ prediction of electricity\ndemand and consumption, the operation and generation\
    \ of power in real-time can be optimized, and also effectively\ndevelop the pricing\
    \ mechanism. With the use of big data analytics, the smart grid gives more control\
    \ over the use\nof energy to the customer, supplies economic and reliable energy,\
    \ responds quickly to the demand for electricity,\nand also quickly restores and\
    \ detect the failure and many more facilities [124]. This also helps in taking\
    \ decision\nfor customers, producers, operators, and regulators in the smart grid\
    \ [308]. Energy management uses emerging\ntechnologies like ICT (Fig. 22).\nFig.\
    \ 22. Energy management (energy cloud) [197].\nThe pattern of consumption and\
    \ production of energy is changed due to involving of big data. The energy big\n\
    data has involved 3Es and 4Vs energy, empathy, exchange, value, velocity, volume,\
    \ and variety [308].\n7.5.1. Challenges in smart energy\nThere are various opportunities\
    \ and some challenges brought by energy big data. Some challenges are listed here:\n\
    Effectively collection of energy big data: It is very difﬁcult to collect data\
    \ from energy resources for giving\nefﬁcient and effective decision-making and\
    \ quick responses.\nManagement storage of energy big data: This is also one of\
    \ the major challenges for energy big data to provide\nbetter services to customers.\n\
    M. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n261\nMining\
    \ and analyzing of energy big data: The mining of data for cleaning big raw data\
    \ and analysis is a very\ntough job.\nLack of effective and efﬁcient decision\
    \ making: The decision making is one of the impotent key points of a smart\nenergy\
    \ system, it also needs to be improved by joining efﬁcient techniques like PDS.\n\
    Privacy preserving of energy big data: This is one of the major concerns to giving\
    \ security to energy big data.\nWith the use of IoT devices, a huge amount of\
    \ data is ﬂowing without any security measures.\nTo achieve the above-discussed\
    \ challenges efﬁcient and effective tools and techniques like PDS are required.\n\
    7.5.2. Applications of PDS in smart energy\nPrivacy Preserving: Zhang et al. proposed\
    \ a mechanism Cuckoo-RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and\nLossy Networks)\
    \ to defend from Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) network from blackhole\
    \ attack. Cuckoo-\nRPL is also useful to defend from other attacks like version\
    \ number and gray hole attack [303].\nNetwork trafﬁc management: Chaudhary et\
    \ al. designed a “SDN-enabled multi-attribute-based secure communi-\ncation protocol”\
    \ in the Smart Grid environment for their entity communication. They use a cuckoo\
    \ ﬁlter for fast\nforwarding of data [56].\nLoad Balancing: Debnath et al. present\
    \ a scheme i.e. ‘BloomFlash for ﬂash storage device. This scheme also\nachieved\
    \ the load balancing of elements across the BF component. This scheme proves that\
    \ the BF is useful in load\nbalancing techniques [72].\n7.6. Smart governance\n\
    Smart governance means accessing the government services free and in a better\
    \ manner using various free data\nprojects. With the emergence of ICT in smart\
    \ cities, smart governance can improve the services provided by the\ncities [159].\
    \ Developing the businesses of the individual smart economies can play an important\
    \ role in providing a\ncollaborative platform. A smart economy also emphasizes\
    \ economic competitiveness in the development of the city,\non the competitive\
    \ edge economic and human activity [143].\nSmart Economy: – Smart economy that\
    \ is for success with high social welfare, sustainability, and resource-\nefﬁcient,\
    \ is based on innovative technologies. It also helps in improving the quality\
    \ of life by adopting new inno-\nvative ideas and building new entrepreneurs,\
    \ and start-ups, which increase competitiveness and productivity [263].\nThis\
    \ whole system is based on technologies and ICT for urban planning and economic\
    \ advancement. For social\nbeneﬁts smart economy is also expected to deliver more\
    \ products and services without compromising energy and\npollution [144].\nSmart\
    \ Government: – Smart government is the timely demand of the 21st century and\
    \ smart governance is its\nkey tool. The key pillar of smart governance is to\
    \ use technology. The public administration is required to update\nitself with\
    \ the emergence of technology. No one can oppose adopting smart governance as\
    \ it is the new face of\npublic administration, governance, and political process\
    \ [237]. The e-government adopts the electronic process in\nthe administration\
    \ system and political system and it is the starting face of smart government.\
    \ There is a trend of\nusing modern technologies in public administration for\
    \ smart governance systems by developed countries and their\nresearchers, academicians,\
    \ politicians, and practitioners [182]. The role of smart government is presented\
    \ in Fig. 23.\nAn intelligent network is created in the sector of governance and\
    \ it is directly related to the internet where people\ncan connect with each other\
    \ for communication even in remote areas. Better communication with real-time\
    \ objects in\nthe intelligent network is done through the distributed network\
    \ [234]. As it is not an automated decision-maker so\nit is not artiﬁcial intelligence.\
    \ It only connects to the people for gathering information and making the decision\
    \ and\nuse it in the future. Due to the rapid growth of IoT devices and digital\
    \ applications, a lot of data is produced. The\nsource of big data is social networking\
    \ websites, mobile phones, daily household appliances, various private and\ngovernment\
    \ websites, and smart devices being used by various researchers.\nBig data plays\
    \ an important role in transforming traditional governance into smart governance.\
    \ Researchers,\nacademicians, and policymakers argued about the transformation\
    \ of traditional public administration to modern and\nsmart administration in\
    \ point of big data. For developing the public administration and government sector\
    \ a large\namount of data is required. It also helps in developing new models\
    \ [238]. Big data also help in effective decisions,\nfast and efﬁcient results,\
    \ and expert users, increasing their accountability and transparency. It also\
    \ helps in solving\n262\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures\
    \ in smart city\nFig. 23. Role of smart government.\ncomplex tools for reforming\
    \ the government but some researchers have doubts about future technologies. Many\n\
    countries have adopted big data for smart governance, but some public administrations\
    \ are still not ready to adopt\nbig data as full ﬂedge. It happens because, for\
    \ implementation of these technologies, data collection, production and\nprocessing\
    \ require a big investment. And those public administrations who implement impulsive\
    \ faces threats and\nchallenges like reducing the productivity, efﬁciency, and\
    \ capacity in governing system [248].\nThe solutions to these challenges, problems,\
    \ and threats are big data-driven technologies [75] like PDS. The\ngovernment\
    \ agencies taking future and proper decisions, and identify criminals and corruption,\
    \ with the help of\nproper use of big data. The government is generating and managing\
    \ the knowledge with their major responsibility\n[5].\n7.6.1. Challenges in smart\
    \ governance\nAdopting Big data technologies: Some developing countries are already\
    \ adopting big data technologies in smart\ngovernance. But many are facing problems,\
    \ due to their bad handling and management, lack of knowledge, cost-\neffectiveness,\
    \ and data available being either unstructured or semi-structured.\nData Privacy:\
    \ Much conﬁdential data is uploaded by people and used by public administration.\
    \ So, it needs to be\nprotected from malicious users.\nApplications of PDS in\
    \ Smart Governance: As such, we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart\
    \ gover-\nnance. So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. PDS\
    \ is an efﬁcient data structure for managing\ndata storage and is also compatible\
    \ with new technologies. PDS also helps in protecting data.\n7.7. Smart society\n\
    A smart society means to promote the satisfaction of citizens satisfaction and\
    \ the well-being of metropolitan\nresidents. In this reference, a smart society\
    \ includes a large number of smart: people, infrastructure, education,\nliving;\
    \ water and waste management systems and many more [243]. Society 4.0 faces the\
    \ challenge with information\nsharing and related knowledge, while in society\
    \ 5.0 the increased process complexity and assured sustainability due\nto the\
    \ massive amount of data combined with environment and human physical investigation.\
    \ The major challenge\nwith big data is to take real-time decisions [94].\nM.\
    \ Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n263\nFig.\
    \ 24. Society evolution 1.0–5.0 [95].\n7.7.1. Society evolution\nSociety is coexistence\
    \ with nature, and according to ethnographers, society 1.0 had begun with the\
    \ birth of humans\nknown as the hunting society (Society 1.0). In 13,000 BC the\
    \ settlements had been ﬁrmly established and irrigation\ntechniques had been developed\
    \ known as an agrarian society (Society 2.0). At the end of the 18th century,\
    \ the steam\nlocomotives were invented and mass production had started, it was\
    \ the industrial society (Society 3.0). In the latter\n20th century computers\
    \ were invented and the distribution of information was started, this is the information\
    \ society\n(Society 4.0). At the beginning of the 21st century, “super-smart society”\
    \ has introduced and known as (Society\n5.0). The social evolution has categorized\
    \ and concise as given below (Fig. 24).\nSociety 1.0: – This society’s evolution\
    \ begins with the birth of humans. This society is also called a hunting\nsociety.\
    \ People used simple tools for full ﬁll their daily needs including food. People\
    \ have changed their habits on\nthe availability of resources [138].\nSociety\
    \ 2.0: – In 13000 BC this social evolution was introduced with new developing\
    \ agriculture techniques\nand it is also known as an agrarian society. With the\
    \ advancement of technology and demographical changes, this\nrevolution is transformed\
    \ from the earlier society revolution [29]. In Mesopotamia, the hand-made pottery\
    \ and the\ncultivation of barley and wheat were found at early stages [14].\n\
    Society 3.0: – This societal revolution begin at the end of the 18th century,\
    \ when modern physics, gravity law, and\nthe invention of the steam engine had\
    \ discovered and also called Industrial Society. This society changes the face\n\
    of the earth forever. As already discussed industry revolutions are one of the\
    \ growing ﬁelds in terms of economy\nas well as academia [254]. This also builds\
    \ the relationship through transportation, environment, society, and many\nmore.\n\
    Society 4.0: – This is the Information Society, initially planned in 1972 in Japan.\
    \ This society aims for a new\nera after the post-industrial revolution in the\
    \ year 1985 [179]. Here the production of information promotes human\ncreativity,\
    \ and the transition, and development of society.\nSociety 5.0: – At the beginning\
    \ of the 21st century this revolution was introduced with a vision of a “super-\n\
    smart society”. This society provides solutions to many social problems through\
    \ technologies because it is human-\ncentered. This also improves the quality\
    \ of life, the use of robots also increases, and also environment-friendly\n[14].\n\
    7.7.2. Applications of smart society\nThe smart society is directly concerned\
    \ with citizens and daily lives. The main applications are discussed below\n(Fig.\
    \ 25).\nSmart Home/Houses: – To increase the quality of life and independence,\
    \ the homes are equipped with technolo-\ngies called “smart home” [73]. Smart\
    \ homes include home appliances like television, air conditioners, smart fans\n\
    264\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 25. Applications of smart society.\nand lights, etc. are connected with IoT\
    \ devices to effectively deliver the services. To achieve the goals of providing\n\
    the services efﬁciently, the Smart Home Reasoning System (SHRS) plays an impotent\
    \ role to make decisions [181].\nReducing environmental emissions, energy management,\
    \ and increasing home automation is the primary objective\nof smart home [229].\n\
    Smart Living/People: – Smart living gives new opportunities to citizens to increase\
    \ their standard of living. It\nneeds to follow an inclusive strategic approach\
    \ across all age groups and demographics [203]. It provides solutions\nthat are\
    \ controllable, productive, sustainable, economical, and efﬁcient. Smart living\
    \ is changing people’s lives\nwith the emergence of new technologies. Yan et al.\
    \ propose an architecture that controls home lighting using a\nBluetooth-based\
    \ Android smartphone [295]. Peoples are safer in their homes, if they have to\
    \ face any problem, they\ncall independently also the objective of smart living\
    \ [153].\nSmart Buildings: – Smart building is deﬁned as it is efﬁcient energy\
    \ management, a convenient and comfort-\nable environment with reasonable investment,\
    \ and is designed to provide service and management [169]. A smart\nbuilding also\
    \ includes automated processes like security, heating, lighting, air conditioning,\
    \ ventilation, and many\nmore [221]. To develop the smart building the things\
    \ required are future-proof devices, IT skilled team, and robust\nwireless infrastructure.\
    \ The basic components of smart building for security includes CCTV system, access\
    \ control,\nintrusion system, gate automation etc [184].\nSmart Education: – With\
    \ the advancement of technologies everything may be interconnected, instrumented\
    \ with\nAI [313]. Smart education is also an emerging area nowadays and also needs\
    \ attention from both researchers and\nacademics [135]. Various smart education\
    \ projects [121] have already been performed in recent years, in which the\nﬁrst\
    \ smart education project is carried out by Malaysia in 1997 [52]. Smart education\
    \ [62] faces certain issues like\naccessing student knowledge, comparing behavioral\
    \ patterns of a student, data integration, data mining, detecting\neffective and\
    \ emotional state of the student, and many more [60].\nM. Kumar and A. Singh /\
    \ Probabilistic data structures in smart city\n265\n7.7.3. Challenges in smart\
    \ society\nEfﬁciency: – All resource uses in a smart society have their limits\
    \ like battery power, memory storage, and\nbandwidth required for communication.\
    \ They directly affect efﬁciency, which also increases with the rapid growth\n\
    in data.\nHeterogeneous data: – The data generated in the super-smart city is\
    \ heterogeneous, which leads to challenges in\nprocessing, analyzing, and mining\
    \ data. Getting adequate information from big data in heterogeneous information\n\
    networks is also a big challenge.\nPrivacy preserving: – On increasing of smart\
    \ technologies in a smart society the issue of security, and privacy is\nthe main\
    \ concern. Challenges in all aspects like access control, authentication, policy\
    \ enforcement etc.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Society: As such we have not\
    \ found any existing use of PDS in the smart society.\nSo here the scope of use\
    \ of PDS is highly recommendable. In lieu of the above challenges, there are many\
    \ studies\nand researches available that PDS and its variants give an efﬁcient\
    \ result with memory management, and storage,\nalso to handle heterogeneous data.\
    \ PDSs also provide security to the data.\n7.8. Smart sustainability\nThe idea\
    \ of sustainability was introduced in 1987. Sustainability deﬁne that the to meet\
    \ today’s needs without\nsacriﬁcing the future ability to fulﬁll their requirements\
    \ like social, economic, and environmental [19]. Emerging\ntechnologies and digital\
    \ governance are also part of smart sustainability [178]. It also requires a balance\
    \ between\nthe technology, policy, and management by local government [235]. The\
    \ main pillars of sustainability are environ-\nmental, economic, and social. Smart\
    \ sustainability has the potential for solving the problems of urban areas [296].\n\
    In sustainable development, governance plays an impotent role [84]. In sustainable\
    \ development’s planning and\nimplementation, the stakeholder and policymakers\
    \ lack practical research knowledge. To achieve this new technolo-\ngies like\
    \ ICT, IoT and cloud are being used in a smart city. Modern technology and creativity\
    \ are being focused\non the framework of smart cities as compared to sustainability\
    \ cities depending on the data-driven identiﬁcation\nof the dynamic changes in\
    \ the broadcast relationship [258]. To achieve the required level of sustainability\
    \ the data\ncame from various sources in smart cities are need to be well structured.\
    \ The IoT technologies measures in smart\nsustainable cities are air and water\
    \ quality, green urban areas, tourism and culture, energy, digital transformation,\
    \ le-\ngality, and security (Fig. 26). Sustainable economic advancement includes\
    \ all the factors that are included in a smart\ncity. These factors are green\
    \ building, smart education, social responsibility, water management, sustainable\
    \ energy,\nsmart health, smart governance, natural resource management, sustainable\
    \ transportation, and waste management\n(Fig. 27).\nFig. 26. Smart sustainable.\n\
    7.8.1. Challenges in smart sustainability\nCollection of data: – For developing\
    \ sustainability a huge amount of big data is required at a place.\nStorage management:\
    \ – The management of this data in a proper manner is a big challenge.\nPrivacy\
    \ and Security: – Security and privacy of this data is also the main concern.\n\
    266\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nFig.\
    \ 27. Smart sustainable city.\nApplications of PDS in Smart Sustainability: As\
    \ such we have not found any existing use of PDS in smart city\nsustainability.\
    \ So here the scope of use of PDS is highly recommendable. The PDS and its variant\
    \ are very much\neffective in data collection with less time and efﬁcient storage\
    \ management. It also provides security to the data\nmovement in smart sustainability.\n\
    8. Comprehensive analysis of PDS in smart city\nIn the smart city, the data, and\
    \ information are the entrance to instantly bounded competitive beneﬁts. Today,\n\
    billions of people are accessing and releasing huge amounts of data via the internet,\
    \ and social networks. This\ngrowth in data required efﬁcient storage and handling\
    \ of data is a big challenge for both academia and industry [96].\nTo improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of data access and testing, the storage of monthly or annual data\
    \ production from various\ncompanies, hospitals, institutions, and forests is\
    \ at data centers [118]. The variants of data structures in PDSs are\nimportant\
    \ for big data and live streaming systems. A BF is a probabilistic randomized\
    \ data structure given by Burton\nBloom, for efﬁciently storing information of\
    \ static sets to support membership queries [36]. Presently BF is widely\nused\
    \ in many networking and security algorithms [201]. After studying the existing\
    \ uses of PDS in smart cities, it is\nfound that many researchers have used BF\
    \ in healthcare for efﬁcient storage of patient data, privacy-preserving etc.\n\
    in various applications Some of the existing applications of PDS in a smart city\
    \ are recapitulated in below (Table 6).\n9. Generational data management\nA massive\
    \ amount of data is ﬂowing in a smart city. Obviously, this data needs to be managed\
    \ for their well-being\nto be used for both personal and civic data services.\
    \ The use of WEB 3.0 for data management is also important.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh\

    \ – May be applicable in smart city applications.\nIslam et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ mechanism using bloom ﬁlter which provides protection from cyber threats\nin\
    \ the healthcare system [125]. In this concern, Liu et al. proposed a blockchain-based\
    \ distributed data storage\nscheme with enabled edge computing. The counting bloom\
    \ ﬁlter is used when the storage checking fails to locate\nthe error data and\
    \ to realize data dynamics [161]. Similarly, Nie et al. propose a secure and privacy-preserving\n\
    blockchain-based data-sharing scheme. For secure proﬁle matching, the ‘Key-policy\
    \ attribute-based encryption’\nalgorithm is used, and to verify the authenticity\
    \ of ciphertext, a bloom ﬁlter with hash functions is designed [200].\nA secure\
    \ framework in a sustainable city environment is proposed by Singh et al. for\
    \ smart parking that is energy\nefﬁcient and blockchain-enabled. For secure communication\
    \ of parking zone data, the Elliptic Curve Cryptography\n(ECC) algorithm is used\
    \ at the transport layer to encrypt and decrypt the data [247].\n10. Research\
    \ opportunities and challenges in smart city\nAs discussed in Section 1.1, big\
    \ data analysis, retrieval, and processing have very high importance from the\n\
    perspective of smart cities. As storage and retrieval of large volumes of unstructured\
    \ data, especially when responses\nare required in real-time, remains a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge for researchers. From the extensive LR done, some of the\nidentiﬁed\
    \ research areas are:\nFiltering and processing of sensor data: – The data generated\
    \ by various sensors and wearable devices have\nsome limitations like security,\
    \ privacy, ethics, data format, user acceptance, and big data concerns. Also,\
    \ have\nincompatibility issues between data and information. The information collected\
    \ by these devices may contain some\nnoise. This sensor data may be also corrupted\
    \ by the signals antiques like missing value and noise issues, which\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ reduce phase performance. Before using data for any future analysis, this issue\
    \ needs to be addressed.\nDifﬁcult to monitoring user’s social networking data:\
    \ – It is difﬁcult to monitor users’ data on social network-\ning sites. In smart\
    \ healthcare, doctors can’t rely on data from social media. But still, a system\
    \ for detecting the\npsychological disturbance in patients is presented named\
    \ emotional healthcare. Some techniques used to detect de-\npressive and stressful\
    \ content are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN),\
    \ and\nBi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Also proposed recommendation\
    \ systems for patients to get a\ntext-based on the results while they had been\
    \ monitored.\nLack of efﬁcient computational models and data structures: – The\
    \ expansion of massive data has generated\nlarge and complicated data sets. Traditional\
    \ methods used for storage and retrieval of data, increase the computation\noverhead\
    \ in big processing and hence are unable to meet the requirements of the users.\
    \ For big data handling some\nadvanced data, models are required which produce\
    \ results in minimum time with minimum computation overhead.\nOne of the basic\
    \ problems of massive data is to style efﬁcient computational models and data\
    \ structures for solving\nthese problems in big data.\nThe need for energy-efﬁcient\
    \ data processing: – The rise of uses of IoT devices concept paved the way for\
    \ a\nsmart city. Energy management has become a major issue resource as IoT devices\
    \ are constantly consuming huge\namounts of energy. These concerns must be considered\
    \ in order to establish an effective mechanism. The efﬁcient use\n272\nM. Kumar\
    \ and A. Singh / Probabilistic data structures in smart city\nof power aims to\
    \ promise a sustainable city. In addition, IoT devices produce a larger amount\
    \ of data which is needed\nfor optimal processing. Enforcing another challenge\
    \ in securing smart cities is the sharing of data and access control.\nData storage\
    \ and processing: – Smart Cities take hold of the relative advantage of being\
    \ robust for storing\ndata and processing it in the information world. The applications\
    \ of smart cities have generated a continuous huge\namount of data from different\
    \ sources. The existing traditional methods are insufﬁcient to manage this volume\n\
    of data and they have restricted processing speed and effective storage expansion\
    \ costs. To overcome this issue,\nefﬁcient computational models and data structures\
    \ are required.\nVolume data: – Although it is difﬁcult to quantify this challenge\
    \ because data sets are typically very big like hun-\ndreds of terabytes or more.\
    \ The traditional storage system like Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)\n\
    and new big data technologies like Hadoop are developed to efﬁciently count the\
    \ data that must be kept and pro-\ncessed. The new data structures are also required\
    \ to handle and produce results at run time.\nReal time response: – The Response\
    \ Time (RT) in the smart city is very important in term of service, results, data\n\
    transmission etc. The RT directs to the fact that the data transmission and business\
    \ data infrastructure at elevated cost\nand should be considered with fewer delays.\
    \ In this case, various techniques have been used which are depending\non the\
    \ situation and difﬁculty of analysis. In smart cities where responses need to\
    \ be given after processing huge\ndata or by handling streaming data, then traditional\
    \ techniques and approaches are not efﬁcient. So some new data\nhandling techniques/data\
    \ structures are required to provide results in real-time.\nVariety of Data: –\
    \ In the smart city the source of a variety of data is also a major issue. The\
    \ smart city data\nis available in different data sets for different applications\
    \ of smart city and with different format styles like audio,\nvideo, images, text\
    \ etc. The data collected from a variety of sources are ambiguous, unstructured,\
    \ or semi-structured.\nThis data needs to be in a well-structured manner for effective\
    \ and efﬁcient results. The traditional methods are not\nsufﬁcient or even do\
    \ not provide accurate results in the real-time scenarios. For this data management,\
    \ a new data\nstructure like PDS is required.\nSearching and Retrieving for a\
    \ data item from the big data: – In huge data, the task of efﬁciently searching\n\
    and retrieving appropriate data for review in the petabyte and exabyte ranges,\
    \ in a variety of formats, is a major\nchallenge. In some applications when deadlines\
    \ are associated, this challenge becomes more tedious.\nStream Processing(Data\
    \ Collection and Distribution Analysis): – The streaming of big data in smart\
    \ cities is a\nbig challenge. There is a huge amount of data is ﬂow in the smart\
    \ city. The processing and analysis of this set of\ndata are required. When raw\
    \ data is combined like vehicle and road, geolocation sensor and social media,\
    \ weather\ndata, then the streaming of data may cause some issues like a too long\
    \ time in result, access problem etc. Also\nsome problems in development like\
    \ it is still dependent. Various decisions and predictions are based on this type\
    \ of\ndata like trafﬁc, future power consumption, etc. Some traditional systems\
    \ are proposed but with various limitations.\nA new mechanism is required to design\
    \ for efﬁcient and effective results.\nIntegration of Heterogeneous Data Sources\
    \ (Diversity Consolidation): – The data coming from different sources\nis not\
    \ in proper sequence, maybe in a different format, or ambiguous. The operation\
    \ on these data sets is difﬁcult to\napply like validation, authentication, updating,\
    \ alteration etc. This data is need to be well structured and organized.\nNatural\
    \ Text Analysis and Communication(social media analysis): – The analysis of natural\
    \ text from social\nnetworks is available through mobile devices like smartphones\
    \ is also challenging. This data is used for monitoring\nthe behavior and emotions\
    \ of citizens in real life. The information on location from various social networking\
    \ sites is\nnot in a proper format. The data include the comments and statements\
    \ about the user’s feelings, thoughts, interests,\nrelations etc. are integrated\
    \ with sensor data. The reliability of this data is also a big challenge.\nAmbient\
    \ Intelligence issues/challenges (speciﬁc to the current generation of smart city\
    \ domains): – The ex-\npeditious growth of conversion from rural to urban areas\
    \ and urban to smart cities is increasing rapidly. It also\nincreases the usage\
    \ and deployment of smart technologies in everything and everywhere in the city.\
    \ So, smart cities\nmay also face some ambient intelligence issues. The main concern\
    \ in smart cities is AI, and privacy when combine\nwith automation and autonomous\
    \ system [257]. This may also create some design trade-offs like:\nHuman control\
    \ vs. automation: Fail to recognize the speed limit sign or fooled by scam stickers\
    \ on road by\nautonomous driving [86]. Autonomous car driving (Uber) had met a\
    \ deadly accident with a woman walking at night\n[185]. Hard Behavior is also\
    \ one of the problems in autonomous systems. An example of this is conversations\
    \ of\ncustomers with fully automated call centers, and online shopping without\
    \ the involvement of humans. In AI-based\nbehavior, there are missing traceability,\
    \ transparency, and incomprehensible decisions.\nM. Kumar and A. Singh / Probabilistic\
    \ data structures in smart city\n273\nPrivacy vs. smartness: There is also a trade-off\
    \ between privacy and intelligence. To provide smartness, the data\nshould be\
    \ provided to smart services. For this, blockchain is used, which is also cost-effective.\n\
    Infrastructure: To improve the standard of citizens, sensor technology is used\
    \ for analyzing and gathering in-\nformation. These sensors generally collect\
    \ the data like air quality, crime rates, rush hour stats, etc. To install these\n\
    types of sensors a complicated and costly infrastructure is involved [224].\n\
    Hackers vs Security: The threat level to security has also increased, as the uses\
    \ of sensors and IoT technology\nhave expanded.\nBeing Socially Inclusive: The\
    \ programs like ‘smart transit’ which is a great idea for the bustling city for\
    \ real-time\nupdates. This may also raise some issues like: some people in smart\
    \ cities can’t afford to take transit, all elderly\ngrowing people do use smart\
    \ mobile devices or apps, and how it is possible to use and reach technology to\
    \ these\ngroups of people?\n11. Discussion and conclusion\nIn this paper, we have\
    \ discussed the role of big data in Section 1.1, where we emphasize the importance\
    \ of big\ndata in smart cities. In Section 2 the generations of smart cities have\
    \ been discussed. There are various architectures\nthat have been discussed by\
    \ many researchers, but the most appropriate architecture for the smart city is\
    \ elaborated\nin Section 4. Los Angeles took the ﬁrst action or made the ﬁrst\
    \ contribution to smart city projects in 1974. They\nanalyze the urban big data.\
    \ In Section 5 listed various projects to date and also future plans regarding\
    \ smart cities.\nThe role of big data in smart cities is crucial in a smart city.\
    \ Probabilistic Data Structures (PDS) have been discussed\n(Section 6) as a key\
    \ solution to many applications of smart cities. This paper also emphasizes the\
    \ various applications\nof smart cities, such as smart healthcare, smart transportation,\
    \ smart environment, agriculture, smart governance\nand economy, smart society,\
    \ people, education, and smart sustainability (Section 7). It has been found,\
    \ after going\nthrough various proposed techniques in the area of smart cities;\
    \ that there is an inﬂuence of big data in a smart\ncity. Generated data is inconsistent,\
    \ semi-structured, or unstructured, lack of efﬁciency in retrieval and storage\n\
    management of data, privacy, and security has major concerns. In the smart city,\
    \ the collection of data itself is a big\nchallenge. The data collected using\
    \ IoT devices, records (medical history), social media, and web pages are too\
    \ large.\nObviously, this data is redundant and unstructured. Various monitoring\
    \ systems in smart cities also have issues in the\nanalysis and representation\
    \ of this big data with low dimensions. Many researchers have put their sincere\
    \ endeavors\ninto extracting information from a huge amount of knowledge databases.\
    \ The main challenge in this effort is that\nthere is no standard approach to\
    \ efﬁciently map and keep the big data on consistent data structures. The existing\n\
    tool and techniques cannot work efﬁciently and satisfactorily in data management.\
    \ To store and processing of data\nfor optimal recovery and exploring procedures,\
    \ data structures like PDS is one of the adequate standards to use. In\nthe conclusion\

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    Keywords: crop management; sustainable agriculture; smart farming; internet-of-things

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    12 of 26

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    Figure 6. An Internet-of-Things-based network for smart farming.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

    Abstract The need for accurate estimates of reference crop evapotranspiration
    (ETo) is important in irrigation planning and design, irrigation scheduling, reservoir
    management among other applications. ETo can be accurately determined using the
    internationally accepted FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation. However, this
    requires numerous observed data, including solar radiation, air temperature, relative
    humidity, and wind speed, which in most cases are unavailable, particularly in
    developing countries such as the Philippines. This study developed models based
    on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for the
    estimation of daily ETo using different input combinations of meteorological data
    in Region IV-A, Philippines. The performance of machine learning models was compared
    with the different established alternative empirical models for ETo. The results
    show that the SVM and ELM models, with at least Tmax, Tmin, and Rs as inputs,
    provide the best daily ETo estimates. The accuracy of machine learning models
    was also found to be superior compared to the empirical models given with same
    input requirements. In general, SVM and ELM models showed similar modeling performance,
    although the former showed lower run time than the latter. Keywords: reference
    crop evapotranspiration; machine learning; ELM; SVM 1. Introduction The simultaneous
    occurrence of, and the difficulty of separately measuring, evaporation and transpirations
    gives rise to the concept of evapotranspiration [1]. Both evaporation and transpiration
    are influenced by factors such as weather parameters, crop characteristics, management,
    and environmental factors. Due to the complexity of the concept, distinctions
    are made among reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo), crop evapotranspiration
    under standard conditions (ETc) and crop evapotranspiration under non-standard
    conditions (ETc-adj). The reference crop evapotranspiration, ETo, which is the
    focus of this study, refers to the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface,
    defined as a hypothetical grass reference crop with a height of 0.12 m, a fixed
    surface resistance of 70 s/m, and an albedo of 0.23, which is actively growing,
    well-watered, and completely shades the ground [1]. The concept of ETo was introduced
    to study the evaporative demand of the atmosphere independently of crop type,
    crop development, and management practices. ETo is one of the most important agrometeorological
    inputs in the estimation of the irrigation water requirements needed for irrigation
    system planning, design, and operation [2,3,4]. Based on the Philippine Agricultural
    Engineering Standards [3] on the Determination of Irrigation Water Requirements,
    the calculation of ETo is a preliminary step in estimating the crop water requirements
    for the development of climate- and site-specific cropping calendars. Knowledge
    of ETo is also needed in the development of hydrologic models for streamflow estimation
    and flood inundation [5,6,7], reservoir design and operation [8,9], climate change
    studies [10,11,12], and drought severity analyses [13,14]. Hence, the importance
    of accurate methods for estimating ETo can never be overemphasized. In general,
    ETo can be directly measured using the simple water balance derived from equipment
    such as a lysimeter. However, this method is extensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming
    for practical applications [15]. In most cases, ETo is determined using the internationally
    accepted FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-56 PM) equation [1]. Since FAO-56 PM requires
    numerous items of measured meteorological data that are mostly unavailable in
    developing countries such as the Philippines, empirical equations with reduced
    data requirements are usually utilized [16]. These equations are usually based
    on individual or combinations of available meteorological data, such as the temperature-based
    Hargreaves–Samani [17] equation, the temperature–radiation-based Makkink [18]
    and Priestley–Taylor [19] equations, the temperature–radiation and wind speed-based
    Matt–Shuttleworth [20] equation, and the temperature–radiation and relative humidity-based
    Turc [21] equation. Although these empirical models are simple in terms of data
    inputs and computational procedures, their usage is observed to be site-specific,
    or variable according to the climatic conditions of the places where they are
    developed, and in some cases, they provide unsatisfactory results [22,23,24].
    Furthermore, these simplified empirical models are mostly suited to estimating
    ETo on a weekly or monthly basis, but are less suitable for daily ETo estimation
    [25]. Advances in computation have led to the introduction of machine learning
    algorithms in accurate daily ETo estimation. The term machine learning was coined
    and first defined in a study on the International Business Machines (IBM) corporation
    as a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
    programmed [26]. The popularity of machine learning in recent years can be attributed
    to the incorporation of probability and statistics into the algorithm that deals
    with traditional fixed rule-based models, which require manual input [27]. Machine
    learning models, in general, are black boxes in nature, but several studies conducted
    have shown their consistent reliability and accuracy in ETo estimation applications
    compared to other established empirical models [15,22,23,28,29,30]. Among these
    machine learning models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning
    Machine (ELM) have generally exhibited better prediction accuracy in ETo estimations
    in various studies worldwide, such as in India [31], China [32,33], and Spain
    [34]. The performance of machine learning models relies on the proper estimation
    of hyperparameters [35], and cross-validations and resampling, along with grid
    search, are good ways to simultaneously optimize these hyperparameters [36,37].
    The application of grid searches in machine learning model development for Eto
    estimation can be observed in the works of Bellido-Jiménez et al. [34], Seifi
    and Riahi [24], Patil and Deka [38], and Wen et al. [39]. Data-driven agricultural
    techniques, known collectively as precision agriculture, offer a potential way
    to increase global food production because of their more efficient and contextually
    appropriate agriculture management actions [40,41,42]. The recent expansion of
    data-driven farming is due to advances in three key areas: (1) data generation
    from sources such as field sensors and satellites, (2) data processing and predictive
    analytics using big data stacks, machine learning and deep learning models, and
    (3) human–computer interactions that create and improve the usability of insights
    and models [43]. Data-driven agricultural technologies mostly require the monitoring
    of accurate meteorological variables such as ETo [44]. For the past few decades,
    there has been an emerging trend of using machine learning models for the estimation
    of important variables, especially in areas where these data are insufficient,
    unavailable, or inaccessible [45]. To date, no study exists in the published peer-reviewed
    literature that explores the application of SVM and ELM models in the estimation
    of daily ETo under the conditions of the Philippines. The general objective of
    this study is to estimate daily ETo using SVM and ELM, with different input combinations
    of meteorological data collected at weather stations in Region IV-A, Philippines.
    Specifically, this study seeks to compare the accuracy of daily ETo estimation
    in the region (1) across the studied empirical models, (2) across machine learning
    models, i.e., across input combinations and between SVM and ELM, and (3) between
    the empirical models and machine learning models. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.
    Study Area Figure 1 shows the weather stations in Region IV-A, a region in the
    Philippines considered in this study. Twenty years of observed daily data on precipitation
    (P, mm), air temperature (Tmax and Tmin, °C), dew point temperature (Tdew, °C),
    relative humidity (RH, %) and wind speed (Uz, m/s) were acquired from seven DOST-PAGASA
    weather stations in Region IV-A through the agency’s online data acquisition platform
    ClimaDatPh. The requested data underwent a series of reliable quality control
    procedures and subsequent archiving, as described in the paper of Villafuerte
    et al. [46]. Based on the Modified Corona Climate Classification of the Philippines,
    the region can be divided into three zones: Type I, with a pronounced dry season
    from November to April, and wet during the rest of the year, which includes the
    stations in UPLB, Sangley Point, and Ambulong; Type III, with a relatively dry
    season from November to April, and wet during the rest of the year, which includes
    the station in Tanay; and lastly, Type IV is characterized with more or less even
    rainfall throughout the year, and it includes the stations in Infanta, Tayabas
    and Alabat. Table 1 shows the mean annual values of meteorological data per station.
    Figure 1. DOST-PAGASA weather stations considered in this study. Table 1. Temporal
    coverage of records and annual mean values of meteorological data of seven stations
    in Region IV-A. Solar climatic variables in the region are scarce. Out of seven
    DOST-PAGASA stations in the region, only the UPLB station has available ground-based
    solar radiation data (Rs, MJ/m2/day), with temporal records from 1977 to 2011
    (35 years). For this reason, daily Rs data from the Goddard Earth Observing System
    (GEOS) reanalysis datasets that can be accessed through the National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (NASA POWER)
    website were used, given their relative consistency with the Rs ground observations
    in the region [47]. Numerous publications have also proven the consistency of
    NASA-POWER Rs values with the ground observations in many areas around the world
    [48,49,50,51]. The datasets of each station were partitioned into two categories:
    (1) model development set for the development of machine learning models, and
    (2) model evaluation set for out-sampled validation of the calibrated and developed
    models. A continuous 15 years daily record (n~5475) was used as the model development
    set, and a 5 years daily record (n~1825) as the model evaluation set (Table 1).
    2.2. Empirical Models for ETo Estimation The daily ETo (mm/day), estimated using
    FAO-56 PM (Equation (1)), was used as the standard and reference value for the
    development and evaluation of the studied models. ET o = 0.408 Δ ( 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+𝛾 900

    The detailed procedures and the theory for calculation are discussed in the FAO

    data inputs, as shown in Table 2, were also employed to compute ETo per station.
    Detailed descriptions of each of these empirical models can be found in the paper
    of Guo et al. [52]. Table 2. Empirical equations for reference evapotranspiration

    and grid search (Pilario et al., 2020). 2.3.1. Support Vector Machine The SVM
    algorithm developed by Vapnik [53] is a supervised machine learning model for
    pattern recognition and data analysis, and it has been widely employed for regression
    and forecasting in the fields of agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and environmental
    studies. The SVM model estimates the regression based on a series of kernel functions,
    which can convert the original, lower-dimensional input data to a higher dimensional
    feature space implicitly [22,23]. SVM works by transforming the input vector into
    a feature space and maps the relationship with the output vector. In general,
    the SVM can be expressed mathematically as: Y=wφ(X)+b (2) in which Y is the output
    vector, w is the weight vector, φ is the kernel function, X is the input vector,
    and b is the bias term. The weight factor w and bias term b are estimated by minimizing
    the loss function as: 0.5  ∥𝑤∥ 2 +𝐶 1 2 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝐿 𝜖 ( 𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 , 𝑦 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 )  (3)
    𝐿 𝜖 ( 𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 , 𝑦 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 )=𝑓(𝑥)={ 0, | 𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 − 𝑦 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 |−𝜀,   𝑖𝑓 |
    𝑦 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑 − 𝑦 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 |<𝜀   𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 (4) where the term 0.5  ∥𝑤∥ 2 is the regularization
    term, C is the penalty parameter, 𝐿 𝜖 is the 𝜀 -insensitive error function, and
    𝜀 is the margin of SVM. The transformation of the input vector is dictated by
    the kernel function, which adds an extra dimension to the SVM algorithm such that
    a linear hyperplane can separate the classes into new and higher-dimensional space
    [54]. There are different kernel functions that can be applied for the transformation
    of data suitable for finding linear decision boundaries for different non-linearly
    separable data sets. The commonly used Radial Basis Function (RBF) non-linear
    kernel function was used in this study due to its better performance in ETo and
    estimations compared with other kernel functions [22,29], which is expressed as:
    𝐾 ( 𝑥 𝑛 ,  𝑥 𝑖 )=𝑒𝑥𝑝 (−𝛾 ∥ 𝑥 𝑛 − 𝑥 𝑖 ∥ 2 +𝐶) (5) where x n   and   x i are the
    nth and ith terms of the input vector, while γ and C are the hyperparameters in
    the SVM- RDF model. In this study, the hyperparameters C and γ were optimized
    simultaneously using a grid search method with C ranging from 0.1 to 100 and ε
    ranging from 0.001 to 10, while a default value of 0.1 was used for the parameter
    ε. The grid search eliminates the trial-and-error method in tuning hyperparameters
    and has been proven to significantly improve the model’s accuracy [36,55]. 2.3.2.
    Extreme Learning Machine The ELM model proposed by Huang et al. [56] is an extended
    single hidden layer feedforward (FF) neural network wherein the weights and biases
    of the hidden layer are randomly generated without the need for tuning iteratively,
    while the output parameters are analytically calculated. ELM has a more favorable
    general capability with faster learning speed; it does not require too much human
    intervention and can run much faster than the conventional algorithms. ELM is
    an efficient algorithm with numerous advantages such as ease of use, quick learning
    speed, higher performance, and suitability for many nonlinear activation and kernel
    functions [29,57,58]. The basic theory of ELM can be given as follows: For M arbitrary
    distinct inputs (xi, yi) with ∈ ℝ and ∈ ℝ , a standard single layer FF with N
    hidden nodes and the activation function f can be modeled as the following sum:
    ∑ i = 1 N β i   f   ( w i x j + b i ) ,     j ∈ { 1 ,   2 ,   3 , … ,   M } (6)
    where wi is the input weights to the ith neuron in the hidden layer, bi are the
    biases, and β i is the output weights. In a case wherein a single-layer FF perfectly
    approximates the data, the relation is ∑ i = 1 N β i   f   ( w i x j + b i ) =
    y j ,     j ∈ { 1 ,   2 ,   3 , … ,   M } (7) which can more efficiently be written
    as H β i = Y (8) where H = ( f   ( w 1 x 1 + b 1 ) ⋯ f   ( w n x 1 + b N ) ⋮ ⋱
    ⋮ f   ( w 1 x M + b 1 ) ⋯ f   ( w N x M + b N ) ) (9) β = ( β 1 …   β N ) T (10)
    Y = ( y 1 …   y M ) T (11) The hidden layer output matrix H can be computed using
    the randomly generated first layer of the ELM and the training inputs, while the
    output weight β can be solved by finding the least square solution to the linear
    system defined in the hidden layer output matrix H. This solution is given by
    β = H f Y , where H f is the Moore–Penrose generalized inverse of the matrix H.
    The comprehensive derivation and description of the ELM algorithm can be found
    in the original paper of Huang et al. [56]. The kind of activation function (sigmoid,
    linear, or tansig) and the number of neurons in the hidden layer (ranging from
    5 to 200 with an interval equal to 5) are the hyperparameters that were simultaneously
    tuned when using the grid search method. 2.3.3. Machine Learning Model Development
    As shown in Table 3, eight different input combinations were considered to evaluate
    the effects of different meteorological variables on the estimation of daily ETo
    using machine learning models. Eight combinations of different input variables
    were considered for the SVM and ELM models. Model 1 has the same input combinations
    as the FAO-56 PM, namely, Tmax, Tmin, RH, Rs and Uz. Model 2 has the same input
    combination as Model 1, except that it uses extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra,
    MJ/m2-day) instead of Rs. Model 3 does not have any solar radiation variable,
    and uses only Tmax, Tmin, RH and Uz. The input variables considered in Models
    4, 5, and 6 are set to be analogous with the inputs of the TSR-, TSW-, and TS-based
    empirical equations, respectively. Model 7 only considers Tmax, Tmin, and RH.
    Finally, Model 8 only handles air temperature data, comparably with the T-based
    Hargreaves–Samani equation. Table 3. The input combinations of meteorological
    variables used for the development of the SVM and ELM models for ETo estimation.
    In developing both SVM and ELM models, the model development set was further divided
    into a training subset and a validation subset for tuning the hyperparameters
    using a growing window-forward cross validation (gwFV) scheme. The gwFV is the
    recommended cross-validation scheme for machine learning models using time series
    data to preserve the temporal dependencies of the data, and provides almost unbiased
    estimates of the true error [59,60,61]. Four-folds gwFW were used for cross-validating
    the ETo model, a fixed window of 3 years (n~1095). Before putting the input and
    output variables into the machine learning models, raw meteorological data were
    standardized to avoid convergence problems using the equation: X n = X i − μ σ
    (12) where Xn is the standardized value, Xi is the measured value, μ is the mean,
    and σ is the standard deviation. To reflect the real use of the models, the mean
    (μ) and standard deviation (σ) were computed using only the data of the model
    development set. 2.4. Evaluation of Model Performance 2.4.1. Model’s Accuracy
    The accuracy and performance of both the empirical and machine learning models
    for ETo estimation were evaluated and compared using the statistical indicators
    shown in Table 4. To compare or rank the studied model considering all statistical
    indicators, the Global Performance Index (GPI) was computed: G P I i = ∑ j = 1
    j α j ( y ˜ j − y i j ) (13) where y ˜ j is the median of the scaled values of
    indicator j, y i j is the scaled value of indicator j for model I, and α j equals
    −1 for indicators R2, d and NSE, and equals 1 for the other indicator. Table 4.
    Statistical indicators used for the performance evaluation of machine learning
    and empirical models. The concept of GPI indicates that if the scaled value of
    the indicator is far lower than the median of the scaled values, the model is
    the most accurate compared to other models, while if the scaled value of indicator
    is far higher than the median, the model is less accurate compared to the other
    models [62]. A higher value of GPI results in a higher accuracy of the model.
    2.4.2. Machine Learning Model’s Run Time The run time or the time used for the
    computation of the machine learning models across models and between SVM and ELM
    were also compared in this study using a single sample with 4-fold gwFV cross-validation.
    3. Results and Discussions Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table
    10 and Table 11 show the results of statistical indicators for all studied models
    given by the stations at UPLB, Sangley Point, Infanta, Alabat, Tayabas, Ambulong,
    and Tanay. Additionally, the computed GPI values per model and stations are presented

    learning models used for the estimation of daily ETo. 3.1. Comparison across Empirical
    Models Based on the different statistical indicators and the ranking of the computed
    GPI, the TSR-based Turc equation performs the best among the studied empirical
    models in the estimation of daily ETo for all stations, except in Tanay, where
    it ranked second after the Makkink equation. On average, the estimated daily ETo
    of the Turc equation is only 6.0 to 15.2% divergent from the standard FAO-56 PM
    daily ETo. This fits with an R2 of 0.93–0.97, an RMSE of 0.28–0.46 mm/day, an
    RRMSE of 7.5–15.1%, an MAE of 0.22–0.42 mm/day, and an NSE of 0.79–0.94. The Turc
    equation is best used in places where there are no wind speed data available.
    It is considered as one of the most accurate empirical models used to estimate
    ETo under humid conditions [29]. Nevertheless, the T-based Hargreaves equation
    gives the lowest accuracy across stations, with estimates that are 26.9–48.7%
    divergent from the standard FAO-56 PM ETo, with an R2 of 0.19–0.35, an RMSE of
    1.02–1.25 mm/day, an RRMSE of 25.3–40.0%, an MAE of 0.77–0.098 mm/day, and an
    NSE of −0.46–0.27. The ranking of the investigated empirical models according
    to GPI is the same for the UPLB, Infanta, Alabat and Tayabas stations, i.e., Turc
    > Matt–Shuttleworth > Makkink > Priestley–Taylor > Hargreaves–Samani. The ranking
    shows that incorporating relative humidity (TSR-based) and wind speed (TSW-based),
    along with solar radiation and air temperature, could improve the estimates of
    empirical models. 3.2. Comparison across Machine Learning Models 3.2.1. Comparison
    of Models across Input Combinations Overall, models with Rs data as the input
    variable, such as Models 1, 4, 5, and 6, performed best both in SVM and ELM, with
    excellent results based on their values of RRMSE and NSE. Rs data represent the
    solar resources in a specific location available to vaporize water, which is considered
    an important factor, together with air temperature, for the occurrence of ETo
    [1]. In particular, the estimates of Model 1 perfectly fitted the actual value
    of FAO-56 PM, with the R2 ranging from 0.95 to 0.99, an RMSE of 0.07 to 0.22 mm/day,
    an RRMSE of 1.72 to 5.44%, an MAE of 0.04 to 0.13 mm/day, and an NSE of 0.95 to
    0.99. On average, the estimates of Model 1 are only 1.4 to 4.0% divergent from
    the standard FAO-56 PM daily ETo. On the other hand, Model 2, which has the same
    input combination as Model 1, except that it has Ra instead of Rs, performed satisfactorily,
    with an R2 of 0.62–0.82, RMSE of 0.45 to 0.77 mm/day, RRMSE of 12.82 to 20.03%,
    MAE of 0.35 to 0.62 mm/day, and NSE of 0.51 to 0.82. The estimates of Model 2
    are 12.61 to 19.83% on average divergent from the standard FAO-56 PM daily ETo.
    This shows the importance of Rs in the estimation of ETo, which cannot be replaced
    with extraterrestrial solar radiation Ra, even with the presence of both RH and
    Uz data. TSR-based Model 4 and TSW-based Model 5 show relatively comparable performances
    based on the average statistical indicators. On average, the estimated daily ETos
    of Model 4 and Model 5 are only 2.4 to 8.1% and 3.4 to 7.6% divergent from the
    standard FAO-56 PM daily ETo, respectively. Model 4 fitted with R2 ranging from
    0.89 to 0.99, an RMSE of 0.10 to 0.33 mm/day, an RRMSE of 2.9 to 8.5%, an MAE
    of 0.07 to 0.22 mm/day, and an NSE of 0.91 to 0.99, while Model 5 fitted with
    R2 ranges 0.92 to 0.98, an RMSE of 0.12 to 0.29 mm/day, an RRMSE of 3.2 to 6.8%,
    an MAE of 0.09 to 0.18 mm/day, and an NSE of 0.95 to 0.98. When compared to Model
    1, Models 4 and 5 RMSE decreased by 44.4%, or 0.06 mm/day, and MAE decreased by
    38.9% or 0.04 mm/day. Nevertheless, considering the GPI ranking, Model 5 performed
    better than Model 4 at the UPLB, Alabat, and Ambulong stations, while the opposite
    was observed for the other stations. 3.2.2. Comparison of Models between SVM and
    ELM Based on the computed statistical indicators, the SVM developed using the
    RBF kernel and the ELM model generally exhibited identical performances in estimating
    daily ETo for all stations and all input combinations, during both the model development
    and evaluation phases, with average differences in RMSE of 0.002 mm/day and in
    MAE of 0.003 mm/day. In terms of GPI ranking, ELM performed better than SVM for
    most stations and model inputs, especially in the model evaluation phase. This
    observation shows that during the model evaluation phase, the ELM model tends
    to overfit the data, as evidenced by the almost negligible values of ME. Table
    13 presents the average run time, or the time used for the computation, of the
    SVM and ELM models for ETo estimation. The time needed for running the SVM models
    ranged from 79.21 to 223.62 s, while the ELM models displayed a lower range, from
    83.99 to 98.94 s. For the SVM models, it can be observed that the models with
    higher accuracy, such as Models 1, 4, 5, and 6, have a relatively faster run time
    compared to the other models. This can be attributed to the lower time spent in
    the optimization of hyperparameters through grid searching. Overall, running an
    ELM model for ETo estimation is almost two times faster than running SVM models.
    Given that SVM and ELM models can achieve identical accuracy in ETo estimation
    in the region, ELM is preferred when run time is considered. Table 13. Average
    run time (in seconds) of SVM and ELM under different input combinations in the
    estimation of daily ETo. 3.3. Comparison between Empirical and Machine Learning
    Models In general, the accuracy of SVM and ELM models in estimating daily ETo
    is much better compared to empirical models. This is apparent from the ranking
    of the computed GPIs of all studied models across stations in Table 12. When comparing
    models with inputs of only air temperature, we see that Model 8 of the machine
    learning model achieves better performance than the Hargreaves–Samani equation,
    with an average increase in R2 of 44.4%, RMSE of 33.5% or 0.37 mm/day, and MAE
    of 30.7% or 0.26 mm/day. Based on the values of both RRMSE and NSE, the Hargreaves–Samani
    equation has a poor modeling capability, while Model 8 is concluded to be acceptable.
    On the average, estimates of Model 8 are 16.4 to 24.5% divergent from the actual
    values, which is relatively better than the 26.9 to 39.1% of the Hargreaves–Samani
    equation. Empirical models with Rs as one of the inputs (TSR-, TSW-, and TS-based)
    proved to have an acceptable to satisfactory modeling capability, based on the
    computed average RRMSE and NSE across stations. With the same input combinations,
    machine learning models provided an improved performance with excellent results
    (RRMSE < 10% and NSE > 0.8). Compared to the best TS-based model, Model 6 of the
    machine learning models improved the RMSE by 62% or 0.41 mm/day, and MAE by 71.0%
    or 0.42 mm/day. The estimates of Model 6 deviate by 3.5 to 8.0% on average from
    the actual values, which is relatively better than the 9.85 to 24.4% of TS-based
    models. On the other hand, Model 5, when compared to its analogous TSW-based Matt–Shuttleworth
    equation, achieves an average increase in accuracy of 76.5% or 0.46 mm/day in
    terms of RRMSE, and 75.2% or 0.39 mm/day in terms of MAE. The estimates of Model
    5 are on average deviant from the actual value by 3.4 to 7.6%, which is better
    than the Matt–Shuttleworth equation, which is off by 7.4 to 23.7%. Lastly, when
    Model 4 of both SVM and ELM models is compared to the TSR-based Turc equation
    which is the best performing empirical model for this study, a significant improvement
    can still be observed, as there is an average increase in RRMSE of 57.5% or 0.2
    mm/day, and in MAE of 58.2% or 0.17 mm/day. The estimates of Model 4 are off by
    only 2.4 to 8.2%, while the Turc estimate is off by 7.1 to 12.5%. The results
    show the ability of machine learning models to handle complex nonlinear relationships
    between independent variables and dependent variables when estimating daily ETo
    [23,32]. 3.4. Comparison of the Average Monthly ETo: The Case of UPLB and Tanay
    Stations The plots of the monthly average values, computed via the simulated daily
    ETo for all empirical and machine learning models, are shown in Figure 3 and Figure
    4 for the UPLB and Tanay stations, respectively. Among the studied empirical models,
    the average monthly daily estimates of the Turc equation excellently resemble
    the FAO-56 PM for the UPLB station (RMSE of 0.129 MJ/m2/day and NSE of 0.969).
    In the case of the Tanay station, the Makkink equation performed best (RMSE of
    0.216 MJ/m2/day and NSE of 0.869). For both stations, the average monthly daily
    ETo computed via the Matt–Shuttleworth equation tended to be below the FAO-56
    PM ETo, while the Priestley–Taylor equation overshot it. The T-based Hargreaves
    equation tended to overestimate the FAO-56 PM monthly and daily average ETo for
    the Tanay station throughout the whole year, but it only did so during the rainy
    seasons (JJA and SON) at the UPLB stations. Figure 3. Plots of monthly average
    daily ETo at the UPLB station estimated from (a) empirical equations, and calibrated
    machine learning models of (b) Support Vector Machine and (c) Extreme Learning
    Machine. Figure 4. Plots of monthly average daily ETo at the Tanay station, estimated
    from (a) Empirical equations, and calibrated machine learning models of (b) Support
    Vector Machine and (c) Extreme Learning Machine. The average monthly ETo based
    on daily values computed via the SVM and ELM models, with any input combinations,
    proved to have a relatively high level of accuracy with NSE >0.8, which showed
    a closely reflected behavior of the monthly values based on FAO56-PM daily ETo.
    This proves that even with minimum inputs of air temperature data (Model 8), machine
    learning models can reliably and satisfactorily estimate ETo on a daily, monthly,
    and seasonal basis. The daily record of ETo is important in irrigation scheduling
    and hydrologic modeling, while monthly or seasonal estimates are necessary baseline
    data for irrigation system and reservoir designs, as well as water right determination
    [3]. 4. Conclusions Reliable data are key to forming good hydrological models
    and engineering designs. In particular, accurate estimates of ETo are important
    in irrigation planning and design, irrigation scheduling, reservoir management
    among other applications. This study developed models based on SVM with an RBF
    non-linear kernel function, and on ELM, for estimating daily reference crop evapotranspiration
    in Region IV-A, Philippines, using limited meteorological input data. The machine
    learning models developed were compared with five other established empirical
    models in terms of accuracy in daily ETo estimation. The results show that the
    calibrated SVM and ELM models, with at least Tmax, Tmin and Rs as inputs, provide
    the best daily ETo estimates. When compared to empirical models with analogous
    data inputs, the ELM and SVM models achieved higher accuracies, with RMSE values
    of at least 0.2 mm/day, and MAE values of 0.17 mm/day. Overall, the ELM and SVM
    models achieved similar modeling performances, although the former exhibited shorter
    run times than the latter. These machine learning models, with proper simulations
    and optimization, could achieve excellent performance in terms of accuracy. Author

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Maize production in Thailand is increasingly suffering
    from drought periods along the cropping season. This creates the need for rapid
    and accurate methods to detect crop water stress to prevent yield loss. The study
    was, therefore, conducted to improve the efficacy of thermal imaging for assessing
    maize water stress and yield prediction. The experiment was carried out under
    controlled and field conditions in Phitsanulok, Thailand. Five treatments were
    applied, including (T1) fully irrigated treatment with 100% of crop water requirement
    (CWR) as control; (T2) early stress with 50% of CWR from 20 days after sowing
    (DAS) until anthesis and subsequent rewatering; (T3) sustained deficit at 50%
    of CWR from 20 DAS until harvest; (T4) late stress with 100% of CWR until anthesis
    and 50% of CWR after anthesis until harvest; (T5) late stress with 100% of CWR
    until anthesis and no irrigation after anthesis. Canopy temperature (FLIR), crop
    growth and soil moisture were measured at 5-day-intervals. Under controlled conditions,
    early water stress significantly reduced maize growth and yield. Water deficit
    after anthesis had no significant effect. A new combination of wet/dry sponge
    type reference surfaces was used for the determination of the Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI). There was a strong relationship between CWSI and stomatal conductance
    (R² = 0.90), with a CWSI of 0.35 being correlated to a 64%-yield loss. Assessing
    CWSI at 55 DAS, that is, at tasseling, under greenhouse conditions corresponded
    best to the final maize yield. This linear regression model validated well in
    both maize lowland (R² = 0.94) and maize upland fields (R² = 0.97) under the prevailing
    variety, soil and climate conditions. The results demonstrate that, using improved
    standardized references and data acquisition protocols, thermal imaging CWSI monitoring
    according to critical phenological stages enables yield prediction under drought
    stress. 1 INTRODUCTION Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important cereal
    grains worldwide in both temperate and tropical regions. In Thailand, it is mostly
    grown on marginal sites in both upland and lowland areas of rainfed cropping systems.
    The impact of recent climate change, triggering more erratic rainfall and longer
    drought periods, has substantially affected maize production in Thailand causing
    disproportionally high yield declines (Hirich et al., 2016; Khongdee et al., 2021).
    The magnitude of yield loss depends on the duration and severity of drought stress
    and the phenological stage at which the crop is affected (Sah et al., 2020). While
    drought stress during early stages of development results in smaller plants with
    a lower photosynthetic potential for overall biomass generation, drought stress
    during later stages (flowering to grain filling) affects yield formation and leads
    to a lower harvest index. Timely irrigation management necessitates sufficient
    water supply at any time of the cropping period to avoid drought and prevent yield
    reduction due to water shortage. Therefore, knowledge of the impact of drought
    stress and methods to identify its occurrence are fundamental in order to deal
    with sub-optimal water supply. Conventional methods for monitoring crop water
    stress rely on soil moisture measurements or determination of the matric potential
    in root zone (Kumar et al., 2020). However, accounting for soil heterogeneity
    in the field is often difficult (Clarke, 1997), additionally, soil water status
    is an indirect way to determine the actual plant water status. Thus, over the
    last three decades, several methods to monitor crop water stress at the plant
    directly have been developed. Crop water stress monitoring by plant-based approaches
    includes the determination of stomatal conductance, leaf water potential, relative
    water content and sap flow measurements (Jones, 2004). These methods, however,
    are time consuming and labour intensive, and some methods are destructive and
    hence are used more in research rather than in irrigation planning (Ihuoma & Madramootoo,
    2017). Remote sensing methods, on the contrary, such as spectral vegetation indices
    and infrared thermography are interesting alternative methods for the practice
    due to their reliability, rapidity of data acquisition and non-destructive nature
    (Ihuoma & Madramootoo, 2017; Mwinuka et al., 2021). Monitoring canopy temperature
    is probably the most practical way to obtain information on the crop water status.
    The temperature of the crop canopy increases as heat (solar energy) is absorbed
    into it but cools when that energy is used to evaporate water or transpire. Stomata
    close in response to soil water depletion, resulting in a decrease in water uptake,
    gas exchange and photosynthesis. Water-stressed plants would thus generally have
    less transpiration and hence a higher temperature than non-stressed ones (Payero
    & Irmak, 2006). Similar effects have been observed as a response to both biotic
    (pests/diseases (Hatfield & Pinter, 1993)) and abiotic (e.g., nutrient (Lin et
    al., 2012)) stress. Thus, if the water stress is the primarily object of thermal
    studies, other stress factors need to be avoided in order that the canopy temperature
    serves as an indicator of plant water status (Payero & Irmak, 2006). Several studies
    have been conducted to develop infrared thermography as a method to identify water
    stress status of crops such as maize (Zia et al., 2013), potato (Solanum tuberosum
    L.) (Gerhards et al., 2016), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (Hu et al., 2011), grapevine
    (Vitis vinifera L.) (Jones, 2002; Zia et al., 2009), olive (Olea europaea L.)
    (García-Tejero et al., 2017) and longan (Dimocarpus longan L.) (Wirya-Alongkorn
    et al., 2013). However, numerous climatic and microclimatic factors affect plant
    canopy temperature, such as solar radiation, wind, air temperature and humidity.
    Therefore, thermography measurements alone cannot detect plant water stress. Several
    strategies for measuring crop water stress using infrared thermography have been
    developed. Tc (crop canopy temperature) is used as the key indicator for estimation
    crop water stress in all the methods, usually as a single value during a high
    stress period or by calculating the time duration above a temperature threshold.
    This, however, requires a reference measurement of an unstressed control or a
    complex model to determine this threshold. For example, the difference in temperature
    between the canopy (Tc) and the air (Ta) has long been used as an indicator of
    water stress to account for climate variation. Idso et al. (1977) used the rising
    degree day concept to demonstrate that the accumulation of regular afternoon temperature
    variations, Tc–Ta, during the crop growing season is linearly related to final
    crop yield. Moreover, Wang and Gartung (2010) have reported using canopy temperature
    measurements with infrared thermometry for assessing water status of peach trees
    (Prunus persica) and a reasonable correlation between stem water potential and
    the canopy to air temperature difference was found. However, this method was mostly
    ignored after an introduction of the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) in the early
    1980s (Idso et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1981). CWSI uses a wet and a dry surface
    to simulate the border conditions of a non-transpiring and fully transpiring leaf
    to quantify crop water stress based on the current meteorological conditions.
    Applications of CWSI for maize have been evaluated in a number of recent studies
    (Apolo-apolo et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2010; Irmak et al., 2000; Zia et al.,
    2011). To improve the CWSI method, baselines have been established, obtaining
    concurrent measurements of air temperature and relative humidity. Baselines simulate
    the complete dehydration as well as the full watering of the plant in order to
    use as a reference state for the interpretation of plant stress status. Nevertheless,
    established references for fully irrigated plants and completely dry plant conditions
    to monitor plant water deficiency are not yet reliable for all crops (Grant et
    al., 2007). Apolo-apolo et al. (2020) developed new hemispherical wet and dry
    reference surfaces using a cellulose napkin paper together with a hemispheric
    plastic mould and a 3D printer for CWSI detection in maize. This approach allowed
    the accurate determination of Twet and Tdry in maize, though Tdry could be obtained
    directly from a dry artificial reference surfaces (ARS) temperature, a solar radiation-based
    transformation was required to determine Twet from the wet ARS temperature. Estimating
    CWSI in maize crops, however, is still limited as the practical implementation
    of this method by farmers or advisory services remains challenging. This is especially
    true, when considering the future necessity for large-scale and automated procedures
    of image acquisition and evaluation (Zhou et al., 2021), as the more data enter
    into the drought stress assessment to more important is the comparability of different
    data sets. In this study, we hypothesize that using more adequate wet and dry
    references may improve the efficiency of CWSI for monitoring maize water stress.
    Therefore, we conducted two maize water deficit irrigation experiments in order
    to (i) test a new approach to establish wet/dry references for use in CWSI by
    thermal imaging, (ii) to test whether the improved CWSI method relates to stomatal
    conductance and hence water stress and (iii) to assess the potential of the improved
    CWSI to predict maize yield under field conditions. The thermal imaging method
    was first tested under controlled conditions in a greenhouse, which was used as
    a rainout shelter, using controlled-water deficit irrigation treatments to induce
    stress during different critical stages of plant development. Thereafter, the
    improved thermal imaging-based CWSI approach was validated in a lowland field
    experiment under controlled-water deficit irrigation treatments. Finally, the
    developed CWSI method was applied and tested in an upland field experiment under
    rainfed conditions. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Experimental setup This study
    was carried out under two different growing and irrigation conditions. The first
    experiment was conducted in the greenhouse under controlled irrigation conditions
    followed by a similarly irrigated lowland field experiment and finally an upland
    field experiment under rainfed conditions. The first two experiments were implemented
    at Thapo sub-district, Mueang district, Phitsanulok province located in the lower
    north of Thailand (16.73°N, 100.18°E and 16.74°N, 100.21oE; Figure 1). The third
    experiment was conducted at Wang Thong district, Phitsanulok province, Thailand
    (16.90°N, 100.53°E; Figure 1). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Experimental
    location map For the greenhouse experiment under controlled conditions, maize
    variety CP888 was planted in big plastic containers (with 80 kg soil) from September
    to December 2018. The experimental design was arranged as a randomized complete
    block design (RCBD) with five treatments and five replications. A clay loam soil
    (sand 21.8%, silt 48.1% and clay 30.1%), EC 0.38 dS m−1, pH 5.6, OM 1.2%, total
    N 0.06%, available P 7.99 mg kg−1 and exchangeable K 46.1 mg kg−1 was used in
    experiment. Fertilizer was split-applied to maize, receiving a basal dressing
    of 24 kg ha−1 of N, 24 kg ha−1 of P and 24 kg ha−1 of K as a compound fertilizer
    at maize planting and a top dressing of 86.3 kg ha−1 of N as urea 30 days after
    maize sowing (DAS) as recommended by the Department of Agriculture of Thailand.
    Five irrigation treatments were designed based on the calculation of crop water
    requirement (CWR) being equal to the potential crop evapotranspiration of maize
    (ETc maize), using the modified FAO Penman–Monteith equation to calculate potential
    reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and multiplying it with crop coefficients recommended
    for maize (Kc maize) (Allen et al., 1998). All treatments received 100% CWR up
    to 20 DAS, following with five treatments as follows: (T1) “control” with full
    irrigation: 100% CWR (T2) “early stress”: 50% CWR from 20 DAS until anthesis and
    100% CWR after anthesis until harvest (T3) “sustained deficit”: 50% CWR from 20
    DAS until harvest (T4) “late stress”: 100% CWR up to anthesis and 50% CWR after
    anthesis until harvest (T5) “terminal stress”: 100% CWR up to anthesis and no
    irrigation after anthesis Details of water irrigation scheduling are presented
    in Table S1. The lowland field experiment was conducted from February to May 2020.
    The experiment was laid out as a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with
    five treatments and five replications. Water deficit treatments were identical
    to T1–T5 described above and arranged according to the greenhouse experiment under
    controlled conditions. The soil was classified as clayey soil (sand 15.5%, silt
    31.51% and clay 49.99%) with pH 7.5, EC 0.48 dS m−1, OM 0.8%, available P 1.81
    mg kg−1, exchangeable K 18.0 mg kg−1 and bulk density of 1.64 g cm−3. The plot
    size was 30 m2. Maize spacing was 75 cm between rows and 25 cm between plants
    in the row. Drip irrigation was applied according to the water deficit treatments.
    Fertilization was according to the recommendations of the department of Agriculture
    of Thailand as described above. In addition, maize yield data and CWSI values
    at 55 DAS from an additional upland maize field under rainfed condition were used
    to repeat the validation of the previously established CWSI–maize yield relationships.
    The experiment was carried out during 2018 on upland soil in a nearby region (Wang
    Thong district, Figure 1), using a split-plot design with three replications.
    Treatments were: July-planted maize sole cropping (control), July-planted maize–mungbean
    (Vigna radiata) relay cropping and June-planted maize sole cropping. Details of
    this experiment, that is, weather, soil and crop management, are described by
    Khongdee et al. (2021). 2.2 Soil moisture and weather data Soil moisture sensors
    (Watermark. IRROMETER, USA) were placed at 10 cm depth from soil surface to monitor
    the soil water potential. Field capacity (FC) and drought stress threshold (TH)
    were calculated based on soil matric potential. Weather data including temperature
    and relative humidity were recorded hourly by Tinytag sensors (Gemini, UK) (Figure
    2). Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was calculated as follows (Monteith & Unsworth,
    2014): (1) where RH is relative humidity (%) and T is air temperature (°C). FIGURE

    in the lowland field (b). Data were collected at Thapo sub-district, Mueang district,
    Phitsanulok province, lower north of Thailand 2.3 Maize growth, physiological
    and yield measurements Maize growth parameters, for example, plant height, leaf
    area, green value (SPAD) and maximum quantum yield of PSII were evaluated every
    2 weeks. Plant height and leaf area of maize were measured by a tape meter. Two
    leaves (No. 3 and 4 from the top) were selected to measure SPAD and maximum quantum
    yield of PSII (Fv/Fm). SPAD and maximum quantum yield of PSII were measured with
    a SPAD-502 meter (Konica-Minolta, Japan) and FluorPen FP 100-MAX meter (Photon
    Systems Instruments, Czech Republic), respectively. Moreover, leaf stomatal conductance
    was measured by Porometer model SC-1 leaf porometer (Decagon Devices, Washington)
    twice a week together with thermal imaging capture. Final maize grain yield under
    controlled and field conditions was collected at 115 DAS and was assessed for
    treatment comparison. 2.4 Thermal image acquisition FLIR camera (model C2, spectral
    range 7.5–14 µm and resolution of 80 × 60 pixel; FLIR Company, USA) was positioned
    at 1.5 m above the top of the maize canopy. The emissivity of the FLIR camera
    was set at 0.95. Thermal images were taken twice a week under both controlled
    and field conditions. After initial tests, the time 12:00–2:00 PM was determined
    as the most appropriate phase to record water stress by thermal imaging (Pradawet
    et al., 2019). Wet and dry reference surface readings, at the same time as thermal
    image acquisition, were used for false colour image interpretation. The green
    colour surface of cellulose sponge cloth (high liquid absorption and retention
    capacity; 3M company) was used for the artificial wet reference (Twet) by soaking
    both sides with water, while the sponge cloth without soaking with water was set
    as dry reference (Tdry) (Figure 3). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    and El3–EI8 plant measurement spots on 3rd or 4th leave 2.5 Thermal image processing
    and computation of CWSI Thermal image processing was done by FLIR Tools software
    version 5.1. Canopy temperature (Tc) was determined from the ellipse tool function
    as the software generates maximum, minimum and average value of leaves temperature
    of each pixel in the selected circle area of the maize leaves No. 3 or 4 from
    the top canopy. Averaged values of three spots of leave temperature were made
    as shown in Figure 2. Crop water stress index (CWSI) was calculated according
    to the equation given below (Jones, 2002). (2) where Tc is mean canopy temperature
    in °C, Tdry is dry reference temperature obtained by sponge cloth without watering,
    and Twet is the wet reference temperature obtained by soaking the sponge cloth
    with water. The CWSI values range between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates maximum stress
    and 0 indicates the absence of water stress. 2.6 Statistical analysis The growth
    and physiological responses of maize under different water deficits at different
    time points were analysed by means of an ANOVA by using JMP Pro 15.1.0 (SAS Institute
    Cary, NC). The Least Significant Difference (LSD) was used to identify significant
    differences among treatments (p ≤ .05 and p ≤ .01) for the greenhouse and the
    lowland field with RCBD design and the upland field with split-plot design. We
    can assume that growth, physiology and yield of maize were independent for each
    time point as they were collected quite far away from each other. Hence, there
    were big differences between maize plants of data points. Yield prediction was
    conducted by developing a linear regression model between crop yield and CWSI,
    using data collected under controlled conditions. For the initial validation of
    the linear regression model, crop yield and CWSI data from the water deficit irrigation
    lowland field experiment at Mueang district, Phitsanulok province, were used.
    The validation was repeated using maize data from an experiment under rainfed
    condition on an upland field at Wang Thong district, Phitsanulok province, where
    the same thermal imaging approach was used. The efficiency of CWSI in a maize
    yield prediction equation model was tested using root-mean-square error (RMSE),
    mean absolute error (MAE) and Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE).
    If RMSE and MAE is zero, it underlines the goodness of the agreement between measured
    and predicted data. NSE ranges between 1.0 (perfect fit) and -∞. NSE lower than
    0 indicates that mean value of observations would have been a better predictor
    than the model (Apolo-apolo et al., 2020). 3 RESULTS 3.1 Soil water condition
    of different water regimes The soil water status under controlled conditions is
    presented as log10 of soil water retention (pF) (Figure 4). The graph shows that
    from emergence until 20 DAS, the soil matric potential was on the same level in
    all treatments (pF = 2.0–2.5). Under full irrigation, soil water retention remained
    steadily in between field capacity and above drought stress threshold. Ten days
    after reducing irrigation to 50% CWR in T2, the soil dried below the drought stress
    threshold level, but regained a favourable moisture level again after reinitiating
    irrigation again after anthesis. Soil moisture of T3 initially followed the same
    pattern as T2 and as the irrigation level remained at 50% CWR drought increased
    until the maize was harvested. Water retention of T4 and T5 was mostly similar
    to control before anthesis phase, but their water content thereafter dropped.
    In addition, it was most pronounced in T5 after anthesis phase exhibiting a water
    retention beyond drought stress threshold value until harvest. For changes in
    weather, the CWR was overestimated between 65 and 72 DAS, leading to a temporary
    surpassing of FC in T1 and T2. The amount of irrigation was subsequently adjusted.

    20 DAS until harvest; T4 = late stress with 100% of CWR until anthesis and 50%
    of CWR after anthesis until harvest; and T5 = late stress with 100% of CWR until
    anthesis and no irrigation after anthesis 3.2 Maize growth and physiological responses
    under different water regimes Under controlled conditions, growth and development
    of maize were significantly affected by the different water regimes (Figure 5).
    Full irrigation up to anthesis until harvest (T1 and T4) increased height of maize
    significantly (p < .05) reaching a maximum height of about 230 cm. With regard
    to the SPAD index, leaf area and maximum quantum yield of PSII of maize leaves
    were also significantly higher in T4 and T5 than in the other irrigation treatments.
    The plant height in the early drought stressed treatments (T2 and T3) was lower
    and did not recover after re-irrigation in T2. T2 and T3 were also low in SPAD
    values with less than 40 SPAD units, the leaf area was less than 6000 cm2 pl−1,
    and maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm) was lower than 0.6. Results of maize
    growth and physiology of maize under field conditions were mostly similar to those
    obtained under greenhouse conditions as shown in Figure S1. FIGURE 5 Open in figure

    of CWR from 20 DAS until harvest; T4 = late stress with 100% of CWR until anthesis
    and 50% of CWR after anthesis until harvest; T5 = late stress with 100% of CWR
    until anthesis and no irrigation after anthesis. Note: * = significant differences
    of each time point at p ≤ .05 3.3 Canopy temperature, stomatal conductance and
    relationship to CWSI Canopy temperatures in T2 and T3 were significantly higher
    than in the control (T1) during 30 to 55 DAS under greenhouse and 37 to 50 DAS
    under field conditions as shown in Figure 6a and c. The canopy temperatures of
    T4 and T5 mostly were similar as compared to control. Stomatal conductance showed
    a similar trend as canopy temperature. T2 and T3 had significantly lower stomatal
    conductance than control as shown in Figure 6b and d. FIGURE 6 Open in figure

    T5 = late stress with 100%of CWR until anthesis and no irrigation after anthesis.
    Note: * = significant differences of each time point at p ≤ .05 3.4 Thermal imagery-based
    CWSI response at different levels of irrigation Under controlled conditions in
    the greenhouse, early drought stressed treatments (T2 and T3) showed significantly
    higher CWSI values than other treatments throughout the experiment (Figure 7a).
    Mean CWSI value of T2 and T3 climbed up to 0.35 at 55 DAS, whereas CWSI values
    of the other treatments remained low between 0.05 and 0.15, similar to the control.
    Consequently, yields of maize T2 and T3 were adversely affected, resulting in
    low grain yield production of about 2.5 Mg ha−1, whereas control obtained a median
    of 8.5 Mg ha−1 (Figure 7b). For the lowland field condition, results of CWSI and
    T3 were higher than the other treatments at around 30–50 DAS (Figure 7c), resulting
    in lower yield in T3 (5 Mg ha−1) (Figure 7d). FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    anthesis until harvest; and T5 = late stress with 100% of CWR until anthesis and
    no irrigation after anthesis. Note: a, b, and * = significant difference at p
    ≤ .05 Stomatal conductance has been widely used as a crop water stress detection
    method. Maize canopy temperature by thermal imaging alone had a very weak relationship
    with maize stomatal conductance (R2 = 0.02) as shown in Figure 8a. However, CWSI
    developed in this study using thermal imaging and improved dry/wet controls was
    strongly (R2 = 0.90) and linearly related to stomatal conductance under greenhouse
    conditions (Figure 8b). FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationships
    between stomatal conductance and canopy temperature (a) and stomatal conductance
    and crop water stress index (CWSI) (b) under controlled greenhouse conditions
    at 55 DAS 3.5 Maize yield prediction using CWSI Among several tested CWSI dates
    from 25 to 60 DAS of maize under greenhouse conditions, Table 1 reveals that measuring
    CWSI at 55 DAS (at tasseling stage) showed the strongest relationship between
    CWSI values and maize grain yield (R2 = 0.84). The linear regression at 55 DAS
    was “Yield = −16.05 × CWSI + 9.646”. Assessing CWSI between 50 and 60 DAS was
    also resulted in a strong relation with grain yield (R2 > 0.65), whereas those
    obtained between 25 and 45 DAS demonstrated a weak yield relation (R2 < 0.65).
    Hence, the linear regression of 55 DAS under controlled greenhouse conditions
    was validated by using CWSI and yield data of maize measured under lowland field
    conditions. The result showed that the yield predictions using CWSI assessment
    at 55 DAS were strongly correlated with yield of lowland maize under water deficit
    irrigation with R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.589, MAE = 0.459 and NSE = 0.843 (Figure 9a)
    as well as yield of upland maize under rainfed condition with R2 = 0.97, RMSE
    = 0.569, MAE = 0.390 and NSE = 0.969 (Figure 9b). TABLE 1. Relationship between

    DISCUSSION 4.1 Effects of water deficits on maize growth, physiological responses
    and yield production As expected, it was observed that water deficit severely
    affected growth and development of plants as well as yield (Grant et al., 1989;
    Khalili et al., 2013; Patanè, 2011). However, it is important to evaluate growth
    responses dependent on timing and duration of water deficit. In this study, the
    most detrimental plant effect was observed under water deficit in the early stages
    of development and a recovery never took place, even after returning to full irrigation.
    This is a relevant finding considering the specific conditions in Thailand where
    crop development in early off-season production falls into the dry season and
    plants depend solely on potential irrigation, while during the later stages the
    onset of the rainy season lowers the evaporative demand and supplies rainwater
    to the crop. In this study, the establishment of late stress after full irrigation
    was not successful and neither drought stress reactions nor a significant reduction
    in yield were hence observed. Not only height of maize was negatively affected
    by water deficit, but also SPAD, leaf area and photosynthetic system. As reported
    in a number of studies (Ghosh et al., 2017; Greaves & Wang, 2017; Na et al., 2018;
    Romano et al., 2011; Sangakkara et al., 2001), water stress decreased source and
    sink relationships that may also interfere with N uptake and photosynthesis of
    maize. Leaf area was reduced under water deficit conditions; hence, water stress
    significantly decreased radiation use efficiency of maize, which has been also
    reported in the literature (Earl & Davis, 2003; Stone et al., 2001). Chlorophyll
    fluorescence is one of the most powerful and widely used techniques to determine
    the photosynthetic efficiency. In general, the value of maximum quantum yield
    of the photo system II of maize (FV/Fm ratio) could be around 0.8 depending on
    maize variety (Guidi et al., 2019). A decline of this ratio is a good indicator
    of photoinhibition. Our results revealed that the reduction in irrigation by 50%
    from 20 to 60 DAS (T2 and T3) negatively affected the efficiency of maize photosynthesis,
    while control and other treatments remained at the standard value. In addition,
    yield of maize decreased by approximately 64% due to the water management in T2
    and T3. A strong water stress during the vegetative growth stage seriously inhibited
    the growth and leaf area of maize plants and decrease yield (Ghosh et al., 2017;
    Romano et al., 2011). This effect was further enhanced by the observed reduced
    greenness of leaves which is directly linked to less nitrogen uptake and a subsequent
    reduction in leaf area and photosynthetic activity (Urban et al., 2021). Source
    ability is determined by the photosynthetic products assimilated during the maize
    grain filling phase. Sink strength is defined by the growing grains’ capacity
    to absorb these assimilates. Generally, the yield of maize grain has been reported
    to be sink limited (Bonelli et al., 2016). Consequently, seed number per crop
    of T2 and T3 was significantly decreased (data not shown). However, maize with
    even little water stress during the early vegetative growth and late grain-filling
    stages could also decrease growth and yield of maize (Kang et al., 2000; Tariq
    & Usman, 2009). In our study, reducing irrigation by 50% (T4) or 100% (T5) of
    the control amount from anthesis until harvest had no serious effect on maize
    growth and yield. This was because the residual water content in the soil was
    still sufficient for maize to produce grain yield (Figure 3). Thus, in the absence
    of drought stress, stomatal conductance and leave temperature during the critical
    period of these two treatments were similar to the control (Figure 6). Hence,
    reducing irrigation after the critical flowering period of maize had little effect
    on maize yield production. However, these treatments created variation in maize
    yield production under both controlled and field conditions as seen in Figure
    7b and d. 4.2 CWSI indicates water stress levels of maize Canopy temperature is
    a valuable plant water stress indicator that has been used in several crops (Gerhards
    et al., 2016; Wirya-Alongkorn et al., 2013; Zia et al., 2013). In this study,
    it was confirmed that canopy temperature is also an efficient water stress indicator
    for maize, particularly when combined with the newly establish dry/wet references
    used for CWSI calculation. Canopy temperature of maize reliably increased with
    reduced irrigation (Figure 6a and c). Clearly, canopy temperature alone cannot
    efficiently indicate drought stress. This is in part shown by the weak correlation
    with maize stomatal conductance, which served as a reference in this study (Figure
    8a). This is because the impact on overall canopy temperature by leaf transpiration
    was insignificant as compared to environmental factors. Therefore, dry/wet references
    using wet and dry sponges were shown to be a good reference to account for the
    change in environmental conditions and allowed to calculate an improved CWSI to
    quantify water stress levels of maize (Jackson et al., 1981; Jones, 2002). The
    CWSI developed in this study was linearly and highly correlated (R² = 0.90) with
    stomatal conductance under controlled conditions. Even though stomatal conduction
    was used as a reference measurement in this study, data analysis revealed that
    during periods of stress, CWSI remained high and showed lower variation as compared
    to stomatal conductance. This indicates that thermal imaging is a more reliable
    stress indicator for the practice than the determination of stomatal conductance.
    CWSI based on constant wet and dry reference surfaces on the same image excludes
    the human factor, especially when computerized image recognition is used. The
    determination of stomatal conductance in contrast depends on the person taking
    the measurement to assess the situation about environmental factors such as exposure
    to the sun or position within the canopy prior to taking the measurement on a
    limited portion of the canopy (Damour et al., 2010). Furthermore, the measurement
    always implies a certain time delay and unlike thermal imaging which allows to
    assess the whole canopy at the same time, stomatal conductance cannot be measured
    at different points simultaneously. Thus, stress monitoring based on CWSI is likely
    to become more widespread (Zhou et al., 2021). To detect stress based on CWSI,
    the identification of critical values is important (Kacira et al., 2002). In this
    study under controlled conditions, the peak CWSI was 0.35, which was correlated
    with yield losses of up to 64% in T2 and T3, while a CWSI of less than 0.1 indicated
    no stress. Under field conditions, the peak CWSI was 0.42 and lowest CWSI was
    0.1, resulting in maize yield loss up to 38% in T3. Other studies have observed
    different critical CWSI values, depending on the methods applied. For example,
    a low CWSI value of about 0.2 has been reported for maize under well-watered conditions
    and a CWSI of above 0.6 has been reported to reduce maize grain yields by 13%
    under field conditions in subtropical environment (Romano et al., 2011; Yazar
    et al., 1999). The method applied here differed from others mainly in the way
    reference surfaces was used. Grant et al. (2007) and Jones (1999,2002) pioneered
    the use of CWSI based on a method of spraying water on leaves (wet reference)
    and coating leaves with Vaseline (dry reference). Simulation of dry reference
    by clogging leaves with Vaseline leads to permanently closed maize stomata and
    negatively affects leaves functioning. In contrast, the technique shown here can
    quantify water stress levels of maize as well, without interfering with maize
    growth. Romano et al. (2011) used wet (wet bulb) and dry (Ta +5°C) references,
    which were not directly represented on the false colour image and, thus, required
    an extra step of calculation. The most recent study about improving the use of
    reference surfaces for the analysis of CWSI in maize by Apolo-apolo et al. (2020)
    suggests the use of hemispherical bodies of a standardized material. The applicability
    in the field and transferability of the results, however, still need testing.
    This demonstrates the importance of the actual design of the reference surfaces
    especially when applying different methods of image acquisition, for example,
    by a hand-held device or by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The use of standardized
    surfaces is also a very important prerequisite for the development of algorithms
    to improve machine learning methods and statistical models for the application
    of CWSI assessment methods on a larger scale and a higher scale of automation
    (Tariq & Usman, 2009). While these methods may lead to a review of the actual
    references used in practice in the future, the high correlation of the CWSI determined
    based on the sponge material used in this study to stomatal conductance (R² =
    0.90) shows the suitability of the method presented here. 4.3 Validity of improved
    CWSI as maize yield predictor Beyond the sheer detection of drought stress, this
    study shows a way to predict the yield level based on a linear regression equation
    using CWSI55DAS under controlled conditions. Measuring the canopy temperature
    of maize at various growth stages can reveal a range of effects on growth and
    yield development. This study started tracking maize canopy temperature at 25
    DAS and continued until 60 DAS for each 5-day period following the initiation
    of deficit irrigation at 20 DAS. A longer period of water deficit improves the
    predictability of CWSI on maize yield production under controlled conditions.
    CWSI55DAS was the most accurate for predicting final maize yield among the tested
    measurement time options as it was the most critical water requiring period. CWSI55DAS
    developed in the greenhouse revealed a strong correlation with maize yield production
    in the field as well (R² = 0.94 under irrigation maize field experiment and R²
    = 0.97 under rainfed upland maize field condition). Additionally, the results
    of this study show that 55 DAS was a good prediction period because there was
    no major water stress after anthesis or during grain filling, thereby constraining
    the applicability of this specific regression to cases without major late development
    stress. It is easier to calibrate CWSI in the greenhouse than it is in the field
    because the controlled conditions in the greenhouse environment allow for the
    creation of a well-defined and regulated moisture gradient. Water deficits can
    be handled in a manner that is directly related to maize water stress. In contrast
    under field conditions, experiments may be influenced by a variety of causes,
    including abiotic and biotic stress. Rain can fall unexpectedly during a time
    of water scarcity, as illustrated in our results in Figure 1b. Thus, calibrating
    the CWSI in the greenhouse and then validating it in the field can demonstrate
    the effects of water stress more clearly than testing under a single-field condition.
    In this study, CWSI was tested using a hybrid maize variety (CP888) with a harvesting
    cycle of 110 days. For this variety, around 50–55 DAS, maize reached its maximum
    height and started to shed its pollen (tasseling stage). Source and sink relationship
    was imbalanced due to sink being limited (pollen abortion) by drought effects.
    Water stress in maize is the most severe during tasseling and can result in a
    severe yield loss if the tassel is partially lost (Udom & Kamalu, 2019). Therefore,
    this growth stage could be a good measuring time to predict final maize yield
    by CWSI as it is the most sensitive period to water stress. Using this approach
    for yield prediction needs to consider the maize variety as the life cycle of
    each variety is different, meaning that the critical maize growth stages are reached
    at different times. Additionally, microclimate and other stresses, that is, nutrient
    deficiency and diseases must be considered as factors restricting the CWSI''s
    ability to predict final maize grain yield (Nanda et al., 2018). Irmak et al.
    (2000) assessed CWSI of maize under field conditions in a Mediterranean semiarid
    climate and predicted maize yield using CWSI. Their CWSI values of maize at pollinating
    stage were related with maize grain yield by a polynomial function (R² = 0.98).
    Similarly, this study showed that CWSI was related with maize grain yield by a
    polynomial function (Table S2). 5 CONCLUSIONS Along with the development of a
    water stress detection technology, a new wet/dry technique using a sponge cloth
    is proposed to obtain reliable CSWI values. Strong relationships between CWSI
    and stomatal conductance were found under the different maize water deficit treatments,
    showing the suitability of CWSI to quantify maize water stress levels. However,
    in order to make absolute values comparable uniform and standardized references
    are necessary. We conclude that the use of adequate reference surfaces is an important
    prerequisite for the reliable determination of CWSI on the one hand and for the
    comparability of data on the other hand. Maize responded strongly to severity
    and time of water deficits occurring before critical growth stages. In this study,
    due to the conditions on the research site, water deficits after anthesis were
    not prominent and, thus, did not show a major effect on maize growth and yield
    due to sufficient remaining residual water in this clay loam soil. In contrast,
    the yields in treatments subjected to drought stress during crop development were
    reduced by 64% compared with the well-watered control as water stress occurred
    at the critical tasseling stage of maize. This yield reduction did occur even
    when water supply was sufficient at a later stage. Taking this into account, we
    were able to show that a yield loss prediction is best done, when considering
    the severity of the stress and the phenological stage of the crop. Assessing CWSI
    at 55 DAS, that is, at tasseling, had a strong linear correlation with grain yield.
    This linear regression provides a high potential to predict the grain yield of
    this variety based on CWSI values even under field conditions under similar soils.
    Further research is required to determine the robustness of the method under different
    soils, for different varieties and stress patterns. For the agricultural practice,
    in order to accommodate more plants in one picture and hence account for spatial
    variability, a remotely piloted aerial vehicle equipped with a digital camera
    is recommended to be employed to improve early detection of water stress in maize,
    when combined with the developed dry/wet references strategically positioned in
    the field. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research was sponsored and supported by the National

    \ Hass avocado irrigation is a controversial issue due to insufficient scientific\

    \ studies in the \nHass avocado irrigation focused on proximal sensing (PS) technologies\
    \ and recent studies emphasizing the \npotential of remote sensing (RS), and application\
    \ technologies to schedule the irrigation. PS takes advantage \nof the soil or\

    \ while RS \nprovides a broad set of spectral data in continuous and large areas\
    \ that can be transformed into crop-rela-\nted biophysical variables. Applications\
    \ – a term grouping mobile (smartphone) apps, desktop programs, and \nweb-based\
    \ platforms – offers portability, high precision, and graphic visualization of\

    \ one of the \nmost profitable fruits traded in international mar-\nkets (FAO,\
    \ 2021; International Trade Centre, 2021). \nThis fruit is produced in countries\
    \ with tropical and \nsubtropical climates (Schaffer et al., 2013), many of \n\
    them with emergent economies, such as Colombia. \nThis country is the tenth largest\
    \ global exporter of \nHass avocados (FAO, 2021), and its production has \nincreased\
    \ exponentially in recent years (Ramírez-Gil \net al., 2018a). Unfortunately,\
    \ such production has \nbeen conducted without technology, which has ex-\ntended\
    \ the agronomic knowledge gap (Ramírez-Gil et \nal., 2018a; Builes and Duque,\
    \ 2020). Hass avocado in \nColombia can be considered a rainfed crop because \n\
    most farmers irrigate empirically once a week only \nwhen trees manifest water\
    \ deficit signs or do not ir-\nrigate, but recently studies demonstrated that\
    \ under \ntropical condition irrigation can be necessary in a few \nmonths a year\
    \ (Erazo-Mesa et al., 2021). Therefore, \nColombian Hass avocado farmers who adopt\
    \ incipi-\nent or state of the art irrigation techniques can save \nwater and\
    \ mitigate the negative consequences of wa-\nter scarcity and climate change on\
    \ their agriculture \nproduction system in the future.\nWater scarcity and climate\
    \ change will modify the wa-\nter use in agriculture in the forthcoming years\
    \ (FAO, \n2020), including some avocado-producing areas, \nwhere changes in temperature\
    \ and precipitation are \nprojected with impacts on water balances (Ramírez-\n\
    Gil et al., 2019). In addition, climatic variability under \ntropical conditions\
    \ presents many adverse effects on \ncrops as avocado (Ramírez-Gil et al., 2020;\
    \ Erazo-\nMesa et al., 2021). Climate variability is associated \nwith seasonal\
    \ and non-seasonal phenomena such as \nthe Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)\
    \ (Byrne et \nal., 2018; Mamalakis and Foufoula-Georgiou, 2018), \nand ENSO (El\
    \ Niño Southern Oscillation) phenom-\nena, respectively (McPhaden et al., 2006;\
    \ McCabe and \nWolock, 2013). Both phenomena have a high impact \non the availability\
    \ of water for crops.\nAiming to identify the volume of water and the \nmoment\
    \ to irrigate the crop (Ali, 2010), irrigation \nscheduling (IS) is the first\
    \ step to fill the water man-\nagement gap in Hass avocado in Colombia. Although\
    \ \nother methods have been used to schedule irrigation \n(Yohannes et al., 2019),\

    \ These demand a vast amount of historical \nor near real-time data and specialized\
    \ knowledge to \nperform the irrigation scheduling (Fernández et al., \n2020).\
    \ The factors that contribute to the reduction \nof the IS accuracy include the\
    \ high variability of the \nsoil, terrain, and microclimates; the changing trees’\
    \ \nphysiology and reseeding requirements; the differen-\ntial gene expression;\
    \ the rootstock variability in the \nnursery stage; and heterogeneous agronomic\
    \ tasks \nwithin plots (Ali, 2010).\nCurrently, the concept of digital agriculture\
    \ (DA), \npart of the revolution 4.0 concept, is being explored \nemphasizing\
    \ the use of different technologies in \nagriculture (Ramírez-Gil et al., 2021)\
    \ such as infor-\nmation and communication systems, remote and \nproximal sensing,\
    \ modeling, programming, robotics, \ncloud computing, the internet of things (IoT),\
    \ big \ndata analysis, among others (Kamilaris et al., 2017; \nEl-Gayar and Ofori,\
    \ 2020). The main objective of this \nnew approach in agriculture is the management\
    \ of \ninformation for a correct, fast, and accurate decision \nmaking. From the\
    \ DA approach, technologies that \nsuit the Hass avocado IS (Ćulibrk et al., 2014)\
    \ can be \nclassified into three categories: proximal sensing (PS), \nremote sensing\
    \ (RS), and mobile or web applications. \nStudies have reported the benefits of\
    \ using IS in avo-\ncado orchards (Holzapfel et al., 2017; Moreno-Ortega \net\
    \ al., 2019; Silber et al., 2019), highlighting a reduc-\ntion in crop water consumption\
    \ and yield, and fruit \nquality improvement.\nIn the following chapters, an exhaustive\
    \ review will \nbe made when aspects associated with the definition \nof DA, the\
    \ use of remote and proximity sensors, new \nanalysis technologies, and smart\
    \ devices and web \npages were used for the determination, program-\nming, and\
    \ management of irrigation on agricultural \nsystems with an emphasis on the Hass\
    \ avocado crop.\nDIGITAL AGRICULTURE APPROACH: \nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn recent\
    \ years, the need for new technologies in \nagricultural systems has been characterized\
    \ by a con-\ntinuous search for sustainable solutions to face global \nchallenges,\
    \ highlighting the technological tools that \nimprove the analysis of information\
    \ and the under-\nstanding of biological phenomena. New technolo-\ngies have allowed\
    \ a better understanding of plant \ninteractions with biotic and abiotic actors,\
    \ generat-\ning criteria for the optimization of processes, conser-\nvation of\
    \ biodiversity, efficient use of resources, mass \nyields, and management of phytosanitary\
    \ problems \n(Fig. 1).\nThis new trend in agriculture has been named digi-\ntal\
    \ agriculture (DA), smart agriculture, or agriculture \n4.0, all these related\
    \ to the same concept (Rose and \nChilvers, 2018; Sharma et al., 2020). The main\
    \ objec-\ntive of this new era in agriculture is the management \nof information\
    \ for correct decision-making and the \nsearch to massify the yields with a lower\
    \ economic \nand environmental cost. This revolution implies the \nuse of technologies\
    \ such as information and commu-\nnication systems, remote and proximity sensors,\
    \ bio-\nmodeling, programming, robotics, the cloud, IoT, big \ndata analysis,\
    \ artificial intelligence, machine learn-\ning, blockchain, mobile applications,\
    \ and electronic \ndevices (Karmas et al., 2016; Kamilaris et al., 2017; \nKamilaris\
    \ and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018; Ramírez-Gil \net al., 2018b; Smith, 2018; El-Gayar\
    \ and Ofori, 2020; \nSharma et al., 2020).\nThe DA approach presents multiple\
    \ challenges to \nachieve a high impact on a diversity of producers, \nfarm sizes,\
    \ production systems, cultures, and social \naspects. These challenges are associated\
    \ with: (i) the \nneed for reliable, fast, and accurate information as \npossible;\
    \ (ii) design of flexible tools; low-cost solu-\ntions; (iii) easy-to-implement\
    \ and friendly-interface \nalternatives to users, (iv) open-source technologies;\
    \ \nand (v) responsible innovation (Ramírez-Gil et al., \n2018; Rose and Chilvers,\
    \ 2018; Rijswijk et al., 2019).\nThe practical application of the DA approach\
    \ in dif-\nferent parts of the value chain of agricultural systems \nhas multiple\
    \ cooperative advantages (Smith, 2018; \nSharma et al., 2020). In this work, we\
    \ suggest that \nthe design and practical applications of technological \ndevelopments\
    \ associated with DA have the following \naspects: (i) objective and problem to\
    \ be solved; (ii) \ncorrect use of the principles and theoretical concep-\ntualization\
    \ of algorithms, processes, and tools used; \n(iii) resources necessary for its\
    \ implementation under \nfield conditions; (iv) products generated, correct in-\n\
    terpretation, and their limitations; and (v) economic \nviability.\nIn figure\
    \ 1, we present the main objective, some tools, \nand the potential products of\
    \ the DA approach. The \nimplementation of DA tools has contributed to a bet-\n\
    ter land use; more sustainable agronomic practices; \nVol. 16 - No. 1 - 2022\n\

    \ 2017; Ka-\nmilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018; Ramírez-Gil et al., \n2018b; Rijswijk\
    \ et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2020).\nOur results suggest that the practical\
    \ application of \nAD tools in avocado production systems is not wide-\nspread\
    \ worldwide. This situation indicates the great \npotential that this type of\
    \ technology can generate \nthroughout the value chain. It also indicates the\
    \ great \nchallenge that it means for the sector to be able to \nincorporate the\
    \ new developments associated with \nAD and its application as a basis for evidence-based\
    \ \ndecision-making.\nTHE USE OF PROXIMAL SENSING\nSoil-based Sensors\nA broad\
    \ set of soil-based sensor technologies to \nschedule avocado irrigation have\
    \ been reported \n(Crowley and Escalera, 2013). These imply monitor-\ning the\
    \ soil water content (SWC) with time-domain \nreflectometry (TDR) probes, capacitance\
    \ sensors, \nor reflectometry probes, or the soil matric potential \n(SMP) with\
    \ tensiometers or granular matrix sensors \n(Scanlon et al., 2002). However, most\
    \ irrigation stud-\nies in the Hass and other avocado cultivars have used \nSMP\
    \ devices to schedule irrigation (Tab. 1). SMP is \nthe amount of energy exerted\
    \ by the soil particles \nto retain water (Miyazaki, 2005), which does not \n\
    depend on the texture and other soil-related factors. \nTherefore, SMP measurements\
    \ take advantage of \nSWC readings because SMP permits standardizing \nthresholds\
    \ to initiate and stop the irrigation (Da-\nbach et al., 2016). Some reporters\
    \ considered the used \nof tensiometers as essential in avocado orchards to \n\
    avoid over and subirrigation (Goodall, 1986; du Ples-\nsis, 1991).\nEarly experiences\
    \ in the use of tensiometers to irri-\ngate avocados were reported in several\
    \ studies. Incipi-\nent knowledge about SMP thresholds to irrigate the \ncrop\
    \ led to select −1000 KPa (a value close to perma-\nnent wilting point) as one\
    \ of the irrigation-triggering \ntreatments. Due to tensiometer readings not falling\
    \ \nbelow −80 KPa, the authors used resistance blocks to \nreach this value and\
    \ consequently activate the irriga-\ntion. After this treatment was applied, the\
    \ tree trunk \ndiameter growth significantly reduced (Richards et \nal., 1962).\
    \ Other authors reported an operational ba-\nsis to schedule the avocado irrigation\
    \ using tensiome-\nters in drip irrigation systems in the United States \nFigure\

    \ of 7, 14, 21, and 28-d irrigation intervals \n(thresholds to start the irrigation\
    \ ranged from −20 \nto < −80 KPa) on tree parameters of Ettinger, and \nFuerte\
    \ avocado cultivars. The application of the 21-d \nirrigation interval (corresponding\
    \ to the irrigation \ntrigger of −40 KPa) saved 24.9% of water (compared \nwith\
    \ the 7-d irrigation interval) while evidencing no \nsignificant reduction in\
    \ trunk diameter, tree canopy \nvolume, and yield. However, this produced a cumula-\n\
    tive water deficit in deep soil layers throughout the \nirrigation season (Kalmar\
    \ and Lahav, 1977; Lahav and \nKalmar, 1977, 1983).\nSMP devices must be buried\
    \ permanently in the soil \naccording to the highest avocado tree’s root density\
    \ \ndepth (Lahav and Kalmar, 1983), which is usually \nno deeper than 0.60 m (du\
    \ Plessis, 1991). The most \nappropriate SMP devices installation location cor-\n\
    responds to the permanently moist soil area, where \nthe active or feeder roots\
    \ are found (Fig. 2) (Good-\nall, 1986). In addition, it is recommended installing\
    \ \nseveral in-depth (Fig. 2) and spatially distributed ten-\nsiometers in the\
    \ field to counteract the high soil spa-\ntial variability (Crowley and Escalera,\
    \ 2013), which \nis one of the critical limitations of soil-based sensors \n(Van\
    \ Pelt and Wierenga, 2001). Once installed, ten-\nsiometer and granular matrix\
    \ sensor measurements \nmust be read manually and stored in data loggers or \n\
    on the cloud, respectively. Although manufacturers’ \ntechnical sheets state that\
    \ current tensiometers and \ngranular matrix sensors can read SMP in the ranges\
    \ of \n0, −100 KPa, and from 0, −200 KPa, respectively, in \npractice, these ranges\
    \ can oscillate in either direction.\nIrrigation scheduling using these devices\
    \ consists \nof identifying the appropriate moment to start and \nstop the irrigation\
    \ event and establishing the lowest \nand the highest SMP limits, respectively.\
    \ An irriga-\ntion event is triggered when the SMP falls below the \nlowest limit,\
    \ and this event ends when the water re-\nplenishing within the root zone rises\
    \ the SMP back \nto its highest limit. After a comprehensive review of \nthose\
    \ SMP thresholds as presented in table 1, it can \nbe affirmed that although the\
    \ most used lowest SMP \nlimit is −50 KPa, an accurate selection of this limit\

    \ \ndepends on the irrigation system and the soil texture. \nAccording to Goodall’s\
    \ recommendation (Goodall, \n1986) (Tab. 1), high-frequent systems require the\
    \ \nlowest threshold close to field capacity (FC), while \nlow-frequent systems\
    \ require an SMP threshold far \nfrom FC. Due to water in sandy soils moving faster\
    \ \nthan in those clayey soils, the lowest SMP threshold \nin sandy soils must\
    \ be close to FC, as this must be \nfar from FC in clayey soils (see du Plessis’\
    \ recommen-\ndation in Tab. 1). Although this was not detailed in \nmost of the\
    \ studies of table 1, it can be inferred that \nthe highest SMP limit used to\
    \ stop the irrigation was \n−10 KPa (FC). When two SMP devices are installed \n\
    in the field, it is recommended to use the shallowest \nreadings as the lowest\
    \ SMP threshold, and the deep-\nest readings as the highest SMP threshold (Goodall,\
    \ \n1986).\nPlant-based sensors\nPlants are living systems that take a small amount\
    \ of \nwater transported by energy gradients through the \ncontinuum soil-plant-atmosphere\
    \ (Kramer, 1983). An \nimbalance among the soil water availability, water \nused\
    \ by plant-water-related processes, and the evapo-\nrative demand causes plants\
    \ to endure water deficit \n6\n ERAZO-MESA / ECHEVERRI-SÁNCHEZ / RAMÍREZ-GIL\n\
    Rev. Colomb. Cienc. Hortic.\nstress (Taiz and Zeiger, 2002). It is noted that\
    \ plants \nreveal water stress through the water and energy \nstatus, electrical\
    \ potential, flux of related fluids, pres-\nsure, or size variation of the trunk,\
    \ stems, leaves, tis-\nsues, and other vegetative organs (Fernández, 2017). \n\
    The consequences of water stress in some plants \ncan be temporary (i.e., reversible)\
    \ due to their stress \nadaptation mechanisms or permanent, modifying \ntheir\
    \ life cycle (Silber et al., 2013). In this sense, the \nplant-based irrigation\
    \ approach takes advantage of \ndetectable water-deficit-stress plant signals\
    \ to estab-\nlish reasonable limits to trigger the irrigation (Jones, \n2004).\n\
    The most common plant-based variables tested as \npotential triggering-irrigation\
    \ parameters in Hass \navocado crop are the maximum daily trunk-diame-\nter variation\
    \ (MTDV), trunk diameter growth rate \n(TGR), trunk diameter shrinkage (TDS),\
    \ stem and \nleaf water potential (SWP and LWP), leaf stomatal \nconductance (gs),\
    \ fruit diameter variation, leaf volt-\nage differences, and photosynthesis rate\
    \ (Turner et \nal., 2001; Winer and Zachs, 2007; Gil et al., 2011; Sil-\nber et\
    \ al., 2013, 2019). A detailed list of water stress \nindicators in tree orchards\
    \ is provided (Fernández, \n2017). Furthermore, some authors had been classi-\n\
    fied in non-automated and automated the methods \nto measure plant-based variables\
    \ (Fernández, 2017). \nPorometers, infrared gas analyzers, portable photo-\nsynthesis\
    \ systems, and Scholander chambers are part \nof the first group. In the second\
    \ group sap flow sen-\nsors, magnetic leaf patch-clamp pressure probes and \n\
    TDR probes are included.\nDespite their potential benefits as described in detail\
    \ \n(Jones, 2004), the following limitations restrict in-\nfield usage of plant-based\
    \ methods to the wise irriga-\ntion management of avocado orchards (Jones, 2004;\
    \ \nSilber et al., 2013; Fernández, 2017):\n• The variability of in-field LWP\
    \ measurements is \nequal to or greater than the lowest threshold (−2 \nMPa),\
    \ making it challenging to recognize the ri-\nght time when the plant has reached\
    \ the LWP \nthreshold. \n• Specific processes of avocado tree flushes could in-\n\
    duce physiological parameters and water demand \nchanges, resulting in a lack\
    \ of precise indicators of \nplant-based thresholds. \n• The tree growth rate\
    \ of some woody crops such as \nthe avocado, depends on alternate bearing years,\
    \ \nand this involves relative trunk diameter measure-\nments in on-crop and off-crop\
    \ years. \n• Most plant-based water stress indicators exhibit a \nrecurring-diurnal\
    \ behavior, which means they de-\ncrease at midday and increase at night, reaching\
    \ a \npeak in the early mornings. \n• Plant-based sensors can be calibrated to\
    \ identify \nthe plant’s water-stress condition and, consequent-\nly, trigger\
    \ the irrigation. However, these sensors ne-\nglect how much water needs to be\
    \ applied and the \nright moment to stop irrigation. \nA few studies have attempted\
    \ to establish rationale \nirrigation indices for the Hass avocado crop. In an\
    \ ex-\nperiment the authors tested triggering the irrigation \nwhen gs fell below\
    \ 25% (by arbitrary criterium), ob-\ntaining a reduction of 33% in the water applied\
    \ and \nof 30 fruits per tree, as compared to the 120% pan \nevaporation triggering\
    \ irrigation treatment (Turner et \nal., 2001). In addition, Winer and Zachs (2007)\
    \ pro-\nposed a method to remove the water-stress cumula-\ntive effect when the\
    \ soil water was depleting from \nthe MTDV, joining successive MTDV peaks through\
    \ \na reference line. The authors affirmed this could im-\nprove water irrigation\
    \ management decisions for \navocado orchards. On the other hand (Oyarce and \n\
    Gurovich, 2010), measured in laboratory conditions \na significant electrical\
    \ potential falling of 7.10 ± 1.56 \nmV in the trunk (recorded at 25 cm above\
    \ the ground) \nof 2-year trees when the irrigation was applied.\nSilber et al.\
    \ (2012) and Silber et al. (2013) delved into \nthe response of irrigation treatments\
    \ to IS plant-\nbased parameters of Hass avocado trees, consider-\ning the effect\
    \ of environmental variables on these \nparameters. Additionally, has been reported\
    \ a poor \nhourly correlation between the tree’s water uptake, \nthe applied water\
    \ volume, and the trunk diameter \ngrowth. As the hourly water uptake rate peak\
    \ oc-\ncurred around midday (12 L h−1 / tree), the trunk \ndiameter growth decreased\
    \ (the 0.1-mm peak was \nidentified in the early morning, around 6 AM) (Silber\
    \ \net al., 2012). The daily course of the trunk diameter \ngrowth responds to\
    \ a circadian-cycle behavior. In this \nsame study, the authors determined that\
    \ TGR was \ninversely correlated to the hourly vapor pressure defi-\ncit. TGR\
    \ reached negative values (i.e., a shrinkage) in \nthe early afternoon but returned\
    \ to zero or positive \nvalues at night. Therefore, it can be affirmed that \n\
    differential irrigation strategies significantly influ-\nence plant-based parameters\
    \ of avocado trees at the \nend of the season. However, no apparent effects were\
    \ \nVol. 16 - No. 1 - 2022\nADVANCES IN HASS AVOCADO IRRIGATION SCHEDULING\n7\n\
    found on the daily dynamics, which is an indispens-\nable condition required for\
    \ effective IS. Furthermore, \nany plant based IS strategy must be calibrated\
    \ using \nthe actual crop water requirement (Gu et al., 2020).\nTHE USE OF REMOTE\
    \ SENSING\nRS fundamentals\nRemote sensing is a term that gathers a broad set\
    \ of \nnon-contact platformed-based sensors, techniques, \nmodels, communication\
    \ protocols, and applications \nproviding electromagnetic spectrum, geometrical\
    \ and \nbiophysical data from the earth’s surface and atmo-\nsphere (Tempfli et\
    \ al., 2009). Based on the acquisition-\ndata distance above the earth’s surface,\
    \ sensors can be \nclassified into the following categories: ground-based, \n\
    (i.e., systems articulated to terrestrial vehicles and \nhand-held sensors); aerials,\
    \ which include platforms \non airplanes and unmanned aerial systems (UAVs); \n\
    and space-based, as integrated by satellite constella-\ntions (Sishodia et al.,\
    \ 2020). From reduced spectral \ndatasets in the 1970s (Madry, 2017), the RS concept\
    \ \nbecame an integrated related products’ collection \nboosted through the internet\
    \ of things (IoT) and ar-\ntificial intelligence (AI) (Jung et al., 2021). Stored\
    \ in \na proper location and warranting their accessibility \nand ease to interpreting,\
    \ RS data could be regarded \nas a common heritage of humankind that provides\
    \ \nfactual evidence of historical and current changes of \nthe earth (Pelton\
    \ et al., 2017).\nPlatform-based remote sensors measure the amount, \nquality\
    \ or surface-sensor traveling time of the ener-\ngy emitted or reflected by the\
    \ objects’ surface on the \nearth or the atmosphere’s particles. Active sensors\
    \ \nemit their energy over the target’s surface and mea-\nsure the resulting reflected\
    \ energy, and passive sen-\nsors measure the reflected energy primarily sourced\
    \ \nby the sun (Reddy, 2018). Target’s surface properties \nsuch as scattering,\
    \ absorbance, and the signal’s angle, \ndirection, and polarization are measured\
    \ by remote \nsensors (Tempfli et al., 2009). Sensors capture the \nenergy in\
    \ some wavelength ranges of interest. The \nmost common to agricultural applications\
    \ are the \nso-called visible (0.38-0.75 μm), infrared (0.7-1 μm), \nshort-wavelength\
    \ infrared (1.5-3 μm), thermal in-\nfrared (3-15 μm), and microwaves (1 mm-1 m).\
    \ The \nnumber of pixels with which the surface is rebuilt, \nrevisiting days,\
    \ and wavelengths captured by these \nsensors correspond to the spatial, time,\
    \ and spectral \nresolution (Sishodia et al., 2020). RS measurements \nbecome\
    \ biophysical variables through empirical and \ntheoretical models, which must\
    \ be calibrated with \nfield readings (Tab. 2) (Huang et al., 2018). Ponder-\n\
    ing the shortage of RS concepts presented above, an \nextended background is thoroughly\
    \ described by dif-\nferent studies (Schowengerdt, 2007; Tempfli et al., \n2009;\
    \ Pelton et al., 2017).\nSince Google Earth Engine’s (GEE) arrival in 2010, the\
    \ \nuse and application development of the satellite RS \nhave massified enormously\
    \ (Tamiminia et al., 2020). \nGEE is a cloud-based petabyte platform that provides\
    \ \na refined way of acceding, visualizing, downloading, \nand processing publicly\
    \ accessible, near-real-time, \nand historical satellite RS datasets (Gorelick\
    \ et al., \n2017). In its robust platform, GEE hosts earth’s ob-\nservations from\
    \ Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS proj-\nects; high-resolution imagery from Planet\
    \ SkySat and \nThe National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); \nbiophysical\
    \ (DEMs, landforms, lithology, and vegeta-\ntion coverages); environmental (ecoregions,\
    \ defores-\ntation, emissions, and forest); and climate-weather \n(surface temperature,\
    \ LAI, rainfall, water vapor, and \ndroughts indices) datasets (Google Inc., 2021).\
    \ Sig-\nnificant disparities are presented in the coverage, \nprocessing level\
    \ temporal, and spatial resolution, and \nquality of these datasets by which users\
    \ are aimed to \nunderstand the specific features of the dataset of in-\nterest.\
    \ Functionalities such as ready-to-use datasets, \nparallel processing, machine\
    \ learning, image and spe-\ncialized packages, and object-oriented programming\
    \ \n(Tamiminia et al., 2020), allow users to convert RS \ndatasets into excellent\
    \ end products.\nRS applications in agriculture: Irrigation traits\nEven though\
    \ there is a broad range of approaches \nto classify RS applications in agriculture\
    \ (Weiss et \nal., 2020), the most integral, suitable-for-farmers, \nand challenging\
    \ must be based on agricultural tasks \n(Sishodia et al., 2020). Taking advantage\
    \ of recent \nIoT and AI advances in agriculture (Singh et al., \n2021), an ideal\
    \ task-based approach could consist of: \nacceding RS data stored on the cloud\
    \ or download-\ning data from in-field RS platforms; processing data \nusing theoretical,\
    \ empirical or AI models by agrono-\nmists and RS experts (Huang et al., 2018);\
    \ uploading \nthe modeling results on the cloud to the end-user; \naccessing those\
    \ modeling results through a smart-\nphone app; and deciding how to improve the\
    \ task \nof interest comparing the modeling results with \n8\n ERAZO-MESA / ECHEVERRI-SÁNCHEZ\

    \ usage of RS in new \nscouting areas, soil survey, land designing and pre-\n\
    paring, seeding, irrigation (Tab. 2), drainage, fertil-\nization, weed and pest\
    \ management, and harvesting \nhas been appropriately documented (Sishodia et\
    \ al., \n2020; Weiss et al., 2020).\nDelving into the irrigation studies using\
    \ RS products, \nit can be inferred that most of them computed in-\nstantaneous\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET) and the basal \ncrop coefficient (Kcb) from optical\
    \ satellite imagery \nto manage the irrigation. In such studies (Tab. 2), ET \n\
    was estimated through surface energy balance mod-\nels (ALEXI, Dis-ALEXI, SEBAL,\
    \ TSEB, and METRIC) \nand Kcb was estimated by correlating vegetation in-\ndices\
    \ (NDVI) with theoretical or field Kcb measure-\nments. Furthermore, table 2 helps\
    \ to identify, as a \nfirst step, the suitable RS platform for several irriga-\n\
    tion traits. A study described a web-GIS-based deci-\nsion support systems required\
    \ to schedule irrigation \nbased on ET and Kcb (Calera et al., 2017). One of these\
    \ \nis IrriSAT (Hornbuckle et al., 2016), a web platform \nthat uses Landsat and\
    \ Sentinel optical satellite imag-\nery to estimate Kcb from NDVI values.\nDespite\
    \ the resolution-related advances described \npreviously, most notably in the\
    \ tropics, the following \nfactors hinder practical applications of RS-based IS\
    \ \nin crops: the high-resolution RS datasets required to \nschedule irrigation\
    \ at a plot scale (Calera et al., 2017) \ndo not have a high-frequent revisiting\
    \ time needed to \ndaily track the soil water depletion (Li and Roy, 2017); \n\
    the high-cloud coverage in the tropical hillslope areas \nevidenced for most of\
    \ the year (Prudente et al., 2020), \ndoes not provide cloud-free time series\
    \ pixels to com-\npute the irrigation parameters; although most stud-\nies in\
    \ table 3 did not include precipitation in water \nbalance, it has a critical\
    \ influence on the soil water \nbalance (SWB) throughout the year (Richter, 2016);\
    \ \nand some RS models required to compute ET such as \nMETRIC (Olmedo and de\
    \ la Fuente-Saiz, 2018), must \nbe calibrated with hourly climate data corresponding\
    \ \nto the area of interest.\nSoil moisture retrieval from SAR images\nThe soil\

    \ et al., 2014). Plants \ncan fulfill their growth cycle thanks to the water \n\
    regulation capacity exerted by soils. Measuring SMC \nto schedule irrigation allows\
    \ for the direct detection \nof cumulative and instantaneous water changes in\
    \ \nthe soil (Gu et al., 2020), and no other variable or IS \napproach offers\
    \ such flexibility. The lack of a wide \nspatial influence of proximal sensors’\
    \ punctual SMC \nreadings (Rodríguez et al., 2018) is outperformed by \nthe global\
    \ coverage offered by remote sensors (Gore-\nlick et al., 2017). Moreover, the\
    \ soil moisture can be \nretrieved through optical and radar satellite images\
    \ \n(Calera et al., 2017). As the optical images acquisition \nprocess is hampered\
    \ by the high cloud coverage in the \ntropics (Prudente et al., 2020) and highly\
    \ conditioned \nby target-surface-reflectance properties (Dorigo et \nal., 2015),\
    \ radar sensors can work 24 h a day while \nnot being affected by the atmospheric\

    \ (Schowengerdt, \n2007). Bidirectional emitted and reflected energy \npulses\
    \ (according to the electromagnetic theory) are \ndecomposed into horizontal (H)\
    \ and vertical (V) vec-\ntors, producing a set of co-polarized (VV or HH) and\
    \ \ncross-polarized (VH or HV) microwave bands (Parikh \net al., 2020). Multi-polarization\
    \ sensors (e.g., Radar-\nsat-2) can retrieve several polarized bands (Sinha et\
    \ \nal., 2018), and others do this in single bands.\nBy advancing the sensed surface\
    \ exposition time, syn-\nthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology has enhanced \n\
    the spatial resolution of images (Tempfli et al., 2009). \nSinghroy (2017) described\
    \ current and future radar \nsatellite platforms’ characteristics and affirmed\
    \ that \nsome publicly available SAR satellite projects like \nSentinel-1 by ESA,\
    \ AMSR-E, SMAP, and SMOS by \nNASA, among others, have been used for SMC esti-\n\
    mation (Sishodia et al., 2020). According to Peng et al. \n(2021), Sentinel-1\
    \ is currently the most sophisticated \nSAR platform to estimate SMC. In orbit\
    \ since April \n2014 and aimed to map the planet, this mission pro-\nvides radiometric\
    \ data in C-band. Its revisiting time \nin the tropics is 12 d with a spatial\
    \ resolution of 20 \nm (ESA, 2021). The Ground Range Detected (GRD) \nLevel 1\
    \ Sentinel-1 dataset is available on GEE and can \nbe fully accessed with name\
    \ collection ‘COPERNI-\nCUS/S1_GRD’ (Google Inc., 2021).\nThe energy intensity\
    \ captured by radar platforms de-\npends on sensor-related factors (e.g., polarization\
    \ and \nwavelength), the platform pathway (e.g., incidence \nangle and the trajectory\
    \ direction), and the large-and-\nshort-scale surface properties (Tempfli et al.,\
    \ 2009). \nSurface properties at large scales lead to terrain dis-\ntortions in\
    \ the capturing process, which must be cor-\nrected to effectively interpret on-ground\
    \ observations \n(Vollrath et al., 2020). On a short scale, the roughness \nand\
    \ dielectric properties and the surface coverage \ntype (bare soil or vegetation)\
    \ define the noise of the \nsignal (Reddy, 2018). To retrieve SMC, this noise\
    \ is \ntheoretically or empirically analyzed through back-\nscattering models\
    \ (BM) (Hoeben et al., 1997). More-\nover, machine learning (ML) and AI approaches\
    \ are \nfaster and simpler alternatives to conventional mod-\nels (Datta et al.,\
    \ 2020). Notably, the radar estimated \nSMC represents the amount of water in\
    \ the first 10 \ncm of the soil profile, which is perhaps its main limi-\ntation\
    \ (Peng et al., 2021). On bare soils, the integral \nequation method (IEM), advanced\
    \ integral equation \nmodel (AIEM), Dubois, and Oh are the most used BM \n(Choker\
    \ et al., 2017). The semi-empirical water cloud \nmodel is the most reported in\
    \ vegetation-covered \nsoils (Kweon and Oh, 2015). A comprehensive review \nof\
    \ BM for retrieving SMC is found in Karthikeyan et \nal. (Karthikeyan et al.,\
    \ 2017).\nLow spatial and temporal resolutions hinder practi-\ncal applications\
    \ of SAR images in agriculture (Peng \net al., 2021). Considering irrigators who\
    \ require near-\nreal-time data availability to trigger, for instance, \nirrigation\
    \ events and finer spatial resolution (com-\npared to the unit management) to\
    \ differentiate the \nwater amount and timing by plot, radar images must \nbe\
    \ carefully used. However, studies in irrigation de-\ntection and water volume\
    \ estimation have been \nreported. Brocca et al. (2018) used SMAP, SMOS, \nASCAT,\
    \ and AMSR2 radar mission data (~12.5 km \nfor the finer spatial resolution and\
    \ a daily revisiting \nfrequency being the most common) to estimate the \nirrigation\
    \ water amount through the SM2RAIN al-\ngorithm. They validated their results\
    \ in nine areas of \nthe United States, Europe, Australia, and Africa and \nfound\
    \ a good correlation between the monthly irriga-\ntion amount radar estimates\
    \ and field measurements. \nIn this regard, Jalilvand et al. (2019) retrieved\
    \ SMC \nfrom AMSR2 data (daily revisiting time and ~25 km \nof spatial resolution)\
    \ by using the SM2RAIN algo-\nrithm in the Miandoab Plain (Iran). The radar SMC\
    \ \nestimates performed by authors followed the tempo-\nral soil water dynamics,\
    \ overestimating the amount \nof water needed for irrigation.\nOn the other hand,\
    \ Le Page et al. (2020) successfully \ndetected irrigation timing in six maize\
    \ plots (south-\nwest France), analyzing direction changes of the SMC \ntime series\
    \ retrieved through Sentinel-1 observations. \nThey recommended using SAR images\
    \ with revisit-\ning times of 2 to 4 days (d) to manage the irrigation. \nConsistent\
    \ with the study above, Bazzi et al. (2020) \nretrieved SMC from Sentinel-1 data\
    \ using the irriga-\ntion detection BM (IDM) to detect near-real-time ir-\nrigation\
    \ events in 46 intensively irrigated grassland \nplots in Crau Plain (France).\
    \ The novel IDM operates \nat grid (10 x 10 km) and plot scales to discriminate\
    \ \nchanges in the Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficient \nσ0 due to precipitation\
    \ and irrigation, respectively. \nIrrigation events were accurately detected by\
    \ this \nmethod. In addition, Lawston et al. (2017) compared \nthe efficiency\
    \ of five low-spatial-resolution SMC \nproducts (SMAP at 1 km and 9 km, SMOS at\
    \ 1 km, \nASCAT at 12.5 km, and Sentinel-1 at 1 km of spa-\ntial resolution) to\

    Applications comparison\nAlthough it is demonstrated that using precision irri-\n\
    gation technologies significantly improves irrigation \nmanagement (Abioye et\
    \ al., 2020), most irrigators, \ninstead of scheduling irrigation using these\
    \ technolo-\ngies (Khabba et al., 2013; Vellidis et al., 2016), irrigat-\ning\
    \ empirically based on external variables such as \nwater and personnel and infrastructure\
    \ availability, \ncrop water deficit signs, and commercial trends. Mul-\ntiple\
    \ causes explain why irrigators do not implement \nnew irrigation technologies\
    \ (Abdullah and Samah, \n2013; Mottaleb, 2018). Irrigation scheduling deci-\n\
    sion-support applications such as smartphone apps, \nweb-based platforms, and\
    \ desktop programs bridge \nthe existing timing and water-related knowledge gap\
    \ \nin irrigation methods (Migliaccio et al., 2016). Thou-\nsands of valuable\
    \ irrigation-related data can currently \nbe retrieved in a publicly available\
    \ and near-real-time \nmanner through online applications. Unfortunately, \nthe\
    \ poor internet connection in worldwide rural \nzones impedes their use (Chiaraviglio\
    \ et al., 2017).\nAn extended and diverse ecosystem of applications to \nschedule\
    \ irrigation is found on the web, as intended \nfor various crops, farming organizations,\
    \ commercial \nand research interests, output targets, available input \ndata,\
    \ and development levels. A small sample is char-\nacterized in table 3, taken\
    \ from studies (in journal \nindexes) that reported their use and irrigation com-\n\
    panies’ catalogs on the web. According to the listed \nIS applications developers,\
    \ primary motivations to \nbuild these are set out to provide farmers with an\
    \ \neasy-to-use tool to support irrigation management \ndecisions, saving water\
    \ irrigation, and optimizing \nthe water productivity of selected crops. IS applica-\n\
    tions are structured into the core engine, where the \nIS model is allocated;\
    \ the database, where input, an-\ncillary, and output data are hosted; and the\
    \ graphical \ninterface, where users interact with the application.\nApps boast\
    \ user-friendly, geo-location, graphical, \nintuitive, free-access, and tactile\
    \ front ends, but \nlack robust-IS-model back-ends. Many of them are \ndeveloped\
    \ for both iPhone (iOS) and Android oper-\nating systems. Web-based platforms,\
    \ as depicted in \ntable 3, are designed to store and accede to available \n(e.g.,\
    \ remote sensing RS) data on the cloud (as sym-\nbolized in the available data\
    \ and IS approach columns \nin table 3 with ), which can be processed, retrieved,\
    \ \nand interpreted easily by farmers. These platforms \nrun on web browsers where\
    \ users must always log \nin to access their services thus avoiding inter-opera-\n\
    tive system obstacles. Desktop programs are boosted \nby the robustness, stability,\
    \ and offline advantages \nof desktop computers to implement SWB complex \nmodels.\
    \ However, the high and specialized knowl-\nedge required to operate them commonly\
    \ exceeds \nfarmers’ abilities, and thus these programs must be \nmanaged by agronomists,\
    \ who as a result occasion-\nally assist farmers in the field. As a result, desktop\
    \ \nprograms lack enough portability to support farmers’ \nin-field decisions.\n\
    The main strength of multi-platform applications is \ntheir responsive web design,\
    \ which easily overcomes \nthe agronomist-farmer problem described previously.\
    \ \nMoreover, users with administrator, agronomist, or \nfarmer roles can monitor\
    \ real-time PS devices and feed \nthese applications with data. A flaw associated\
    \ with \napps, web-based, and multi-platforms is their online \ndependency since\
    \ rural zones lack a stable internet \nconnection. Being state-of-art and portable\
    \ and offer-\ning client support, commercial applications are more \nbeneficial\
    \ than free access applications (symbolized \nin table 3 with ). Farmers who\
    \ need to choose the \nright IS application undertake a complex task because \n\
    of the enormous number of variables to consider.\nApps\nFirst attempts to deal\
    \ with irrigation traits through \nmobile appliances were made through PDA and\
    \ PC \npockets (Hornbuckle et al., 2006; Molina-Martínez \nand Ruiz-Canales, 2009),\
    \ equipped with a GPS sen-\nsor, a tactile screen, a camera, and an operating\
    \ sys-\ntem. The irrigation software was then externally \nprogrammed in LabView,\
    \ Visual Basic, Java or C, and \ninstalled on these devices. Early efforts to\
    \ remotely \ncontrol the irrigation through smartphones were \naccomplished by\
    \ wiring PS devices in the field to a \ncentral unit, processing PS readings,\
    \ and triggering ir-\nrigation event once the SMP threshold was reached \n(Fernández\
    \ et al., 2008). All these strives were made \nin parallel with Android and iOS\
    \ projects launched \nbetween 2005-2009 (Islam and Want, 2014), and the \n12\n\
    \ ERAZO-MESA / ECHEVERRI-SÁNCHEZ / RAMÍREZ-GIL\nRev. Colomb. Cienc. Hortic.\n\
    mobile applications were trending in the agriculture \nfield in this same period.\
    \ Regarding the studies men-\ntioned above, the most limiting factors to achieving\
    \ \na whole operative irrigation system via the available \nsmartphone apps were\
    \ the lack of operational wire-\nless PS infield networks, which made it challeng-\n\
    ing to monitor broad areas; the limited battery life, \nmemory, and storage resources;\
    \ and the expensive \nimplementation.\nBetween 2010 and 2019, various studies\
    \ demonstrat-\ned how apps were used and evaluated in-field prac-\ntices, highlighting\
    \ their valuable support to farmers \n(Hamad et al., 2018). Authors as Dehnen-Schmutz\
    \ \net al. (2016) reported that although most farmers \nowned a smartphone, more\
    \ than one-third of those \ninterviewed did not use any agriculture app. In ad-\n\
    dition, Pongnumkul et al. (2015) described the use \nof apps in agriculture in\
    \ 2010-2014, underlining GPS \nand cameras as the most-used smartphone sensors\
    \ \nfor various agricultural tasks. Meanwhile, Kaewmard \nand Saiyod (Kaewmard\
    \ and Saiyod, 2014) designed \nan automatic irrigation system and tested its start-\n\
    stop irrigation signal transmission’s accuracy, finding \nan accuracy greater\
    \ than 95%. Taking advantage of \navailable real-time data from weather networks\
    \ in \nGeorgia and Florida, the United States, Migliaccio et \nal. (2016) developed\

    \ other IS methods, Vellidis and others (Velli-\ndis et al., 2016) found that\
    \ after using Cotton App to \nschedule irrigation, the cotton yield was significantly\
    \ \nhigher in the 2013 and 2014 seasons and higher in the \n2015 season, and the\
    \ water use efficiency (WUE) was \nhigher in the 2013 and 2014 seasons.\nThe IS\
    \ smartphone app used by the avocado growers \ndetailed above goes by the name\
    \ Smartirrigation Avo-\ncado and can be found in the Google Play and Apple \n\
    App Stores (Migliaccio et al., 2016). This app requires \ninput parameters such\
    \ as the irrigation system, the \ncrop, the soil type, and IS characteristics\
    \ to output \nthe accumulated precipitation for the seven previous \ndays, the\
    \ applied irrigation events timing, and the \nreached moisture depth. Each day,\
    \ Smartirrigation \nAvocado shows the irrigation events required for the \nnext\
    \ 15 d, based on the five-previous-day crop evapo-\ntranspiration, as computed\
    \ using nearby-station \nweather data from the Florida Automated Weather \nNetwork.\
    \ Irrigation doses change throughout the \ncrop seasons according to Kc of 0.6,\
    \ 0.8, 0.7, 1.0, and \n0.7 to dormancy, flower bud development, flowering \nand\
    \ fruit set, fruit growth, and after harvest. Mba-\nbazi et al. (2017) compared\
    \ the IS provided by this \napp with SWB field observations and found that the\
    \ \ndrainage, irrigation depth, and wetted area simulated \nerrors were not significant.\
    \ Mbabazi et al. (2017) de-\ntermined that using Smartirrigation Avocado could\
    \ \nreduce the irrigation water used for the crop between \n62 to 67% moistening\
    \ the first 12.7 mm of the soil \ndepth by any given event, compared with irrigating\
    \ \nthree times per week.\nRecently, other IS apps have been developed for toma-\n\
    to (Miller et al., 2018) and grains crops (Freebairn et \nal., 2018), exploiting\
    \ artificial intelligence techniques \n(Ferreira et al., 2020), reading soil matric\
    \ potential \ndevices (UNL, 2019), and integrating IS data to IoT \nenvironments\
    \ (Sales et al., 2020). After validating in \nfield conditions, authors of the\
    \ three first apps men-\ntioned above concluded IS apps do reliably estimate \n\
    the soil water dynamic and positively impact WUE. \nMoreover, other authors compared\
    \ IS apps features \nand found the most common were Map View, farm \ndivisions\
    \ (plots), and irrigation planning (Sales et al., \n2020). In line with the agriculture\
    \ 4.0 concept, IoT \nand smartphones will lead the progressive transfor-\nmation\
    \ of irrigation technology toward irrigation 4.0 \nas the direct connection between\
    \ farmers and irriga-\ntion systems (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019; da Silva \net\
    \ al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Therefore, there is enough \nsustained evidence\
    \ to affirmatively respond the ques-\ntion put forward of whether crops can be\
    \ watered by \nour phones (Puértolas et al., 2019).\nCONCLUSIONS\nTraditional\
    \ irrigation scheduling methods have been \ninvariantly reported in Hass avocado\
    \ irrigation dedi-\ncated studies for decades. Soil water balance and \nsoil-based\
    \ sensors such as tensiometers and granular \nmatrix sensors are the most mature\
    \ methods. Fortu-\nnately, new digital agriculture technologies are chang-\ning\
    \ how such methods and their data are controlled \nin the field and handled, respectively,\
    \ boosting the \ndecision-making process toward increasing water use \nefficiency\
    \ and the fruit quality parameters and reduc-\ning the amount of water used for\
    \ Hass avocado crop. \nAlthough remote sensing technologies are no being \nwidely\
    \ used in the Hass avocado crop irrigation, radar \nimages stand out above optical\
    \ images because the \nsurface soil moisture, their specific product to sched-\n\
    ule irrigation, can be retrieved in acceptable periods, \navoiding the high cloud\
    \ coverage problem presented \nby optical images in tropics. Avocado dedicated\
    \ ap-\nplications represent a trustful tool for Hass avocado \ngrowers to irrigate\
    \ their orchards technically.  Inte-\ngrating remote and proximal sensing technologies\
    \ \nthrough user-friendly applications can represent a \nsuitable option to improve\
    \ Hass avocado irrigation in \ndeveloping countries.\nConflict of interests: The\

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Evapotranspiration can be used to estimate the amount
    of water required by agriculture projects and green spaces, playing a key role
    in water management policies that combat the hydrological drought, which assumes
    a structural character in many countries. In this context, this work presents
    a study on reference evapotranspiration ( E T o ) estimation models, having as
    input a limited set of meteorological parameters, namely: temperature, humidity,
    and wind. Since solar radiation (SR) is an important parameter in the determination
    of E T o , SR estimation models are also developed. These E T o and SR estimation
    models compare the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short Term Memory
    (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and hybrid
    neural network models such as LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, and GRU-ANN. Two main approaches
    were taken for E T o estimation: (i) directly use those algorithms to estimate
    E T o , and (ii) estimate solar radiation first and then use that estimation together
    with other meteorological parameters in a method that predicts E T o . For the
    latter case, two variants were implemented: the use of the estimated solar radiation
    as (ii.1) a feature of the neural network regressors, and (ii.2) the use of the
    Penman-Monteith method (a.k.a. FAO-56PM method, adopted by the United Nations
    Food and Agriculture Organization) to compute E T o , which has solar radiation
    as one of the input parameters. Using experimental data collected from a weather
    station (WS) located in Vale do Lobo (Portugal), the later approach achieved the
    best result with a coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 0.977. The developed
    model was then applied to data from eleven stations located in Colorado (USA),
    with very distinct climatic conditions, showing similar results to the ones for
    which the models were initially designed ( R 2 >0.95 ), proving a good generalization.

    A known strategy, to make a water efficient irrigation system, is to rely on soil
    humidity sensors and keep the humidity levels between the field capacity (FC)
    and the management allowable depletion (MAD), which is a percentage of the available
    soil water holding capacity [1]. Apart from components, installation, and management
    costs associated to the implementation of such systems on public green space,
    other problems are common such as vandalism or theft, since normally there is
    no comprehensive security or surveillance in such locations. Further, the available
    water holding capacity changes significantly with soil type [2], requiring that
    for each specific soil, in order to determine the soil humidity values corresponding
    to the field capacity and wilting point (WP), samples would need to be sent to
    a laboratory for analyses. Crop evapotranspiration ( E T c ), also known as crop
    water use, is the water that is used by a crop [3]. The Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) recommends using the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-56PM)
    formula as a reference method for computing reference evapotranspiration ( E T
    o ) [4], being E T c and E T o related by a crop coefficient ( K c ). FAO56-PM
    formula uses four main meteorological parameters: temperature, humidity, wind,
    and solar radiation (SR). In this context, several computational studies show
    that SR is the main driver of E T o [5], however, its measurement requires sensors
    like pyranometers, which are typically associated with expensive WSs, that need
    to be properly maintained and calibrated [6]. Also, solar radiation forecast application
    programming interfaces (APIs) are not common (at least freely) and present a high
    system cost penalty. As part of a framework for the computation of optimal crop
    water irrigation scheduling requirements (with special emphasis to green spaces),
    this paper presents the computational models being prepared to estimate the E
    T o using machine learning, deep learning, acquired intelligence, meteorological
    data from WSs on the field, as well as meteorological data and forecasts from
    APIs available on the internet. This will optimize water and energy expenditure,
    improve the well-being of the crop, reduce reaction time in solving problems,
    improve anomalies detection methods, and maintain the quality of green spaces.
    Concisely, the framework being developed will be an intelligent irrigation solution,
    technologically differentiated from other platforms on the market. The development
    of the full framework is being done under project GSSIC – Green Spaces SMART Irrigation
    Control. In short, this study compares several E T o and SR estimation models
    that use Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated
    Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and hybrid neural network
    models such as LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN and GRU-ANN. Two approaches were taken for E
    T o ’s estimation: (i) directly use those machine learning models to estimate
    it and (ii) first estimate solar radiation, and then use the obtained value and
    other meteorological parameters in a method that predicts E T o . Furthermore,
    for the latter case, two variants were addressed, namely: the use of the estimated
    SR as (ii.1) a feature of a neural network regressor, and (ii.2) the use of FAO-56PM
    method to compute E T o , which has SR as one of the input parameters. Figure
    1 schematizes what we have just detailed. FIGURE 1. Workflow for the developed
    approaches: E T o estimation models without SR and limited set of features, solar
    radiation estimation models with a limited set of features, and E T o computation
    based on estimated solar radiation as an input to another neural network model
    or to FAO56-PM formula. Show All Using experimental data collected from a WS located
    in Vale do Lobo, south Portugal, approach (ii.2) achieved the best result with
    a coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 0.977, improving results previously
    achieved in [7]. The quality and generalization of the proposed models was then
    tested using 11 weather stations of the Colorado Agricultural Meteorological Network
    (CoAgMET), which is composed of automatic weather stations distributed across
    the state of Colorado, USA. The selected weather stations have data available
    starting from August 1992, which comprises almost 30 years of data. Also, with
    temperatures ranging from −39.06 to 44.26 degrees Celsius (°C), they represent
    different climatic conditions than the Mediterranean’s Vale do Lobo WS. This allows
    the assessment of model performance under different climate conditions, and for
    a longer period of historical data. The achieved metrics values, when comparable
    with the ones from other authors, showed that our proposal has in general a better
    performance in the analysed metrics, besides presenting alternatives to most of
    the existing models, namely through the use of recurrent neural networks and hybrid
    methods. The latter model is even more unusual in this category of studies, being
    by itself another evolution to the state of the art. The paper is structured as
    follows. The next section presents the problem’s background and the methodologies
    used by others to tackle the problem in study. Section III starts by detailing
    the computational setup and exploring the dataset, followed by section III-B where
    the proposed neural network architectures, hyperparameters, and overall training
    approach is presented. Then, on section III-C the proposed models and associated
    performance analysis is weighed. Section IV presents the results for the 11 CoAgMET
    agricultural weather stations. Finally, the last section presents the conclusion
    and establishes some future work. SECTION II. Reference Evapotranspiration Problematic
    and Known Solutions Reference evapotranspiration, E T o , is the evapotranspiration
    of a reference surface, defined as hypothetical grass with a uniform height of
    0.12 m, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m −1 , and an albedo (reflection coefficient)
    of 0.23 [4]. Besides, crop evapotranspiration, E T c , represents the crop’s water
    requirements and is proportional to reference evapotranspiration by means of the
    crop coefficient, K c [4]. Therefore, E T o prediction plays an important role,
    making it one of the fundamental parameters for smart irrigation scheduling, since
    it is proportional to the amount of water that needs to be restored during the
    irrigation period [8]. Some of the main characteristics that distinguish E T c
    from E T o are (i) the crop cover density and total leaf area, (ii) the resistance
    of foliage epidermis and soil surface to the flow of water vapor, (iii) the aerodynamic
    roughness of the crop canopy, and (iv) the reflectance of the crop and soil surface
    to short wave radiation [9]. In this context, known the value of K c , the E T
    c value for a specific time period can be estimated by E T c = K c E T o . (1)
    View Source The crop coefficient can be simple or have two components, one representing
    the basal crop coefficient ( K cb ) and another representing the soil surface
    evaporation component ( K e ), being computed by K c = K s K cb + K e , (2) View
    Source where K s ∈[0,1] is used to introduce a K c reduction in cases of environmental
    stresses, such as lack of soil water or soil salinity [9]. So, it becomes clear
    that in order to make crop water requirement predictions, accurate estimation
    of E T o is required. Historically, several deterministic methods have been developed
    to estimate reference evapotranspiration using single or limited weather parameters
    and being generally categorized as: temperature, radiation, or combination based.
    For example, temperature based methods include Thorntwait [10], Blaney-Criddle
    [11], and Hargreaves and Samani [12] formulas; radiation methods include Priestley-Taylor
    [13] and Makkink [14] formulas; and combination methods, requiring both temperature
    and radiation, include Penman [15], modified Penman [16], and FAO-56 Penman-Monteith
    (FAO56-PM) [4] formulas. Shahidian et al. [6] give an overview of several of these
    methods and compare their performance under different climate conditions. The
    authors concluded that, when applied to climates different from those on which
    the methods were developed and tested, most of them yield a poor performance and
    may require the adjustment of empirical coefficients to accommodate to local climate
    conditions, which is not ideal. FAO recommends the use of the FAO-56PM formula
    as a reference method for estimating E T o [4]. To give a deeper idea of the involved
    parameters, measured in millimeters per day [ mm/day ], the formula to estimate
    E T o is given by E T o = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900 T+273 u 2 ( e s − e a ) Δ+γ(1+0.34
    u 2 ) , (3) View Source where R n is the net radiation at crop surface [ MJ m
    −2 da y −1 ], G is the soil heat flux density [ MJ m −2 da y −1 ], T is the air
    temperature at 2 m height [ o C ], u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height [ m s −1
    ], e s is the saturation vapor pressure [ kPa ], e a is the actual vapor pressure
    [ kPa ], e s − e a is the saturation vapor pressure deficit [ kPa ], Δ is the
    slope vapor pressure curve [ kP a o C −1 ], and γ is the psychrometric constant
    [ kP a o C −1 ]. Being based on physical principles, the formula has become widely
    adopted as a standard for E T o computation since it performs well under different
    climate types [6]. However, to compute E T o using FAO56-PM the following main
    meteorological parameters are required: temperature, solar radiation, relative
    humidity, and wind speed. The remaining meteorological parameters are constants
    being derived from latitude and elevation above sea level. Except for solar radiation,
    all parameters (real or estimated) required by the FAO56-PM formula for E T o
    ’s computation, can be freely obtained from common weather forecast APIs. Solar
    radiation forecasting APIs are, currently, not common and the ones available present
    a high-cost penalty. Therefore, a major asset would be to (i) develop alternative
    methods for E T o estimation using limited meteorological parameters, that do
    not require solar radiation and are compatible with the weather parameters obtained
    by freely available weather forecast and historical weather data APIs, and/or
    (ii) to estimate the solar radiation itself and use it as an approximation on
    the solar radiation dependent methods. This is also important since in most situations
    a proper functioning, maintained, and calibrated WS, with solar radiation measurement
    capability, is not close to the area of interest. Recently, as an alternative,
    several authors have used machine and deep learning to estimate E T o , being
    that, as stated by Chia et al. [17], machine learning has proved itself to be
    a promising solution for E T o estimation with the common meteorological data.
    For instance, using data collected in Central Florida, a humid subtropical climate,
    Granata [18] compared three different evapotranspiration models which differ in
    the input variables. In their work, four variants of machine learning algorithms
    were applied to each model, namely: M5P Regression Tree, Bagging, Random Forest,
    and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Their best results are achieved using M5P Regression
    Tree and Bagging with a coefficient of determination of 0.987 and a mean absolute
    error of 0.14 mm/day (see the metrics definition in Sec. III-A). However, among
    other features, all models included as input variable the net solar radiation.
    The same author also studied three recurrent neural network-based models for the
    prediction of short term ahead evapotranspiration [19]. Two variants of each model
    were developed, selecting the employed algorithm between LSTM and nonlinear autoregressive
    network with exogenous inputs (NARX). The prediction models were trained and tested
    using data from two sites with different climates: Cypress Swamp, southern Florida,
    and Kobeh Valley, central Nevada. With reference to the subtropical climatic conditions
    of South Florida, LSTM models proved to be more accurate than NARX models, while
    some exogenous variables such as sensible heat flux and relative humidity did
    not affect the results significantly. Wu and Fan [20] evaluated eight machine
    learning algorithms divided in four classes: neuron based (MLP – Multilayer Perceptron,
    GRNN – General Regression Neural Network, and ANFIS – Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy
    Inference System), kernel-based (SVM, KNEA – Kernel-based Non Linear Extension
    of Arps decline model), tree-based (M5Tree – M5 model tree, Extreme Gradient Boosting
    – XGBoost), and curve based (MARS – Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline).
    The methods were applied to data collected from 14 WSs in various climatic regions
    of China and used only temperature or temperature and precipitation as input to
    the models. Ferreira et al. [8] used six alternative empirical reduced-set equations,
    such as Hargreaves and Samani [12], and compared the estimated values with the
    ones from an ANN and a SVM model. Data was collected from 203 WSs and used for
    daily E T o estimation for the entirety of Brazil. Temperature or temperature
    and humidity were used as input features. They concluded that, in general, ANN
    was the best performing model when including, as input features, data from up
    to four previous days. With the best algorithms reaching an R 2 median value around
    0.80 considering all stations, results were weighed good given that only temperature
    or temperature and humidity were used as input. Keshtegar et al. [21] used high-order
    response surface method to compute E T o . They included daily weather information
    which include the maximum temperature, maximum humidity, wind speed, solar radiation,
    and vapor pressure deficit, obtained from three observation stations in Burkina
    Faso, West Africa. Ten models were evaluated with the determination coefficient
    ( R 2 ) and root-mean-square error values ranging between 0.2068 and 0.9966 and
    between 0.7237 and 0.9948, respectively. However, one of the used features is
    solar radiation, which is not always easy to obtain for most of the locations.
    Muhammad et al. [22] studied the implementation of evolutionary computing models,
    namely the gene expression programming (GEP), for the simulation of daily E T
    o in different locations of Peninsular Malaysia. The models used various input
    combinations of meteorological variables including air temperature (mean, maximum,
    and minimum), relative humidity, solar radiation, and mean wind speed. Compared
    to other black box artificial intelligence algorithms, the authors’ alleged major
    advantage of GEP is that it provides a set of equations that can be used by practitioners
    for reliable estimation of E T o at the field, with fewer meteorological variables
    and, thus, can have wide applicability in water resources management. As in the
    previous case, the model also requires the use of solar radiation with the already
    mentioned drawback. Khosravi et al. [23] studied nine models, including five data
    mining algorithms and four adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, for their ability
    to predict E T o at meteorological stations in Baghdad and Mosul, Iraq. As parameters
    for the models, they considered wind speed, sunshine hours, rainfall, maximum
    and minimum temperature, and relative humidity. Investigations on the modeling
    accuracy with different input parameter combinations showed that no single input
    combination showed a consistent modeling outcome. Moreover, hybrid models showed
    a higher predictive power than the individual models. A large part of the result
    shown had R 2 value around 0.9, with the best one achieving 0.951 for one station
    and 0.97 for the other. The geographical robustness of various inter-model ensembles
    in estimating daily E T o was assessed in [17]. The study aimed to develop inter-model
    ensembles that consist of ANN, support vector regressors, ANFIS via Bayesian modeling
    approach, and the non-linear neural ensemble, trained for different meteorological
    stations with differential geographical characteristics in the Peninsular Malaysia.
    This work allowed to infer some aspects of the effect of the geographical characteristics
    on the performance of inter-model ensembles and examine the effect of data management
    strategies applied to solve the data-hungry issue (both qualitative and quantitative)
    of inter-model ensembles. Sanikhani et al. [24] explore 6 artificial intelligence
    models for modeling E T o using minimum and maximum temperatures of the air and
    extraterrestrial radiation. The models include MLP, GRNN, radial basis neural
    networks (RBNN), integrated adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems with grid partitioning
    and subtractive clustering (ANFIS-GP and ANFIS-SC), and GEP. The Hargreaves–Samani
    equation and its calibrated version were used to perform a verification analysis
    of the established models. In the best cases, results show R 2 values around 0.95.
    In [25], Chen et al. study the estimation of daily reference evapotranspiration
    using three deep learning models (namely, deep neural network – DNN, temporal
    convolution neural network – TCN, and LSTM neural network). The performance of
    the three models was compared with the results of an SVM algorithm, a random forest
    algorithm, and empirical equations like Hargreaves and modified Hargreaves(temperature-based),
    Ritchie, Priestley-Talor, and Makkink (radiation-based), and Romanenko and Schendel
    (humidity-based) empirical models. Several other works can be found in the literature
    [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], which vary the number and type
    of features, estimation models etc. Vaz et al. [7] used data from a Vale do Lobo
    WS, in south Portugal, and explored the use of machine learning for E T o estimation.
    They concluded that instead of directly estimating E T o , the best result was
    obtained by using machine learning for SR estimation, having as input a limited
    set of meteorological features, and then use that result together with temperature,
    humidity and wind speed as input to the FAO56-PM equation, achieving an R 2 of
    0.975, a MAE of 0.18 mm/day , and a MAPE of 5.51 %. The work here presented explores
    and develops deep learning based E T o prediction models, supported on the same
    data, improving the previous results, as it will be detailed in the next sections.
    Furthermore, the proposed models are applied to 11 other WS stations maintaining,
    without further hyperparameter tuning, similar performance in terms of attained
    metrics values. So, based on a set of features generally available in public WS,
    which do not include solar radiation, our solution produces a stable set of results
    for different weather environments presenting a state-of-the-art methodology.
    SECTION III. Proposed Models A. Experimental Setup and Dataset As a general introduction
    to the computational environment, this work was conducted using Python v3.9.7,
    Numpy v1.21.4 [34], Pandas v1.3.4 [35], [36], Tensor Flow v2.6.0 [37], Keras 2.6.0
    [38], Scikit-learn v1.0.1 [39], and PyET v1.1.0 [40]. The Pandas library was used
    for data analysis and manipulation, PyET to compute the reference evapotranspiration
    using the FAO56-PM method, Scikit-learn is a python machine learning framework
    that includes data preprocessing, model selection, and model metrics evaluation
    tools. Keras runs on top of Tensor Flow, and all neural network models here presented
    were developed using it. Finally, all computation was done on a 2020 MacBook Air
    with an Apple M1 SoC chip and 16 GB of RAM, running MacOS Big Sur v11.6.4. Data
    from Vale do Lobo WS, in south Portugal, was collected starting from February
    2019 up to and including September 2021. The WS is composed of sensors from Davis
    Instruments, where the following weather parameters are measured periodically
    throughout the day and stored with a daily resolution: temperature (minimum, maximum,
    and average), dew point (minimum, maximum, and average), relative humidity (minimum,
    maximum, and average), solar radiation (maximum and average), wind speed (minimum,
    maximum, and average), wind direction, atmospheric pressure (minimum, maximum,
    and average), rain intensity, and precipitation. This is the same dataset previously
    used by Vaz et al. [7], where the use of machine learning algorithms was explored
    to create E T o and SR estimation models. A ratio of 75 % to 25 % of train and
    test data was used, respectively, resulting in train data starting from February
    1st, 2019 up to February 3rd, 2021, and test data from February 4th, 2021 up to
    September 30th, 2021. Being a time series, no shuffling was made to the train
    and test data, and the train data was further divided into 10 folders, used to
    implement time series cross validation [41]. Furthermore, a hyperparameter grid
    search strategy was used to tune the proposed machine/deep learning methods, as
    will be presented in the corresponding sections. For model statistical evaluation
    and performance comparison, the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage
    error (MAPE), the mean square error (MSE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE),
    and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) were used [42]. Just to recall, considering
    y t the actual value and y t ^ the estimated value at instants t=1,2,…,n , and
    y ¯ ¯ ¯ the mean value of the actual samples, the evaluation metrics are defined
    as MAE= MAPE= MSE= RMSE= 1 n ∑ t=1 n | y t − y t ^ |, 1 n ∑ t=1 n ∣ ∣ ∣ y t −
    y t ^ y t ∣ ∣ ∣ ×100%, 1 n ∑ t=1 n ( y t − y t ^ ) 2 , MSE − − − − − √ , (4) (5)
    (6) (7) View Source and R 2 =1− ∑ n t=1 ( y t − y t ^ ) 2 ∑ n t=1 ( y t − y ¯
    ¯ ¯ ) 2 , (8) View Source In this set of metrics, the MAE measures the average
    of the absolute residuals in the original unit and the MAPE measures the average
    absolute percent error. The MSE represents the average of the squared difference
    between the original and predicted values in the data set, measuring the variance
    of the residuals in the squared unit of the original data, which can be returned
    to the original unit by computing the RMSE (the standard deviation of residuals).
    Finally, R 2 represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable,
    which is explained by the linear regression model, being a scale-free score. While
    values should be near to zero for the MAE, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE, they should be
    near to 1 for the R 2 metric. Depending on the regression problem in study ( E
    T o vs. SR), two targets were considered: (i) E T o was computed using the FAO56-PM
    formula, as per Eq. (3), and using as input the data measured by the already referred
    WS, namely temperature, humidity, wind speed and solar radiation (see Sec. III-C1,
    III-C3, and III-C4); and (ii) the average solar radiation measured by the WS was
    used as SR target (see Sec. III-C2). B. Neural Network Models’ Architecture The
    following neural network types were used for the conduction of this work: ANN,
    LSTM [43], GRU [44], and Artificial RNN [45], as well as hybrid models like LSTM-ANN,
    RNN-ANN, and GRU-ANN. Artificial neural networks typically have an input layer,
    one or more hidden layers, and one output layer. The input layer dimension is
    defined by the number of inputs to the model, i.e., the number of features that
    are used on a particular model. Hidden layers are internal layers that can vary
    in quantity and number of neurons. The output layer can have one or more neurons,
    depending on the number of outputs a model has. Artificial neurons are activated
    using activation functions, which have an important role on the performance of
    neural networks, since they provide the non-linearity that is needed to learn
    a complex problem [46]. During the conduction of this work, Rectified Linear Unit
    (ReLU), Tangent Hyperbolic Function (Tanh) and Sigmoid activation functions were
    tested, however ReLU always yielded better results, being therefore fixed [47].
    LSTM, GRU, and RNN algorithms are deep learning methods that, unlike feed-forward
    neural networks, implement feedback connections. These feedback connections provide
    the ability to add memory to the models, making its use justified through the
    fact that the dataset (and target) is a time series, where some patterns might
    be cyclic or information from the previous days might play an important role [43],
    [44], [45]. Furthermore, in the work presented by Vaz et al. [7], for the same
    problem and dataset here in study (using limited weather parameters as input features),
    several machine learning regression models were compared in their performance,
    namely: Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso, k -Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
    Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest (RF). Since Random Forest [48], [49]
    gave the best results for E T o and SR estimation models, RF will also be evaluated,
    so that the proposed neural network based models can be directly compared with
    other top performing methods. Systematic testing (varying the number of neurons
    in powers of 2) allowed us to set the non-hybrid models to have two hidden layers:
    the first one consisting of 512 neurons, followed by a second layer that has 32
    neurons, represented as having [512, 32] neurons. This configuration consistently
    gave the best results, being observed that augmenting the number of layers and/or
    neurons of the neural network would not increase model performance, while reducing
    would impact on model’s performance. Following the same arrangement, allowed us
    to decide the hybrid models’ architecture (namely, LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, and GRU-ANN).
    In this case, to balance the training computational requirements and the models’
    performance, it was decided to use four hidden layers. E.g., as depicted in Fig.
    2, the LSTM-ANN model has the first two hidden layers consisting of [32, 64] neurons
    of LSTM type, followed by two more layers of [64, 32] neurons of a fully connected
    ANN. The RNN-ANN and GRU-ANN models are similar, being all represented as having
    [32, 64; 64, 32] neurons. Also, as can be seen in Fig. 2, between each layer there
    is the possibility of using dropout regularization. FIGURE 2. LSTM-ANN neural
    network architecture. Show All Solver, loss function, and hyperparameters like
    learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size play an important role on model
    training and performance [50]. For all models, the Adam optimizer [51] was selected
    as a solver, mean squared error (MSE) was used as the loss function, kernel initialization
    was done using the Glorot normal initialization [52], and the number of epochs
    was set to a high value of 1000, however, early stopping was used, with a patience
    value set to 150. Dropout regularization [53] was applied during training and
    its value was selected using grid search with values ranging from 0.0 up to 0.6,
    in 0.1 steps. During initial model development and training, the batch size was
    also selected using a grid search approach, with a range from 64 up to 256, in
    multiples of 32. However, a batch size of 128 always gave a good and consistent
    result, so later it was fixed to 128 for all models, reducing models training
    time. Input features were normalized to values between 0 and 1. Finally, max norm
    weight constraint was applied, and its value was grid searched between 1 and 4,
    in steps of one. It should also be noticed that time lag was introduced on all
    models, i.e., data from the previous days was introduced as an input feature together
    with current day data. In this case, time lags from 1 up to 10 days were tested,
    however it brought no improvement on models performance. In this experimental
    context, attempts of introducing new features through the use of polynomial features
    and features inverse were also made, but did not present any further improvement
    in models’ metrics and, as such, it is not presented here. In appendix, Tables
    5 and 6 summarize the tested and tuned hyperparameters, respectively, for each
    of the proposed models. TABLE 1 Comparison of Several Regression Methods for E

    Used in the Grid Search Procedure TABLE 6 Tuned Hyperparameters C. Estimation
    Using ANN Methods With a Limited Set of Features Solar radiation is not normally
    available either as a measurement or as a forecast, therefore the need to develop
    models to estimate E T o that do not require it as an input feature. In this context,
    E T o estimation models that have as input a limited set of parameters are explored
    in Sec. III-C1. Furthermore, since solar radiation is the main factor for the
    determination of E T o [4], in Sec. III-C2 solar radiation estimation models that
    use a limited set of features are explored. Finally, two approaches are taken:
    (i) use the previously estimated solar radiation as an input to another neural
    network model (Sec. III-C3) or (ii) use the FAO56-PM formula to compute E T o
    , using as an input feature the estimated solar radiation (Sec. III-C4). Please
    refer to Fig. 1 for scheme of the proposed flow. 1) E T o Estimation Using ANN
    Methods (Excluding Solar Radiation) In this section neural network based models
    are used to directly estimate E T o , using as inputs limited weather parameters.
    The set of features used are Month∈{1,2,…,12} , maximum and minimum temperature
    ( TempMax and TempMin ), average humidity ( HumididtyAvg ), and average wind speed
    ( WindAvg ). Table 1 shows the results obtained by the non-hybrid models and RF
    (included for comparison purposes), being clear that neural network based models
    outperform, in all metrics, the RF model. ANN, LSTM, GRU and RNN give similar
    results, the best one being the GRU based model with an R 2 of 0.962, a MAE of
    0.24 mm/day , and a MAPE of 7.25 %. The plot of the target E T o (blue), of the
    E T o estimated using the ANN model (orange), and of the corresponding absolute
    error (green) in Fig. 3 shows that the estimator follows relatively well the E
    T o target value. In the same figure, the shadowed region corresponds to the test
    data, being visible the expectable slight increase of the absolute error, when
    comparing to the train region (as stated earlier, all presented metrics are calculated
    using only the test data). Table 3 also presents the results obtained using the
    hybrid models, namely, LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, GRU-ANN. The results are slightly worse
    than the ones obtained using the GRU, with the LSTM-ANN model attaining an R 2
    of 0.959 against the 0.962 of GRU (MAE, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE are also similar).
    FIGURE 3. Target E T o vs. ANN estimation, where solar radiation was not used
    as feature. Show All 2) Solar Radiation Estimation Using ANN Methods With a Limited
    Set of Features As an alternative to the presented in the previous section, and
    since solar radiation is the main driver of evapotranspiration [4], [5], this
    section studies solar radiation estimation models that have as input a limited
    feature set, compatible with the limited number of features returned by the common
    weather forecast APIs. The estimated result will be later injected as a feature
    in other machine learning model or used in the FAO56-PM formula (Eq. 3). So, in
    this section, the solar radiation measured by the WS was used as target. Initially,
    the features used in the solar radiation models were the same as the ones proposed
    by Vaz et al. [7], namely: Month , Day , maximum and minimum temperature ( TempMax
    and TempMin ), average humidity ( HumididtyAvg ), average wind speed ( WindAvg
    ), dew point, and the polynomial feature Mont h 2 ×Day . However, it was found
    that the model metrics were improved by dropping dew point and the polynomial
    feature Mont h 2 ×Day and, instead, adding the sunset hour angle ( ω s ) and daylight
    hours ( N ). As a note, the sunset hour angle ( ω s ) was defined as [4] ω s =arccos[−tan(φ)×tan(δ)],
    (9) View Source where φ is the latitude of the WS (in radians) and δ=0.409sin(
    2π 365 J−1.39) (10) View Source is the solar declination (also in radians), and
    J is the number of the day in the year. Furthermore, the daylight hours (N) is
    given by N= 24 π ω s . (11) View Source The results obtained are summarized in
    Table 2, where it can be seen that RNN and ANN are the best performing methods,
    with RNN being slightly better with an R 2 of 0.833, a MAE of 18.46 W/ m 2 /day
    , a MAPE of 10.30 %, and a RMSE of 28.817. This result is better than what was
    obtained by Vaz et al. [7], using the same dataset, on which Random Forest gave
    the best results, with an R 2 of 0.814, a MAE of 21.31 W/ m 2 /day , and a MAPE
    of 11.29 %. The inclusion of daylight hours and sunset angle improved performance
    for all neural network based models but, as can be seen on Table 2, it worsened
    Random Forest performance. Fig. 4 depicts the target solar radiation that was
    measured by the solar station (blue), the approximated solar radiation obtained
    with ANN method (orange), and the absolute error curve (green). Shadowed is the
    test set. This solar radiation estimation will be used next to predict the E T
    o values. FIGURE 4. Target solar radiation vs ANN estimation, input features include
    daylight hours and sunset angle as derived features. Show All As in Sec. III-C1,
    the recursive hybrid LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN and GRU-ANN models’ results, summarized
    also in Table 2, give similar performance to the recursive non-hybrid methods,
    with the advantage of requiring less computation power, since the number of trainable
    parameters is highly reduced due to the smaller network that is used. E.g., the
    LSTM model has 1,128,609 trainable parameters, while the LSTM-ANN model only has
    35,841, requiring approximately 21 % of the training time, and 58 % of the inference
    time. 3) E T o Estimation Using the Approximated Solar Radiation This section
    describes the implementation of the E T o estimation using as features solar radiation
    (approximated using the ANN presented in Sec. III-C2) together with maximum temperature,
    average humidity, and average wind speed. To be more clear, the difference between
    the present models and the ones in Sec. III-C1 is the use of the (estimated) SR,
    which was not previously used. The obtained results are summarized in Table 3.
    The ANN model was the best one with an R 2 of 0.968, a MAE of 0.22 mm/day , a
    MAPE of 6.66 %, and a RMSE of 0.303 (against the R 2 of 0.962, the MAE of 0.24
    mm/day , the MAPE of 7.25%, and the RMSE of 0.331 previously obtained with GRU
    model). Similarly, with the advantages previously stated, the LSTM-ANN model achieved
    an R 2 of 0.967, just one thousandth worse than the ANN model, but improving the
    MAPE to 6.5%. Also, the obtained result is better than the ones presented in Vaz
    et al. [7], using a similar technique but based on ML algorithms, where the best
    performing model was Random Forest with an R 2 of 0.951, a MAE of 0.26 mm/day
    , and a MAPE of 7.44 %. Feature engineering as well as the use of other weather
    limited features was attempted, but no further improvements could be made. Fig.
    5 (top) depicts the target E T o (blue), estimated E T o (orange), and absolute
    error (green) curves for the train and test (shadowed) dataset, allowing to observe
    the model closely follows the reference evapotranspiration target. FIGURE 5. Target
    E T o vs ANN estimation (top) and Target E T o vs FAO56-PM values using estimated
    solar radiation (bottom). Show All 4) Estimation Using FAO56-PM Equation and the
    Approximated Solar Radiation In this section, another type of hybrid approach
    was tested, which uses the previously estimated solar radiation as an input, together
    with temperature, humidity and wind speed to compute E T o using the FAO56-PM
    formula (SR-ANN → FAO56-PM). The result obtained is presented in Table 3, with
    an R 2 of 0.977, MAE of 0.16 mm/day and MAPE of 5.05 %. This result is better
    than the previously obtained ones, and once again is also better than what was
    presented by Vaz et al. [7] which consisted of an R 2 of 0.975, an MAE of 0.18
    mm/day , and an MAPE of 5.51 %. Fig. 5 (bottom) plots E T o target, estimated
    E T o , and absolute error, where in the bottom plot an improvement of the absolute
    error can be seen when compared with the previous plots. Next section will generalize
    the current results to 11 WS ran by the Colorado Agricultural Meteorological Network
    (CoAgMET). SECTION IV. CoAgMET Agricultural Weather Stations The Colorado Agricultural
    Meteorological Network (CoAgMET) is a network of automatic weather stations distributed
    across the state of Colorado. The collected weather data, such as temperature,
    humidity, wind speed and solar radiation, can be accessed via an API at https://www.coagmet.com.
    Data from 11 weather stations was collected, namely the stations having the following
    code names: alt01, avn01, ctz01, hyk02, idl01, ksy01, lcn01, oth01, pkh01, rfd01,
    yjk01. These weather stations were chosen because they are spread across the Colorado
    state and have data available starting from August 1992, up to and including July
    2021 (when the test were run), which comprises almost 30 years of data. Also,
    with temperatures ranging from −39.06 to 44.26 degrees Celsius (°C), and having
    desert zones, the Colorado state poses different climatic conditions than the
    Mediterranean based Vale do Lobo. This allows the assessment of model performance
    under different climate conditions than Vale do Lobo, and for a longer period
    of historical data. For each WS, the ANN, the LSTM-ANN and the RF models were
    trained using the same hyperparameters found for the Vale do Lobo Dataset (see
    Table 6). As previously, a ratio of 75 % to 25 % of train and test data was used,
    meaning that the developed models are making predictions for more than 7 years.
    The results obtained for the 11 WS were averaged and are presented in Table 4.
    In short, the best results were attained by the hybrid method where SR is estimated
    by an ANN and then injected in the FAO56-PM formula (SR-ANN → FAO56-PM), achieving
    an R 2 of 0.984, a RMSE of 0.261 mm/day , a MSE of 0.069 m m 2 /day , a MAE of
    0.16 mm/day , and a MAPE of 4.84 %. Furthermore, R 2 and RMSE variation across
    all stations is small, as can be observed in the boxplots of Fig. 6. Also, for
    all models, R 2 is always above 0.958 and RMSE is below 0.45 mm/day , which can
    be considered a good result. MAE metric variation across all WS is also small,
    as it can be observed in Table 4 and inferred from the boxplots on Fig. 7 which
    shows that, for the 7 years of test data, the maximum absolute error is below
    1 mm/day , apart outliers. As a note, values are regarded as outliers if they
    are more than 1.5 times the interquartile range ( IQR ) below the first quartile
    ( Q 1 ) or more than 1.5×IQR above the third quartile ( Q 3 ), i.e., values outside
    the interval [ Q 1 −1.5×IQR, Q 3 +1.5×IQR] . FIGURE 6. Boxplot graphs of R 2 (top)
    and RMSE (bottom) obtained using the following E T o estimation models: ANN without
    SR, LSTM-ANN without SR, RF without SR, ANN with SR estimated by an ANN (SR-ANN),
    LSTM-ANN with SR-ANN, RF with SR-ANN, and the hybrid method where SR-ANN is used
    as a feature in FAO56-PM formula (SR-ANN → FAO56-PM). The models were trained
    using data collected from 11 WS, that are spread across the Colorado state. Show

    SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Work Evapotranspiration can be used to estimate
    the amount of water required by agriculture projects and green spaces, playing
    a key role in water management policies that combat the hydrological drought.
    Some equipment can be used to measure E T o , but they are expensive to buy and
    maintain. As an alternative, many use meteorological data to estimate the E T
    o values, but again, in the most well accepted formula (FAO56-PM), solar radiation
    is required, which is not common to have in general meteorological APIs. In this
    work, several neural network based regression models (namely, ANN, LST, GRU, and
    RNN) and hybrid approaches (namely, LSTM-ANN, RNN-ANN, GRU-ANN) for E T o estimation
    were developed with different degrees of success. Since solar radiation is the
    main E T o driver, as stated by several authors, models were also developed for
    estimating solar radiation using input features that are readily available in
    common weather forecast APIs. This allowed both the use of the previously estimated
    solar radiation in neural network regressors, to estimate E T o , but also the
    possibility to use the hybrid approach where solar radiation is previously estimated,
    and then the FAO56-PM method is used to finally compute E T o . For the Vale do
    Lobo WS, the latter yielded the best results, with an R 2 of 0.977, a RMSE of
    0.256 mm/day , a MSE of 0.066 m m 2 /day , a MAE of 0.16 mm/day , and a MAPE of
    5.05 %. The attained results were also compared against the ones in a previous
    work from the authors, were several other machine learning methods were used (namely,
    Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge, Lasso, k -Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine,
    Decision Tree, and Random Forest), demonstrating the overall good result, considering
    the limited weather parameter features that were used. Being the conditions different,
    and impossible to replicate, we can also see that the proposed methods generically
    improve the metric values attained by other authors. An extensive dataset collected
    from 11 WS from the Colorado CoAgMET network was used to assess model performance
    under different climate conditions and longer periods of data. Our results show
    that the evaluated models give similar performance to the ones obtained when using
    the Vale do Lobo dataset, with average R 2 of 0.984, MAE of 0.16 mm/day , MAPE
    of 4.84 %, and a RMSE of 0.261, when using the Hybrid FAO56-PM model. The result
    is particularly relevant when considering the diversity of weather conditions,
    and the long period of data that comprises almost 30 years. Also, our work shows
    that the recurrent hybrid network models (e.g., LSTM-ANN) give similar results
    to the non-hybrid recurrent network models (e.g., LSTM). However, its computational
    cost is lower due to the decrease of trainable parameters, requiring only 21 %
    of training, and 58 % of inference time when compared to the non-hybrid recurrent
    networks. This is an important result when using edge computing, where computational
    power is limited. Future work will include a dataset collected from the existing
    WS infrastructure that is installed in the Algarve region, in south Portugal.
    The objective will be to develop local and pooled models of E T o predictors for
    the Algarve region. Also, since all limited feature models here presented are
    compatible with the freely available weather forecast APIs, the impact of using
    such APIs as input data to the ML models here developed needs to be further assessed.

    Article history Views PDF Share Tools Abstract Listen One of the needs of a sustainable
    decision-making system in agriculture is to determine the role of energy in the
    food production cycle. Wind energy turbines can be built in agricultural fields
    for groundwater exploitation and reduce the cost of energy supply for the pumping
    system. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of wind energy and economics
    on sustainable planning of agricultural water resources. A multiobjective framework
    was developed based on the nondominated sorting principle and water cycle optimizer.
    Maximization of benefit per cost ratio for the total cropping pattern and minimization
    of energy consumption for the growing season were addressed as the objectives
    of the nonlinear problem. The prediction of biomass production was made by simulating
    a hybrid structure between the soil moisture balance in the root zone area and
    the development of the canopy cover of each crop. The results showed that the
    objectives of the problem have been met by irrigation planning using climatic
    constraints and drought stresses. About 35% of the total water requirement of
    plants with a higher harvest index (watermelon, melon, etc.) is in the maturing
    stage of the shade cover. HIGHLIGHTS Listen The role of wind energy variables
    has been considered in the agricultural yield production. A multiobjective framework
    was developed based on the nondominated sorting principle and water cycle optimizer.
    The proposed optimization method showed that the total water productivity increased
    significantly by 38%. agricultural water supplement, biomass, cropping pattern,
    wind energy INTRODUCTION Listen Sustainable management of water and ecosystem
    requires attention to the components of water production and consumption (Li et
    al. 2022a; Zhu et al. 2022; Qi et al. 2023). Different studies have been conducted
    to develop the sustainable strategies of agricultural water management. Optimization
    techniques (Lalehzari et al. 2020), uncertainty analysis (Lalehzari & Kerachian
    2020a), field studies (Behdarvandi et al. 2020) and agroecosystem concepts (Pan
    et al. 2019) are the most topics that have expanded the technical knowledge of
    water allocation and cropping pattern. None of these works dealt with the application
    of wind energy as a probabilistic component to withdraw groundwater for irrigation
    management. Research on applications of wind energy to hydraulics and water resources
    has thrived over the past two decades. That research can be classified into two
    general categories: (1) feasibility of wind projects and (2) development of wind
    energy tools and turbines (Hou et al. 2021). Mohsen & Akash (1998) determined
    locations with high, medium and low potential for water pumping with wind power
    in Jordan. Guerrero et al. (2010) investigated alternative energy sources for
    irrigation systems and noted that conversion from natural gas irrigation systems
    to electric systems is more feasible than the adoption of hybrid ones. The cost
    of pumping with fossil fuels can exceed the cost of providing the same service
    using renewable energy (Cloutier & Rowley 2011). Therefore, replacing fossil fuels
    with wind renewable energy for water pumping would be economical in that instance.
    The crop production could be simulated with different methods such as monitoring
    the canopy cover, evaporation and transpiration (Huang et al. 2021; Li et al.
    2021a), simulation models such as CropWat, AquaCrop and SWAT (Wang et al. 2021),
    Doorenbos and Kassam equation (De Juan et al. 1996) and experimental methods.
    Lalehzari & Kerachian (2020a, 2020b) showed that the use of modeling with a time
    step of 1 day increased the accuracy of the results compared to time steps of
    10 days and 1 month. In addition, irrigation planning is not possible in models
    that have a time step of more than 1 week. In daily modeling, the transpiration
    parameter, which is directly involved in biomass production, is separated from
    evaporation, which causes water loss. Research has shown that water loss in the
    simulation with a shorter time period had an effective role in reducing water
    consumption. Akbari et al. (2022) optimized water use efficiency of the cropping
    pattern in the Eshtehard watershed in Iran. A hydro-agronomic simulation-optimization
    approach was simulated using soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) and the optimal
    cropping pattern was searched by particle swarm optimizer (PSO). Mirzaei et al.
    (2022) used optimal programming of the cropping pattern to consider seasonal fluctuations
    of surface water in the irrigation network of the Jiroft plain in Kerman Province,
    Iran. A model of irrigation water allocation was developed based on cropping pattern
    using multistage stochastic programming in accordance with surface water supply
    fluctuations. The results indicated more benefits for the farmers based on the
    proposed framework. Li et al. (2022b) proposed a dynamic method to provide a multidimensional
    cooperative optimization modeling for cropping patterns. The developed method
    helps to promote the sustainable use of cultivated land. Moreover, the optimization
    improved the crop diversity, with a variety of food crops planted in most regions.
    Dzikiti et al. (2022) investigated the energy and water requirements of rooibos
    fields to increase crop yield. Developed model predicted increases in both the
    annual ETa and yield by between 8 and 16%. Fan et al. (2022) used a maximum entropy
    machine learning model to determine the optimal cropping pattern based on crop
    suitability and to explore the impact mechanism of the optimal cropping pattern
    on the irrigation sustainability index from the perspective of reliability, resilience
    and vulnerability. Results showed that the proposed cropping pattern reduced irrigation
    water use by 21% with no continued agricultural expansion. Xue et al. (2022) used
    global sensitivity analysis to calibrate the relationship between evapotranspiration
    processes and yield production during the periods of 2001–2018. Results showed
    that a significant increase, which was caused by rises in temperature and changing
    cropping patterns associated with an increase in area under nut crop production.
    In this research, the planning of agro-economic model based on maximizing economic
    indicators and minimizing water consumption is considered. The relationships and
    constraints governing water allocation in agriculture and the role of periodic
    drought stresses, economic parameters and rainfall are formulated. The proposed
    model needs to identify the wind speed and duration variables for estimating the
    potential energy, simulating water consumption, sensitivity of agricultural products
    to water and climate tensions and use of timely hydrological data in the estimation
    of water needs, taking into account uncertainty in water availability. MATERIAL
    AND METHODS Model description Listen The conceptual framework of the proposed
    model to create an interconnected structure of water and energy optimization to
    increase the efficiency of crop production in agriculture is summarized in Figure
    1. In the developed system, the input parameters included the cultivated area,
    actual yield production, irrigation schedule, growth stages of canopy cover and
    historical data of wind speed and duration. The simulation of the processes has
    been done by MATLAB software and as a daily time step. The planning process based
    on the flowchart shown in Figure 1 is summarized as follows: I. Simulation of
    water allocation system in agricultural lands: this process includes water exploitation
    and irrigation planning, which includes marginal measures such as determining
    plant water needs, modeling soil moisture and water losses. II. Yield production
    estimation: in this section, the production of each crop is calculated according
    to water allocation and environmental stresses. In this paper, the constraints
    of the problem are referred to the decision variables. Therefore, each decision
    variable has a separate feasible domain based on environmental, economic and water
    constraints. III. Wind energy model: the two-variable return period of wind speed
    and duration is probabilistically estimated and the obtained output is entered
    into the decision-making system according to the flowchart in Figure 1. IV. Optimization:
    the programming of the mathematical model has been performed by a multiobjective
    algorithm. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE The main components of an agro-economic
    management model. As shown in the figure, there are concepts that need to be defined.
    After calculating the solutions of the Pareto front by the optimization model,
    it is necessary to evaluate criteria such as sustainability and applicability
    according to the knowledge (knowledge gap) and experience (adaptive governance)
    of experts, and the optimal solution is selected as the final decision (Wang et
    al. 2022). Cropping pattern Listen Agroecosystem management will be planned based
    on five components of water, land, climate, economy and production (Lalehzari
    & Boroomand-Nasab 2017; Zhao et al. 2020; Li et al. 2021b). As shown in Figure
    1, land-use change policies with the aim of yield production are one of the main
    constraints. Economic factors seem to have been a determining factor in land allocation
    for food security. Moreover, the impact of climate change on agricultural development
    policies and cropping pattern formulation is considered. Obviously, water is the
    decision-making factor for agro-economic management. Therefore, the following
    formulations are considered for developing the simulation model as the first objective
    function (OF1). One of the main issues in water allocation for food security is
    the simulation of yield production, which has so far often been based on the guidelines
    of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations No. 33. Various
    studies have been performed using this relationship, which is based on the ratio
    of actual/ potential evapotranspiration and sensitivity coefficient. In this research,
    production functions based on the role of water stress and water quality will
    be generated using the functions developed in the new FAO guidelines for the study
    area. The time step of the models in the optimal allocation of water is daily.
    Evaporation, transpiration, runoff, deep percolation, soil moisture, root development,
    biomass, canopy cover, moisture, salinity stresses, temperature changes, humidity
    and solar radiation and the sensitivity of plants in different stages of growth
    are simulated in separate sub-models. The main components of the crop production
    model are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE The main components
    of the crop production model. Therefore, the first objective will be the relative
    efficiency of water consumption to maximize yield production as follow. (1) where
    BC is the benefit per cost ratio; Pt is the precipitation in growth stage n (mm);
    I is the allocated water as the decision variable (mm); ET is the maximum evapotranspiration
    (mm), Ct is the crop coefficient in each stress period t, BCC is the benefit per
    cost coefficient; and N is the number of simulation periods. The constraints considered
    on this planning system are summarized as follows. (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8)
    where BYp is the selling price of the crop p (USD/kg); CY is the seasonal required
    cost for cultivation, growing and harvest process (USD/ha); A is the cultivated
    area (h); p is the crop number, B is the biomass (kg), WP* is the normalized water
    productivity, Tr is the transpiration (mm/day), CR is the time period coefficient;
    FR = 125; Ra is the rainfall (mm). Furthermore, the transpiration of plants and
    evaporation from the soil surface depends on the moisture content of different
    soil layers. Runoff, deep percolation and evaporation are components of water
    balance that determine the amount of losses in each planning scenario and play
    a role in choosing the best cropping pattern strategy. Irrigation time can be
    estimated according to the time interval between rainfall and irrigation and reaching
    soil moisture to the permanent wilting point. Wind energy Listen Uncertainty is
    considered in this study by evaluating the possible impact of wind energy supply.
    For this purpose, first, the wind power to produce energy and supply the mechanical
    power of the water pump has been calculated and the answers to the problem have
    been analyzed at the confidence level of 5%. The proposed energy supply system
    is simple turbines that convert wind energy into mechanical energy used for water
    exploitation. The wind force at time t (Ft (W)) produced by the wind turbine is
    calculated as follows: (9) where T is the turbine wheel diameter (m), ρa is the
    air density (1.2 kg/m3) and ut is the wind speed (m/s) at time t. The wind energy
    (Et(J)) with a wind turbine is obtained by multiplying the force and the generation
    time. (10) where μ is the wind turbine efficiency at time t; γw is the unit of
    water weight (9.81 N/m3); Q is the pumping flow rate (m3/s) and Hd is the height
    of water pumping from the well into the tank (m) and t is the time interval (s).
    For the economic evaluation of projects, it is necessary to estimate the amount
    of investment in the study year compared to the base year as a constraint. (11)
    (12) where AC is the total cost, CRF is the return on investment (USD), CR, CW
    and CC are the cost of reservoir construction, wind turbine and cropping pattern
    (USD), respectively, i is the interest rate, n is the number of years since the
    base year. In addition to the technical parameters, two variables of wind speed
    and duration are needed to calculate the wind force, which is considered as the
    second objective function. Therefore, wind characteristics were estimated using
    hourly data (Carta et al. 2008) recorded at Miandoab station from 2002 to 2022.
    Probabilistic modeling was done based on bivariate joint functions. The limitations
    of this decision-making system for energy production were calculated as a predetermined
    range at a 5% confidence level and were used in the analysis of the results to
    estimate the extreme points. Nondominated sorting water cycle algorithm Listen
    Nondominated sorting test has been inspired by an economic theory to evaluate
    the solutions based on the domination ability (Deb et al. 2002). Genetic algorithm
    was the initial technique to optimize the process in this concept. In this study,
    the water cycle algorithm (WCA) is incorporated into this framework for increasing
    convergence. The WCA starts by generating an initial population known as raindrops.
    The best member (the best drop of water) is selected as the sea. After that, some
    of the raindrops with superior position are considered as rivers and the rest
    of the raindrops are considered as streams that flow towards the rivers and the
    sea. In a multidimensional optimization problem, a raindrop is an array in the
    form of Nvar × 1. This array is defined by the following equation. (13) where
    X1 to represent the decision variables. To begin with, a sample of the raindrop
    matrix of Npop × Nvar is randomly generated. (14) where Npop and Nvar are the
    number of raindrops (initial population) and the number of variables, respectively.
    The values of the cost function (C) are obtained from the following equation.
    (15) where Ci is the objective value of each drop. In the first step, Npop, number
    of raindrops, is generated and then NSR, number of the best drops (minimum value),
    is selected as sea and river. A raindrop with the smallest amount is considered
    as a sea. NSR is the sum of the number of rivers (which is a practical parameter)
    and a sea (Equation (16)). The rest of the population (streams that may flow into
    rivers or directly into the sea) is calculated using Equation (17). (16) (17)
    In order to determine or allocate raindrops to rivers and the sea, depending on
    the intensity of the flow, Equation (18) is used. (18) where NSn is a number of
    streams that flow into certain rivers or the sea. A stream flows until it reaches
    the river along the connecting line between them using a randomly selected distance,
    which is determined according to the following equation. (19) where C is a value
    between one and two (close to two) and the best value for C is considered equal
    to 2, d is the distance between the stream and the river, X is a random number
    distributed uniformly between zero and (C × d). The new position of streams and
    rivers can be calculated with the following equations. (20) (21) where rand is
    a random number uniformly distributed between zero and one. If the solution provided
    by a stream is better than the river connected to it, the position of the river
    and the stream will change. This exchange can happen in the same way for rivers
    and sea. One of the most important factors that prevent the algorithm from quickly
    converging and getting trapped in local optima is evaporation. The process of
    evaporation causes the sea water to evaporate into the sea again in the form of
    rivers or streams. Equation (22) shows how to determine whether the river flows
    into the sea or not. (22) where dmax is a small number (close to zero). Therefore,
    if the distance between the river and the sea is less than dmax, it means that
    the river has reached the sea. In this situation, the evaporation process takes
    effect and after sufficient evaporation, precipitation will begin. The value of
    dmax decreases in each iteration according to the following equation. (23) After
    evaporation is estimated, precipitation term is applied. In the precipitation
    process, new raindrops form streams at different locations. Equation (24) shows
    the new location of newly formed streams. (24) where LB and UB are the lower and
    upper bounds defined by the problem, respectively. The best newly formed raindrops
    are considered as rivers and the remaining raindrops are considered as new streams
    flowing into rivers. In the next step, Equation (25) is used to increase the speed
    of convergence and computational performance of the algorithm. (25) where μ is
    a coefficient that shows the feasible domain near the sea. randn is a random number
    of normal distribution. Large values of μ increase the possibility of leaving
    the feasible region, and small values of μ lead to the search of the algorithm
    in a smaller region near the sea. The appropriate value of μ is determined as
    0.1. The criterion of convergence in this research is to reach the maximum number
    of repetitions equal to 5,000. Study area Listen The Miandoab Plain with an area
    of approximately 1,200 km2 is located in the south of Urmia Lake. The geographic
    coordinate of the studied area is between 36°50′ and 37°15′ east longitude and
    45°52′ and 46°11′ north latitude. The location of this plain is shown in Figure
    3. Its potential evapotranspiration rate is estimated at 742 mm. Zarrineh irrigation
    and drainage network is located in plain with area equal to 586 km2. The average
    annual rainfall during 1992–2022 is about 285 mm/year according to the recorded
    data at Miandoab synoptic station. This region has a cold and semi-arid climate
    based on the statistics meteorology data analysis and empirical Emberger method
    (Norouzi Ghoshbelag et al. 2019). According to the hydrological, agricultural
    and environmental conditions of the region, the area is suitable for evaluating
    the developed models. Figure 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Location of study area
    in Urmia Lake watershed. To develop the decision-making system and evaluate the
    role of wind energy application in agricultural water allocation, the cropping
    pattern of Miandoab Plain in 2022 is summarized in Table 1. The average yield
    production (YP) and irrigation (I) have been collected based on field measurements,
    face-to-face interviews and completing questionnaires. Furthermore, the crop water
    requirement (CWR) has been estimated based on the method of Allen et al. (1998).

    AND DISCUSSION Irrigation planning Listen Figure 4 shows the water allocation
    strategies in 10-day periods for six plants that are in priority planning based
    on the 25-year return period of wind speed and duration. According to the figure,
    the highest percentage of water requirement has been estimated for cantaloupe
    in the emergence phase (about 30% of water available in the second time step).
    The water requirement of this product during the growing season until reaching
    the maturity stage has been the highest amount in the optimal state. The lowest
    water requirement in the comparison was for onions. It is possible to control
    the balance between water demand and water allocation by changing the date of
    crop cultivation (Lalehzari et al. 2016). In September, only cucumbers and tomatoes
    are in the harvest stage, and their water needs are fully allocated. Figure 4
    VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Comparison of optimal irrigation depth in growing season
    length. Optimal cropping pattern Listen One of the goals of this research is to
    compare the cultivated area of each plant based on the defined limits. Therefore,
    the cropping pattern in the three strategies (the existing plan (EP) (Figure 5),
    the maximization of yield productivity (Figure 6) and the minimization of water
    consumption (Figure 7)) are compared. The results showed that wheat decreased
    by 260 hectares in optimal conditions (Figure 6) and increased by 230 hectares
    in drought conditions. One of the important reasons for these changes is the capability
    of wheat for rainfed cultivation and it can perform well in drought conditions.
    On the other hand, the area under potato cultivation has increased in optimal
    conditions and decreased in the drought scenario. As shown in Figure 5, supplying
    the water needed by potatoes, especially at the end of the growing season, will
    increase yield and in optimal conditions will increase the final productivity
    of the cultivation pattern. In general, the area under cultivation of agricultural
    products in the defined strategies for drought has decreased by about 18% because
    it is necessary to allocate water needed by other plants by reducing the area
    under cultivation. Figure 5 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Cropping pattern (ha) in
    the existing plan. Figure 6 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Optimal cropping pattern
    for maximizing the yield productivity. Figure 7 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Optimal
    cropping pattern for minimizing the water consumption. Water productivity Listen
    The water productivity based on the objective functions of the problem is compared
    with the EP in Figure 8. The results showed that for the crops that tolerate the
    drought stress are able to have more productivity under the condition defined
    by OF2. According to the predetermined concept of the second objective function
    (OF2), water extraction will be minimized to save energy and available water will
    be reduced. Therefore, its productivity increases as expected. The production
    biomass of pea and sugar beet has decreased with a greater slope in the conditions
    of OF1 by increasing 0.2 and 2 kg/m3, respectively. As shown in Figure 5, the
    highest and lowest water productivity were estimated for sorghum and sesame, respectively.
    In addition, optimization has increased productivity, especially for wheat, barley,
    fodder corn, garlic, carrot, mung bean and turnip. Figure 8 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Water productivity in existing plan (EP) and optimal strategies (OF1 and
    OF2). CONCLUSION Listen Climate change and cropping patterns are the main factors
    affecting agricultural productivity in recent years. Therefore, in order to adapt
    to climatic conditions, economic parameters, population growth and food security,
    it is necessary to update water allocation strategies based on new limitations.
    This research provided a structure to use renewable wind energy for exploitation
    and production of agricultural crops. The results showed that the application
    of an optimal planning can achieve a sustainable pattern in water allocation with
    two conflicting objectives. In drought conditions, crops such as sugar beet, watermelon
    and cantaloupe should be replaced by wheat, barley, sorghum, maize and canola.
    Comparing the outputs of the optimization model showed that the total water productivity
    increased significantly by 38%, which also confirmed the significant economic
    benefit for farmers by expanding the land area. One of the implications of this
    research can be the inclusion of renewable energy in exploitation and determining
    the cropping pattern. Probabilistic models can play an effective role in predicting
    hydrological events for wind energy supply risk analysis. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen

    Technological advances have played a critical role in the production of ﬂower

    crops, enabling farmers to maximize yields and reduce losses while also improving

    the quality of ﬂowers. These advances have included the development of new

    breeding techniques, such as molecular marker-assisted breeding, and the use of

    modern technologies like high-throughput phenotyping to identify and select

    superior cultivars. In addition, precision farming techniques, such as the use
    of

    sensors and remote monitoring systems, have made it possible to closely monitor

    crop growth and optimize inputs like water and fertilizer, leading to higher yields

    and improved resource efﬁciency. Advancements in biotechnology have also

    resulted in the development of transgenic plants that are resistant to pests and

    diseases, reducing the need for chemical pesticides and improving plant health.

    Modern molecular genetic tools, particularly genome editing with CRISPR/

    Cas9 nucleases, are emerging in addition to conventional approaches of

    investigating these plants. Furthermore, the use of novel growing systems,

    such as hydroponics and vertical farming, has allowed for year-round ﬂower

    production in controlled environments, mitigating the challenges associated with

    seasonal changes and climate variability. These innovations have also made it

    possible to produce high-quality ﬂowers in urban areas, bringing fresh blooms

    closer to consumers. Overall, technological advances in ﬂower crops have

    revolutionized the ﬂoriculture industry, enabling growers to produce high-

    quality

    ﬂowers

    in

    a

    more

    sustainable

    and

    efﬁcient

    manner.

    These

    advancements have not only improved the productivity and proﬁtability of

    ﬂower farming but have also contributed to the conservation of natural

    resources and the protection of the environment.

    1 Introduction

    The cultivation of ﬂowers has been intertwined with human

    civilization for centuries. Ancient cultures like the Egyptians,

    Greeks, and Romans were known to cultivate and use ﬂowers for

    various purposes, including as offerings to their gods, for medicinal

    purposes, and to make fragrances and perfumes (Dafni et al., 2006).

    Flower production saw a seminal shift when colonial powers used

    Naval power along with railways to transport planting material across

    the continents thus bringing hitherto newer ornamental species and

    cultivars into gardens. As the demand for ﬂowers increased over

    time, growers began to adopt new technologies to improve the

    quality and yield of their crops (Wani et al., 2018). The 20th century

    saw the advent of air and refrigerated transport and hence the ability

    to move ﬂowers over long distances, particularly in the post-ﬁfties

    which was the single most contributor to development of ﬂoriculture

    into a trans-continental and global enterprise. Flower production

    moved to areas around the equator that required less investment in

    energy in comparison to traditional production areas in northern

    latitudes. Newer ﬂower types and cultivars were bred that withstood

    the rigours of long-distance transport, including improved post-

    harvest technologies and marketing that completed the value chain.

    Technologies have been rapidly developed and deployed to reduce

    the collective carbon footprint of the ﬂoriculture industry. In the

    post-2000s, ﬂower industry has undergone the most rapid and

    paradigm shift in harnessing technologies that have emerged as

    the world ushered in the 4.0 industrial revolution (Hossen et al.,

    2020). Today, growers have access to cutting-edge technologies that

    have revolutionized ﬂower production (Maraveas, 2023). As a result,

    the ability to handle big data in recent years has allowed the

    ﬂoriculture

    industry

    to

    make

    use

    of

    the

    most

    signiﬁcant

    technological advances like genetic engineering (Cardoso and

    Vendrame, 2022; Khan et al., 2022) to create new ﬂower varieties

    with improved characteristics, such as longer shelf-life, unique

    colors, and fragrance. By manipulating the plant’s genetic code,

    breeders can develop ﬂowers that are more resistant to pests and

    diseases, which reduces the need for harmful chemicals and makes

    the industry more sustainable (Huylenbroeck, and Bhattarai, 2022).

    AI and IoT have enabled the ﬂower industry to reap the beneﬁts of

    precision agriculture. This technology involves the use of sensors,

    drones, and GPS mapping to optimize crop inputs, reduce waste,

    and increase yields. By monitoring plant health and growth, growers

    can adjust irrigation, fertilization, and pest management practices

    more precisely, which reduces the overall environmental impact of

    ﬂower production (Belal et al., 2021; Ferroukhi et al., 2023).

    Automation, robotics, and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) have also

    played a signiﬁcant role in reducing labor costs and increasing

    efﬁciency in ﬂower cultivation. For example, automated planting

    and harvesting systems can perform tasks much faster and more

    accurately than manual labor, reducing the need for human workers

    (Jha et al., 2019). While these technological advances have greatly

    improved the quality and yield of ﬂower crops and made the

    industry more sustainable, there are also potential drawbacks to

    consider. Genetic engineering raises questions about the safety of

    modiﬁed plants and their potential impact on the environment.

    Automation and use of artiﬁcial intelligence may lead to job losses,

    particularly in the global south where most of the production areas

    are currently located. Therefore, it is essential to explore the

    potential impact of these technological innovations on the

    environment, economy, and society and use them responsibly to

    promote sustainable and equitable ﬂower production.

    According to a report by the International Trade Centre, the

    global ﬂower trade was valued at over USD 104 billion in 2019,

    with exports from developing countries accounting for a

    signiﬁcant share of this value. However, the ﬂower industry

    also faces challenges, including increasing competition, climate

    change,

    environmental

    degradation

    and

    gender

    equity.

    Technological innovations can help address some of these

    challenges,

    but

    they

    should

    be

    used

    responsibly

    and

    in

    conjunction with other sustainable practices such as organic

    farming, biodiversity conservation, and fair labor standards

    and health issues. In addition, technological advances should

    be accessible to all stakeholders, including small-scale farmers,

    and should not contribute to widening the existing economic and

    social disparities in the ﬂower industry. By promoting sustainable

    and equitable ﬂower production, we can ensure that this beautiful

    and culturally signiﬁcant part of crop husbandry continues to

    thrive for generations to come. Technology has signiﬁcantly

    impacted

    the

    ﬂoriculture

    industry,

    leading

    to

    signiﬁcant

    advances

    in

    production,

    management,

    and

    sustainability.

    However, the looming challenge is to sustain and promote

    equity, inclusion and reduction of economic disparity by

    harnessing fourth industrial

    revolution in channelling its

    effects on advances in genetic engineering, climate control,

    carbon neutrality and making technologies available to all.

    Previous reviews on ornamental crops have primarily focused

    on a few technologies as evidenced by several available reviews

    (Rihn et al., 2022; Lea-Cox et al., 2013; Mahmud et al., 2023)

    whereas Rihn et al. (2022), on the other hand, examined factors

    linked to the inclination of the nursery industry to utilize

    automation and mechanization, and discussed the barriers to

    adoption for currently available technologies. This review article

    stands out as a comprehensive overview of available technologies

    for ornamental crop production. It discusses the potential

    beneﬁts of using

    advanced

    technologies that are already

    employed in other crop industries and introduces the concept

    of virtual ﬂowers, a new idea presented in this article. To the best

    of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst review article to delve so deeply

    into the signiﬁcant technological advances for the ornamental

    industry, which have the potential to transform the ﬂoriculture

    industry.

    The

    ornamental

    industry

    is

    continuously

    enhancing

    its

    production, distribution, and marketing processes by leveraging

    existing agricultural technologies, while also exploring new and

    emerging ones. Below are several technologies that are either

    currently being utilized or hold promising potential for adoption

    within the ornamental industry.

    2 Biotechnology

    Biotechnology has made signiﬁcant advances in ornamental

    crops, such as ﬂowers and decorative plants (Darqui et al., 2017).

    Tissue culture has been employed to produce a large number of

    identical plants within short period and efﬁciently, which can be

    useful for breeding and propagating new varieties of ornamental

    Frontiers in Environmental Science

    Wani et al.

    10.3389/fenvs.2023.1188643

    crops (Din et al., 2022). This technique can also be used to

    produce new varieties of plants with desirable traits. Using

    genetic engineering technology and transgenics, new varieties

    of ornamental crops with desirable traits, such as brighter colors,

    longer vase life, resistant to insect pests have been developed

    (Table 1) (Azadi et al., 2016; Boutigny et al., 2020). Marker-

    assisted breeding has been used to identify desirable traits in

    ornamental crops, such as improved color or longer vase life

    (Ahn et al., 2020; Chandler and Tribe, 2022; Suprasanna and Jain,

    2022). This technique can be used to speed up the breeding

    process and create new varieties of ornamental crops more

    quickly. RNA interference has been used to silence speciﬁc

    genes in ornamental crops, leading to improved traits such as

    longer vase life or improved resistance to pests and diseases.

    Genome editing has been used to make precise edits to the DNA

    of ornamental crops, leading to improved traits (Table 1) (Sirohi

    et al., 2022; Ahmad et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2023). Overall,

    biotechnology has made signiﬁcant advances in ornamental

    crops, leading to new varieties of plants with improved traits,

    increased resistance to pests and diseases, and more sustainable

    production practices (Din et al., 2021). The spread of the

    commercialization of GM ornamentals has been impeded by

    economic

    and

    regulatory

    constraints

    despite

    the

    positive

    scientiﬁc outlook for transgenic ﬂowers. It is now time to deal

    with the legal challenges to the commercial distribution of GM

    plants, including ﬂowers. Due to the costs and skills required for

    commercial development, the release of ornamental items will

    remain

    exceedingly

    challenging

    in

    the

    absence

    of

    an

    internationally

    suitable

    and

    authorised

    framework

    for

    regulation of GM crops. Reduced regulatory requirements for

    decorative plants and other non-food plants are needed to reduce

    this nuisance (Noman et al., 2017). By leveraging these advances,

    horticulturists can produce new varieties of ornamental crops

    that are more resilient, beautiful, and sustainable. In this review,

    we have made an effort to highlight recent advances and the need

    for attention in order to maximise the long-term sustainability of

    technology and society (Table 1).

    3 Nanotechnology

    Nanotechnology is a ﬁeld of science that involves manipulating

    matter at the nanoscale level, which is typically between 1 and

    100 nm in size. In the ﬂower industry, nanotechnology is being

    explored for various applications, including improving ﬂower

    quality, disease resistance, and shelf life. One application of

    nanotechnology in ﬂowers is the use of nanoscale particles to

    improve the efﬁciency of fertilizers and pesticides. By attaching

    fertilizer or pesticide molecules to nanoparticles, growers can

    increase the efﬁciency of these products, reducing the amount

    needed and minimizing environmental impact. Nanoparticles can

    also be used to deliver nutrients and other compounds directly to

    plant cells, improving uptake and reducing waste. Another

    application of nanotechnology in ﬂowers is the development of

    nanosensors for monitoring plant growth and health. Nanosensors

    can be designed to detect changes in temperature, humidity, nutrient

    levels, and other factors that affect plant growth. Nano biosensors

    have the potential to revolutionize agriculture by not only

    monitoring soil and plant health but also by predicting outbreaks

    of pests or diseases. By detecting changes in the biochemical makeup

    of plants or soil at a molecular level, nano biosensors can provide

    farmers with early warning signs of potential problems (Rai et al.,

    2022). This allows them to take preemptive measures to mitigate the

    impact of these issues, such as applying targeted treatments or

    adjusting their growing practices. This information can be used

    to optimize growing conditions and improve ﬂower quality. In

    addition, nanotechnology can be used to develop materials with

    unique properties that are useful in the ﬂower industry. For example,

    researchers are developing nanomaterials that can absorb and

    release water slowly, helping to maintain proper moisture levels

    TABLE 1 Some speciﬁc examples of various biotechnological interventions in improving
    targeted ornamental traits.

    in ﬂower arrangements. Nanomaterials can also be used to develop

    coatings that improve the durability and longevity of ﬂowers,

    reducing waste and improving the sustainability of the industry.

    Cut ﬂowers have ornamental value and are commercially very

    important, but the ﬂowers’ shelf-life is very short (Solgi et al.,

    2009), due to higher microbial contamination (Lu et al., 2010a).

    The early wilting of the ﬂowers is due to microbial and stem barrier

    infection that causes stem blockage which limits the uptake and

    transport of water, leading to water imbalances (Lü et al., 2010; Witte

    et al., 2014). Hence, it is important to overcome stem blockage by

    controlling microbial infections. Several reports have suggested that

    nano-silver has the potential to broaden the vase life of cut ﬂowers

    (Li et al., 2012; Alekasir et al., 2017; Amingad et al., 2017). The most

    important nanoparticle, graphene oxide (GO) is a graphene-

    imitating carbon-based NPs containing enormous quantities of

    oxygenated groups with an extensive surface area that contributes

    a ﬁrst-rate capability to transfer nourishment for sluggish-discharge

    fertilizers (Zhang et al., 2014; Rana et al., 2021). Overall,

    nanotechnology has the potential to revolutionize the ﬂower

    industry by improving efﬁciency, reducing waste, and improving

    ﬂower quality and sustainability. While many of these applications

    are still in the research phase, they offer exciting possibilities for the

    future of ﬂower production and distribution.

    4 Smart greenhouse technology

    Greenhouse technology is widely used in horticulture to create

    an optimal growing environment for plants. Greenhouses allow

    growers

    to

    control

    the

    temperature,

    humidity,

    and

    other

    environmental factors to create an optimal growing environment

    for plants (Koukounaras, 2021). This can be particularly important

    for growing plants in regions with extreme climates or for producing

    crops out of season. Greenhouses can help to protect plants from

    pests and diseases by creating a barrier between the plants and the

    outside environment. This can help to reduce the need for pesticides

    and

    other

    chemical

    interventions

    (Messelink

    et

    al.,

    2021).

    Greenhouses can extend the growing season for plants by

    providing a sheltered environment that protects them from the

    elements. This can be particularly important for producing crops out

    of season or in regions with short growing seasons (Nassar and

    Ribeiro, 2020; Pereira et al., 2021). Greenhouses can help to conserve

    water by collecting and recycling irrigation water. This can be

    particularly important in regions with limited water resources or

    in areas with high water usage. Greenhouses can help to increase the

    productivity of horticultural crops by providing a controlled

    environment that promotes plant growth and reduces the risk of

    crop loss due to weather or pests. Greenhouses can help to maximize

    space utilization by allowing plants to be grown vertically or in

    tightly spaced rows (Stanghellini, 2013). This can help to increase

    the yield per unit area of land. Overall, greenhouse technology is a

    key tool in modern horticulture, allowing growers to produce high-

    quality crops year-round in a controlled environment. Keeping in

    view the sustainability there is an urgent need to upgrade or device

    smart greenhouses (Figure 1). Smart greenhouses use sensors and

    automation technology to monitor plant growth and create an

    optimal environment for ﬂowers to ﬂourish. This technology can

    increase crop yields, reduce waste, and improve the overall quality of

    the ﬂowers. By leveraging the beneﬁts of greenhouse technology,

    horticulturists can increase productivity, conserve resources, and

    produce crops that are healthier and more sustainable.

    5 Post-harvest technology

    Post-harvest technology in ﬂowers has advanced signiﬁcantly in

    recent years, with new technologies and techniques being developed

    to extend the vase life of cut ﬂowers and improve their quality. Here

    are some of the key advances in post-harvest technology in ﬂowers.

    Modiﬁed atmosphere packaging (MAP) involves storing cut ﬂowers

    FIGURE 1

    Conceptual design of smart greenhouse and individual overhead bench system.

    Wani et al.

    10.3389/fenvs.2023.1188643

    in an environment with controlled levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide,

    and humidity. This can help to extend the vase life of cut ﬂowers by

    reducing respiration rates and slowing the growth of bacteria and

    fungi. Ethylene is a gas produced by plants that can cause ﬂowers to

    wilt and decay. New technologies, such as ethylene-absorbing

    sachets and controlled atmosphere storage, can help to reduce

    the levels of ethylene around cut ﬂowers, extending their vase life

    (Yang et al., 2021). Temperature is a critical factor in post-harvest

    ﬂower care. New techniques, such as hydrocooling and forced-air

    cooling, can help to reduce the temperature of cut ﬂowers quickly

    after harvest, reducing respiration rates and extending vase life

    (Rabiza-Świder et al., 2021). The quality of water used to hydrate

    cut ﬂowers can affect their vase life. New techniques, such as reverse

    osmosis and ultraviolet sterilization, can help to improve the quality

    of water used in post-harvest ﬂower care. New treatments, such as

    pulsing with sugar or plant hormones, can help to extend the vase

    life of cut ﬂowers by promoting water uptake and reducing the

    growth of bacteria and fungi (Ichimura et al., 2007; Kazaz et al.,

    2019). Research and development in the ﬂoriculture industry are

    ongoing, and new chemicals are continually being developed to

    improve the vase life of cut ﬂowers. Here are some examples of new

    chemicals that have shown promising results in recent studies: Nitric

    oxide (NO): NO is a natural signaling molecule that plays a role in

    regulating plant growth and development. Studies have shown that

    treating cut ﬂowers with NO can delay senescence (the aging

    process) and increase vase life (Hussain et al., 2022). NO can

    also improve the quality of ﬂowers by enhancing color, scent,

    and overall appearance. Polyamines are organic compounds

    found in all living cells, including plants. They are involved in

    various physiological processes, such as cell division, differentiation,

    and stress response. Recent studies have shown that treating cut

    ﬂowers with polyamines, such as putrescine and spermidine, can

    improve their vase life by reducing senescence and preserving ﬂower

    quality (Qu et al., 2020; Mazrou et al., 2022). Chitosan is a

    biodegradable polymer derived from chitin, which is found in the

    shells of crustaceans. It has antimicrobial and antifungal properties

    and has been shown to improve the vase life of cut ﬂowers by

    reducing microbial growth and maintaining water balance (Ali et al.,

    2022). Essential oils: Essential oils are volatile compounds extracted

    from plants, and they have been used for centuries in various

    applications,

    including

    aromatherapy

    and

    medicine.

    Recent

    studies have shown that treating cut ﬂowers with essential oils,

    such as lavender and rosemary, can improve their vase life by

    reducing

    microbial

    growth

    and

    enhancing

    ﬂower

    quality

    (Teerarak et al., 2019; El-Sayed et al., 2021). Overall, advances in

    post-harvest technology in ﬂowers are helping to improve the

    quality

    and

    longevity

    of

    cut

    ﬂowers,

    reducing

    waste

    and

    improving the sustainability of the ﬂoral industry. By leveraging

    the latest technologies and techniques, horticulturists can produce

    high-quality ﬂowers that retain their beauty and freshness for longer

    periods of time.

    6 Smart irrigation technology

    Irrigation technology has been playing an essential role in ﬂower

    crop production by providing the right amount of water to the

    plants, increasing crop yield, and optimizing the use of water

    resources. In general, irrigation technology in ﬂower crops

    involves the application of water in the right amount and at the

    right time, using advanced systems and methods. One of the main

    advances in irrigation technology for ﬂower crops is the use of drip

    irrigation systems. These systems provide water directly to the root

    zone of plants, minimizing water loss due to evaporation and runoff.

    They also allow for precise control of water application, reducing the

    risk of over- or under-watering. Another irrigation technology that

    has gained popularity in recent years is the use of soil moisture

    sensors. These sensors measure the moisture content in the soil and

    provide real-time data to growers, allowing them to adjust irrigation

    schedules and avoid water stress or over-watering. In addition,

    advanced irrigation controllers are now available that use weather

    data to adjust irrigation schedules automatically based on the local

    climate conditions, further optimizing water use. Finally, fertigation

    technology is also being used in ﬂower crops, where fertilizers are

    injected into the irrigation system to provide nutrients directly to the

    roots. This approach ensures that the plants receive the necessary

    nutrients for healthy growth while minimizing fertilizer waste and

    runoff. Overall, irrigation technology has revolutionized ﬂower crop

    production by providing precise control over water and nutrient

    application, resulting in increased yields, improved quality, and

    reduced water usage. Automation through an IoT system could

    be an effective approach to improve a conventional surface irrigation

    system operation. An automated surface irrigation system refers to

    its operation with timers, sensors or computers or mechanical

    appliances with minimal manual involvement (Figure 2). Many

    researchers have reported that automation in irrigation projects

    using an intelligent irrigation controller and wireless sensor network

    could save water up to 38% (Al-Ghobari, et al., 2013; Bowlekar et al.,

    2019). Automation is a smart technique to deal with the problem of

    high labor requirements and low water application efﬁciency of

    surface irrigation systems (Table 2). Many soil moisture sensors

    such as tensiometer, gypsum block, granular matrix sensor, time-

    domain reﬂectometer, dielectric probe are commercially available

    for soil moisture measurement and they could generally be used for

    manual or integrated with automatic irrigation control systems

    through an IoT system (Bowlekar et al., 2019; Hardie, 2020; Vera

    et al., 2021; Pramanik et al., 2022). The sensor senses the water

    advance front and gives a signal to cut-off the ﬂow.

    Smart irrigation systems using Internet of Things (IoT)

    technology have been successfully implemented for ornamental

    crop production. For example, Banda-Chávez et al. (2018)

    developed an IoT-based sensor network using an IoT platform

    and soil moisture sensors (YL-69) to automate the irrigation of

    ornamental plants (Figure 2). Beeson and Brooks (2006) also used an

    evapotranspiration (ETo) model-based smart irrigation system for

    wax-leaf privet, reducing water usage by 22.22% annually compared

    to traditional overhead irrigation methods. While there are limited

    studies

    on

    IoT-based

    automatic

    irrigation

    systems

    for

    the

    ornamental industry, the promising potential of this technology

    in other crop industries suggests it could beneﬁt ornamental crop

    production. However, sensor-to-sensor variability and accurate

    sensor positioning are important factors that can affect efﬁcacy.

    Determining the optimal number of sensors for a particular nursery

    environment depends on various factors such as the accuracy and

    repeatability of the sensors, variation among sensors, spatial

    variability of the nursery environment, and cost.

    7 Soilless technology

    Limited resources, such as fertile soil and clean water, are already a

    reality in many parts of the world. Climate change further exacerbates

    the challenges of conventional farming practices, as the availability and

    quality of arable land become increasingly limited. Soilless cultivation,

    also known as hydroponics, is a method of growing plants without soil,

    using a nutrient-rich solution instead. By eliminating the need for soil,

    soilless cultivation systems can help conserve water and open up urban

    areas, such as residential rooftops, for food production in close

    proximity

    to

    consumers

    (Fussy

    and

    Papenbrock,

    2022).

    The

    development of automation and computer technology, coupled with

    the greenhouse feature, has accelerated the adoption of soilless

    cultivation

    in

    many

    developed

    countries

    in

    recent

    years.

    Conventional

    farming

    practices

    typically

    rely

    on

    soil-bound

    methods, which can have a range of negative impacts on the

    environment, including high and inefﬁcient water demand, large

    land requirements, fertilizer use, soil degradation, and loss of

    biodiversity. It is imperative to explore alternative approaches to

    food production, such as soilless cultivation, to address these

    challenges and ensure sustainable agricultural practices for the future

    (Killebrew and Wolff 2010; Walls 2006). In the ﬂower industry, soilless

    cultivation is gaining popularity due to its ability to improve crop yields,

    reduce water consumption, and minimize the use of pesticides and

    fertilizers (AlShrouf, 2017). One of the beneﬁts of soilless cultivation in

    ﬂowers is the ability to control growing conditions more precisely. By

    controlling the temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels of the

    growing solution, growers can optimize plant growth and ﬂower

    quality (Zimmermann and Fischer, 2020). Soilless cultivation also

    eliminates the need for soil, which can reduce the risk of soil-borne

    diseases and pests (Savvas, 2002; Hussain et al., 2014). There are several

    methods of soilless cultivation that can be used in the ﬂower industry

    (Kahraman and Akçal, 2018; Khalaj and Noroozharaf, 2020; Kromwijk

    and van Os, 2020). For example, one common method is to grow

    ﬂowers in a nutrient-rich solution that is recirculated through a series of

    pipes or channels. This method is known as a recirculating hydroponic

    system. Another method is to grow ﬂowers in a substrate, such as

    rockwool or coco coir, which is soaked in a nutrient-rich solution (Leiva

    et al., 2019; Kharrazi et al., 2020). This method is known as a substrate-

    based hydroponic system. Soilless cultivation can also be combined with

    other technologies to further improve ﬂower production. For example,

    some growers use vertical farming techniques to maximize space

    utilization

    and

    improve

    growing

    conditions.

    Vertical

    farming

    involves growing plants in stacked layers, using artiﬁcial lighting and

    environmental controls to optimize plant growth. Overall, soilless

    cultivation has the potential to revolutionize the ﬂower industry by

    improving crop yields, reducing water and fertilizer consumption, and

    minimizing the risk of pests and diseases. By using nutrient-rich

    solutions and advanced environmental controls, growers can

    produce

    high-quality

    ﬂowers

    with

    less

    waste

    and

    environmental impact (Figure 3).

    7.1 Aeroponics

    Aeroponics is a modern agricultural technique that involves

    growing plants in an air or mist environment without soil. Instead of

    soil, plants are grown in a nutrient-rich solution that is misted onto

    the roots. Aeroponics is becoming increasingly popular in ﬂower

    crop production because of its many advantages (Nir, 1982). One

    advantage of aeroponics is that it allows for more efﬁcient use of

    resources like water and nutrients. Because the nutrient solution is

    misted onto the roots, plants can absorb more of the nutrients and

    water than they would if they were grown in soil. This can lead to

    faster growth and higher yields. Another advantage of aeroponics is

    that it reduces the risk of disease and pests. Because plants are grown

    in a sterile environment, there is less chance of soil-borne diseases or

    pests affecting the crop. This can reduce the need for pesticides and

    other chemicals, making aeroponics a more sustainable and

    environmentally-friendly option. Aeroponics can also be used to

    grow ﬂowers year-round, regardless of weather conditions. This

    makes it possible to produce ﬂowers in areas where traditional

    outdoor growing methods may not be feasible. The performance of

    the system has been tested successfully (growing and rooting) with

    several plants, such as ornamental plants like carnation, croton,

    chrysanthemum,

    Eustoma

    geranium,

    euonymus,

    Ficus,

    philodendron, dracaena, dieffenbachia, Zantedeschia, etc (de Kreij

    and van der Hoeven, 1997; Christie and Nichols, 2004; Hayden,

    2006; Fascella and Zizzo, 2007). In order to analyse plant root

    systems for a variety of studies, researchers need a practical growing

    system. An aeroponic system that was created by a French engineer

    and modiﬁed by members of the legume community, was detailed by

    Cai et al. (2023) and was initially intended for nodulating legume

    root systems. For researchers looking to better understand root

    growth and development, this approach offers various beneﬁts. With

    this aeroponic device, researchers can grow hundreds of plants at

    once. Even though it is not a sterile system, it may be kept axenic in

    the lab with appropriate procedures. During plant growth, the

    nutritional medium can be changed based on the demands of the

    experiment. Overall, aeroponics is a promising technology for ﬂower

    crop production, offering many beneﬁts over traditional growing

    methods. However, it requires careful monitoring and management

    to ensure optimal plant growth and health.

    7.2 Smart vertical farming

    Vertical farming is a growing trend in the agriculture industry,

    and it is also being explored for ﬂower production. Vertical farming

    in ﬂowers involves growing plants in vertical layers, often in

    controlled environments, such as indoor facilities or greenhouses

    (Touliatos et al., 2016). Numerous countries including Korea, Japan,

    China, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, China, France, India,

    Sweden, Singapore, and the United States, have convened to discuss

    vertical farming. They have repeatedly endorsed the concept as

    integral to the long-term sustainability of their cities (Despommier,

    2014). Vertical farming can provide several beneﬁts to ﬂower

    growers (Figure 4). Firstly, it allows for the efﬁcient use of space,

    as plants can be stacked vertically, increasing the amount of

    production per unit area of land. Furthermore, indoor farming

    provides a low-impact system that can signiﬁcantly reduce travel

    costs, as well as reduce GHG emissions, by cutting down on travel

    distances between distant farms and local markets (Astee, and

    Kishnani, 2010; Mukherji and Morales, 2010). Also, vertical

    farming could ignite local economies by providing much-needed

    “green collar” jobs to urban areas (Healy and Rosenberg, 2013;

    Mukherji and Morales, 2010). This is particularly advantageous in

    urban areas where land is limited and expensive. Secondly, vertical

    farming can offer precise control over growing conditions, such as

    temperature,

    humidity,

    light,

    and

    nutrient

    levels,

    ensuring

    consistent plant growth and reducing the risk of disease and pest

    infestations (Al-Kodmany, 2018). By using artiﬁcial lighting and

    hydroponic or aeroponic systems, vertical farms can provide

    optimal growing conditions for ﬂowers, resulting in higher

    quality and more consistent blooms (Despommier, 2010; Eve,

    2015; Levenston, 2017; Meinhold, 2017). Thirdly, vertical farming

    can reduce the need for pesticides and herbicides, as plants are

    grown in a controlled environment with fewer pests and diseases.

    This reduces the environmental impact of ﬂower production and

    provides safer working conditions for growers. Finally, vertical

    farming

    can

    also

    reduce

    water

    usage,

    as

    hydroponic

    and

    aeroponic systems recycle water, reducing waste and conserving

    resources. While vertical farming in ﬂowers is still in its early stages,

    it has the potential to transform ﬂower production by providing a

    more sustainable, efﬁcient, and cost-effective way to grow ﬂowers.

    With further research and development, vertical farming could

    become a key method of ﬂower production in the future.

    8 Green roofs and walls

    Green roofs and walls are becoming more popular in urban areas

    as a way to add green space and reduce the urban heat island effect.

    Advances in materials and installation techniques have made it

    easier and more cost-effective to install and maintain these features.

    Green roofs and walls are innovative and sustainable solutions to

    improve urban environments by incorporating vegetation into

    buildings. Green roofs are roofs that are covered with plants and

    vegetation, often including a layer of soil and a drainage system, to

    support the growth of vegetation. They can provide several beneﬁts,

    including reducing urban heat island effects, improving stormwater

    management by retaining rainwater, and providing additional

    insulation to buildings to reduce energy consumption (Mayrand

    and Clergeau, 2018). They can also provide habitat for wildlife and

    improve air quality by ﬁltering pollutants (Haaland and van den

    Bosch, 2015). Green walls, also known as living walls or vertical

    gardens, are similar to green roofs, but they are installed vertically on

    the side of buildings. They can be made up of a variety of plant

    species and can be used for both aesthetic and functional purposes.

    Green walls can also provide similar beneﬁts to green roofs, such as

    improving air quality and reducing urban heat island effects. Both

    green roofs and walls require proper installation and maintenance to

    ensure their long-term viability. They can also provide unique

    opportunities for urban agriculture and rooftop gardens, creating

    additional beneﬁts for local communities. Overall, green roofs and

    walls are sustainable solutions to improve urban environments and

    promote green infrastructure (Elmqvist et al., 2015).

    Green roofs and walls can support a variety of vegetation,

    including ﬂower crops. In fact, adding ﬂower crops to green roofs

    and walls can increase their aesthetic value and provide

    additional beneﬁts to the environment. Flower crops such as

    sedum, lavender, and wildﬂowers are often used in green roofs

    due to their hardiness and ability to withstand harsh weather

    conditions. They can also attract pollinators, such as bees and

    butterﬂies, which play an important role in the pollination of

    plants. When it comes to green walls, ﬂower crops can be

    arranged in different patterns and designs to create beautiful

    living walls (Pétremand et al., 2017). For instance, a mix of

    ﬂowering plants such as petunias, pansies, and geraniums can

    be used to create a colorful and vibrant wall. In addition to their

    aesthetic beneﬁts, green roofs and walls with ﬂower crops can also

    provide environmental beneﬁts such as reducing urban heat

    island effects and improving air quality (Ode et al., 2023).

    They can also provide opportunities for urban agriculture,

    such as growing edible ﬂowers and herbs (Li et al., 2016).

    However, it is important to note that green roofs and walls

    with ﬂower crops require regular maintenance to ensure their

    health and viability. This includes proper irrigation, fertilization,

    and pest management. Overall, incorporating ﬂower crops into

    green roofs and walls can be a sustainable and beautiful solution

    for urban environments.

    9 Robotics

    Robotics is a rapidly developing ﬁeld that is also making strides in

    the ﬂoriculture industry. Despite the clear beneﬁts of existing

    approaches to robotizing harvesting operations in gardens, the

    relationship between a robot’s degree of autonomy and its ability to

    perform multiple agricultural tasks on a single platform has not been

    thoroughly investigated. Developing effective calculation methods will

    be crucial to unlocking the full potential of mobile robots by increasing

    their autonomy and expanding their functionality. At the same time, the

    issues of increasing the technical efﬁciency of solutions aimed at

    achieving a high level of robot autonomy require development. This

    can be achieved by applying intelligent approaches to the complex

    processing of data coming from a complex of information devices

    (Bechar et al., 2016; Grimstad, 2017) Robotics in ﬂower crops involves

    the use of automated and autonomous systems to perform various tasks

    related to the cultivation, care, and harvesting of ﬂower crops (Abarna

    and Selvakumar 2015). Robotic mowers, trimmers, and other

    automated maintenance equipment can now be used to maintain

    lawns and other outdoor spaces (Oliveira et al., 2021). In addition,

    the availability of a skilled workforce that accepts repetitive tasks in

    uncomfortable greenhouse conditions is decreasing rapidly, causing a

    reduced availability of workforce (Adegbola et al., 2019; Arad et al.,

    2020). Furthermore, the issue of labor shortage has become even

    more relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by

    the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has limited international travel for

    migrant workers (Woo et al., 2020). These machines can work

    continuously and efﬁciently, reducing the need for manual labor

    and improving overall maintenance quality. One signiﬁcant

    beneﬁt of using robotics in ﬂower crops is the potential for

    increased efﬁciency and productivity. Robots can work 24/7,

    perform tasks with precision and consistency, and work in

    harsh environments without risking the health and safety of

    human workers. Robots can be used to perform tasks such as

    planting, pruning, weeding, and harvesting (Sori et al., 2018;

    Uchida et al., 2019; Verbiest et al., 2020; Tarannum et al., 2021).

    For example, robots equipped with sensors, cameras, and other

    technology can navigate ﬁelds, identify ﬂowers, and accurately

    harvest them with minimal damage to the plant. Some examples

    of ﬂower harvest robots currently on the market include the

    Flower Robotics’ “Ryden” and the “Harvest Croo” system, which

    is designed speciﬁcally for harvesting strawberries but could

    potentially be adapted for use with other types of ﬂowers.

    QuickFlora is testing another robot ‘FloraBot’ to automate the

    ﬂower

    arrangement

    process.

    FloraBot

    designs

    advanced

    technologies which enable customers to automate the handling

    and assembly of fresh ﬂower arrangements something that was

    impossible in the past (www.ﬂora.bot). Everything starts with a

    vision of how to increase efﬁciency, improve product quality and

    provide scalability when needed, using ﬂower-friendly robotics.

    In simple terms, robots do things that have not been possible

    before in mass-production ﬂoral environments. We are able to

    automate the assembly of ﬂoral products and processes that were

    previously off-limits to automation. These robots can also

    monitor plant growth and detect any diseases or pests that

    could harm the crops, allowing for quicker response times to

    prevent the spread of disease and reduce the need for chemical

    treatments (Figure 5). Similar robots can be designed using a

    combination

    of

    computer

    vision

    and

    machine

    learning

    algorithms to recognize ﬂower types and colors and arrange

    them into a desired pattern or design. The robots can be

    equipped with a specialized gripper that can pick up and

    handle delicate ﬂowers without damaging them. Similarly,

    “Starship robots” are designed to transport food packages over

    short distances and have been successfully used to deliver ﬂowers

    to customers (www.starship.xyz). They are operated by Starship

    Technologies, a company founded by two Skype co-founders,

    Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis.

    An automated system for harvesting Gerbera jamesonii cut

    ﬂowers grown in greenhouses has been developed using image

    processing (Kawollek, and Rath, 2008). The harvesting process uses

    an industrial robot with six axes and an additional linear axis,

    equipped with an end-effector using razor blades for cutting the

    ﬂower stems. The whole harvesting system, including the robots,

    end-effectors, transport unit, and cameras, is calibrated online using

    special calibration algorithms. The system analyzes image data from

    eight different viewpoints to identify all ﬂower stems in at least one

    of the positions, enabling stepwise harvesting, if necessary, in

    different positions of the plant. To ensure a collision-free process,

    a path-planning module is integrated, and an algorithm for ﬂower

    stem tracking predicts the emerging of the stem in the following

    non-visible area. In harvesting experiments, 80% of all ﬂower

    stems were harvested, with a decreasing rate of harvest with an

    increasing number of ﬂower stems per plant. For plants with one

    or two ﬂower stems, 98% of the ﬂower stems were harvested,

    while for plants with ﬁve or more ﬂower stems, 51% of all ﬂower

    stems were harvested. Al-beeshi et al. (2015) designed a self-

    propelled robot, which can analyze soil moisture and monitor

    and adjust the water pump’s condition in order to activate the soil

    watering function. A multi-task robotic work cell for greenhouse

    transplanting and seedlings has been developed by Han et al.

    (2018). The work cell mainly consists of two conveyors, a ﬁlling

    unit, a control system, and a transplanting system, which is made

    up of multi-grippers designed to automatically pick up and plant

    whole rows of seedlings. Several studies have been conducted on

    the development of robots that can perform various agricultural

    tasks with precision and accuracy. Chang et al. (2016) developed

    a low-cost planting robot that can navigate straight lines with

    great accuracy. The robot is equipped with a drilling mechanism

    that can dig up to 30 cm depth, and an ultrasonic sensor is used to

    detect the drilling depth. Gao et al. (2017) designed a prototype of

    a robot sprayer that can adjust the spray angle according to crop

    height, canopy shape, thickness, and plant density. The system

    uses magnetic sensors installed on the tracks to detect the canopy

    ridge. Wang et al. (2022) designed an intelligent and modular

    greenhouse seedling inspection robot that can acquire images of

    seedlings and environmental data during cultivation. The robot’s

    environmental data collection module can accurately obtain data

    on

    the

    light

    intensity,

    temperature,

    humidity,

    and

    CO2

    concentration in the greenhouse. Masuzawa et al. (2017)

    developed

    a

    mobile

    robot

    capable

    of

    supporting

    ﬂower

    harvesting

    by

    utilizing

    a

    simultaneous

    localization

    and

    mapping (SLAM) algorithm to map the environment. The

    robot has an RGB-D camera installed not only to measure the

    distance to objects but also to allow for person-following

    capability. The robot uses image-based person detection and

    tracking and trajectory generation for following movements to

    trace the person’s trajectory as a guide to safe path planning. Ohi

    et al. (2018) utilized the same technology to develop a robot

    that can perform fully autonomous precision pollination of

    bramble plants in a greenhouse environment. The robot uses

    vision techniques to detect the position of ﬂowers for pollination,

    and an RGB-D camera installed on the robotic arm enables

    precise short-range positioning. These advancements in robot

    technology show great potential for improving agricultural

    practices and increasing efﬁciency in various tasks, from

    planting and spraying to harvesting and pollination. While

    the use of robotics in ﬂower crops is still in its early stages, it

    has the potential to signiﬁcantly improve the efﬁciency, quality,

    and

    sustainability

    of

    ﬂower

    production.

    However,

    the

    development and adoption of ﬂower harvest robots face

    challenges such as cost, technical complexity, and the need for

    further reﬁnement to ensure they can operate in diverse ﬁeld

    environments.

    By

    leveraging

    robotics,

    ﬂoriculturists

    can

    maximize their yields, reduce labor costs, and minimize their

    environmental impact, leading to a more sustainable and

    proﬁtable industry.

    10 Imaging technology

    Imaging technology has become an important tool for the

    ﬂoriculture industry. Imaging technology in ﬂower crops involves

    the use of advanced cameras and sensors to capture detailed images

    of plants, ﬂowers, and their surrounding environments. These

    imaging techniques include visible imaging (machine vision),

    imaging spectroscopy (multispectral and hyperspectral remote

    sensing), thermal infrared imaging, ﬂuorescence imaging, 3D

    imaging and tomographic imaging (MRT, PET and CT) (Li

    et al., 2014). These images are then analyzed using advanced

    algorithms and computer programs to provide insights into plant

    growth, development, and health. One of the primary applications of

    imaging technology in ﬂower crops is for the detection and diagnosis

    of plant diseases and pests (Saleem et al., 2020). By capturing high-

    resolution images of plants and analyzing them using artiﬁcial

    intelligence and machine learning algorithms, ﬂoriculturists can

    quickly and accurately detect early signs of disease or pest

    infestations, allowing for timely intervention and treatment

    (Sasaki et al., 1999; Chaerle et al., 2007). Imaging technology can

    also be used to monitor plant growth and development, including

    factors such as leaf area, stem diameter, and ﬂower size. This

    information can be used to optimize growth conditions, such as

    lighting, temperature, and irrigation, to maximize plant health and

    productivity

    (Nakarmi and

    Tang, 2012; Tilly et al., 2012;

    Longchamps et al., 2023).

    Plant phenotyping robots are cutting-edge technology that

    allows for the high-throughput measurement of morphological,

    chemical, and physiological properties of a large number of

    plants.

    Multiple

    robotic

    systems

    have

    been

    developed

    for

    different phenotyping missions. Robotic phenotyping has the

    potential to efﬁciently monitor changes in plant traits over time,

    both in controlled environments and in the ﬁeld (Ateﬁ et al., 2021).

    Various studies have discussed the use of image-based techniques,

    including 2D and 3D reconstruction, to extract architectural traits

    such as inﬂorescence length and width, inﬂorescence volume

    (weight), grain shape and size, grain angle, number of grains, and

    number of ﬂowers (Faroq et al., 2013; Crowell et al., 2014; Gage et al.,

    2017; Rudolph et al., 2019). To measure morphological traits in

    plant phenotyping, a robot equipped with LIDAR or a camera can

    automatically capture images or point cloud data from various

    angles of the inﬂorescence. Physiological traits are important

    indicators of stress or disease in plants. For example, the

    temperature of the spikes has been used to detect water stress in

    plants (Panozzo et al., 1999). A robotic arm equipped with a

    temperature sensor can potentially grasp the spike and insert the

    sensor into spikelets to record their temperature. In fruit quality

    Wani et al.

    10.3389/fenvs.2023.1188643

    assessment, various properties such as water content, sugar content,

    chlorophyll, carotenoid, soluble solids, acidity, and ﬁrmness need to

    be measured. Spectroscopy and spectral imagery are non-destructive

    and high-throughput methods that can be used to estimate these

    qualitative parameters (Ateﬁ et al., 2021; Shao and He, 2008; Wu

    et al., 2008; Nishizawa et al., 2009; Penchaiya et al., 2009; Ecarnot

    et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2013; Dykes et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015;

    Mancini et al., 2020). A robotic system can be utilized to monitor the

    dynamics of fruit attributes for hundreds of growing fruits per day.

    For instance, a portable spectrometer can be attached to the robot’s

    end-effector. The robot can detect the fruit on the plant, grasp it, and

    gather its spectral data to infer its quality parameters. This approach

    offers a high-throughput and non-destructive method for fruit

    quality

    assessment,

    enabling

    efﬁcient

    monitoring

    of

    fruit

    development over time. In addition, imaging technology can also

    be used to assess the quality of ﬂowers, providing insights into

    factors such as color, shape, and size, which are important for

    marketability and consumer appeal (Prunet and Duncan, 2020).

    Overall, imaging technology is proving to be a valuable tool in the

    ﬂoriculture industry, providing ﬂoriculturists with the ability to

    detect and treat plant diseases, optimize growth conditions, and

    improve the quality of their products.

    11 Computerized monitoring systems

    Computerized

    monitoring

    systems

    in

    agriculture

    are

    technology-driven systems that use sensors and automated data

    collection to track and monitor various aspects of crop production.

    These systems can provide farmers with real-time data on soil

    moisture,

    temperature,

    weather

    patterns,

    and

    other

    environmental factors, allowing them to make more informed

    decisions

    about

    irrigation,

    fertilization,

    and

    other

    inputs.

    Computerized monitoring systems can also be used to detect and

    respond to potential problems, such as pest infestations or disease

    outbreaks before they have a chance to cause signiﬁcant damage.

    Overall, computerized monitoring systems are helping to improve

    the efﬁciency and productivity of agricultural operations, while also

    reducing waste and environmental impact.

    12 Data analytics

    Data analytics is playing an increasingly important role in

    agriculture, helping farmers to make more informed decisions

    and improve crop yields. Here are some of the key areas of data

    analytics in agriculture: Predictive analytics: Predictive analytics

    uses data analysis techniques to make predictions about future

    outcomes, such as crop yields or weather patterns. This

    information

    can

    help

    farmers

    to

    make

    more

    informed

    decisions about planting, harvesting, and other aspects of

    agricultural

    production

    (Lassoued

    et

    al.,

    2021).

    Precision

    agriculture: Precision agriculture involves using data analytics

    to optimize crop production by tailoring inputs such as water,

    fertilizer, and pesticides to speciﬁc areas of a ﬁeld (Grifﬁn et al.,

    2018; Akhter et al., 2021). This approach can improve crop yields

    while reducing waste and environmental impact. Remote sensing:

    Remote sensing involves using satellites, drones, and other

    technologies to collect data on crop health, soil moisture, and

    other environmental factors. This data can be used to identify

    areas of a ﬁeld that require additional inputs or interventions.

    Data visualization tools can be used to display data in an easy-to-

    understand format, helping farmers to identify trends and make

    informed decisions (Kumar et al., 2019a; 2019b). For example,

    farmers can use data visualization tools to track weather patterns,

    crop yields, and other key metrics. Supply chain analytics: Supply

    chain analytics can be used to optimize the distribution and

    delivery of agricultural products, reducing waste and improving

    efﬁciency. Overall, data analytics is transforming agriculture by

    providing farmers with real-time data on crop health, weather

    patterns, and other environmental factors. By leveraging the

    power of data, farmers can make more informed decisions

    about planting, harvesting, and other aspects of agricultural

    production, contributing to a more sustainable and secure

    food supply.

    13 Internet of things (IoT)

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows

    devices to connect remotely to achieve smart farming (Patil and

    Kale, 2016). The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range of

    industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and

    agriculture, to enhance efﬁciency and performance across all

    markets (Elijah and Rahman, 2018; Sisinni et al., 2018; Shi

    et al., 2019). The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of

    connected devices and sensors that communicate and exchange

    data with each other. In the ﬂower industry, IoT is being used to

    improve the efﬁciency of ﬂower production and supply chain

    management.

    IoT

    sensors

    can

    be

    used

    to

    monitor

    environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and

    light levels, which are critical factors in ﬂower growth and

    development. By collecting data on these factors, growers can

    optimize growing conditions to ensure the best quality and yield of

    ﬂowers. For example, sensors can be used to adjust the temperature

    and humidity levels in a greenhouse to create the ideal

    environment for ﬂower growth. IoT can also be used to

    monitor the health and growth of ﬂowers. For instance, sensors

    can be placed on individual plants to measure their growth rate,

    nutrient uptake, and water consumption. This can help growers to

    identify any issues early on and take corrective measures before

    they become serious. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology

    enables the remote monitoring of plants and animals, retrieving

    information from mobile phones and other devices. Through the

    use of sensors and instruments, farmers can assess weather

    patterns and anticipate production levels. The IoT also plays a

    crucial role in water management, allowing for the monitoring and

    control of water ﬂow, assessment of crops’ water requirements, and

    optimization of water usage, like never before (Yong et al., 2018).

    With sensors and cloud connectivity through the gateway, the

    status of the water supply can be remotely monitored based on soil

    and plant needs (Mekala et al., 2017). The beneﬁts of IoT

    technology extend to correcting nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and

    diseases, as farmers cannot manually monitor every plant. This

    technology has ushered farmers into a new era of modern

    agriculture (Mittal and Singh, 2007). In addition, IoT can be

    can

    the

    temperature,

    humidity, and other conditions during shipping and alert

    growers and distributors if there are any deviations from the

    ideal conditions. Overall, IoT has the potential to improve the

    efﬁciency and quality of ﬂower production and supply chain

    management. By using IoT sensors and devices, growers and

    distributors can optimize growing conditions, reduce waste, and

    ensure the best quality and freshness of ﬂowers for consumers.

    14 Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)

    Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is a broad term that refers to the

    ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human

    intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-

    making. In the ﬂower industry, AI is being used to improve

    ﬂower production and quality, as well as to optimize supply

    chain management. One application of AI in ﬂowers is to

    analyze and interpret data from sensors and cameras to optimize

    growing conditions. AI algorithms can be used to analyze large

    datasets of environmental and plant growth data to identify patterns

    and make predictions about the optimal conditions for growing

    different types of ﬂowers (Figure 6). For example, AI algorithms can

    help growers optimize the amount of water, fertilizer, and light that

    ﬂowers receive, which can improve yield and quality (Song and He,

    2007; Eli-Chukwu, 2019; Vincent et al., 2019). Another application

    of AI in ﬂowers is to improve disease detection and prevention

    (Adedoja et al., 2019). AI algorithms can be trained to recognize the

    symptoms of different plant diseases and to detect them early on.

    This can help growers take corrective measures before the disease

    spreads and affects the entire crop. AI can also be used to develop

    predictive models for disease outbreaks based on environmental and

    weather data. In addition, AI can be used to optimize supply chain

    management by analyzing data from sensors and cameras to

    monitor

    the

    condition

    and

    location

    of

    ﬂowers

    during

    transportation (Figures 5, 6). AI algorithms can predict the best

    routes and transportation methods for delivering ﬂowers while

    minimizing waste and reducing costs (Wang et al., 2017).

    Overall, AI has the potential to improve the efﬁciency, quality,

    and

    sustainability

    of

    ﬂower

    production

    and

    supply

    chain

    management.

    By

    analyzing

    data

    and

    making

    predictions

    (Talaviya et al., 2020), AI can help growers optimize growing

    conditions, detect and prevent diseases, and improve supply

    chain logistics for delivering high-quality ﬂowers to consumers.

    15 Machine learning (ML)

    Machine learning is a type of artiﬁcial intelligence that enables

    computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time

    without being explicitly programmed. In the ﬂower industry, machine

    learning is being used to improve ﬂower production and quality, as well

    as to optimize supply chain management. One application of machine

    learning in ﬂowers is to analyze and interpret data from sensors and

    cameras to optimize growing conditions (Benos et al., 2021). Machine

    learning algorithms can be used to analyze large datasets of

    environmental and plant growth data to identify patterns and make

    predictions about the optimal conditions for growing different types of

    ﬂowers. For example, machine learning algorithms can help growers

    optimize the amount of water, fertilizer, and light that ﬂowers receive,

    which can improve yield and quality (Sun et al., 2019; Virnodkar et al.,

    2020). Another application of machine learning in ﬂowers is to improve

    disease detection and prevention. Machine learning algorithms can be

    trained to recognize the symptoms of different plant diseases and to

    detect them early on. This can help growers take corrective measures

    before the disease spreads and affects the entire crop. Machine learning

    can also be used to develop predictive models for disease outbreaks

    based on environmental and weather data. In addition, machine

    learning can be used to optimize supply chain management by

    analyzing data from sensors and cameras to monitor the condition

    and location of ﬂowers during transportation (Liakos et al., 2018; Zhang

    J. et al, 2021). Machine learning algorithms can predict the best routes

    and transportation methods for delivering ﬂowers while minimizing

    waste and reducing costs.

    The integration of IoT, AI, and machine learning has signiﬁcant

    potential to revolutionize ﬂower production and supply chain

    management (Figure 7). IoT sensors and devices can help

    growers and distributors optimize growing conditions and reduce

    waste, while AI and machine learning can help them make data-

    driven decisions to improve efﬁciency, quality, and sustainability.

    For instance, the use of IoT sensors can monitor factors such as soil

    moisture, temperature, and light levels, helping growers create the

    ideal growing conditions for each ﬂower variety. This can lead to

    increased yields, reduced water usage, and lower energy costs.

    Additionally, IoT devices can monitor the ﬂowers’ post-harvest

    conditions, ensuring they are stored and transported at optimal

    temperatures to maintain their quality and freshness. The use of AI

    and machine learning can further enhance ﬂower production and

    FIGURE 6

    supply chain management. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI

    can help growers make informed decisions on when to harvest their

    crops, reducing waste and increasing efﬁciency. AI can also predict

    and detect diseases early, allowing growers to take preventive

    measures

    and

    reduce

    the

    need

    for

    harmful

    pesticides.

    Furthermore, machine learning can help growers optimize their

    logistics and supply chain management, ensuring that ﬂowers reach

    consumers quickly and efﬁciently. By analyzing historical data on

    demand and supply, machine learning can help growers forecast

    demand accurately, reducing overproduction and minimizing waste.

    In conclusion, the integration of IoT, AI, and machine learning can

    help ﬂower growers and distributors to create a more efﬁcient,

    sustainable, and high-quality supply chain. By leveraging these

    technologies, they can reduce waste, improve growing conditions,

    and deliver fresher, higher-quality ﬂowers to consumers. This not

    only

    beneﬁts

    the

    ﬂower

    industry

    but

    also

    helps

    promote

    sustainability and environmental protection.

    16 Radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID

    tags)

    RFID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation) technology is an automated

    identiﬁcation system that uses radio waves to transfer data between a tag

    attached to an object and a reader. A Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation

    (RFID) tag functions as a barcode that can hold information (Kumar

    and Srivastava, 2014). There are two main types of RFID tags: active and

    passive, with a variety of shapes and forms available for different

    applications (Fernandez, 2014). Passive tags can be made from

    paper, plastic, or vinyl (Want, 2006) and are designed to withstand

    continuous exposure to the elements, including water, heat, dirt, and

    chemicals, making them suitable for outdoor nursery production

    environments. Each RFID label has a unique identiﬁcation code and

    can be encoded with important production information such as genus,

    species, cultivar, and planting dates. Passive RFID labels are relatively

    inexpensive, and as adoption increases, costs are expected to decrease

    due to economies of scale. These labels are read using a speciﬁc UHF

    radio frequency with an RFID interrogator. One of the advantages of

    RFID in agricultural operations is that it does not require a clean label,

    unlike barcodes which can be obscured by dirt or damage (Ruiz-Garcia

    and Lunadei, 2011). RFID tags have been used for tagging and tracking

    animals and plants, health monitoring (Wang et al., 2006), identifying

    and tracking livestock, and monitoring irrigation system management

    (Floyd 2015; Deng et al. 2020).

    In the ﬂower industry, RFID technology is used for tracking and

    tracing ﬂowers from the ﬁeld to the store, providing greater transparency

    and efﬁciency in the supply chain (Ampatzidis et al., 2009; Jones et al.,

    2005; Verdouw et al., 2013). One application of RFID in ﬂowers is the

    tracking of individual ﬂower stems from the time they are harvested to

    the time they are sold. Each stem can be tagged with an RFID tag, which

    contains information about the grower, variety, and other key details. As

    the ﬂowers move through the supply chain, RFID readers can be used to

    track their location and monitor temperature and humidity levels,

    ensuring that the ﬂowers are properly handled and stored (Luvisi

    et al., 2010). RFID tags are also used to monitor temperature and

    humidity during transport, ensuring that the ﬂowers are kept in optimal

    conditions (Dose et al., 2021). RFID technology can also be used to

    improve inventory management and reduce waste in the ﬂower industry.

    By tracking the movement of ﬂowers in real-time, retailers can better

    manage their inventory levels, reducing the risk of overstocking or

    stockouts. This can help to reduce waste by ensuring that ﬂowers are sold

    before they spoil or lose their freshness.

    Another application of RFID in ﬂowers is the ability to provide

    consumers with information about the ﬂowers they are purchasing.

    By scanning the RFID tag with a smartphone or other device,

    consumers can access information about the ﬂower’s origin,

    growing conditions, and other details. This can help to build

    trust between consumers and growers and promote greater

    sustainability and transparency in the industry. Overall, RFID

    technology offers numerous beneﬁts for the ﬂower industry,

    including improved supply chain efﬁciency, better inventory

    management, and greater transparency for consumers. As RFID

    technology continues to evolve, its use in the ﬂower industry will

    likely become even more widespread and impactful.

    17 LED (Light Emitting Diode)

    LED (Light Emitting Diode) technology is revolutionizing the

    way ﬂowers are grown by providing a more efﬁcient and

    customizable light source for plants (Al Murad et al., 2021).

    LEDs are more energy-efﬁcient than traditional light sources, and

    they can be tuned to speciﬁc wavelengths that optimize plant growth

    and ﬂowering. One application of LEDs in ﬂower cultivation is in the

    production of cut ﬂowers. By using LEDs to provide the optimal

    light spectrum for ﬂower growth, growers can achieve faster growth,

    increased ﬂower size, and improved color and fragrance. This can

    help to increase yield and quality while reducing production costs, as

    LEDs use less energy than traditional lighting methods (Table 3).

    Another application of LEDs in ﬂowers is in the production of

    potted plants and indoor ﬂowers (Mills-Ibibofori, et al., 2019; Kang

    et al., 2019). LEDs can be used to provide a speciﬁc light spectrum

    that promotes healthy growth, even in low-light environments. This

    can be particularly useful in urban areas or areas with limited access

    to natural light, where plants may struggle to thrive without artiﬁcial

    lighting. In addition, LEDs can be used to control the timing and

    quality of ﬂower blooms (Paradiso and Proietti, 2022). By adjusting

    the light spectrum and duration, growers can induce ﬂowers to

    bloom at speciﬁc times of the year or in response to certain

    environmental cues. This can be particularly useful for the

    production

    of

    holiday

    ﬂowers,

    such

    as

    Cyclamen,

    chrysanthemums, poinsettias, gerberas, petunias, Easter lilies

    (Heo et al., 2003; Higuchi et al., 2012; Park et al., 2016; Mills-

    Ibibofori, et al., 2019). However, in general, studies investigating the

    effects of LED light on ﬂower crops typically vary in terms of the

    speciﬁc ﬂower species (Mills-Ibibofori et al., 2019) being studied, the

    type and intensity of the LED light used, the duration and timing of

    the light treatments, and the speciﬁc growth or developmental

    parameters being measured (Craig and Runkle, 2013; Park and

    Runkle, 2016; Matysiak, 2021; Vendrame et al., 2022). These studies

    often aim to optimize plant growth and development, increase

    yield, improve ﬂower quality and color, or reduce disease

    The study showed that short-day plants have their long night interrupted most
    effectively by a moderate-to-

    high R:FR ratio of 0.66, and that ﬂowering is not regulated by FR light alone.
    In all species, stem length

    increased quadratically with the increase in R:FR ratio during the night interruption,

    incidence (Cioc et al., 2022; Rashidi et al., 2023). Results can vary

    widely depending on these factors, and further research is needed

    to better understand the effects of LED lighting on ﬂower crops

    under

    different

    growing

    conditions.

    Overall,

    LEDs

    offer

    numerous beneﬁts for the ﬂower industry, including improved

    growth and ﬂowering, reduced energy costs, and greater control

    over bloom timing and quality. As LED technology continues to

    evolve, it is likely that its use in the ﬂower industry will become

    even more widespread and impactful.

    be

    created

    for

    educational

    or

    entertainment purposes, allowing users to explore and learn

    about different types of ﬂowers in a virtual environment. One

    advantage of virtual ﬂowers is that they can be created and shared

    easily and quickly, without the need for physical ﬂowers or

    transportation. This can be particularly useful for events or

    occasions

    where

    ﬂowers

    may

    be

    difﬁcult

    to

    obtain

    or

    transport, such as in remote or urban areas. Virtual ﬂowers

    also offer the opportunity for greater customization and

    personalization than traditional ﬂowers. Users can choose

    from a wide range of ﬂower types, colors, and arrangements

    to create a unique and personalized gift or message. Virtual

    ﬂowers can also be easily modiﬁed or updated, allowing for

    changes in color or arrangement to suit different preferences

    or occasions. Overall, virtual ﬂowers offer a fun and creative way

    to enjoy the beauty of ﬂowers in a digital environment. While

    they cannot replace the physical experience of receiving or giving

    real ﬂowers, they offer a unique and convenient alternative for

    those who may not have access to physical ﬂowers or who want to

    explore the creative possibilities of digital technology.

    other

    professionals

    in

    the

    landscaping industry. It allows them to create detailed and

    accurate models of outdoor spaces, reducing the risk of errors

    and misunderstandings.

    20 Drone mapping

    Drones equipped with cameras and sensors can be used to

    create detailed maps of landscapes, Drone mapping is becoming

    an increasingly popular technology in the ﬂoriculture and

    landscaping industries. It involves using drones equipped

    with cameras to capture high-resolution aerial images of a

    landscape,

    allowing

    designers

    to

    analyze

    topography,

    vegetation, and other factors that can affect the design and

    maintenance of outdoor spaces which can then be used to

    create detailed maps, 3D models, and other visualizations

    (Kleinschroth et al., 2022). Here are some of the ways that

    drone mapping is being used in ﬂoriculture and landscaping:

    Site surveys: Drones can be used to quickly and accurately survey

    a landscape, allowing designers and landscapers to gather

    detailed information about the topography, vegetation, and

    other features of the site. Plant health monitoring: Drones

    Precision application of inputs: Drones equipped with spraying

    equipment can be used to apply fertilizers, pesticides, and other

    inputs to crops and landscaping areas with greater precision

    than traditional ground-based methods (Hassler and Baysal-

    Gurel, 2019). This can reduce waste, improve efﬁciency, and

    reduce the risk of damage to non-target areas. Overall, drone

    mapping is a powerful tool for ﬂoriculture and landscaping

    professionals, providing a detailed and accurate view of a

    landscape from above. It can help improve efﬁciency, reduce

    waste, and improve the health and productivity of plants and

    other vegetation.

    install, and maintain outdoor spaces. These technologies are

    helping to create more sustainable and enjoyable landscapes

    that can beneﬁt both people and the environment.

    22 Blockchain technology

    Blockchain technology is a secure and decentralized database

    system that has been adopted in various industries, including

    agriculture. In the ﬂower industry, blockchain technology is

    being explored as a means to improve supply chain management,

    traceability, and transparency. Blockchain technology can provide a

    secure and transparent record of every transaction along the ﬂower

    supply chain, from the grower to the retailer. This can help to

    increase consumer trust by ensuring that the ﬂowers are grown and

    distributed

    sustainably

    and

    ethically.

    By

    using

    blockchain

    technology,

    consumers

    can

    verify

    the

    origin,

    quality,

    and

    freshness

    of

    ﬂowers,

    and

    can

    be

    conﬁdent

    that

    they

    are

    purchasing a genuine product. In addition, blockchain technology

    can help to reduce the risk of fraud, counterfeiting, and mislabeling

    in the ﬂower industry. It can provide a secure and tamper-proof

    record of every step in the supply chain, which can help to identify

    any irregularities or inconsistencies. This can help to reduce waste,

    increase efﬁciency, and save costs. Furthermore, blockchain

    technology can also provide beneﬁts to ﬂower growers by

    improving payment systems and reducing transaction costs. By

    using blockchain-based payment systems, growers can receive

    payment faster, without the need for intermediaries such as

    banks or payment processors. Overall, blockchain technology has

    the potential to transform the ﬂower industry by improving

    transparency, traceability, and efﬁciency throughout the supply

    chain.

    With

    further

    adoption

    and

    development,

    blockchain

    technology

    could

    become

    a

    key

    tool

    in

    ensuring

    the

    sustainability, quality, and authenticity of ﬂowers for consumers

    around the world.

    23 E-commerce platforms

    E-commerce platforms allow for online sales of ﬂowers and

    plants, making it easier for customers to purchase and receive

    products. Here are some global e-commerce platforms for ﬂowers:

    Interﬂora: A global ﬂower delivery service that operates in over

    140 countries, providing same-day and next-day ﬂower delivery options.

    Florist.com: A global online ﬂower delivery service that offers a

    wide range of ﬂoral arrangements and gift options for various occasions.

    To address existing challenges and promote sustainable large-

    scale production of ornamental plants, innovative solutions are

    being developed (Cardoso and Vendrame, 2022). One such

    project, FloraGuard (Lavorgna et al., 2020), aims to combat

    the illegal online market of endangered plants by tracking,

    providing

    information,

    strengthening

    legislation,

    and

    exploring strategies. This initiative seeks to reduce the over-

    collection and commercialization of threatened or endangered

    plants that are unlawfully extracted from their natural habitats.

    24 Conclusion and future prospectus

    The ﬂower industry has experienced noteworthy beneﬁts due to

    the ongoing advancement of technology, including enhanced

    efﬁcacy in production procedures, superior ﬂower quality, and

    increased proﬁtability. As the ﬂoral sector experiences further

    development and expansion, the imperative for sustainable and

    ethical methodologies becomes increasingly pressing. The overuse

    of pesticides and fertilisers in ﬂower cultivation is a signiﬁcant

    ecological issue that can result in detrimental consequences for

    the environment and the wellbeing of labourers engaged in the

    production process. The implementation of precision agriculture

    methodologies, which entail the utilisation of sensors and data

    analytics, can potentially mitigate the excessive application of

    chemicals by furnishing precise insights regarding soil quality,

    pest invasions, and crop nourishment necessities. In addition, the

    adoption of biodegradable packaging materials and the integration

    of energy-efﬁcient systems within the ﬂower production sector can

    substantially

    mitigate

    the

    industry’s

    carbon

    emissions.

    The

    attainment of this objective can be realised by embracing

    sustainable energy alternatives, such as solar or wind energy, and

    integrating circular economy tenets, which involve the recycling or

    repurposing of waste materials. One additional ethical issue

    prevalent

    in

    the

    ﬂower

    industry

    pertains

    to

    the

    potential

    exploitation of labour in developing nations, which serve as the

    primary location for ﬂower cultivation. In order to tackle this matter,

    it is possible to implement fair trade practises and certiﬁcations,

    which can guarantee that labourers are remunerated equitably,

    provided with secure working environments, and granted access

    to

    educational

    and

    healthcare

    resources.

    Moreover,

    the

    utilisation of technology can facilitate the advancement of

    social and economic growth within regional communities by

    creating

    novel

    employment

    prospects

    and

    fostering

    entrepreneurial

    activities.

    platforms has the potential to establish a direct connection

    between consumers and small-scale ﬂower growers, thereby

    obviating the requirement for intermediaries and augmenting

    the proﬁt margins of the growers. To conclude, the ﬂower

    industry must prioritise sustainability, ethical practices, and

    social responsibility in the development and implementation

    of novel technologies. By endorsing these principles, the ﬂoral

    industry can sustain its growth and satisfy the increasing need for

    aesthetically pleasing and signiﬁcant ﬂowers, all while making a

    positive impact on both the environment and society.

    Water scarcity is a major challenge in the agriculture industry, and traditional
    irrigation methods are often wasteful and inefficient. To address this challenge,
    a smart solar irrigation system that uses loT and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
    algorithms can optimize water usage for agriculture. The system can provide automated
    irrigation, improve crop yields, and reduce water consumption. This paper proposes
    a design and implementation methodology of a smart solar irrigation system using
    loT and ANN algorithms. The system includes solar panels, a water pump, a water
    storage tank, sensors, loT devices, and ANN algorithms. The system is designed
    to automate the irrigation process by controlling the water pump based on the
    data collected from the sensors. Key words: Smart irrigation / IoT / Machine Learning

    \ \n \nAbstract— Designing an efficient irrigation system is a crucial issue in\
    \ \nagriculture, due to water scarcity problem around the world with the need\
    \ of \nincreasing agricultural production to satisfy the demands of the enlargement\
    \ of \npopulation. Therefore, to design a smart irrigation system, a real monitoring\
    \ of \nfield’s information that affects the watering status is required which\
    \ can be \nachieved with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In this paper, an irrigation\
    \ \nsystem based WSN is proposed to save water, power, labor, and as a result,\
    \ \nsaving cost with production and profit increase. Sensor nodes collect field\
    \ data \nto be sent to the Raspberry pi, as a main controller, to make optimal\
    \ decisions \nabout irrigation process. The field data includes the sensor readings\
    \ of \ntemperature and soil moisture. Crop evapotranspiration is also considered;\
    \ \nthus, the required amount of water is estimated with a particular irrigation\
    \ time \nto avoid over irrigation that hurts the plants growth and yields quality.\
    \ The \nobtained results show the efficiency of the proposed system operation\
    \ and \ncontrolling on the irrigation process. These results are taken for tomato\
    \ plant \nas a case study. The monitoring tools are used to verify the suggested\
    \ algorithm \neffectiveness in irrigation scheduling. \nIndex Terms— Evapotranspiration,\
    \ Irrigation systems, Raspberry pi, WSN. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n       Irrigation\
    \ in agriculture consumes about 85% of the total consumed water in the world and\
    \ this \nwill increase rapidly with the increase of population [1]. Therefore,\
    \ developing an optimal irrigation \nsystem is necessary to reduce cost, power\
    \ and water consumption depending on real physical \ninformation instead of predicted\
    \ one [2]. Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have a \nsignificant role\
    \ in many application, such as environmental monitoring, medical, agricultural\
    \ and others \ndue to its flexibility and ability of processing data in different\
    \ environments with an easy programming \n[3]-[4]. In agriculture, natural resources\
    \ can be utilized in an efficient way using WSNs to gather real-\ntime information\
    \ on soil, weather, and plant growth. Therefore, farmers use this data to make\
    \ smart \ndecisions regarding to planting to get better yields and increase profits\
    \ [5].  \nMany studies proposed smart irrigation systems based on WSNs with limited\
    \ sensors’ readings \n(soil moisture, air temperature and humidity sensors only),\
    \ without referring to other climatic conditions \nsuch as wind speed, sun radiation.\
    \ In addition, most of these researches used simulation models to verify \nthe\
    \ suggested system’s operation. In [6], an  Internet of Things (IoT) based Smart\
    \ AgroTech system \nwas proposed to improve farm production using efficient monitoring\
    \ and scheduling irrigation process \nusing WSNs with ESP8226 controller. The\
    \ collected data from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and \nhumidity) compared\
    \ with real data using comparative analysis and results showed an acceptable error\
    \ \non the charge of lacking in coverage area. While in [7], authors developed\
    \ a smart drip irrigation system \n \n73 \nReceived 30/July/2021; Accepted 7/November/2021\

    \ (IJCCCE), Vol. 22, No. 1, March 2022             \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.33103/uot.ijccce.22.1.8\
    \ \n \ndepending on real-time soil moisture data in a greenhouse tomato’s crop.\
    \ A comparative study between \nthe proposed system and other irrigation systems\
    \ was done with results approved that the giving system \nis efficient to deal\
    \ with food security and water scarcity issues. In [8], a smart agriculture system\
    \ was \ndeveloped with an open source and not expensive hardware components like\
    \ built a WSN using Arduino \nand Raspberry Pi to get a cost-effective system.\
    \ The fuzzy logic control was used as a decision method \nfor the amount and duration\
    \ of irrigation. An automated irrigation system based on IOT was presented \n\
    in [9], this was done by distributing different sensors in the farm (soil moisture,\
    \ temperature and \nhumidity) and the reads are entered to a machine learning\
    \ algorithm. Authors in [10] proposed an \nautomated drip irrigation system using\
    \ real-time fuzzy inference method and WSN implemented in \nLaboratory Virtual\
    \ Instrument Workbench platform (LABVIEW). In [11], a monitoring and control \n\
    irrigation system was proposed based on multi agent system and artificial intelligence.\
    \ The WSN \ngathered data from environment to evaluate the actual need of water\
    \ every five minutes and weather \nmap used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration\
    \ precisely. Moreover, authors in [12] presented \nan automated drip irrigation\
    \ with fertigation system based on WSN. It utilized soil moisture data and \n\
    evapotranspiration for prediction of required water to irrigate the area. This\
    \ system proposed also a \ntransmission method between cluster head and a base\
    \ station based on Travelling Salesman Protocol \n(TSP) to reduce power consumption\
    \ in data transmission. The results approved that the proposed system \nused water\
    \ efficiently. In [13], a developed real-time agriculture application was presented\
    \ using multi-\nlayered architecture containing three technologies (Internet of\
    \ Things, cloud computing and context \nawareness).  \nAt the other hand, authors\
    \ in the smart drip irrigation system proposed in [14] used smartphone to \ncapture\
    \ soil image. Calculations were made on the image to know the level of wetness\
    \ and send the data \nto a microcontroller to take an irrigation decision depending\
    \ on the captured image in smartphone and \nsensors output. Authors of [15] proposed\
    \ a control system to control environmental parameters that \naffect the crop\
    \ production. Three parts included in the control system: hardware component,\
    \ web \napplication and mobile application. Authors of  [16] presented a Solar\
    \ Photovoltaic Watering System \n(SPVWS) with multithreading design and virtual\
    \ timers. Raspberry pi was used due to its efficient \nperformance with real time\
    \ applications. By multithreading programming used in the system, \ncontrolling\
    \ the system and HTTP server job working concurrently to give remote control of\
    \ the \nirrigation system and online monitoring of data. Authors in [17]  suggested\
    \ a smart farm management \nsystem based on WSN to schedule irrigation,  feed\
    \ animals, and manage farm production. For irrigation \nscheduling, an Arduino\
    \ UNO microcontroller controls soil moisture, temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ \nwhich were used to gather real-time data relating water status in soil and\
    \ air temperature and humidity. \nThe microcontroller sends the collected data\
    \ to control center via Bluetooth for processing and storing \nin data base. Control\
    \ information is sent from control center to the Arduino to manage irrigation\
    \ process.  \n The proposed system in [18] used IOT to automate controlling and\
    \ monitoring of irrigation \nprocess. Sensor devices collected environmental data\
    \ from the field and regression algorithm used this \ndata to determine water\
    \ requirements in a day. Authors of [19] proposed a watering system with future\
    \ \nprediction of soil moisture content using Neural Network. The expectation\
    \ strategy utilized the collected \ndata from sensors such as soil and weather\
    \ parameters. Authors of [1] proposed an automated irrigation \nsystem based on\
    \ WSN to gather data for irrigation process decision. A web application in smartphones\
    \ \nalso used to give notifications when the soil is dry or the level of the water\
    \ in the tank is low. The WSN \nconnected with the server using 4G-Long-Term Evolution\
    \ (LTE) technology due to its flexibility. In \naddition, authors in [20] presented\
    \ a simulation model to a smart irrigation system based on WSN. In \nthe proposed\
    \ model, WSN used cluster topology to ensure a scalable network and increase sensors\
    \ life \ntime. The proposed system used fuzzy inference system to irrigation control.\
    \ Simulation results showed \nthat the system performance is accurate with economical\
    \ use of water and power.  \n \n74 \nReceived 30/July/2021; Accepted 7/November/2021\

    \ \n \nIn this paper, a smart on-demand irrigation system is proposed based on\
    \ WSN. Two sensor nodes \nare used to detect watering status, and send real-time\
    \ data to raspberry pi for optimizing the right \ndecision about starting or stopping\
    \ irrigation process. In addition, the Raspberry pi determines the \nrequired\
    \ amount of water depending on climatic conditions and crop data, and irrigation\
    \ run time is also \ncalculated to specify how long the particular plant should\
    \ irrigate. As a case study, the tomato plant data \nis chosen to verify the operation\
    \ of the proposed system. Table I shows a short brief of the work in the \nprevious\

    \ need for extra \ntransmission hardware.   \n- system is implemented \nin hardware\
    \ with results \nverified its desired \noperation. \nII. THE PROPOSED IRRIGATION\
    \ SYSTEM \n A smart control and monitoring irrigation system based on WSNs is\
    \ proposed in this work to detect \nthe plants need of water and schedule the\
    \ irrigation process accordingly. An overview of the suggested \nsystem is presented\
    \ in Fig. 1. For each node, soil moisture and temperature sensors are connected\
    \ with \nESP8266 microcontroller and used to collect data from the field. Soil\
    \ moisture sensor is used to detect \nthe witness of the soil, while temperature\
    \ sensor is used to detect air temperature. Sensor readings are \nsent from the\
    \ controller to Raspberry pi using WiFi connection and MQTT protocol to make decision\
    \ \nabout starting or stopping the irrigation process. Raspberry pi sends control\
    \ commands to ESP8266 \nmicrocontroller to switch on/off of water pump with the\
    \ aid of WiFi connection and MQTT protocol. \nIn addition, the amount of the water\
    \ and the time required to run the irrigation process is determined by \nRaspberry\
    \ pi using climatic data stored in a server data base to calculate reference evapotranspiration.\

    \ https://doi.org/10.33103/uot.ijccce.22.1.8 \n \nThe work flow of the proposed\
    \ algorithm can be explained in the following steps:  \n \n1. After powering up\
    \ the system, ESP8266 microcontroller sends sensors reading to Raspberry pi \n\
    with WiFi connection and MQTT protocol.  \n2. The Raspberry pi, as a base station\
    \ in the system, is responsible of making irrigation decision \nand scheduling\
    \ process. So, it receives sensors reading, sends it to server for monitoring\
    \ using \nNode-RED tool.  \n3. The Raspberry pi makes the necessary calculations\
    \ to estimate crop water requirements as well \nas irrigation run time using equations\
    \ (1) – (6), while the microcontroller continues reading \nsensors at the same\
    \ time.   \n4. The decision of starting irrigation or not depends on soil moisture\
    \ sensor reading. If the reading \nbelow a preferred threshold value for a particular\
    \ crop, then irrigation is started by sending \npower on command from Raspberry\
    \ pi to ESP8266 to power on water pump for a specific time \nwith a continuous\
    \ check of soil moisture value to avoid over irrigation that harms plant growth\
    \ \nand crop production. When sensor reading is above the determined threshold\
    \ value or irrigation \nrun time ends, Raspberry pi sends power off command to\
    \ ESP8266 to stop water pump and \nstarts the operation again. \n \n  In the implementation\
    \ of the proposed irrigation system as a prototype, different        \nhardware\
    \ components are utilized including:  \n \n \nLaptop \n \nRaspberry pi 4 Model\
    \ B [25] \n \nESP8266 microcontroller[26] \n \nFC-28 soil moisture sensor [27]\

    TABLE III. TOMATO CROP WATER REQUIREMENTS  \n \nIn this paper, LEDs are used to\
    \ verify system’s operation. When Raspberry pi sends power on \ncommand to ESP8266\
    \ microcontroller, LEDs are turned ON, for a particular time equals to irrigation\
    \ \nrun time determined by Raspberry pi. On the other hand, they are turnned OFF,\
    \ with power off \ncommand.  \nFig. 6 shows system’s monitoring on server with\
    \ Node-RED dashboards. A temperature guage and \nchart are used in Fig. 6.a to\
    \ mointor temperature sensors reading, in addition to LED status, which is \n\
    turnned ON when air temperature exceeds 25 C (according to Raspberry pi commands)\
    \ and it is turnned \nOFF otherwise. Fig. 6.b-d show soil moisture monitoring\
    \ windows, soil moisture sensor reading range \nis between 0 and 1024 with 0 represent\
    \ 100% moisture and 1024 represent 0%. As mentioned earliar, \nthe preferred soil\
    \ moisture value for tomato crop is between 70-80%. After mapping the reading\
    \ of the \nproposed sensor, the results show that a 70% moisture is equal to 430.\
    \ Therefore in system design, when \na Raspberry pi receives a moisture sensor\
    \ reading above 430, a power ON command must be sent to \nESP8266 to turn ON the\
    \ specific water pump for starting irrigation process with a particular irrigation\
    \ \ntime. In the moisture monitoring window, a LED repersents a water pump status,\
    \ it is turnned ON with \ntimer when irrigation is required and it is turnned\
    \ OFF otherwise. ESP8266 is programmed with C \nprogramming language and Arduino-IDE\

    \ based WSNs was proposed to enhance crops production \nby maintaining an efficient\
    \ amount of water that is necessary to get a good quality crop. Sensors reading\
    \ \nas well as weather information are used as inputs to the system to make an\
    \ accurate irrigation decision. \nRaspberry pi is used as a base station that\
    \ receives these inputs from ESP8266 ccontroller for making \nwatering decisions,\
    \ and sends commands to nodes. WiFi technology and MQTT protocol were used to\
    \ \nexchange the data and control commands between nodes and Raspberry pi. Watering\
    \ decisions were \nnot only for starting or ending irrigation process, but also\
    \ the required amount of water was determined \naccording to crop evapotranspiration.\
    \ Moreover, irrigation run time was estimated depending on drip \nirrigation strategy\
    \ and its suggested tools. Tomato crop was chosen as a case study, due to its\
    \ importance \nin agricultural production around the world. Finally,  monitoring\
    \ of system operation approved the \neffeciency of the proposed system in making\
    \ appropriate irrigation decisions that lead to reduce water \nand power consumption\
    \ in irrigation process with imrovement in quality and quantity of yields. \n\

    \ \nAgriculture plays a major role in the world economy and most people depend\
    \ on it for their \nlivelihood. This makes water an important resource that must\
    \ be conserved using the latest \navailable technologies. Today, the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) has extended its capabilities to smart \nfarming. In this paper,\
    \ an automated and low-cost system for intelligent irrigation based on a \nFuzzy-based\
    \ energy-aware routing approach is presented. In addition, a neural network is\
    \ trained \nto determine the best irrigation program, based on information received\
    \ from sensors (such as \ntemperature, soil moisture, etc.). The user in the system\
    \ can monitor the data collection process \nwith mobile phones, mobile computers,\
    \ etc. and manage the irrigation of agricultural products. \nThe proposed system\
    \ proves its suitability with intelligence and low cost and portability, for \n\
    greenhouses, farms, etc. The simulation results show that the proposed method\
    \ offers better results \ncompared to the LEACH protocol as well as the WSN-IoT\
    \ algorithm in various criteria such as \nnetwork lifetime and power consumption.\
    \ \n \nKeywords: IoT, intelligent irrigation, intelligent agriculture, data routing,\
    \ OSPF protocol. \n \n \n \n1. Introduction \nAgriculture plays an important role\
    \ in many countries and needs to become an intelligent industry \n[1]. The agricultural\
    \ industry is currently evolving using modern intelligent technologies to find\
    \ \nsolutions for efficient use of resources. This has made water an important\
    \ resource that must be \nmaintained using the latest technologies. The Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) has developed its \ncapabilities, in addition to industry, in\
    \ smart agriculture [2]. Today, IoT is recognized as a new \nform of Internet\
    \ use among users [2]. In IoT technology, all objects have a unique Internet address\
    \ \nthat can connect to the Internet. This new generation of the Internet has\
    \ many applications in \nvarious fields, one of which is agriculture and water\
    \ intelligence [3]. \nModern and intelligent agriculture will be achieved by using\
    \ interconnected communication \nequipment as well as new technologies such as\
    \ IoT. Smart farming has advantages such as high \nand advanced efficiency, optimized\
    \ arable land, high planning accuracy and so on. The use of \nexisting technologies\
    \ in intelligent agriculture has provided more profitability for farmers, \nincreased\
    \ the attractiveness of the agricultural industry and made such tools available\
    \ to farmers \nto help them face future problems and challenges [4]. An intelligent\
    \ irrigation device \ncommunicates with various sensors and manages irrigation\
    \ based on the information it receives \nfrom the sensors. These sensors can inform\
    \ the central device of information such as whether it is \nraining or not, and\
    \ the ambient temperature, as well as the amount of soil moisture or the intensity\
    \ \nof the wind. The advantage of this system over timer irrigation controls is\
    \ its impact on water \nconsumption because irrigation is done only when your\
    \ trees and plants need water [5]. \n2 \nWith the advent of the Internet of Things\
    \ and digital transformation in rural areas, it is possible \nto intelligently\
    \ control irrigation, soil moisture, crop growth monitoring, as well as preventive\
    \ \nmeasures to detect damage by remote control. The use of this technology allows\
    \ access to smart \nagriculture [5]. Remote management of agricultural activities\
    \ with new technologies is a new field \nfor research activities. This paper configures\
    \ a fast and low cost management system for \nintelligent irrigation via wireless\
    \ sensors and the Internet of Things. The data extraction unit \nincludes a set\
    \ of wireless sensors to measure agricultural activities and collect information\
    \ related \nto irrigation parameters [6]. Based on information received from sensors\
    \ (such as temperature, \nsoil moisture, etc.), a neural network is trained to\
    \ determine the best irrigation program. The user \nin the system can connect\
    \ to an Internet network with mobile phones, mobile computers, etc. and \nmanage\
    \ the process of collecting information through the Internet of Things and monitoring\
    \ \nagricultural products. In addition, a Fuzzy-based fast routing algorithm is\
    \ designed to transmit \ninformation that helps distribute energy consumption\
    \ in the network. The emphasis of the \nproposed method is on the analysis of\
    \ routing protocol in the wireless sensor network (WSN) \nnode for sending information\
    \ from the hardware system to the interface software such as a mobile \napplication\
    \ [3]. \n The rest of this article is as follows: Section 2 deals with background\
    \ and motivation. Some of \nthe most recent work done in Section 3 is reviewed.\
    \ Section 4 presents the proposed IoT-based \nmethod for creating an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system. The results of the evaluation of the proposed \nmethod are\
    \ given in Section 5 and finally the conclusions and suggestions are expressed\
    \ in Section \n6. \n \n2. Motivation \nComputers, and therefore the Internet,\
    \ are almost entirely dependent on humans for information. \nThis concept is the\
    \ core of intelligent technology and can be used to properly manage irrigation\
    \ \nin gardens, greenhouses, farms and farmland. Smart farming is a well-established\
    \ domain, and \ncombining technology with farmers’ experience has numerous benefits:\
    \ including improved crop \nhealth, better hygiene, faster tracking, water management,\
    \ and more. Water is one of the most \nimportant resources in agriculture [7].\
    \ Large amounts of water are used almost 100 times more \nthan personal consumption\
    \ in agriculture and about 70% of river and groundwater is used for \nirrigation,\
    \ which has made humans the largest consumer of water resources [8]. In addition,\
    \ almost \nhalf of the water in traditional agriculture is lost due to evaporation.\
    \ This has led to extensive \nwork on the efficient use of this limited resource.\
    \ Much work has been done and is being done by \nvarious research groups in the\
    \ field of smart agriculture. As most IoT technology suggests wireless \nsensor\
    \ networks to manage water consumption. \n \n3. Literature review \nMuch research\
    \ has been done on the Internet of Things and irrigation intelligence in agriculture\
    \ \nto increase the quality of agricultural production as well as save water consumption.\
    \ Krishnan et \nal. (2020) proposed Fuzzy logic based on intelligent irrigation\
    \ system using IoT [9]. In this paper, \nthe fuzzy logic controller is used to\
    \ calculate the input parameters (e.g. soil moisture, temperature \nand humidity)\
    \ and generate the output of the engine condition. Karar et al. (2020) proposed\
    \ IoT \nand neural network-based water pumping control system for intelligent\
    \ irrigation [10]. This paper \naims to save water wasted in the IoT irrigation\
    \ process based on a set of sensors and a multilayer \n3 \nperceptron neural network\
    \ (MLP). Machine learning algorithm such as MLP neural network plays \nan important\
    \ role effectively in supporting the decision of automatic control of IoT-based\
    \ \nirrigation system, managing water consumption. \nTiglao et al. (2020) proposed\
    \ an intelligent irrigation system based on low-cost wireless \nnetwork called\
    \ Agrinex [11]. This provides an alternative to existing monitoring methods \n\
    in agricultural land while providing an irrigation mechanism to assist resource\
    \ conservation \nmeasures using a wireless sensor and excitation network. The\
    \ Agrinex system has a network-like \nconfiguration of in-field nodes that acts\
    \ both as a sensor for soil moisture, temperature and \nhumidity, and as an actuator\
    \ on a valve that regulates drip irrigation. Mousavi et al. (2020) \nproposed\
    \ an approach to improve IoT security using encryption algorithms for intelligent\
    \ \nirrigation systems [12]. This paper proposes a new hybrid encryption algorithm\
    \ based on hedge \nencryption, elliptic-curve encryption, and secure Hash algorithm\
    \ to protect sensitive information \nin IoT-based intelligent irrigation systems.\
    \ The results confirm the effectiveness of this model and \nthe solidification\
    \ for confidentiality based on confidentiality analysis. \nThe WSN-IoT algorithm\
    \ was proposed by Nawandar and Satpute (2019), which is a low-cost, \nintelligent\
    \ IoT-based module for creating an intelligent irrigation system [13]. Including\
    \ \ncapabilities of this software are the manager mode for interacting with the\
    \ user, making settings \nonly once to estimate the irrigation program, neural\
    \ network-based decision making for intelligent \nsupport and remote data monitoring.\
    \ In addition, the system uses MQTT and HTTP to inform the \nuser about the current\
    \ status of crops and irrigation conditions even from a remote \nlocation. Alomar\
    \ and Alazzam (2018) proposed an intelligent irrigation system using IoT \ncontroller\
    \ and Fuzzy logic [14]. The purpose of this paper is to provide an IoT-based irrigation\
    \ \nsystem that helps reduce irrigation frequency while increasing production\
    \ through the use of \nFuzzy logic. The system consists of a Mamdani fuzzy controller\
    \ that obtains environmental \ncharacteristics, i.e., soil moisture and outside\
    \ temperature through special sensors, then applies a \nseries of fuzzy rules\
    \ to control the flow of water through the water pump and the appropriate time\
    \ \nand frequency for provides irrigation. \n \n4. The proposed method \nThis\
    \ paper presents an intelligent crop monitoring and irrigation system based on\
    \ Fuzzy logic and \nneural network. Taking into account the needs of plants and\
    \ soil, the proposed intelligent irrigation \nsystem achieves efficient utilization\
    \ of water. To do this, the parameters of plant growth stage, \nambient temperature,\
    \ ambient humidity, soil moisture, evaporation rate, crop growth rate, crop \n\
    water requirement, crop planting time, maximum and minimum temperature, geographical\
    \ \nlocation, rainfall, irrigation method and type of mechanical stimulus are\
    \ noticeable that is received \nfrom WSN. These parameters generally determine\
    \ the water requirement of a product, which can \nbe used to develop an intelligent\
    \ and automatic irrigation system without any human intervention. \nIn the proposed\
    \ intelligent irrigation system, continuous monitoring of the environment, reading\
    \ \nsensor data, connecting to a broker to disseminate information, deciding on\
    \ irrigation mode, \ndeciding on the amount of The amount of water output, transferring\
    \ the decision to the Irrigation \nUnit (IU), decision feedback is done from the\
    \ unit irrigation. Figure 1 shows a conceptual \narchitecture of the proposed\
    \ method consisting of four layers. \n \n \n4 \n \nFig. 1. Architecture of the\
    \ proposed irrigation system \n \nThe first layer is related to data collection\
    \ through a WSN with fixed number of nodes. The \nnodes used in this section have\
    \ the ability to collect the parameters defined for irrigation through \na sense\
    \ of environment. These nodes have the ability to convert analog signals to digital\
    \ and use \nthe radio frequency protocol to transmit information. In addition\
    \ to WSN-related equipment, there \nis a water source available through the IU\
    \ that can enforce submitted decisions. The second layer \nconsists of a sensor\
    \ information unit (SIU), which is responsible for processing data and \ncommunicating\
    \ with devices connected to the Internet. Also, SIU can communicate and exchange\
    \ \ndata. The third layer consists of a GSM modem connected to the Internet through\
    \ which the SIU \ncan send information received from the WSN to the server (or\
    \ application). Therefore, data \nanalysis is performed by the server, which simplifies\
    \ the system architecture. The fourth layer \nconsists of a server or an application\
    \ platform that the user (farmer) can view and manage its data. \nAn application\
    \ can be an app or website that runs on a mobile phone or personal computer \n\
    In this research, a fast and low cost management system has been designed for\
    \ intelligent \nirrigation through IoT. A number of wireless sensors are used\
    \ to collect data. These sensors \nprovide information such as temperature, soil\
    \ moisture, temperature, amount of light, \nmeasurement of frost, etc. This data\
    \ is used to measure agricultural activities and better \nmanagement of the irrigation\
    \ system. Based on the information collected, a neural network is \ntrained to\
    \ determine the best irrigation program. Here, a series of real inputs-outputs\
    \ are used to \ntrain the neural network, which will be provided by an expert.\
    \ The user in the system can connect \nto an Internet network with mobile phones,\
    \ mobile computers, etc. and manage the process of \ncollecting information through\
    \ the Internet of Things and monitoring agricultural products. In \nLayer 1: Data\

    \ a fuzzy-based fast routing algorithm is designed to transmit information. The\
    \ proposed \nrouting algorithm creates a routing table for all sensors at the\
    \ beginning of the setup, and the \nrouting table is updated only if one sensor\
    \ (neighborhood switch) is deactivated. The flowchart of \nthe proposed method\
    \ are shown in the figure 2. \n \n \nFig. 2. Flowchart of the proposed method\
    \ \n \nThe basic routing protocol for implementing the proposed irrigation system\
    \ is OSPF. In this \nprotocol, SPF algorithm is used for routing and is based\
    \ only on bandwidth [15]. In this paper the \nrouting process in the OSPF protocol\
    \ is improved by a Fuzzy system. Here, the network topology \nspecification is\
    \ considered as input based on a set of standard parameters. \nThe target network\
    \ is a WSN network and includes a set of sensor nodes with the ability to send\
    \ \ndata. These nodes are actually IoT operators. Initially, the OSPF protocol\
    \ is based on the WSN. \nThis is done by sending a “hello” message and creating\
    \ a neighborhood table. Then the \ncommunication status between the sensor nodes\
    \ is determined by sending an LSA message and \nbased on this, the network neighborhood\
    \ table is created. Each node that receives the LSA \nmessage updates its neighborhood\
    \ table and sends an LSA message to the other neighboring \nLinks status changes\

    \ is created for each node. This is done by developing the SPF algorithm with\
    \ a Fuzzy \napproach for each node. The OSPF protocol alternately modifies the\
    \ neighborhood table based on \nLSA messages. However, the LSA is sent only in\
    \ two cases: 1) Changes in the status of the links \n(for example, ending the\
    \ energy of a node) and 2) A specified time range (for example, every \nsecond).\
    \ Therefore, in case of changes, each node updates its neighborhood table and\
    \ notifies the \nchanges to its neighbors by sending an LSA. \n \n4.1 Fuzzy approach\
    \ to create routing table \nThe proposed routing system is such that the source\
    \ node is first considered as the current path \nnode (݊݋݀݁௖). The next ݊݋݀݁௖\
    \ is then identified based on all candidate nodes. That’s mean, \nܽ݊݀݅݀(݊݋݀݁௖)\
    \ = {݊݋݀݁ଵ, ݊݋݀݁ଶ, … , ݊݋݀݁௭ଵ} . Where indicates ݖ1 the number of candidate \n\
    nodes for the current ݊݋݀݁௖. Here, neighboring nodes are considered as candidate\
    \ nodes. In the \nnext step, based on a fuzzy system based on the law, for each\
    \ node of the set of candidate nodes, \nthe effect of its selection is calculated.\
    \ Then one node is selected from the candidate nodes as the \nnext node of the\
    \ path. This selection is done based on the influence coefficient and the roulette\
    \ \nwheel technique. Assuming the ݊݋݀݁ଵ is selected, this node is considered as\
    \ the current node, \nwhich means ݊݋݀݁௖ = ݊݋݀݁ଵ. This process is repeated for\
    \ the current node until the destination \nnode is selected. \n Fuzzy system designed\
    \ based on the parameters “residual energy of the candidate node”, \n“distance\
    \ of the candidate node from the current node”, “distance of the candidate node\
    \ from the \nSIU” and “bandwidth of the link between the current node and the\
    \ candidate node” determine the \nimpact of each candidate node . Here the input\
    \ parameters include 1) energy (ܧܴ), 2) distance \n(ܦܵ) and 3) bandwidth (ܤܹ).\
    \ The parameters of the distance of the candidate node from the \ncurrent node\
    \ and the distance of the candidate node from the SIU are considered as the average\
    \ \nsound. First, the values of these parameters are normalized based on the maximum\
    \ value and then \nthey become Fuzzy based on the trapezoidal Fuzzy set with three\
    \ modes (Low, Middle and High). \nFigure 3 shows the considered trapezoidal Fuzzy\
    \ set. The output of the Fuzzy system is also \nthe influence coefficient which\
    \ is modeled by the trapezoidal fuzzy set. \n \n \nFig. 3. Making system input\
    \ parameters Fuzzy \n  \nThe output is determined by a database of fuzzy rules\
    \ designed by an expert, where the \nmembership degree of each input pattern is\
    \ calculated using the multiplier-field operator. The \nfuzzy rules considered\
    \ are shown in Table 1. \n7 \nTable 1. Database of fuzzy rules used in routing\

    \ \nMost research uses a threshold to decide on the type of irrigation. For example,\
    \ if the \ntemperature drops below -5, there is a possibility of freezing and\
    \ irrigation is done. However, the \nparameters under consideration often include\
    \ ambient temperature, humidity, soil-water content, \nwhich do not provide a\
    \ simple relationship for decision making. Therefore, in this paper, an \nattempt\
    \ has been made to use the neural network model instead of the threshold, where\
    \ it can \nmake the best decision for the current situation based on past conditions.\
    \ Here, a neural network \nis trained to determine the best irrigation program\
    \ based on information gathered by the Internet \nof Things. To do this, a series\
    \ of real inputs-outputs are used to train the neural network, and this \ninformation\
    \ is provided by an expert. The inputs considered in this system include ambient\
    \ \ntemperature, ambient humidity, soil moisture, evaporation rate, crop growth\
    \ rate, crop water \nrequirement, crop planting time and rainfall. In addition,\
    \ the output of the system is a type of \nirrigation program that includes low\
    \ pressure drip irrigation, high pressure drip irrigation, low \npressure sprinkler\
    \ irrigation, high pressure sprinkler irrigation, low pressure surface irrigation\
    \ and \nhigh pressure surface irrigation. \nIn this paper, a multilayer perceptron\
    \ neural network (MLP-NNs) is used, which has three input, \nhidden and output\
    \ layers. The input characteristics are equal according to the parameters extracted\
    \ \nby the sensors and the number of outputs is equal according to the defined\
    \ types of irrigation. In \naddition, the number of hidden layers is 1 and the\
    \ number of neurons in this layer is 4. The number \nof learning courses is equal\
    \ to 1000 and the technique of learning weights is defined as descending \ngradient\
    \ .The output of each node is generated by calculating the weight value of its\
    \ input values \nand then performing the sigmoid activation function. Finally,\
    \ the average square error (MSE) of \nthe output is predicted and calculated based\
    \ on its difference from the actual sample output. Figure \n4 shows an example\
    \ of the MLP-NN architecture based on the 3–4–1 configuration (i.e., 3 input \n\
    nodes, 4 nodes in a hidden layer and 1 output node). \n  \n8 \n \n Fig. 4. An\
    \ example of used structure of the MLP neural network  \n \n5. Results and discussion\
    \ \nThe simulation is performed with MATLAB 2019a software and all tests are performed\
    \ by an \nAsus laptop with Intel Core i7 processor and frequency and 3.0 GHz,\
    \ 16GB memory. The \nsimulation is performed on an IoT-based wireless sensor network\
    \ topology. In the experiments \nperformed, the values set for the parameters\
    \ of the proposed method are as follows; Number of \nsimulation cycles equal to\
    \ 5000, LSA sending time range equal to 5 simulation cycles, agricultural \nland\
    \ size equal to 100×100 meters, number of sensor nodes equal to 100, position\
    \ of sensor nodes \nrandomly with uniform distribution, initial energy of nodes\
    \ equal to 0.2 joules, data packet size is \nequal to 4 KB, the size of Hello\
    \ packets is equal to 25 bits, the position of the sensor information \nunit is\
    \ equal to 50×50 meters and the number of fuzzy rules is equal to 12. \n According\
    \ to the energy consumption model [13] is used to send and receive data. In this\
    \ \nmodel, if the distance between two nodes is greater than the threshold distance,\
    \ the nodes send \nthe packet with the maximum power level, otherwise, the package\
    \ is sent based on the distance \nwith an average power level. In this model,\
    \ the amount of energy consumption for the sending \nnodes (ܧ௧௫) and receiving\
    \ nodes (ܧ௥௫) is measured according to Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). \nܧ௧௫(݀) = ቊܧ௘௟௘௖×݈+ߝ௙௦\

    In these relationships, energy required to send / receive is one bit. And also\

    Fig. 6. Residual network energy based on each node \n \n In the following, the\
    \ residual energy of the network in the proposed method is compared to the \n\
    routing cycles against the LEACH protocol [16] and the WSN-IoT algorithm [13].\
    \ At each routing \ncycle, the residual energy of the network is equal to the\
    \ average residual energy for all network \nnodes. The results of this comparison\
    \ are presented in Figure 7. In the first round of simulation, \nthe network energy\
    \ is 20 J. Here, a decreasing trend of network energy is observed during routing\
    \ \ncycles for all methods. However, the proposed method shows less acceleration\
    \ in energy reduction \nthan other methods. The reason for the superiority of\
    \ the proposed method is the use of energy-\naware technique in routing as well\
    \ as proper distribution of energy consumption. \n \n \nFig. 7. Comparison of\
    \ network residual energy in different methods \n  \n11 \n In another experiment,\
    \ network lifetime and the number of live nodes were compared based \non routing\
    \ cycles in different methods. Figure 8 shows the results of this comparison.\
    \ In the \nproposed method, death of the first node in the routing round is 2109.\
    \ This criterion is 1057 for \nthe LEACH protocol and 1625 for the WSN-IoT algorithm.\
    \ Therefore, the proposed method offers \nbetter network life. In addition, after\
    \ completing 5000 routing rounds, the proposed method with \n22 live nodes reports\
    \ better results than the LEACH protocol with 2 and the WSN-IoT algorithm \nwith\
    \ 4 live nodes. \n  \n \n Fig. 8. Comparison of the number of live network nodes\
    \ in different methods \n  \n Finally, the comparison of different methods based\
    \ on the numerical results of different criteria \nis shown in Table 3 after the\
    \ completion of 5000 routing rounds. In general, the proposed method \nbased on\
    \ IoT architecture as well as fuzzy based energy-aware routing algorithm has given\
    \ better \nresults than LEACH protocol as well as WSN-IoT algorithm. \n \nTable\

    \ \n6. Conclusions and future work \nThe world’s population is growing and the\
    \ current food supply is not enough to feed people. \nToday, traditional agriculture\
    \ can be one of the reasons for the decline in food production, even if \na lot\
    \ of arable land is available. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate developing\
    \ technologies \nwith agriculture and perform intelligent agriculture. In addition,\
    \ agriculture plays a major role in \nthe world economy and most people depend\
    \ on it for their livelihood. This makes water an \nimportant resource that must\
    \ be conserved using the latest available technologies. Today, the \nInternet\
    \ of Things has extended its capabilities to smart farming. In this paper, an\
    \ automated and \nlow-cost system for intelligent irrigation was designed. Here,\
    \ IoT is used to build devices that \n12 \nautomatically communicate with each\
    \ other in the system and has features such as: manager mode \nfor user interaction,\
    \ setting irrigation schedule, neural network-based decision making for \nintelligent\
    \ support and remote data monitoring. The proposed system has proven to be intelligent,\
    \ \nlow cost and portable, suitable for greenhouses, farms, etc. \n For future\
    \ work, it is recommended to use an IoT-enabled microcontroller which is equipped\
    \ \nwith internet to transfer information between the sensor nodes and the node\
    \ processing unit, and \nto speed up the data transfer process. In addition, using\
    \ and comparing the performance of OSPF \nprotocol with other new protocols such\
    \ as EIGRP [17] is another suggestion of this research. \n \nFunding \nNo funding\

    Abstract

    This research introduces a Smart Watering System powered by Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) for

    precision agriculture. The system utilizes real-time monitoring and irrigation
    management to provide

    crops with the right amount of water based on their individual needs. The method
    aims to enhance

    agricultural yields, reduce labor costs, and improve water e¨ciency. By deploying
    a network of affordable

    wireless sensors in the ¦elds, soil moisture levels are continuously tracked,
    and the data is sent wirelessly

    to a central controller. Using advanced wireless protocols, the system analyzes
    the data and determines

    the optimal watering requirements for each crop. The technology is scalable and
    easy to install in larger

    agricultural ¦elds. Research ¦ndings indicate that the system can increase crop
    yields by up to 30% and

    improve water usage e¨ciency by up to 60%. Adopting this smart irrigation monitoring
    service powered

    by WSN allows farmers to conserve water, save time and money, and improve overall
    pro¦tability in

    sustainable agriculture.

    1. Introduction

    An important part of agriculture is irrigation, which makes sure that crops have
    enough water to grow.

    Traditional irrigation techniques, however, can be ineffective, resulting in water
    waste and higher

    expenses for farmers. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), there
    is a chance to put in

    place smart irrigation systems that may maximise water consumption while preserving
    agricultural

    productivity (Amarendra Goap et al., 2018, Karamiet al., 2021, Neha et al., 2019).

    The wireless sensor networks (WSN) used in this paper''s smart irrigation monitoring
    service provide for

    real-time data collection and analysis on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
    The gateway node

    transmits the data gathered by the sensors to a server for processing (Andres
    et al., 2020). The server

    then processes the data using algorithms to provide farmers useful information
    about the water

    requirements of their crops.

    The WSN-based monitoring system is composed of a number of ¦eld-deployed sensor
    nodes, a gateway

    node that gathers data from the sensor nodes and sends it to a server, and a web-based
    user interface for

    farmers to access the data (Fadi Al-Turjman, 2019, J. Gao et al., 2018). (Emmanuel
    et al., 2020; H. Ben

    Hammouda et al., 2015) The sensor nodes continually gather data on soil moisture,
    temperature, and

    humidity and communicate it to the gateway node. The data is subsequently sent
    from the gateway node

    to a server for archival and analysis. The server processes the data using data
    analytics techniques to

    produce useful information about the water needs of crops. Figure 1 depicts the
    data-§ow diagram and

    domain architecture reference-model for the monitoring service.

    The algorithms that calculate the best time and volume of water application are
    the foundation of the

    system''s functionality. Based on the crop type and development stage, these algorithms
    analyse the

    gathered data to determine the quantity of water that crops need and recommend
    applying. This strategy

    guarantees that water is only applied when required, minimising waste and increasing
    crop output. The

    Page 3/18

    suggested method gives farmers precise and timely information on when and how
    much water to apply,

    with the goal of increasing irrigation e¨ciency. The system may gather data from
    several places in the

    ¦eld utilising WSN (A. Z. Abbasi et al., 2014; H. Al-Sakran et al., 2013), which
    enables a more accurate

    depiction of soil moisture levels. The device can also spot patterns or abnormalities
    in the data, warning

    farmers of possible problems like overwatering or underwatering.

    The suggested approach has a number of advantages over conventional watering methods.
    First off, it

    lessens water waste by giving farmers up-to-date knowledge on their crops'' water
    requirements. It also

    helps farmers to use water more e¨ciently, which boosts agricultural yields and
    lowers water expenses.

    Thirdly, it encourages environmental sustainability by minimising irrigation''s
    negative environmental

    effects and lowering water waste. A ¦eld experiment of the system is run at a
    corn farm to assess its

    e¨cacy. The research resulted in a 40% decrease in water use while preserving
    crop output, highlighting

    the system''s potential to increase agricultural sustainability.

    The rest of this essay is structured as follows. A brief summary of the related
    work on intelligent irrigation

    systems is given in Section 2. The system architecture and components are thoroughly
    explained in

    Section 3. The experimental setup and ¦ndings are presented in Section 4. The
    study is concluded in

    Section 5 which also explores the possibility of further research.

    2. Literature Review

    The analysis demonstrates how water shortage is a signi¦cant problem for agriculture
    and how smart

    irrigation systems are a good way to maximise water use. For the purpose of maximising
    irrigation,

    several research have suggested the use of wireless sensor networks to gather
    information on soil

    moisture, temperature, and humidity. These studies show how wireless sensor networks
    may be used to

    monitor and manage irrigation systems in real time.

    The review also covers the many parts of a smart irrigation system, such as sensor
    nodes, wireless

    sensor networks, communication protocols, and algorithms. The ideal amount and
    time of water delivery

    are suggested by these algorithms based on information on soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. The

    review emphasises how crucial it is to choose the right algorithms and models
    based on the kind of crop,

    soil, and environment. Also evaluated the literature already in existence on WSN-based
    smart irrigation

    systems, emphasising their success in streamlining water use and enhancing agricultural
    production.

    The Agro-IoT system is one existent system that makes use of wireless sensor networks
    and Internet of

    Things (IoT) technology. This system is made up of multiple sensor nodes that
    track temperature,

    humidity, and soil moisture among other things. The central server, where it is
    processed and examined,

    receives the data that the sensor nodes have collected. The system also has a
    smartphone application

    that gives farmers access to real-time information on crop conditions and empowers
    them to plan

    irrigation effectively. Similarly, the WaterSense system is an established technology
    that utilizes wireless

    sensor networks and IoT capabilities. This system measures soil moisture levels
    and provides real-time

    information on crop water needs using a network of soil moisture sensors. Farmers
    may view the data

    Page 4/18

    and use the system''s mobile application to decide how much irrigation to use,
    optimizing water usage

    and enhancing crop yield in the process. The integration of IoT with wireless
    sensor networks holds great

    promise in revolutionizing precision agriculture and empowering farmers with actionable
    insights for

    sustainable and e¨cient farming practices (Jazaeri et al. (2016).

    The LoRaWAN-based WSN model is an other existing model. This approach enables
    communication

    between sensor nodes and a gateway node by using the LoRaWAN protocol, a low-power
    long-range

    wireless communication protocol. The gateway node gathers and sends data to a
    centralised server for

    processing, while the sensor nodes are deployed in the ¦eld to detect soil moisture,
    temperature, and

    humidity. After processing the data, the central server uses a user interface
    to give farmers real-time

    information on crop water needs.

    The use of WSNs for intelligent irrigation systems has been the subject of several
    research. For precision

    agriculture, Akyildiz et al. (2002) developed a system based on WSNs. The system
    used sensor nodes to

    detect a variety of variables, including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture,
    and it sent the data to a

    processing hub for storage and analysis. When compared to conventional irrigation
    techniques, the

    scientists found that crop output and water utilisation had signi¦cantly improved.
    WSN-based smart

    irrigation systems have been successfully implemented, according to several research.
    For instance, a

    WSN-based irrigation system created by Lia Gao et al. (2013) increased agricultural
    productivity by 20%

    while using 45% less water. In a similar vein, Shuangde Zhang (2014) claimed that
    a WSN-based

    irrigation system resulted in a 50% decrease in water use and a 10% improvement
    in crop output.

    Similar to this, Joaquin Gutierrez et al. (2014) suggested an intelligent watering
    system for vineyards

    employing WSNs. The system was made up of several sensor nodes placed all around
    the vineyard that

    detected different things including soil moisture and leaf temperature. The technology
    provided the ideal

    timing and volume of water application depending on the data after wirelessly
    transmitting the gathered

    data to a central point for analysis. When compared to conventional irrigation
    techniques, the scientists

    found that crop output and water utilisation had signi¦cantly improved.

    The evaluation also touches on how crucial user interfaces are to smart irrigation
    systems. Farmers may

    get real-time data on crop water requirements and make knowledgeable irrigation
    decisions thanks to

    user interfaces. The use of web-based interfaces for remote data access has been
    suggested in several

    studies, making it simpler for farmers to control irrigation systems from any
    location.

    The analysis comes to the conclusion that wireless sensor networks and smart irrigation
    systems have

    the potential to greatly enhance agricultural water use. The choice of relevant
    algorithms and models, as

    well as the creation of user interfaces that are user-friendly and available to
    farmers, are necessary for

    these systems to be successful. The solution that is being suggested in this study
    attempts to overcome

    these di¨culties and make a positive impact on the creation of successful smart
    irrigation systems.

    3. Proposed System

    Page 5/18

    A Smart Monitoring Service for Irrigation The current irrigation method of using
    WSN is new (K. H. Dhara

    and A. B. Makwana, 2015; Loubna Hamami et al., 2020), however the farmers have
    not yet fully

    embraced it. It is mostly used by researchers to carry out experimental experiments.
    A novel idea in

    agricultural applications, the wireless sensor network (WSN), inspired several
    academics to do study in

    this area. The current irrigation method of using WSN is relatively new but holds
    immense potential to

    revolutionize agriculture through its real-time monitoring and precision water
    management capabilities.

    Wired sensor systems may now handle particular challenges thanks to recent advancements
    in wireless

    sensor network (WSN) technology (Md Mohinur Rahaman et al., 2022; Mehdi Gheisari
    et al., 2022). Wired

    sensor systems may now handle speci¦c challenges thanks to recent advancements
    in wireless sensor

    network (WSN) technology (A. Z. Abbasi et al., 2014).

    3.1 Soil Evaporation Model

    Prediction of soil moisture is essential for effective irrigation management.
    The Penmen approach was

    thought to produce the most precise ¦ndings with the least amount of inaccuracy
    in relation to the live

    grass reference crop. It was found that, depending on the location of the land,
    the pan approach would

    provide us with appropriate precision. The following equations illustrate the
    FAO Penman-Monteith

    technique for calculating ET0:

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), G = heat §ux density of soil
    [MJ m−2·day−1], μ2 = 

    wind speed at height of 2 m [ms−1], T = daily mean air temperature at 3 m height
    [°C], Rn = crop surface

    net radiation [MJ M−2 day −1], ea = actual vapor pressure [kPa], es = saturated
    vapor pressure [kPa], es-ea 

    = de¦cit saturation vapors pressure [kPa], P = atmospheric pressure [kPa], Δ = curve
    of slope vapor

    pressure [kPa °C−1], γ = psychrometric constant [kPa °C−1], z = elevation above
    sea level [m], e0 (T) = 

    saturation vapor pressure at the air temperature T [kPa], CP = speci¦c heat at
    constant pressure, 1.013 10–

    3 [MJ kg−10C−1], λ = latent heat of vaporization, 2.45[MJ kg−1], € = ration molecular
    weight of water

    vapor/day air = 0.622.

    Page 6/18

    The soil moisture estimation is mainly depending upon the evapotranspiration.
    The other most frequently

    used method based on extra-terrestrial radioactivity and temperature to evaluate
    ET0 (G. H. Hargreaves

    and Z. A. Samani, 1985)

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), Tmax and Tmin = max. temperature
    and min.

    temperature (°C), Ra = extra-terrestrial radiation (MJm−2 day−1).

    Ritchie purposed another method for the estimation of ET0 (C. Jones, 1990) based
    on solar radiation and

    temperature. It is expressed as

    where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum and
    minimum

    temperature (°C); and Rs = solar radiation (MJm−2 day−1).

    When

    A method for measuring evapotranspiration based on neurofuzzy (NF) inference was
    developed because

    it shows greater accuracy than combinations of air temperature, wind speed, and
    solar radiation (M.

    Cobaner, 2011). The NF model is dependent on relative humidity, solar radioactivity,
    and air temperature.

    The weather forecast sensors installed at the farm have anticipated the wetness
    of the soil. According to

    L. Ruiz-Garcia (2009), soil temperature, radiation, air temperature, and relative
    humidity all affect how

    much moisture evaporates from the soil. In order to e¨ciently irrigate farmland,
    a sensor-based and IoT

    constructed architecture (Figure 4) has been developed for gathering, processing,
    and transmitting the

    various physical parameters (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil moisture,
    soil temperature, and

    radiation).

    3.2 WSN Architecture

    The mobile ad hoc network of WSNs, access points, routers, gateways, and multi-point
    relays shown in

    Figure 2 form a sophisticated architecture for seamless communication and connectivity
    among WSN

    nodes, coordinators, relays, gateways, and routers. As highlighted by Mir A et
    al. (2002), Rathore M et al.

    (2018), and P. Singh et al. (2013), access points serve as ¦xed-point transceivers,
    granting local nodes or

    those within wireless range easy accessibility. Meanwhile, multipoint relays play
    a vital role in

    Page 7/18

    establishing connections to various networks, including the Internet and mobile
    service provider networks.

    When it comes to packet transmission, routers skillfully navigate through available
    open paths in the

    network, e¨ciently choosing the optimal route. Lastly, the crucial task of linking
    the two networks falls to

    the coordinator, ensuring seamless communication between them. This intricate
    architecture forms the

    backbone of the smart monitoring service for irrigation, allowing real-time data
    collection and analysis for

    precise water management in agricultural ¦elds (Jazaeri et al. (2021).

    The WSN nodes have the ability to forward data to the access point (base station)
    as well as sense data.

    The nodes may move around and can communicate with distant access points while
    having coverage

    and mobility range. Access points have the ability to acquire and process data
    and are connected to a

    wider network, such as the Internet (Kenny Paul et al., 2022; S. M. Kamruzzaman
    et al., 2019). Layered

    construction is seen in Figure 3. Each node has a connection to a close neighbour.
    When the node travels

    farther, it connects with the access point (base station) through 2 or 3 hops.
    Low-power transceivers

    connect each node to the closest neighbouring layer WSNs. 

    Assume that there are three levels of WSNs around the base station. WSNs at Layer
    1 link directly. Before

    connecting directly, layer 2 WSNs make connections to layer 1 WSNs acting as coordinators.
    Prior to

    connecting to layer 1 WSNs and the access point, layer 3 WSNs establish connections
    to layer 2 WSNs

    serving as coordinators. The layer 1 WSN1 and WSN6 connections to the access point
    are depicted in the

    image. It denotes a hop count of 1. WSN 2 and WSN 3 are likewise depicted in the
    picture at layer 2. The

    ¦rst hop is to WSN1, while the second hop is through WSN1. For layer 2, the hop
    count is 2. In other

    words, WSN 2 is connected to WSN 1, which is connected to the access point (base
    station). 

    WSN 4 and WSN 5 are likewise depicted in the picture at layer 3. Three hops are
    required for their

    connection—one to layer 2 WSN, one to layer 1 WSN, and one to the access point.
    For layer 3, the hop

    count is 3. As a result, WSN 5 connects to WSN2, WSN1, and ¦nally the access point.
    The access point is

    connected via WSN4 before WSN3, WSN1, and WSN3. Wireless LAN (802.11b) access
    points are used to

    link the clusters. Connectivity to the Internet is made possible via the access
    points. Users with mobile

    devices and distant clients can access the archived and real-time queryable sensor
    data. The WSNs are

    shown in Figures 2 and 3. Every access point and gateway are connected. Each gateway
    uses LPWAN to

    interact with the cloud.

    3.3 Proposed System Architecture

    The fundamental design of a wireless sensor network-based irrigation monitoring
    system is depicted in

    Figure 4. The sensor nodes, gateway node, cloud, and Internet are the system''s
    four key parts.

    Sensors: The tools that gather environmental data are known as sensors. Temperature,
    humidity, soil

    moisture, and light intensity sensors are all present in this situation. The gateway
    devices receive the

    wirelessly sent sensor data and pass it along to the cloud computing platform
    for processing and

    analysis. This information may then be used by the cloud computing platform to
    decide when and how

    Page 8/18

    much to irrigate the crops. The platform may also transmit instructions back to
    the gateway components

    to regulate the irrigation system.

    Gateway: A device known as a gateway is used to gather data from sensors and transmit
    it to a server. A

    Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) module, a WiFi module, a microcontroller unit (MCU),
    and RAM are all

    included with the gateway.

    Server: The server is the key element of the system that stores and processes
    the sensor data. It receives

    the data from the gateway and, after analysing it, issues orders to the actuators.

    Devices that carry out activities in response to orders sent from the server are
    known as actuators. The

    actuators in this instance consist of a water pump, a solenoid valve, and a fertiliser
    dispenser. The MCU

    in the gateway, which gets commands from the server through the WSN module, manages
    these devices.

    A WSN has an ID and monitors moisture among other things. Every node is a WSN.
    Each WSN takes

    measurements at certain depths inside the soil at designated locations within
    a crop. Three similarly

    spaced depths of sensors are employed. A network is created when a collection
    of WSNs use ZigBee to

    communicate. Each network has an access point that uses LPWAN to receive messages
    from each node. 

    Data is continually gathered by the sensors and sent to the gateway. Data from
    the sensors is gathered

    by the gateway and sent to the server via the WiFi module. To ascertain the plants''
    watering needs, the

    server receives the data and processes it. The server issues orders to the actuators
    based on the analysis

    to carry out the required tasks, such as turning on the water pump or opening
    the solenoid valve. Through

    the WSN module, the server sends commands to the MCU in the gateway, which then
    uses those

    commands to operate the actuators.

    The smart irrigation monitoring system we suggest carries out the following duties:

    Smart irrigation uses moisture sensors and actuators to water channels.

    Installs each soil moisture sensor at a certain depth in the ¦elds using a sensor
    circuitry board.

    Makes use of a variety of actuators (solenoid valves) that are positioned along
    water lines and that

    regulate moisture levels that are too high during a certain crop time.

    Monitors evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration) and moisture in fruit
    plants such as

    grapes and mangoes using sensors positioned at three depths.

    Calculates and tracks real water requirements for irrigation and absorption

    Each sensor board is enclosed in a waterproof shell and uses the ZigBee protocol
    to connect to an

    access point. A WSN is made up of a number of sensor circuits.

    The data is received by the access point, which then sends it to a related gateway.
    Data is

    transformed at the gateway before being sent through LPWAN to a cloud platform.

    The platform''s analytics examine the moisture data and interact with the water
    irrigation channels''

    actuators in accordance with the amount of water needed and previous data.

    Page 9/18

    Sensors take measurements at predetermined intervals, and actuators respond to
    the intervals''

    needed values after analysis.

    The platform sets the preset measurement intervals of T1 (for example, 24 hours)
    and the preset

    actuation interval of t2 before uploading the programmes to the sensors and actuators
    circuits. 

    An algorithm downloads and updates the programmes for the gateways and nodes.
    Sensed

    moisture readings that surpass certain thresholds then send off the alert.

    Operates at the data-adaptation layer and, at regular intervals, identi¦es the
    malfunctioning or

    inaccessible moisture sensors.

    The monitoring system''s prototype was created using an open-source SDK and IDE.

    3.4 Experimental Setup 

    Typically, the experimental setup for the Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service
    utilising Wireless Sensor

    Networks (WSN) consists of a network of sensors that monitor soil moisture content,
    temperature, and

    humidity levels. The sensor nodes are wirelessly linked to a central node or gateway,
    which is in charge of

    gathering data from the nodes and transmitting it to a platform for cloud-based
    data storage. Figure 5

    displays photographs of the planned model prototype that was placed in several
    agricultural areas to

    gauge the soil''s temperature and moisture content.

    To operate the hardware, a software programme is created and run on the ESP8266
    microcontroller. The

    node was positioned close to the plant to feel its surroundings, and it is wirelessly
    connected to the main

    station through an ESP8266 microcontroller that serves as both an access point
    and a server. The

    ESP8266 module also communicates with the main station via serial communication.
    Each zone in the

    planted area has sensors for soil moisture, air humidity, air temperature, and
    solar light brightness. To

    obtain correct data, this division is carried out depending on the sensing range
    of the sensors. The

    ESP8266 module is used to wirelessly link all the parameters that correspond to
    the de¦ned zone before

    sending them to the sink node. After that, each sensor node''s data is assembled
    and delivered via serial

    connection from the sink node to the main station. The main station collects the
    data and uses an

    application to process it in order to decide on irrigation while simultaneously
    saving the information in a

    database. The decision command was transmitted through serial connection to an
    ESP8266 module,

    then converted and sent wirelessly to the actuator node. The actuator node then
    uses a relay module to

    operate the water pumps. Figure 5 depicts the deployment of sensors in various
    agricultural ¦elds,

    including farm ¦elds, house gardens, and plant-in-pot ¦elds.

    The sensor nodes are positioned across the agricultural area, and the data they
    collect is evaluated to

    establish the best watering schedules for the crops. The central node or gateway
    is often connected to

    the irrigation system, enabling remote monitoring and management of irrigation
    procedures. According to

    studies, using WSN technology for irrigation monitoring has increased irrigation
    e¨ciency by an average

    of 30%. Accordingly, farmers may now use up to 30% less water, which saves them
    a lot of money and

    has a less negative impact on the environment.

    Page 10/18

    4. Results And Discussion

    In addition, farmers can now manage irrigation practises from any location thanks
    to the system''s remote

    monitoring and control capabilities, which has increased production and e¨ciency.
    The Smart Irrigation

    Monitoring Service''s use of WSN has shown encouraging results. The method has
    made it possible to

    use targeted and accurate irrigation techniques, which has reduced water waste
    and enhanced

    agricultural yields. The ¦ndings from the experimental design are as follows:

    Soil Moisture Content: The percentage of soil moisture is measured by the soil
    moisture sensors. The

    results can range from 0% to 100%, where 100% represents fully saturated soil
    and 0% represents

    severely dry soil. For most crops, a soil''s ideal moisture content ranges from
    50% to 70%.

    Temperature: The sensors monitor the ambient temperature in either Celsius or
    Fahrenheit.

    Depending on the sensor''s specs, the numbers received can range from -40°C to
    125°C or -40°F to

    257°F. Most crops do best at a temperature of 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F).

    Humidity: The humidity sensors calculate the environment''s % relative humidity.
    The results can vary

    from 0% to 100%, where 100% represents totally saturated air and 0% represents
    excessively dry air.

    For most crops, a humidity level between 40% and 70% is ideal.

    Irrigation Frequency: Based on the moisture content of the soil and other environmental
    parameters,

    the experimental values also take irrigation frequency into account. Depending
    on the needs of the

    crop, the frequency might range from many times per day to once per week.

    Water Consumption: The Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service utilising WSN also
    measures the

    quantity of water utilised for irrigation, which can assist farmers in streamlining
    their water

    consumption and lowering expenses. Depending on the needs of the crop and the
    surrounding

    environment, the experimental numbers can range from a few litres to several thousand
    litres per

    day.

    The outcomes of employing the WSN-based Smart Irrigation Monitoring Service have
    been quite positive.

    Farmers have been able to optimise irrigation practises thanks to the technology,
    which has led to

    considerable water savings and higher crop yields.

    5. Conclusion and Future Scope

    Smart irrigation monitoring services using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have
    revolutionized

    precision agriculture by enabling real-time monitoring of crucial environmental
    variables such as

    humidity, temperature, and soil moisture. This technology has proven highly successful
    in optimizing

    irrigation schedules and conserving water resources, resulting in a remarkable
    30% improvement in

    irrigation practices. By embracing smart irrigation with WSNs, farmers have experienced
    increased crop

    yields, reduced water waste, and a smaller environmental impact. The future holds
    immense potential for

    even greater advancements, including enhanced data analysis through technologies
    like Arti¦cial

    Intelligence (AI) and machine learning, as well as integration with other smart
    agricultural technologies

    Page 11/18

    like drones and precision farming. To further enhance the effectiveness of smart
    irrigation monitoring,

    future work could focus on developing advanced AI algorithms that can predict
    crop water requirements

    more accurately and dynamically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time
    weather and soil

    conditions. Additionally, exploring the use of Internet of Things (IoT) platforms
    to create a seamless and

    interconnected network of smart agricultural devices and systems would open up

    \ Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) plays important roles in environmental, hydrological\
    \ and \nagricultural studies and its accurate prediction is significant in water\
    \ resources management and water \nproductivity increase. This study focused on\
    \ evaluating the ability of support vector regression (SVR) \nmodel for modeling\
    \ ET0 in arid and semiarid climate stations of Iraq. For comparison, multiple\
    \ linear \nregression (MLR) and calibrated Hargreaves and Samani (HS) empirical\
    \ models were also applied. Daily \nmeteorological data from Basra and Erbil stations\
    \ including minimum, maximum and mean \ntemperatures, relative humidity, wind\
    \ speed, precipitation, solar radiation and surface pressure were \ncollected\
    \ for two consecutive years (2017 – 2018) and used as inputs to the models. FAO\
    \ 56 Penman-\nMonteith was used as the benchmark ET0. Root mean square error (RMSE)\
    \ and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency \ncriterion (NSE) were the performance evaluation\
    \ criteria employed. The results revealed that, all the \napplied models led to\
    \ reliable results, but SVR model provided the best performance with NSEs of 0.9949,\
    \ \n0.9871 and RMSEs of 0.0009, 0.0016 in the validation phase for Basra and Erbil\
    \ stations, respectively. The \ngeneral results implied that SVR model could be\
    \ employed successfully for estimation of ET0 in arid and \nsemiarid climate stations\
    \ of Iraq. \nKeywords: Support Vector Regression, Penman-Monteith, Semiarid, Station,\
    \ Climate \n1. Introduction \nEvapotranspiration (ET) is among the primary and\
    \ essential components of hydrologic cycle. \nHowever, estimation of ET with acceptable\
    \ accuracy is a crucial factor to consider in the fields of \nirrigation scheduling,\
    \ water resources management, water balance studies, etc. Moreover, ET is \nconsidered\
    \ equivalent to crop water requirement as an index in plant growth process. In\
    \ practice, since \nto determine ET is difficult for each crop, firstly, reference\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0) is calculated and \nthereafter using the ET0, crop\
    \ evapotranspiration is calculated (Mehdizadeh, 2018). \nThe only direct method\
    \ for ET measurement is by lysimeter. Nonetheless, maintenance and insulation\
    \ \ncosts make its use difficult. Based on meteorological data, many empirical\
    \ methods have been \ndeveloped for the estimation of ET0 (Mehdizadeh, 2018) such\
    \ as Hargreaves and Samani (1985) (HS) \nmethod. For example, Djaman et al. (2019)\
    \ evaluated the potentials of HS and 34 other equations for \nET0 modeling in\
    \ a semiarid dry climate under limited data. Allen et al. (1998) recommended the\
    \ use \nof FAO Penaman-Moneith (FAO-56-PM) as the sole method for estimating ET0.\
    \ \nDespite being reliable tools for evaluating the precise physics of a phenomenon,\
    \ conceptual and \nphysical based models have limitations in practice. However,\
    \ when physical understanding is of less \npriority to accurate predictions, utilizing\
    \ black box models can be more successful. Multiple linear \nregression (MLR)\
    \ is a classical method that determines relationship linearly between dependent\
    \ and \nEurasian Journal of Science & Engineering                            \

    \ (Nourani et al., 2019a). Toward modeling processes, such kinds \nof linear models\
    \ lose their merit in many fields that are subjected to nonlinearity, dynamism\
    \ and high \ncomplexity in both temporal and spatial scales.  \nRecently, applications\
    \ of artificial intelligence (AI) models such as support vector machine (SVR)\
    \ are \nwidely implemented which yielded several publications. Ferreira et al.\
    \ (2019) proposed a new \napproach for estimation of ET0 with limited climate\
    \ data using artificial neural network (ANN) and \nsupport vector machine (SVM).\
    \ Granata (2019) performed a comparative evaluation of SVR and other \n3 machine\
    \ learning methods for ET modeling in humid subtropical climate. Nourani et al.\
    \ (2019a) \nemployed SVR, HS, MLR and other AI and empirical models for ET0 modeling\
    \ in several climatic \nregions. A thorough evaluation of the current literature\
    \ indicates that there was no study conducted \nthat utilized the application\
    \ of AI, regression and empirical models for ET0 modeling in Iraq. Hence, \nthe\
    \ aim of this study was to investigate the abilities of SVR, HS and MLR models\
    \ for the estimation \nof ET0 in Basrah and Erbil stations of Iraq. This was done\
    \ first by performing sensitivity analysis to \ndetermine the appropriate input\
    \ parameters. Then SVR, MLR and HS models were trained and \nvalidated for 5 different\
    \ input combinations, and finally, compared their performances. \n2. Materials\
    \ and Methods \n2.1 Study Area and the Used Data \nIraq is historically called\
    \ Mesopotamia and is situated in western Asia at 29o5` - 37o22`N latitudes and\
    \ \n38o45` - 48o45`E longitudes. Iraq’s climate is considered to be cold in winter,\
    \ dry and hot in summer \ndue to its location (Nourani et al., 2019b). Study by\
    \ Sarlak and Agha (2018) indicates that arid regions \n(e.g. Baghdad, Basra, and\
    \ Rutbah) and semiarid regions (e.g Erbil) covered around 97% of Iraq’s \nclimate.\
    \ Basra has a monsoon climate and is located in a desert-type environmental zone.\
    \ It constitutes \nvery hot summers more especially between the months of July\
    \ and August with maximum and mean \ntemperatures around 45 0C and 37.4 0C, respectively.\
    \ The potential evapotranspiration of Basra \nprovince exceeds 2,450 mm/year on\
    \ average, while average rainfall is below 100 mm/year annually \n(Jabbar & Zhou,\
    \ 2013). Erbil is located in northern Iraq and is considered Kurdistan’s capital\
    \ city. It \nexperiences cool and rainy winters, warm and dry summers (Rasul et\
    \ al., 2015). Figure 1 presents map \nof Iraq and study locations. \nEurasian\

    \ in aridity index, Basra (arid \nstation) has higher Tmax (up to 52.07 0C) than\
    \ Erbil (semiarid station, 46.78 0C). However, many of the \nfeatures that distinguishes\
    \ arid and semiarid climates are seen in Table 1, including less P and higher\
    \ \nU2 in arid climate due to the dryness of the land. RH has the highest deviation\
    \ from the mean with \n18.46 % and 23.36 % for Basra and Erbil stations owing\
    \ to large difference between its minimum and \nmaximum values. \nAt initial stage\

    \ Regression (SVR) \nBased on SVM concept, the SVR model was developed to be used\

    \ methods, SVR as one of the SVM based methods, \nconsider operational risk as\
    \ the objective function to be minimized instead of minimizing the error \nbetween\
    \ computed and observed values. In SVR, at first, a linear regression is fitted\
    \ on the data and \nthen the outputs go through a non-linear kernel to catch the\
    \ non-linear pattern of the data. Given a set \nof training data {(\U0001D465\U0001D456\

    \ aspects of any AI based modeling is the selection of appropriate input \ncombination,\
    \ as contrary to that may lead to complications and error results (Abdullahi &\
    \ Elkiran, \n2017). To overcome such problems, in this study, sensitivity analysis\
    \ was applied to determine the \ndominant inputs. Though, the effect of decrease\
    \ or increase of ET0 due to change in meteorological \nparameters through non\
    \ dimensional sensitivity analysis has already been applied, but as shown by \n\
    previous studies, the effect of each variable on ET0 can be determined through\
    \ single-input single-out \nAI based sensitivity analysis (Nourani et al., 2019a).\
    \ Hence, this study performed single-input single \noutput SVR based sensitivity\
    \ analysis to ascertain the dominant inputs. The results of the sensitivity \n\
    analysis are given in Table 2. \n \n \n \n \n \nEurasian Journal of Science &\

    \ in Table 2, being situated in the severe climates which are characterized with\
    \ high temperature \nand less amount of precipitation, the 3 categories of temperature\
    \ are more dominant parameters to ET0. \nIn both training and validation phases\
    \ for the two stations, it can be observed that almost all the \nparameters have\
    \ significant effect on ET0 to some certain extent. The only exception is P, which\
    \ \nperformed the least with lowest NSE and highest RMSE 0.034 and 0.205 in the\
    \ validation phase. This \ncould be because, P is inversely proportional to temperature,\
    \ meaning that where there is high \ntemperature (such as in arid and semiarid\
    \ climates) P is at its minimum amount and the direct impact \nof temperature\
    \ on ET0 makes it difficult for P to estimate ET0 in such climate conditions.\
    \ Owing to \nthis circumstance, inclusion of P could reduce the accuracy and efficiency\
    \ of the modeling. Therefore, \nP is discarded as input for the ET0 modeling.\
    \ \nBased on the sensitivity analysis results, 5 different models were developed.\
    \ Table 3 shows the results \nof the ET0 modeling. The models for all stations\
    \ were created using RBF kernel. The RBF kernel’s \ntuning parameters are fewer\
    \ than two sigmoid and polynomial kernels. Moreover, when smoothness \nin assumptions\
    \ is considered, better performance is achieved by RBF kernel in SVR modeling\
    \ (Sharghi \net al., 2018). Hence, for effective ET0 modeling in this study, the\
    \ RBF kernel’s parameters were used. \nFigure 4 shows the box plots of the predicted\

    \ by all models for (a) Basra station (b) Erbil Station \nIn Table 3, the RBF\
    \ for SVR structure indicates the kernel function employed for the model \nconstruction,\
    \ while x-y for MLR and HS models indicate the number of inputs and output. For\
    \ better \nperformance comparison, the HS model was calibrated in to training\
    \ and validation as SVR and MLR \nmodels. As demonstrated in Table 3, different\
    \ performance is achieved by different models with \ndifferent input combinations.\
    \ The effectiveness of the input variables to ET0 led to reliable results even\
    \ \nwith the use of 3 inputs. \nFor Basra station, both SVR and MLR models produced\
    \ good performance with 3 or 4 inputs. Though, \nHS model performance could be\
    \ acceptable, but its accuracy is inferior to the other models in both \ntraining\
    \ and validation phases. This could be attributed to one or all of the following\
    \ reasons; (i) SVR \nand MLR models have the advantage of selecting or incorporating\
    \ the most effective variables to ET0 \nwhich is significant aspect in the modeling,\
    \ whereas HS model has fixed inputs irrespective of the \nvariables performance\
    \ towards ET0. (ii) Apart from temperatures (Tmax, Tmean and Tmin), Ra is also\
    \ \nincluded as input for HS model. Ra being the sun’s intensity at the top of\
    \ the earth’s atmosphere \nconstantly varies due to earth’s elliptical orbit,\
    \ which results in varied earth-sun distance. This \nvariation in Ra coupled with\
    \ severe climate condition may deter the performance of HS model in arid \nand\
    \ semiarid climates. (iii) The climate of the station may have significant effect\
    \ on HS model. For \ninstance, in frozen days of winter, the ET0 time series gets\
    \ small values having less complexity without \nsignificant fluctuations. In this\
    \ period, an empirical model may sufficiently lead to reliable results, but \n\
    in the case of arid and semiarid climates, which have hotter days, the fluctuations\
    \ and complexity of \nET0 process might be large thereby leading to inefficiency\
    \ of HS model. Figure 5 shows time series of \nthe observed and predicted values\
    \ for the best models for Basra station. \nEurasian Journal of Science & Engineering\

    \ station in Table 3, the performance of SVR and MLR models are superior to HS\
    \ model due \nto its inability to perform well in an extreme weather condition.\
    \ However, owing to its capability of \ndealing with nonlinear and stochastic\
    \ nature of ET0 process, SVR is found to be the most accurate \nmodel. The results\
    \ in Table 3 also show that, despite the impact of temperature in prediction of\
    \ ET0 in \nErbil as shown by sensitivity analysis, ET0 being a complex process\
    \ depends on many climatic factors \nwhich their inputs are needed for efficient\
    \ ET0 modeling. Nevertheless, the results imply that with \napplication of temperatures\
    \ (Tmin, Tmean, Tmax) only, a successful modeling of ET0 is achievable. Figure\

    \ EAJSE \n \nVolume 6, Issue 1; June, 2020 \n \n101 \n \nFigure 6: Computed versus\
    \ observed time series for the best models in Erbil station \nComparing the performances\
    \ of the models in Basra and Erbil stations, it can be deduced in Table 3 \nthat,\
    \ all the models have similar performances due to the locations of the stations\
    \ to arid and semiarid \nclimate stations, which are characterized by hot temperatures\
    \ and scarce precipitations. The models \nperformed better in Erbil station than\
    \ Basra station. This might be because extremity of climate \nincreases with increase\
    \ in aridity index, also, stochastic and nonlinear nature of climate increases\
    \ as \naridity index increases due to more fluctuations. Thus, dealing with the\
    \ mentioned problems is more \nchallenging in Basra (Arid) than Erbil (semiarid)\
    \ stations. As seen for both stations, model 4 that \nconstitutes Tmax, Tmin,\
    \ Tmean and U2 provided the best results. This justifies the claim by Nourani\

    \ \nVolume 6, Issue 1; June, 2020 \n \n102 \n(2019b) that, sole application of\
    \ U2 in hydro-climatic modeling may not give reliable performance but \nits inclusion\
    \ with other climate parameters may significantly increase the modeling performance.\
    \ With \nreference to Table 2, it can be observed that with exception of P, U2\
    \ is the least sensitive parameter to \nET0 modeling, but its inclusion with other\
    \ parameters led to best performance of models in Table 3. \nAnother notable observation,\
    \ which is worthy to mention is that, though almost all models’ \nperformances\
    \ are better in Erbil than Basra station, the M4 results show a contrasting performance.\
    \ \nLooking at Table 1 in the descriptive statistics, it can be understood that\
    \ Basra has the highest \nmaximum U2 (8.62 m/s) than Erbil (5.18), also in Table\
    \ 2, Basra has the highest NSE (0.486) than \nErbil (0.227). These two statistics\
    \ are showing that the U2 has a direct effect to the modeling of ET0, \nthe higher\
    \ the U2 the more impact it has in ET0 modeling and vice versa.  \n4. Conclusions\
    \ \nThis study ascertained the capabilities of SVR (as AI) model, MLR and empirical\
    \ HS models in \nmodeling ET0 in Basra (arid) and Erbil (semiarid) climate stations.\
    \ Sensitivity analysis was performed \nto determine the dominant inputs, later;\
    \ the models were applied in order to achieve the study objective. \nThe obtained\
    \ results showed that due to the locations of the stations to arid and semiarid\
    \ climates, \ntemperatures including Tmin, Tmax and Tmean were the most effective\
    \ parameters. The results also \nshowed that all the applied models can lead to\
    \ reliable performance but SVR model produced the best \nperformance due to its\
    \ ability to deal with nonlinear and complex behavior of ET0. However, the results\
    \ \nindicated that all the developed models are capable of producing results but,\
    \ inclusion of U2 for M4, \nsignificantly improved the performance of ET0 modeling.\
    \ This study employed local data analysis \napproach to train and validate the\
    \ models, future studies should consider external data analysis \napproach to\
    \ see how effective the models could perform. Also, the use of other models different\
    \ from \nthose utilized in this study and incorporation of additional stations\
    \ would be useful for future studies. \nReferences \nAbdullahi, J., & Elkiran,\

    \ sector is one of the largest consumers of fresh water. Different types of irrigation\
    \ systems are available, including\ncenter pivot, drip and sprinkler systems,\
    \ and linear motion systems. However, the complex structure of existing irrigation\
    \ systems\nand their high maintenance costs encourage Indian farmers to continue\
    \ using these methods. Due to its ease of use and low energy\nconsumption, surface\
    \ irrigation is one of the most popular irrigation techniques. Although the main\
    \ reasons for poor irrigation\napplication efﬁciency are uneven irrigation water\
    \ distribution and deep absorption, using a variety of technologies, countries\
    \ are\ntrying to increase the sustainability of agriculture. Automated irrigation\
    \ systems contribute signiﬁcantly to water conservation. The\ncombination of automation\
    \ and Internet of Things (IoT) improves agricultural practices. These technologies\
    \ help farmers under-\nstand their crops, minimize their impact on the environment,\
    \ and preserve resources. They also enable efﬁcient monitoring of the\nweather,\
    \ water resources, and soil. This research proposes an intelligent, low-cost ﬁeld\
    \ irrigation system. The proposed prototype\ncan measure soil moisture, rain status,\
    \ wind speed, water level, temperature, and humidity using a hardware sensor and\
    \ unit. To\ndecide whether to turn on or off the motor, a variety of sensors are\
    \ used to get a range of readings and conclusions. They enable\nautomatic watering\
    \ when soil moisture levels are below a certain threshold, and if soil moisture\
    \ is equal to the required moisture,\nthen the irrigation process stops. Every\
    \ few minutes, the sensors measure the environmental factors. Data are collected\
    \ and stored\non a ThingSpeak cloud server for analysis. To evaluate the data\
    \ we collected, we used a variety of models, such as K-nearest\nneighbors (KNN),\
    \ Naïve Bayes, random forest, and logistic regression. Compared to other Naïve\
    \ Bayes and random forest models,\nthe accuracy rate was 98.8%, the mean square\
    \ error was 0.16, and the results of logistic regression, KNN, and SVM were in\
    \ order:\n(98.3%/1.66), (99.3%/0.66), and (99.5%/0.5), respectively. In the end,\
    \ an automated irrigation system run on IoT applications gives\nfarmers access\
    \ to remote monitoring and control, as well as information about the speciﬁcs\
    \ of the irrigation ﬁeld.\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture signiﬁcantly impacts GDP\
    \ in both developed and\ndeveloping countries. By 2050, the world’s population\
    \ is\nexpected to reach 10 billion, requiring a 70% increase in\nfood production.\
    \ Sustainable agriculture principles must be\nfollowed to ensure food security\
    \ for this growing population\n[1, 2]. The objectives of sustainable agriculture\
    \ are to enhance\nagricultural productivity and reduce the negative effects of\n\
    outdated farming methods on the environment. Developing\nadvanced agricultural\
    \ practices necessitates substantial research\nand development, especially in\
    \ the ﬁeld of irrigation, which\naccounts for 70% of the total freshwater resources.\
    \ Internet of\nThings (IoT) and machine learning (ML) systems can help\nmonitor,\
    \ control, and plan irrigation for agricultural regions,\nensuring efﬁcient use\
    \ of freshwater resources [3, 4]. Smart\nagriculture systems utilize IoT and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence to\ncollect and transmit autonomous data to data centers. Artiﬁ-\n\
    cial neural networks and clustering evaluate data to make\ninformed decisions,\
    \ improving the efﬁciency of agricultural\nsystems [5, 6]. A range of IoT and\
    \ ML irrigation systems have\nbeen created with the aim of monitoring and controlling\
    \ irri-\ngation systems. An irrigation system prototype has been\ndesigned that\
    \ integrates sensors and an energy module at\nthe top of the sprinkler [7]. Another\
    \ example connects a\nsoil moisture sensor to the Internet to track soil moisture,\n\
    Hindawi\nJournal of Sensors\nVolume 2024, Article ID 6676907, 15 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2024/6676907\n\
    while a different irrigation system uses ML to assess data on\nair quality, temperature,\
    \ and humidity to schedule irrigation\n[8]. The management of water is extremely\
    \ important due to\nits scarcity. As a substantial portion of fresh water is needed\n\
    for irrigation, this inﬂuences agriculture as well [9]. There are\nmany different\
    \ types of irrigation methods available, such as\nﬂood irrigation, trickle irrigation,\
    \ drip irrigation, and spray\nirrigation [10]. Irrigation planning involves monitoring\
    \ agri-\ncultural factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil mois-\nture.\
    \ Open-source platforms, such as Arduino UNO, are used\nin irrigation management\
    \ systems. Efﬁcient management of\nwater resources is crucial for increasing yields\
    \ and meeting\nfuture food demand in areas with limited resources [11]. We\ncan\
    \ irrigate more areas with the same amount of water if we\nuse a controlled irrigation\
    \ system. In this study, we develop a\nmethod for irrigation prediction to effectively\
    \ control intelli-\ngent autonomous irrigation. To estimate the amount of irri-\n\
    gation required for each crop, the suggested method uses the\nIoT. We took the\
    \ following four steps:\n(1) Install the sensors for water, rain, temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, wind, etc.\n(2) Connecting the sensor set to a data collection\
    \ system.\n(3) Using an IoT server to transfer data to an application\nafter storing\
    \ it on a ThingSpeak cloud server.\n(4) Various algorithms, including K-nearest\
    \ neighbors\n(KNN), Naïve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), SVM,\nand logistic regression\
    \ (LR), are used to analyze the\ndata.\nThis automated irrigation method will\
    \ be extremely use-\nful for large-scale irrigation systems. This will both simplify\n\
    the labor-intensive process of irrigation for plants and improve\nwater management.\
    \ The concept of a related study and the\nproposed automated irrigation system\
    \ are presented in\nthe article. Section 2 presents a state-of-the-art study on\
    \ ML,\nprecision irrigation, automated irrigation systems, and ML\nalgorithms\
    \ for irrigation prediction, along with comparisons\nwith previous research. Section\
    \ 3 presents the proposed irri-\ngation system design. Section 4 displays the\
    \ results of the\nsystem testing and analysis. Future work recommendations\nare\
    \ provided in Section 5. The conclusions of the suggested\nstudy are ﬁnally summarized\
    \ in Section 6.\n2. Literature Review\nThis section covers the contributions of\
    \ several researchers\nin the ﬁelds of IoT and ML for automated irrigation systems\n\
    for agriculture.\nIn this research, a ML algorithm-based, intelligent, adapt-\n\
    able irrigation technique for smart agriculture is presented.\nFor the best possible\
    \ plant development, it uses sensors for\ntemperature, moisture content in the\
    \ soil, and rainfall. A vari-\nety of models, including KNN, LR, neural networks,\
    \ SVM,\nand NB, are utilized to evaluate the data collected using the\nnode-RED\
    \ platform and MongoDB [12]. The IoT and cloud-\nbased architecture are used to\
    \ analyze a smart irrigation\nsystem in this article. The device detects the humidity\
    \ and\nmoisture content of the soil; ML methods are used to ana-\nlyze the data.\
    \ The system uses ML algorithms to forecast the\nideal amount of fresh water for\
    \ crop production, which\nresults in signiﬁcant water savings. The agricultural\
    \ indus-\ntry is predicted to change due to this technology [13]. To\nsolve irrigation-related\
    \ problems, the researcher developed\na solution that uses ML and the IoT. Pressure,\
    \ pH, temper-\nature, humidity, and other sensor types are included in the\nhardware.\
    \ The pH sensor measures the pH of the soil and\nforecasts water requirements.\
    \ The aim is to develop auto-\nmated irrigation systems and save water for future\
    \ usage.\nImprovements in agricultural water efﬁciency and conser-\nvation are\
    \ the objectives of the initiative [14]. In this, a low-\ncost and intelligent\
    \ agricultural irrigation system is pre-\nsented. The constructed prototype uses\
    \ a hardware sensor\nand a unit to monitor temperature, humidity, and water\n\
    level. To determine whether to turn on or off the motor,\nthe study uses a variety\
    \ of sensors to collect various readings\nand values. The IoT-based automated\
    \ system uses applica-\ntions to establish an independent irrigation system. It\
    \ also\nsends SMS messages to our mobile devices, providing us with\nremote updates\
    \ on irrigation ﬁeld details [15]. Research has\ndeveloped a smart irrigation\
    \ system that estimates the depth\nof crop water (WUD) for tomato planting based\
    \ on real-time\nsoil moisture data. A central irrigation controller was used to\n\
    collect the data, guaranteeing an accurate irrigation depth at\nevery irrigation\
    \ event. The experiment was carried out in a\nNorthern Chinese greenhouse [16].\
    \ This research suggests\nthat instead of using physical sensors in a smart irrigation\n\
    system, neural networks based on long–short-term memory\n(LSTM) should be used.\
    \ The system computes transpiration\nin each ﬁeld by transmitting temperature,\
    \ humidity, and soil\nmoisture data via physical sensors. LM35 is used for temper-\n\
    ature, DHT-22 is used for humidity, and a bespoke sensor is\nused for moisture\
    \ readings. Real-time data were collected. The\nﬁndings indicate that the neural\
    \ sensor suggested based on\ndeep learning has a high degree of accuracy when\

    \ a ML\nmodel that regulates the irrigation system with an accuracy of\n98.33%.\
    \ A prototype project with a water pump and relay is\nalso built to demonstrate\
    \ the precise operation of the system\n[29]. Table 2 illustrates previous research\
    \ on the automated\nirrigation system for smart agriculture using ML.\n3. Proposed\
    \ Hybrid Irrigation System\nOne of the essential stages in the production of agricultural\n\
    products is irrigation. Agricultural uses account for around\n80% of the entire\
    \ water supply, although the amount of\nwater available varies considerably from\
    \ region to region.\nThe adoption of microirrigation technology takes an hour.\n\
    But farmers still adhere to an old irrigation pattern, which\ncauses a huge loss\
    \ of water. Existing sprinkler systems are not\nsuitable for all crops. The height\
    \ of the sprinkler irrigation is\n4 feet, so it cannot irrigate crops greater\
    \ than 4 feet. In drip\nand sprinkler irrigation systems, the pipe structure of\
    \ the\nsystem spreads throughout the ﬁeld, making intercultural\noperations difﬁcult.\
    \ Binding up the system during harvesting\nand sawing new crops leads to damage\
    \ to pipes as well as to\ncrops and to a highly labor-consuming process. Damage\
    \ due\nto rodents is more common in ﬁxed-set irrigation systems.\nThe center pivot\
    \ irrigation system and the linear move irri-\ngation system are constructed of\
    \ heavy pipes and are com-\nplex structured. They are not suitable for ﬁelds of\
    \ unusual\nshapes because of their high capital and maintenance require-\nments.\
    \ Related research and ﬁndings are discussed in the\nliterature review, and future\
    \ work recommendations are\nshown in Table 1. To overcome these problems, we proposed\n\
    a hybrid irrigation system that would be able to automatically\nirrigate different\
    \ crops from a remote location. The objective\nof the proposed hybrid irrigation\
    \ system is to overcome the\nproblems of existing systems. The suggested smart\
    \ irrigation\narchitecture is shown in Figure 1.\nThis research has developed\
    \ a smart irrigation system\nthat automatically waters crops without human involvement.\n\
    As a center pivot and linear move irrigation system, it also\nirrigates crops\
    \ with vertical sprinkles, but in a center pivot\nand linear move irrigation system,\
    \ farmers need heavy machin-\nery, power supply, or human resources to move the\
    \ system in\nthe ﬁeld to meet the irrigation requirements. The proposed\nirrigation\
    \ system is a stable and user-friendly model. It is\ndesigned in a T shape, which\
    \ is ﬁxed in the ﬁeld with some\ndistance, and irrigates the ﬁeld with sprinklers.\
    \ The system\nuses moisture sensors to measure the moisture content of the\nsoil\
    \ in ﬁelds. When the moisture levels drop below the mini-\nmum level, the NodeMCU\
    \ board activates the water pump,\nproviding water to the crop. The water sensor\
    \ also monitors\nthe conditions of the water reservoir, sending signals to the\n\
    NodeMCU when the reservoir is empty. Wind speed sensors\nmeasure the wind speed\
    \ on the farm, while rain sensors detect\nthe rain status in the ﬁeld. The data\
    \ from soil moisture sensors\nare displayed on an LCD screen. Solenoid valves\
    \ are embed-\nded to control water ﬂow in different farms. If soil moisture\n\
    drops below the threshold value for farm ﬁeld A, the solenoid\nvalves are activated,\
    \ while the remaining valves remain off.\nThis irrigation system helps farmers\
    \ irrigate their ﬁelds with\nless labor and time. The hybrid irrigation system\
    \ is built with\nthe ability to automatically irrigate crops, considering factors\n\
    such as weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and soil\nmoisture. Taxonomy\
    \ is used to consider the choice of climatic\nand soil conditions, while our sensor\
    \ network keeps track of\nfactors, such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.\
    \ In\ncontrast to the three levels of conventional IoT design (appli-\ncation\
    \ layer, network layer, and perception layer), our pro-\nposed IoT architecture\
    \ comprises four layers: application\nlayer, processing layer, transport layer,\
    \ and perception layer.\nSensors are included in the physical layer, often referred\n\
    to as the perception layer, to collect data such as soil moisture\nlevel, air\
    \ humidity and temperature, rainfall level and wind\nspeed. Using networks like\
    \ Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, and LAN, sensing\ndata that has already been acquired is sent\
    \ from the transport\nlayer to the processing layer. The transport layer sends\
    \ mas-\nsive amounts of data to the processing layer, which stores,\nanalyzes,\
    \ and processes it. It uses modern tools, such as cloud\nservers and the IoT.\
    \ The main goal of the application layer is\nto provide user-speciﬁc application\
    \ services. Our system\nmanages the sensors, GSM module, ThingSpeak cloud\nserver,\
    \ IoT server, Android application (Blynk application),\nand other components.\
    \ We have been able to prepare our\nsystem for complete autonomy thanks to these\
    \ technologies.\n3.1. Architecture of the Proposed System and Working Principals.\n\
    This research developed a method for automatic watering by\nmeasuring ground moisture\
    \ values. This smart irrigation sys-\ntem allows farmers to control and adjust\
    \ irrigation with fewer\nhuman resources. Figure 2 shows the block diagram of\
    \ the\nhybrid irrigation system.\nThe NodeMCU is an open-source platform that\

    5\nis used to measure soil moisture content in the ﬁeld. The\nrequired soil moisture\
    \ threshold value is described, and if\nsoil moisture exceeds or decreases from\
    \ the threshold value,\nthe soil moisture sensor will send the current soil moisture\n\
    value to the server through the node MCU. The updated\ncurrent soil moisture value\
    \ is sent to the application, and\nthe farmer can start irrigation according to\
    \ the minimum\nwater requirements of the crops from a remote location\nautomatically.\
    \ Water sensor is utilized to monitor the water\nstatus at the dam. If the water\
    \ dam is empty, then it will send\nthe empty signals to the application, and at\
    \ the same time, a\nbuzzer is used to indicate an empty water dam if someone is\n\
    around the ﬁeld to shut down the motor manual. A wind\nspeed sensor is used to\
    \ measure the wind speed. Wind speed\nplays an important role in sprinkler water,\
    \ so if wind speed is\nhigh, the farmer can turn off the motor to reduce water\n\
    waste. Solenoid valves control water ﬂow on different farms.\nIf soil moisture\
    \ decreases below the threshold value for a\nfarm ﬁeld, solenoid valves activate\
    \ for that farm, while the\nremaining valves remain off for other farms. An LCD\
    \ screen\nis used to display soil moisture from all ﬁelds for quick\nreview of\
    \ soil moisture at ﬁeld level. This innovative\napproach beneﬁts farmers who struggle\
    \ to irrigate crops.\nAfter the sensors were attached to the board, we started\n\
    programing the board to control the sensors in a way that\nmade it possible for\
    \ different types of data to be collected and\ntransferred in real-time. Then,\

    \ to regulate the voltage within a range\nof 3-5 volts to safeguard sensors and\
    \ equipment from exces-\nsive voltage ﬂuctuations. For the operation of the system,\
    \ we\nused 5 volts of DC power for the node MCU and 2 volts of\npower for the\

    \ blink application, we need to\nestablish the communication between the hardware\
    \ and\nthe blink application. We need to set the virtual connection\nbetween the\

    8\nJournal of Sensors\n3.3.3. Hybrid Irrigation System Working Application. An\n\
    Android application is being developed for farmers to moni-\ntor and control the\
    \ hybrid irrigation system. Input parame-\nters such as soil moisture, wind speed,\
    \ rain status, water,\ntemperature, and humidity are displayed in an application.\n\
    The farmer will be able to monitor and control ﬁeld condi-\ntions at any time\
    \ and from anywhere. With the help of this\napplication, the farmer will control\
    \ the motor switch and\nirrigate the crop according to the requirements and availabil-\n\
    ity of water. The mobile application is shown in Figure 6.\n4. Machine Learning\
    \ Analysis Algorithms\nThis section presents supervised machine learning algorithms\n\
    to analyze the performance of the automated irrigation sys-\ntem. Supervised learning\
    \ is a method where models are\ntrained on a training data set to produce the\
    \ desired output.\nThis process involves acquiring knowledge and improving\nperformance\
    \ over time. The model’s precision is evaluated\nusing a loss function, and adjustments\
    \ are made until the\nerror is reduced. This research utilizes a set of supervised\n\
    machine learning algorithms such as LR, KNN, support vec-\ntor machine (SVM),\
    \ NB, and RF classiﬁers. Table 2 presents\nthe results of previous research studies\
    \ that utilized supervised\nmachine learning techniques to analyze a smart irrigation\n\
    system. The research presents a machine learning-based\nirrigation strategy for\
    \ smart agriculture using sensors like\nsoil humidity, temperature, and rain.\
    \ The node-RED platform\nand MongoDB collect data, with KNN achieving 98.3% accu-\n\
    racy. A web application visualizes and supervises the environ-\nment [12]. This\
    \ study examines a smart irrigation system that\nutilizes the IoT and a cloud-based\
    \ architecture. This technol-\nogy is developed to monitor the moisture and humidity\
    \ con-\ntent of the soil and then use several machine learning\nalgorithms for\
    \ analyzing the data in the cloud. Farmers\nreceive accurate information on water\
    \ content requirements.\nIntelligent irrigation may help farmers use less water\
    \ [13]. In\nthis research, we proposed a new irrigation model (T-shaped\nsprinkler\
    \ irrigation). Different types of sensors are used to\ncollect data from the ﬁeld,\
    \ like soil moisture sensors, wind\nsensors, temperature sensors, rain sensors,\
    \ water level sensors,\netc. All sensors are connected to the node MCU and UNO\
    \ to\ncontrol and collect data from the ﬁeld. Data collected from the\nagriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is stored on the ThingsSpeak cloud server. A\ntotal of 3,000 lines of data\
    \ are collected for analysis using\nmachine learning algorithms to calculate the\
    \ accuracy of the\nworking automated irrigation system. From the collected data,\n\
    80% was used for training purposes, and 20% was used for\ntesting the algorithms.\
    \ After collecting the data for analysis, we\ndeveloped an application for monitoring\
    \ and controlling the\nirrigation. The algorithms used for the classiﬁcation of\
    \ auto-\nmated hybrid irrigation systems are described below.\nCapacitive soil\n\

    \ Support Vector Machine. SVM is a machine learning\ntechnique that is used for\
    \ classiﬁcation and regression tasks\nand is speciﬁcally designed to identify\
    \ objects within given\ndata sets. This method effectively divides n-dimensional\n\
    spaces into various classes, making data entry efﬁcient. The\nresearch used the\
    \ kernel trick mechanism of SVMs for classi-\nﬁcation purposes. This technique\
    \ includes the transformation\nof 2D nonlinear separable data sets into higher\
    \ dimensions,\nsuch as three, four, or 10 dimensions [30]:\nKernel trick : k xi;\
    \ xj\n\x01\n\x03\n¼ xi:xj:\nð1Þ\n4.2. Naïve Bayes. Thomas Bayes (1702–1761) developed\
    \ the\nNaïve Bayesian approach to probabilistic machine learning,\nwhich is based\
    \ on the Bayes theorem. The likelihood of A\noccurring given that B has already\
    \ happened can be used to\ndescribe this theorem. Considering X = (x1,…, xn) is\
    \ the fea-\ntures, and Y is the class variable, in this sentence. The NB\nalgorithm\
    \ is unique in that it assumes that each characteristic\nis independent of the\
    \ others and that modifying one feature\nwill not affect any other. Despite appearing\
    \ straightforward,\nNB has turned out to be a useful classiﬁcation system:\nP\
    \ A B\nð j\nÞ ¼ P B A\nð j\nÞP A\nð Þ\nP B\nð Þ\n:\nð2Þ\n4.3. Logistic Regression.\
    \ LR is a supervised machine-learning\nmethod used for classiﬁcation tasks. This\
    \ method is used to\ndetermine the probability of the dependent variable. The\
    \ tar-\nget variable has a binary nature, indicating that it may only\nassume\
    \ one of two potential classes: success (represented by\n1 or yes) or failure\
    \ (represented by 0 or no). The classiﬁcation\nof this may be categorized into\
    \ three main types: binary or\nbinomial, multinomial, and ordinal.\nThe equation\
    \ for linear regression may be expressed as\nthe equation of a straight line:\n\
    P x\nð Þ\n1\n1 þ e− x−μ\nð\nÞ=s :\nð3Þ\n4.4. K-Nearest Neighbors. The KNN method\
    \ is a supervised\nlearning approach often used in machine learning. The algo-\n\
    rithm operates on the assumption that there exists a degree\nof similarity between\
    \ the newly acquired data and the data\nthat are already accessible. When assigning\
    \ the newly acquired\ndata to the category that exhibits the highest degree of\
    \ similar-\nity with the existing categories, the KNN algorithm uses the\nManhattan\
    \ equation to calculate the distance within this\nframework. The formula for the\
    \ Manhattan distance is shown\nin Equation (4) [12]:\nManhattan distance : d x;\
    \ y\nð\nÞ ¼ ∑n\ni¼1 xi À yi\nj\nj:\nð4Þ\n4.5. Random Forest. Ensemble learning\
    \ is a powerful teach-\ning strategy. For categorization purposes, RF is commonly\n\
    used. Each decision tree’s planned output is represented by\nthe forest’s output,\
    \ and the categorization is based on the\ninformation gathered from the many decision\
    \ trees created\nduring training. Random forest decreases variance in the\nﬁnal\
    \ model, improves performance, and controls overﬁtting\nFIGURE 6: Blynk smart\
    \ irrigation application.\n10\nJournal of Sensors\nby building decision trees\
    \ using random samples of the train-\ning data [8].\n4.6. Collecting and Storing\
    \ Data. Automated modeling and\ncontinuous collection of real-time measurements\
    \ of environ-\nmental factors, such as soil moisture levels, temperature,\nhumidity,\
    \ and pump activity, were taken into consideration\nwhen developing the hybrid\
    \ smart irrigation system based\non the IoT. To perform the analysis, the ThingSpeak\
    \ cloud\nserver is used to collect data from all sensors. We began\nimplementing\
    \ these devices in various environments with\nvarious soil conditions in the mass\
    \ collection process using\nIoT technologies, which are made up of many autonomous\n\
    devices in the form of sensors capable of self-organization\nand working to collect\
    \ information. It was built to distribute\nthe data using an algorithm to provide\
    \ an essential interface\nduring the project. This was a practically complete\
    \ imple-\nmentation of our data set.\nData collected from different sensors with\
    \ different\nranges are discussed below.\n(1) Soil moisture data: As shown in\
    \ Table 3, these data\nare generated by an analog sensor over a range of\nvalues\
    \ between 0 and 1,023. We can see that the\nsmallest value is 314.51 and the maximum\
    \ value is\n984.82, meaning that the average value is 654.5.\n(2) Temperature\
    \ data: A DHT11 temperature sensor was\nused to collect air temperature data from\
    \ the envi-\nronment in the form of Celsius. We can observe that\nthe average\
    \ temperature throughout the collected\nmonths was 26.24, exceeding both its upper\
    \ and\nlower limitations. The minimum value during this\ntime was 18.00, and the\
    \ highest temperature during\nthis time was 38.99.\n(3) Data on air humidity:\
    \ We were able to acquire data on\nair humidity using the same temperature sensor\
    \ that\nhelped with collecting air temperature values, and the\nfollowing is an\
    \ analysis of those data. The average was\n66.4% while collecting the massive\
    \ amount of data,\nwith the lowest value being 38% and the highest value\nbeing\
    \ 81.26%.\nThe study suggests an automated design based on the\npeer-to-peer concept,\
    \ using data that can be classiﬁed with\nvalues that vary from 0 to 1. The ﬁnal\
    \ design was implemen-\nted to show its feasibility and prevent major problems.\

    \ Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms.\nAny machine learning method, including\
    \ KNN, NB, LR,\nRF, and SVMs, which are all classiﬁcation dilemma handling\nalgorithms,\
    \ can forecast the degree of irrigation demand. In\nthis paper, all the abovementioned\
    \ techniques are used to\nanalyze the collected data. For experimental analysis,\
    \ a col-\nlection of 3,000 data recordings was collected. These factors\ninclude\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and the water\npump for irrigation decision-making.\
    \ Five machine learning\nalgorithms, KNN, NB, LR, RF, and SVMs, were utilized\
    \ in an\nexperimental investigation. Two different colors are used to\nrepresent\
    \ the graph. Red colors are used to represent 0, and\nblue colors represent 1.\
    \ To achieve better accuracy and appli-\ncation modeling, the data available on\
    \ soil moisture, air tem-\nperature, humidity, and motor working status are divided\n\
    into two sets: the training data set and the testing data set.\nThe training set\
    \ contains 80% of the data, and 20% is used for\ntesting and validation. The training\
    \ data set is used to train\nthe different machine learning algorithms, and the\
    \ testing\ndata set is used to test the models, which will help to ﬁnd\nthe accuracy\
    \ of their workings and the best machine learning\nalgorithm. Figure 7 represents\
    \ the training data and test data\nin a graphical view.\nThe real-time collected\
    \ data from ﬁeld are stored for\nanalysis using different machine learning algorithms.\
    \ The\ndata collection process is done on a ThingSpeak cloud server\nand published\
    \ on Mendeley Data [37]. Table 3 shows the\ndata for making training predictions,\
    \ looking at presorted\ndata, and showing outcomes. After analyzing all ﬁve machine\n\
    learning algorithms, the results from the models used in this\nstudy are shown\
    \ together with their accuracy and mean\nsquare error (RMSE) in Table 4. The same\
    \ outcome is shown\nin Figure 8, as in a graph.\n(1) The output of the KNN model\
    \ is shown in Line 1,\nwhere the corresponding red and blue colors of the\ntraining\
    \ and testing sets stand in for the pumping\npoints between “0” and “1.” All the\
    \ data points sup-\nplied in red and green are shown to be integrated into\ntheir\
    \ surroundings by the model, respectively. The\nmodel’s rate of accuracy in describing\
    \ the outcomes\nis 98.3%.\n(2) Line 2 displays a 99.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16\n\
    means-square error for the RF model.\n(3) Line 3 shows the results of the NB model\
    \ with a\n98.8% accuracy rate and a 0.16 means-square error.\n(4) In Line 4, where\
    \ the SVM model’s results are dis-\nplayed and as a result, the mean square error\
    \ is\n0.66 and the accuracy rate is 99.3%.\n(5) Finally, a LR model with a mean\
    \ square error that is\nvery nearly 0.5 and a rate of accuracy of 99.5%.\nThe\
    \ accuracy of ML algorithms is determined through\ntraining and validation processes.\
    \ Various machine learning\nalgorithms provide satisfactory results after performing\
    \ anal-\nysis of the collected data. As we can see, the accuracy rates of\nthe\
    \ NB and RF model of 98.8% and the MSE of 0.16 are higher\ncompared to KNN, SVM,\
    \ and LR with successive results:\n(98.3%/1.66), (99.3%/0.66), and (99.5%/0.5),\
    \ respectively.\n5. Future Work Recommendations\nTo increase the efﬁciency of\
    \ the system, some recommenda-\ntions are listed for future research work:\n(1)\
    \ To maintain the soil quality, there is a need to moni-\ntor soil salt rate and\
    \ pH level of the soil.\n(2) To increase the crop production to fulﬁll the future\n\
    needs, controlling and monitoring of the fertilization\nprocess are required to\
    \ be utilized with the existing\nsmart irrigation process.\n(3) Improvement of\
    \ the system is done by adding new\ncontrollers and sensors to increase the stability,\
    \ reli-\nability, structure, and working efﬁciency of the system.\n(4) Artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligent system will be installed with the\nirrigation system to predict\
    \ the user action, rainfall\ncondition patterns, and time to harvest extra.\n\
    (5) To estimate the water requirement for irrigation process,\nwater meter can\
    \ be installed in the irrigation systems.\n(6) In this project, motor is controlled\
    \ from mobile\napplication, fully automated motor system should\nbe installed.\n\
    (7) Cameras can be used for detecting the deeds and for\ncontrolling and monitoring\
    \ the plant growth.\n(8) Alarm system can be installed in the smart agricul-\n\
    ture system for alerting the farmers regarding the ﬁre\nand the any movement in\
    \ the agriculture ﬁeld. This\ncan be achieved using the ﬁre sensor and motion\n\
    detector sensor.\n(9) Decision making can be done using the big data and\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligent technologies. These technologies\nwill help the smart irrigation\
    \ for past and future data\nprediction in the IoT system.\n6. Conclusion\nIncreased\
    \ production is an important ﬁrst step since it will be\nnecessary to meet the\
    \ projected 70% rise in global food con-\nsumption by 2050. The management of\
    \ water consumption\nfor irrigation is another aspect of it. In this research,\
    \ a hybrid\nirrigation system is suggested. Three modules make up our\nsuggested\
    \ approach to smart irrigation: As the ﬁrst module,\nthe sensor network identiﬁes\
    \ variables affecting the require-\nment for water. We use sensors such as DHT11,\
    \ a capacitive\nsoil moisture sensor, a wind sensor, a rain sensor, and a water\n\
    level sensor to measure temperature, soil moisture, temperature,\nhumidity in\
    \ the air, wind speed, rain status, and reservoir water\nlevel. In the second\
    \ module, we utilize the ThingSpeak cloud\nserver and the Bylnk cloud server as\
    \ IoT servers to send and\nreceive data. In the third module, we used machine\
    \ learning\nalgorithms to analyze the data and determine how accurate\nthe decision-making\
    \ process was to determine the need for irri-\ngation. KNN, NB, LR, and RF were\
    \ just a few of the models we\nJournal of Sensors\n13\nused to analyze the data\
    \ we collected. When comparing the\naccuracy rates and mean squared errors of\
    \ different models,\nthe NB and RF models have an accuracy rate of 98.8% and\n\
    MSE of 0.16. In comparison, the KNN, SVM, and logistic regres-\nsion models have\
    \ accuracy rates of 98.3%, 99.3%, and 99.5%, with\ncorresponding MSE values of\
    \ 1.66, 0.66, and 0.5, respectively.\nData Availability\nThe data used to support\

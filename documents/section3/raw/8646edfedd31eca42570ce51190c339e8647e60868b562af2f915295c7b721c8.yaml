    Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing ((AISC,volume 931)) Abstract In
    our days, almost every business relays on medium-to-high performance computer
    systems which presents the possibility of being the target of different threats
    that can exploit the vulnerable software, respectively hardware components. The
    concept of “security risk” can be described as a specific threat that using a
    specific type of attack presents the ability to exploit system vulnerabilities,
    action which will affect the entire integrity of the targeted systems. From this
    point of view, the main idea of this paper is to present a Lego methodology approach
    for Common Criteria certification that can be applied to IoT Telemetry systems.
    Furthermore, we present scenarios of implementation of our approach to increase
    robustness level applied for agro-telemetry system. Keywords Lego methodology

    Internet of Things (IoT) systems poses several challenges, as IoT devices become
    more ubiquitous. To discover the impact that security risks can have over a System
    Under Analysis (SUA), there must be specified very clearly the systems’ description,
    considering two essential perspectives which present certain criteria, such as:
    (a) Information and functionality: Evaluation of the security risks impact. An
    appropriate example can be the affected parts of systems’ services, including
    data processing functions. This perspective is also known as Aim of refinement;
    Criteria of partition: Specific sections of the data or functions can require
    distinct security requirements which present unique criticality levels. (b) System
    architecture: Aim of refinement: Every level of each component of a system can
    present a security risk potential. These levels must be detected in order to improve
    the security level of the entire system; Criteria of partition: Every component,
    such as software and hardware components or even an entire network, presents several
    security risks that can be traced. Because of this characteristic, the architecture
    of potentially vulnerable systems is divided into components, the specific risks
    of each component being identified. In the computer security field, the threat
    concept is defined as an imminent danger situation that can exploit the vulnerabilities
    of a system in order to breach its security mechanisms. Threats can be divided
    into three main categories, as follows [1]: Intentional threats – represent premeditated
    invasive actions. The best example of intentional threats consists of computer
    crimes, including software attacks, theft, espionage, sabotage, etc.; Unintentional
    threats – represent accidental software modifications due to human mistakes or
    technical misunderstandings; Natural threats – represent several threats that
    can damage the physical equipment, such as: natural disasters, power failures,
    fires and floods. The main idea of this article is the presentation of a Lego
    methodology approach for Common Criteria that can be applied to IoT Telemetry
    systems [2]. This methodology allows to select security functions according to
    a specific use case, integrate various evaluated and non-evaluated components,
    plug-and-play (exchange, add, remove and update) new components, perform additional
    tests to demonstrate a higher robustness level of some security functions. As
    it was previously specified, the natural and unintentional threats will be excluded
    from this work activity. The attention will be focused on the intentional threats.
    These threats can also be classified into 3 categories, as follows [1]: Depletion:
    the targeted sectors of these threats are data and resource availability. As an
    effect, a resource will be consumed faster than it can be replenished. After a
    period of time, a resource which is being attacked becomes depleted, fact that
    affects the target functionality; Alteration: in this case, threats occur when
    an unauthorized entity tries to modify private code or data, affecting in this
    manner the integrity of the target; Disclosure: when talking about disclosure,
    threats will affect only the information confidentiality, especially specific
    system information, such as backup and temporary files, patch levels, version
    numbers software distribution, etc. The article will be structured in 5 Sections.
    The current Section represents the introduction, having the main purpose of providing
    sufficient information for a general idea of the security risks impact. In Sect.
    2 will be analyzed the present work activities in this field, being mentioned
    only the most notable research efforts. The methodology approach for Common Criteria
    can be seen in Sect. 3, while several scenarios of implementation will be presented
    in Sect. 4. The last section of this paper draws the conclusions and envisions
    future work. 2 Related Work The innovative developments in the Information and
    Communication Technology (ICT) field produce various embedded things/devices which
    contain sensors and have the property to transfer data among other objects [3].
    In the paper [4], a study has been conducted regarding the methods through which
    the equipment from a use case on a smart service in the industrial maintenance
    domain are securely transmitting their data. The paper examines two solutions
    focused on isolation and execution environment security, namely a Security Controller
    and the ARM TrustZone. For their comparison, a system that takes a device’s snapshot
    authentication has been designed. The results demonstrate increased flexibility
    when using the TrustZone technology and a much secure physical environment for
    the Security Controller. Finally, it is conducted that the best approach is only
    based on the desired use case. The article also proposes a hybrid solution that
    increases the security of industrial applications, which could bring a contribution
    to the future Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Furthermore, there is a recent
    survey about technical approaches, functional requirements, and on overall, the
    security status based on the OpenFog’s [5] architecture. The OpenFog Consortium
    designed the Fog Nodes functional security requirements by adopting the Common
    Criteria standard. The Fog Nodes bolster a trusted computing environment as well
    as a secure service provisioning and also the hardware virtualization. Therefore,
    by using these entities, the multi-tier omnipresent communication-computing infrastructure
    which encompasses a multitude of devices and covers sophisticated hierarchies
    of application areas and administration, will have a more trusted environment
    due to increased security levels. The IoT paradigm emerged into the car tracking
    technology, is being described in [6]. The paper describes the IoT’s role in designing
    a car tracking system as well as the needed standards, principles in order to
    have an increased quality factor. Reliability engineering is the concept behind
    these standards. Common criteria plays an important role by assuring consistency
    and error management, these being the basic fundamental features a system must
    have to guarantee it matches the function for which it was designed. 3 Methodology
    Approach for Common Criteria - Lego Methodology Concept The Common Criteria (CC)
    represents an international standard regarding computer security information (ISO/IEC
    15408) [7]. Furthermore, Common Criteria is a framework in which SFRs (Security
    Functional Requirements) and SARs (Security Assurance Requirements) can be foreseen
    in an ST (Security Target) [8]. The CC assessment methods are performed on systems
    and computer security items. The product or the system which represents the subject
    of the evaluation is called Target of Evaluation (TOE). The evaluation has to
    examine if the security requirements are accomplished; this is performed through
    Protection Profile (PP), Security Target (ST) and Security Functional Requirements
    (SFRs) [9]. The PP is a document created most often by the user or by the community
    and its major role is to detect security requirements for a class of security
    devices significant for a specific target. Retailers have the possibility to implement
    items that submit with one or more PPs, but they also can have their products
    evaluated against those PPs. In this particular case, a PP can be considered a
    template for the ST products. ST represents the document that identifies the security
    features of the main goal of the evaluation. The TOE is evaluated against the
    SFRs settled in its ST; this allows the retailers to suit the evaluation in order
    to match with the abilities of their item. SFRs stipulate the functions that can
    be provided by an item. Common Criteria has a specific list consisting of these
    functions, and the list can be different depending on the type of the evaluation
    even if the targets of the evaluation are the same type [10]. The evaluation procedure
    makes an attempt in the process of determining the degree of reliability of the
    product’s security characteristics by quality assurance procedures, represented
    by SARs and Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL). SARs represent depictions of the
    actions carried out through the product`s evolution and evaluation to provide
    the supposed security functionality. The requirements from the CC catalog are
    documented in PP and ST. EAL is the numerical evaluation which describes the depth
    and the harshness of an evaluation. Each EAL is correlated with a package of SARs
    which includes the full development of an item. Common Criteria stipulates 7 levels
    of EAL, EAL1 being the most fundamental with low costs, while EAL7 is the most
    rigorous and the most expensive. Higher EAL does not suppose a more precise security,
    it only intends to assure that the TOE has been verified with higher accuracy
    [11]. 3.1 Lego Methodology Concept The ‘Lego methodology’ was developed to resolve
    the limitations introduced by the current composition approaches and concentrates
    on the evaluation of a list set in advance of Security Functions (SF) necessary
    in a use-case already existent [12]. This solution allows a global and unique
    Evaluation level (EAL LEGO) of the composite Platform with different robustness
    levels (Vulnerability ANalysis (VAN)-HIGH, VAN-Moderate, VAN-LOW) among security
    functions within the Platform (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Evaluation under current CC
    approaches vs. evaluation under Lego methodology approach Full size image This
    methodology permits the selection of certain security functions related to a use
    case, the integration of different evaluated and non-evaluated parts, the installation
    and utilization of new components, and the execution of additional tests to demonstrate
    an increased robustness level of the security functions. This methodology leads
    to the following benefits: Evaluation with decreased effort, time and at low cost
    by reducing the perimeter of the evaluation, making the evaluation of the platform
    fast and easy; Dynamic plug-and-play integration by updating, adding, removing
    or replacing a Component with less effort; Possibility of obtain different robustness
    levels and increasing the level of robustness of required security functions within
    the system; The following roles are considered in the Lego methodology: Component
    Developer: Entity developing the Component; it might also be the sponsor of the
    Component evaluation; Component Evaluator: Entity performing the Component evaluation;
    Component Certification Body: Entity performing the Component certification; Composite
    Platform Integrator: Entity integrating the Components in the Platform; it might
    also be the sponsor of the Composite Platform evaluation; Composite Platform Evaluator:
    Entity performing the composite Platform evaluation; Composite Platform Certification
    Body: Entity performing the composite Platform certification; Composite Product
    Evaluation Sponsor: Entity in charge of contracting the composite product evaluation.
    In the concept of Lego Methodology, several suppositions are taken into consideration,
    such as: each Component is certified and completely specified, the objectives
    required by the working environment of each Component are well-defined, the Integrator
    should know the components functionality, the Platform has a fixed number of components
    in order to be certified, etc. The described Lego methodology can be employed
    for demonstrating the compositional evaluation within a platform designed for
    security through isolation, called ODSI (On Demand Secure Isolation) [13]. The
    ODSI Platform combines the following independent certified components with different
    security levels (see Fig. 2): Fig. 2. The architecture behind the Network Manager,
    Keyring Manager and Administration Manager interaction Full size image (a) Configuration
    Manager: Certified Component was providing the Isolation security function (SF-ISO)
    between memory partitions. It is the base component on which the security of SFs
    DISP, AUTH, COMM and KEYM is built; (b) Administration Manager: Certified Component
    providing the Dispatch security function (SF-DISP) of commands between partitions;
    (c) Network Manager: Certified Component providing the Authentication (SF-AUTH)
    and the Communication (SF-COMM) security functions; (d) Keyring Manager: Certified
    Component providing the key storage security function (SF-KEYM). 4 Scenarios of
    Implementation In this section, there will be presented two scenarios of implementation,
    one being more of a general overview of the Lego methodology approach on increasing
    the robustness level of a SF within the CC Component and the other presenting
    the Agro-Telemetry use case that utilizes the CC compliant ODSI platform. 4.1
    Scenario 1 - Increase the Robustness Level of a Given SF Within the Component
    In this scenario, the re-evaluation effort will focus on testing that the SF1
    can resist at a security level higher than VAN.3 and that no other part of the
    Component A1 can affect or decrease this security level. A. Actors The following
    Actors are considered in this scenario: Same Evaluator of the Component A1 and
    the SF1; Component Developer; Product Evaluation Sponsor: This actor may be the
    Component Developer. B. Assumptions The following assumptions are considered for
    the evaluation under this scenario: Component A1 is CC-certified; The re-evaluation
    of SF1 and the evaluation of A1 will both be conducted by the same evaluation
    facility. The benefits of this assumption are the following: a full evaluation
    of the Component A1 conducted by the new evaluation facility is not required;
    delivery of all evaluation evidences (documents, source code, samples) to the
    new evaluation facility is not required; the base evaluation results can be reused.
    The source code of the Component A1 is identical between the base certification
    and the reevaluation of SF1. C. Inputs and Required Evidences The following inputs
    are required prior to the evaluation under this scenario: ST, TDS (Target-of-Evaluation
    Design), FSP (Functional SPecification), ATE (Assurance TEsts) of the Component;
    SFRs that fulfill the SF1 are clearly identified and the rationale is provided
    in the Security Target; The SF1-Interfaces and Modules that implement the SF1
    are described in the TDS and FSP Documents; Interactions between SF1-Interfaces
    and the other interfaces of the Components A1 are described in the TDS (TOE Design)
    document; SF1-Interfaces and Interactions are tested, and the conducted tests
    are described in the ATE Document. D. Additional Requirements during Re-evaluation
    The goal of the Lego certification within this scenario may be achieved by the
    following means: Requirements to be fulfilled by the Component Developer or the
    Product Evaluation Sponsor: Additional information of each SF1-Interfaces may
    be required. This information will provide the evaluator with a better understanding
    of how this security function is performed. These additional details of SF1-Interfaces
    can be included in the TDS and the FSP documentation if the SF1-Interface is an
    external one (TSFI); Additional information of the interactions between SF1-Interfaces
    and the other interfaces of the Component A1 may be required. This information
    will provide the evaluator a better understanding of how the SF1 interacts with
    the other parts of the component. These additional details about interactions
    can be included in the TDS; The evaluator may require a characterization of the
    SF1-Interfaces at the implementation level (e.g. description of parameters passed
    from a SF1-Interface to another, variables, data identified for this SF1-Interface
    that are going to be used by other interfaces, return values from those interfaces,
    etc.). Such complete characterizations of SF1-Interfaces are meant to allow their
    exercise during reviewing and testing. These additional details can be included
    in the TDS and the FSP documentation if the SF1-Interface is an external one (TSFI);
    Since they play no role in testing, it is not mandatory to describe at an implementation
    level the SF1-Interfaces that have no interaction with the other interfaces of
    the component; Additional functional depth tests by the developer may be required
    to determine if all SF1-Interfaces and Interactions are completely tested. These
    additional tests can be provided in ATE. Requirements to be addressed by the Evaluator:
    Compliance analysis of the updated evidences; Additional penetration and/or independent
    tests by the evaluator may be conducted to determine if the SF1 is resistant at
    a level higher than VAN.3. 4.2 Scenario 2 – Agro-Telemetry System In this scenario,
    it is presented the implemented Agro-Telemetry System. This system is used for
    precision agriculture and has two functions: data acquirement and data transmission
    along with processing. The first function allows sensors to collect data on temperature,
    humidity sunlight and actuators to execute commands in order to activate mechanic
    systems, such as irrigating. The data transmission and processing function illustrate
    the technique of sensor data transportation from the gateway to server; information
    is processed by the server and is presented to users through Web interface. This
    use-case handles two types of data: business and security data. Business data
    consists of raw information collected from sensors, representing the processed
    data produced by the server, while security data is residing on user credentials,
    log data, system configuration (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Agro-Telemetry system Full
    size image Table 1 concretizes the impacts of feared events. Table 1. Impacts
    of all feared events Full size table Regarding the threats analysis, there will
    be described some examples of contra measures to each threat that relates to a
    feared event. When alteration of Business data is involved, a man-in-the-middle
    attack may interfere on the network. As a contra measure, a deployment of an ODSI
    token verification service for user authentication will be performed. This action
    is provided by the Network Manager whose Certified Component supplies the Authentication
    (SF-AUTH) and the Communication (SF-COMM) security functions. Disclosure of Security
    data implies threats on the gateway such as the side-channel attack which can
    be prevented by deploying a technique called ODSI end-to-end encryption that embodies
    the Certified Component of the Administration Manager which provides the Dispatch
    security function (SF-DISP) of commands between partitions. Considering the unavailability
    of the Data Processing function, a possible threat accomplished on the server
    is the Denial of Service (DOS) attack which can be countered when an ODSI isolation
    BIP technique is deployed on the server through the Configuration Manager’s Certified
    Component which provides the Isolation security function (SF-ISO) between memory
    partitions. 5 Conclusions As shown in this paper, Lego Methodology offers an encouraging
    and feasible way in order to extend the current CC approach to support and facilitate
    composition and allow the evaluation of IoT platforms. The Lego Methodology applied
    on ODSI platform allows a secure communication with a remote entity, end-to-end
    encryption, key management and secure storage without the limitations brought
    in by the present composition approaches. As future work we envision developing
    an application in a real-world context and perform the compositional evaluation.

    \ such as the Internet of Things, raising the productivity of\nagricultural and\
    \ farming activities is critical to improving yields and cost-effectiveness. IoT,\
    \ in particular,\ncan improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes\
    \ by eliminating human intervention\nthrough automation. The fast rise of Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life\nsectors, including\
    \ business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending\n\
    traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various\
    \ obstacles. IoT aids in\ncollecting data that is useful in the farming sector,\
    \ such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility,\namount of water required\
    \ for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of\n\
    creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively\
    \ use technology to monitor\ntheir forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors,\
    \ including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor\nnetworks), are utilized for agricultural\
    \ inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact\noutput and\
    \ utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from\
    \ afar. The goal\nof this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT\
    \ approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates\nIoT applications, benefits, current\
    \ obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart\nagricultural\
    \ system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield\
    \ and save time,\nsuch as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer\
    \ management.\nKeywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT;\
    \ sensors; economic growth; water\nmanagement and water resources\n1. Introduction\n\
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices,\n\
    people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without\
    \ human\ninteraction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical\
    \ and virtual worlds\nby interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked\
    \ industries, smart cities, smart\nhomes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart\
    \ agriculture, connected buildings and\ncampuses, health care, and logistics are\
    \ all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing\nneed for food, both in\
    \ terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and\nmodernization\
    \ of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set\
    \ of\ntechnologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization\
    \ solutions.\nScientiﬁc institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural\
    \ sector are racing to provide\nmore and more IoT solutions to agricultural business\
    \ stakeholders, laying the foundation\nfor a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream\
    \ technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity\nis anticipated to support between\
    \ 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need\nfor specialized food\
    \ production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means\nAgronomy\

    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n2 of 21\nthat by 2050, global food production will have\
    \ to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is\nincreasingly crucial in agriculture,\
    \ with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and\nothers, playing signiﬁcant\
    \ roles in many nations’ economies.\nIn 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars\
    \ and was projected to be 1256.1 billion\ndollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally\
    \ from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to\nassure timely and regular agricultural\
    \ growth and yield due to the combined effects of a\ngrowing population, natural\
    \ weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change.\nFarm management,\
    \ animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental con-\ntrol,\
    \ autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications\
    \ in\nagriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands\
    \ contributing to\nagricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal,\
    \ crop protection, and\ncrop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential\
    \ to world food production [4].\nFarmers, for example, can manage ﬁeld environments\
    \ in real-time and more effortlessly\nregulate ﬁelds using wireless sensors and\
    \ mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT\ntechnology to capture essential\
    \ data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision\nagriculture to\
    \ produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision\n\
    agriculture cycle.\nFigure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day,\nand it will\
    \ become even more critical in the future to ensure proper ﬁeld expansion and\n\
    crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task\
    \ of meeting\nrising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of\
    \ fertility due to poor\nutilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers,\
    \ and pesticides. Crop diseases,\nwater shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control\
    \ monitoring are only some of the challenges\nthat different IoT automation and\
    \ control systems can efﬁciently address [6]. This is why\ncontemporary agriculture\
    \ employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop\nharvesting, storage,\
    \ and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its\naccurate\
    \ monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous\n\
    drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural\n\
    equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is\
    \ then\nimmediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling\
    \ reliable data\ngathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-speciﬁc\
    \ agriculture [7].\nUsing advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities\
    \ has increased crop\nproduction while also improving soil fertility.\nThe following\
    \ are the signiﬁcant contributions made by this study:\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\
    3 of 21\n•\nThe world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing\
    \ IoT approaches\nfor providing solutions and new applications and technology.\n\
    •\nIdentiﬁcation of numerous application ﬁelds, as well as a summary of the most\
    \ recent\nstate-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.\n•\nThe Internet of Things’\
    \ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such\nas resource\
    \ scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.\nThe rest of the paper is laid\
    \ out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the\ndetails of smart agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the\nmany types\
    \ of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identiﬁes unsolved problems\n\
    and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.\n2. Major Applications\
    \ of Smart Agriculture\nPrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring\
    \ are a few agri-\ncultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every\
    \ element of traditional farming\noperation may be substantially improved by combining\
    \ cutting-edge sensors and Internet\nof Things technology. At the moment, the\
    \ Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’\nharmonious incorporation\
    \ into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly in-\nconceivable\
    \ heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and\n\
    yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that\
    \ IoT may assist\nin resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture\
    \ approaches [7]. Figure 2\nillustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural\
    \ monitoring system applica-\ntions, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications\
    \ are classiﬁed as IoT agricultural apps,\nsmartphone-based agricultural apps,\
    \ and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs) have recently\
    \ been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture,\nincluding irrigation\
    \ sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil\nfarming,\
    \ smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Signiﬁcant\n\
    instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efﬁciency\
    \ at various\nstages are included here.\nFigure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n4 of 21\n2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water Levels\n\
    Soil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas,\n\
    both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with\
    \ soil\nmonitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are\
    \ correctly identiﬁed,\nfarming patterns and methods become readily understandable.\
    \ The soil’s moisture content,\nwetness, fertilizer application, and temperature\
    \ trends are all being monitored. Soil’s\nmoisture environment management system\
    \ uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By\nproposing an appropriate fertilizer\
    \ approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report\nassist farmers in increasing\
    \ crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital\noutputs. The judgment\
    \ is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to\npredeﬁned threshold\
    \ levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation\nsystem’s\
    \ automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value,\
    \ the\nwater pump is triggered [10].\nSoil mapping enables you to sow many crop\
    \ types in the same ﬁeld, allowing you\nto match better soil characteristics,\
    \ such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even\nplanting depth, as certain\
    \ crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally,\ngrowing many crops\
    \ concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such\nas resource\
    \ conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture\n\
    and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain\
    \ sensors\nlocated in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits\
    \ all sensor data and\ninformation. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture\
    \ threshold algorithm will be\ndevised and implemented in a microcontroller-based\
    \ gateway to regulate the amount of\nwater given to the ﬁelds. Finally, the user\
    \ is provided with control via an IoT module based\non rain sensor data to interrupt\
    \ or restart water ﬂow as needed [11].\nIf the ﬁeld contains an adequate amount\
    \ of water, no water will be pumped into\nit. However, when the soil’s water moisture\
    \ content falls below a predetermined level,\nwater is pumped into the ﬁeld until\
    \ the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11\nsensor monitors the ﬁeld’s\
    \ temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor\ndetects when an\
    \ intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values\nare\
    \ continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a\
    \ GSM\nsim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds\
    \ IoT capabilities\nto the system [12].\n2.2. System of Irrigation Monitoring\n\
    Numerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production\n\
    technology must signiﬁcantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food.\n\
    Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated\
    \ farming.\nThese efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution\
    \ to the irrigation system’s\npresent problems. At the moment, crop irrigation\
    \ is carried out manually and by established\ncustomary practices. When crops\
    \ are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less\ncalcium. Frequent irrigation\
    \ kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation\nof crops becomes\
    \ a considerable difﬁculty [13]. A smart irrigation management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufﬁcient water from\n\
    a tank to ﬁeld crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for\
    \ determining\nwhether plants require watering based on information gathered from\
    \ monitoring and\nregulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overﬂow\
    \ [14].\nKamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ wireless sen-\nsor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically\
    \ administers and monitors\nthe irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01\
    \ and Arduino tools as the\ncommunication network transceiver and CPU. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor data will be sent to\nthe base station via NRF24L01. Then, the\
    \ sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server\nthrough the base station.\
    \ This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data\nin a database\
    \ and connect it to an Android application.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n5 of 21\n\
    2.3. Fertilizer Administration\nAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based\
    \ technique and upgraded the previous\nsystem, which predicted agricultural yields\
    \ using backpropagation and a random forest\nalgorithm. It recommends fertilizer\
    \ application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric\ndata via a mobile network\
    \ and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes\na segmented tank to\
    \ collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three\nmodes (manual,\
    \ auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertil-\nizer\
    \ and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required\n\
    is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio.\
    \ Finally,\nin smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer\
    \ ratio, or water,\nthe plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended\
    \ automatically. The IoT\nmodule will continuously collect information on the\
    \ temperature and soil moisture. The in-\nformation collected will be stored in\
    \ the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you\nwhenever the given data changes\
    \ and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid\ncrystal display.\n\
    2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest Control\nHuman operators frequently monitor insect\
    \ pests via time-consuming and costly on-\nsite inspections, which results in\
    \ low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring\nhas been possible due\
    \ to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics.\nMonitoring\
    \ costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-\n\
    equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can\
    \ locate\nand count insect pests captured in traps automatically.\nReddy et al.,\
    \ 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest man-\nagement\
    \ in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated\
    \ sensors\nhelp in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity.\
    \ These features\nhelp determine the environmental conditions in which the plant\
    \ ﬂourishes and the plants’\nillnesses. It detects disease on the ﬁeld and sprays\
    \ prescribed insecticides. Web cameras\ntake images that are then preprocessed\
    \ to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect\ndetection, image scaling, image\
    \ enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to\ncategorize characteristics\
    \ generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis,\nskewness,\
    \ and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for\nhardware,\
    \ power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identiﬁed, the\n\
    program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended\n\
    fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves.\
    \ This study was\nconﬁned to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method\
    \ may be used for various\ncrops with favorable outcomes in the future.\nA solution\
    \ is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN\napproach\
    \ and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique\n\
    is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method\
    \ are used\nto create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a speciﬁc resolution\
    \ before data is sent into\nthe CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested\
    \ algorithm was evaluated on four\ndiseases known to have a higher effect on grape\
    \ production. The diseases include esca\nblack measles, anthracnose, leaf blight,\
    \ and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also\nforecasts illnesses based\
    \ on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from\nthe humidity,\
    \ temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry\nPi\
    \ to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to\
    \ anticipate\nthe illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the\
    \ ﬁndings of the preceding\ndetection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate\
    \ fertilizers in the right quantities\nwill be provided to minimize fertilizer\
    \ misuse and cost savings [18].\nTo detect pests in rice during ﬁeld production\
    \ and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things\nsupported a model-based UAV with\
    \ the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based\nUAV was developed on\
    \ AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit\nrice disease\
    \ images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identiﬁes the\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n6 of 21\ndisease and insects by integrating the conﬁdence\
    \ ratings of the labels. The label identiﬁes\nthe objects in the images. To determine\
    \ the pest, the tag with the greatest conﬁdence\nresults and more than or equal\
    \ to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests\nare discovered\
    \ in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the ﬁeld owner directly to take\n\
    preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that\
    \ inﬂuence\nrice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize\
    \ rice waste during\nproduction by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals\
    \ [19]. Table 1 summarizes\nmany current smart agricultural applications.\nTable\
    \ 1. Selected applications based on smart agriculture.\nRef.\nApp\nDescription\n\
    [7]\nSoil Analysis\nLand management offers long-term promise based\non climate,\
    \ geography, and reasonably stable soil\ncharacteristics (like soil texture, depth,\
    \ and\nmineralogy). This application aids farmers in better\nunderstanding the\
    \ potential of their land and climate\nvariations alteration and extenuation measures.\n\
    [9]\nFarm Manager\nFarm Manager App helps the farmers to decide\nwhich techniques\
    \ should apply before planting\nstarts. This app views, organizes, and edits all\n\
    information about your ﬁeld like yield, planting, and\nspraying conditions without\
    \ your mobile phone.\n[7]\nPest Management\nBy collecting pest occurrence information\
    \ from\nfarms, Village Tree provides smart pest control\nsolutions. In addition,\
    \ it employs a crowdsourcing\nstrategy, sending images and location data to other\n\
    farmers who may be affected.\n[9]\nAgrippa\nFarmer can generate electronics maps\
    \ of ﬁeld, keep a\nhistory of growing crops in the ﬁeld (e.g., planting,\nfertilizing,\
    \ harvesting, warehouses, gas station), and\ntrack the location of objects in\
    \ the ﬁeld (e.g., soil\nsampling for agrochemical laboratory) by eFarmer\nApplication.\n\
    Semios\nCovers network coverage, orchard pests, frost,\ndiseases, and irrigation.\
    \ Event notiﬁcations are sent\nout in real-time as part of the monitoring services.\n\
    [7]\nFertilizer\nManagement\nEco Fert assists with fertilizer management so that\
    \ it\nmay be used to its full potential. It determines the\noptimal fertilizer\
    \ mixture created to cover the\nneeded nutrient suspension and considers the\n\
    demands of diverse yields. In addition, it considers\nthe cost of fertilizer based\
    \ on current market pricing.\n2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and Harvesting\n\
    The AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and\n\
    rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring\
    \ in this\nstudy. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications,\
    \ such as the DHT11\nTemperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts\
    \ temperature and rainfall\nranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web\
    \ Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT\nis a messaging protocol that allows for\
    \ various messages across distant connections [20].\nThe study reported establishing\
    \ an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics man-\nagement organized on temperature\
    \ via the use of an Android-based monitoring and\nautomatic correction system\
    \ and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system.\nReal-time data is\
    \ collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature\nand\
    \ humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating\
    \ water\nare monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range.\
    \ In this case, the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n7 of 21\nsystem quickly engages the\
    \ correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device,\nan aerator,\
    \ an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet\n\
    remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through\
    \ the android\napp amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared\
    \ plant devel-\nopment in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on\
    \ soil systems employing\nimage processing in two investigational operations.\
    \ Following record collection, it was\ndetermined that the smart aquaponics system\
    \ achieved greater output than conventional\nagriculture monitoring. As lettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart\naquaponics system vs.\
    \ traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on\nlettuce,\
    \ mustard greens, and pak choi [21].\nA tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled\
    \ agricultural monitoring system to\nimprove performance. A cheap sensor node\
    \ like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU\nmodule transmits data to the control\
    \ unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement,\nand agricultural operations\
    \ are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The in-\ncorporation of cost-effective\
    \ ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather\nmonitoring and sensor\
    \ data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact\nfrom crop growing\
    \ was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].\n\
    2.6. Climate Conditions Monitoring\nIn farming, the weather is extremely important.\
    \ Incorrect climate knowledge can\nhave an impact on crop quality and quantity.\
    \ On the other hand, farmers may use IoT\nsolutions to put sensors in the ﬁeld,\
    \ including humidity sensors, temperature sensors,\nrainfall sensors, and water\
    \ level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment.\nThese sensors\
    \ monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a\nworrying\
    \ environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected\
    \ or a\nwarning is sent to the farmer.\nGreenhouses created an Internet of Things-based\
    \ weather station to address the cost\nand accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor\
    \ Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously\nmonitor weather and abiotic factors,\
    \ transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send\ne-mail notiﬁcations when\
    \ values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to\ninclude the use\
    \ of ML model-based classiﬁcation training to categorize a plant’s health as\n\
    excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light\
    \ intensity,\nand air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s\
    \ health to a larger level\nand might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good\
    \ shape [23].\nArifﬁn et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system\
    \ to address the\ndrawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive,\
    \ have low yields, and\nneed a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture\
    \ was evaluated in a real-world\nsetting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM\
    \ (National Autism Society of Malaysia).\nThe ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms\
    \ is between 20 and 30 ◦C, with a humidity\nlevel of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were\
    \ installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner\nto detect temperature and\
    \ moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station\nthrough a microcontroller\
    \ unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment\nrevealed that\
    \ an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s\nhome\
    \ while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home,\n\
    IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system.\
    \ As a result,\nthe mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom\
    \ growing as well as\nprotection from pests and insects. The climate control system,\
    \ which automates controlling\nthe ideal environment for oyster mushroom production,\
    \ was housed in the IoT control box.\n3. Major Equipment and Technologies\nMajor\
    \ equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections,\n\
    such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 127\n8 of 21\n3.1. Sensors\nThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor,\
    \ thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral\nsensor are only a few of the\
    \ sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone\ntechnologies. Current\
    \ IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in\nTable 2.\n\

    Sensors\nOperations of Different Sensors\nDHT11 Sensor:\nDHT11 sensor measures\
    \ temperature and humidity\n[12].\nSEN0193: Soil Moisture Sensor\nSEN0193 is a\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensor. The dielectric\npermittivity of soil is a consequence\
    \ of its moisture\ncontent. The sensor generates a voltage proportional\nto the\
    \ dielectric permittivity of the soil and hence to\nits water content. The sensor\
    \ takes an average of the\nwater content over its whole length. The Soil\nMoisture\
    \ Sensor is used to quantify moisture loss\nover time due to plant absorption\
    \ and evaporation,\ndetermine optimal soil moisture information for\ndifferent\
    \ plant species, monitor soil moisture\ninformation in greenhouses to regulate\
    \ irrigation,\nand optimize bottle biology research. [20].\nTurbidity Sensor SKU\
    \ SEN0189:\nThe turbidity sensor determines the quality of water\nby detecting\
    \ its turbidity level. It detects suspended\nparticles in water using light by\
    \ measuring the light\ntransmittance and scattering rate, which vary the\nquantity\
    \ of total suspended solids (TSS) in the water\n[25].\nMH-Z14A:\nThis is used\
    \ to monitor the CO2 level at high\nprecision.\nBH1750:\nThis is used to monitor\
    \ the light intensity level (as\nphotosynthesis is related to light intensity)\
    \ and to\nconduct experiments on the inﬂuence of light\nintensity on the greenhouse\
    \ environment’s\ntemperature [26].\nRain sensor:\nA rain sensor is a simple instrument\
    \ for detecting\nrain pressure. It may be used as a switch to\ndetermine the strength\
    \ of rainfall when a raindrop\nfalls through the rainy board [27,28].\nLidar sensor:\n\
    The top camera sensor is an imaging range camera\nthat estimates the distance\
    \ between the camera and\nthe subject at each point in the collected images [29].\n\
    3.2. Agricultural Drones\nUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides,\
    \ and take hyperspectral images\nin precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop\
    \ for issues in plants using visible and\nnear-infrared light, and they can determine\
    \ which plants reﬂect what quantities of green\nand NIR light. Photosynthetic\
    \ activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may\nbe used to create\
    \ numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a\nresult,\
    \ farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identiﬁed.\n\
    Drones are also utilized for surveillance, trafﬁc monitoring, and weather monitoring\
    \ in\nagriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical,\
    \ multispectral,\nthermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are brieﬂy\
    \ detailed in Section 3.1.\nCrop management has beneﬁted from the Internet of\
    \ Things, remote sensing, and\nanalytic data approaches. Pests may be identiﬁed,\
    \ targeted, and managed to utilize remote\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n9 of 21\nsensing\
    \ using UAVs. UAVs can ﬂy in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution\n\
    images that allow pests to be identiﬁed and controlled. Many crop security concerns\
    \ may\nbe solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with\
    \ traditional pest\nmanagement methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect\
    \ damage in agricultural\nareas [30,31].\nAn automated rotating device based on\
    \ sun illumination angle perception keeps the\nsolar panel perpendicular to the\
    \ sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on\nspectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless\ntechnologies,\
    \ such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it\n\
    to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases.\n\
    In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time\
    \ of ﬂight for\ndrones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing\
    \ the ﬂying path\nimplementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal\
    \ of developing a long-standing\ninsect and disease detection technique through\
    \ extensive data gathering and analysis.\nThe suggested model will be tested in\
    \ real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases\nand insects might be tracked\
    \ in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32].\nThe Internet of Things-based\
    \ approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in\nFigure 3.\nFigure\
    \ 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.\n3.3. Harvesting Robots\n\
    Under speciﬁc climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather\
    \ fruits\nautonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism\
    \ is yet in its\nearly stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand,\
    \ have comparable architecture.\nThe system is comprised of an autonomous mobile\
    \ platform, a lightweight mechanical\narm with multiple degrees of freedom, an\
    \ adaptable end effector for a power response\nsystem, a multi-sensor machine\
    \ vision system, a smart decision and drive management\nsystem, and supplementary\
    \ hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed\nan intense neural\
    \ network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps\nfruit\
    \ in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic\n\
    harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised\
    \ of\nIntel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer\n\
    unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic\n\
    manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efﬁcient\n\
    lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition\
    \ and\ninstance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was\
    \ also developed\nto conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera\
    \ through the point\nclouds technique. The two qualities described above were\
    \ utilized and integrated to\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n10 of 21\ndevelop and build\
    \ a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the\nstudy\
    \ was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.\n\
    Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping\n\
    recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova\
    \ and\nAli [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse\
    \ setting using a\nmachine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively\
    \ execute the suggested image\nprocessing method for this purpose, RGB color images\
    \ from a typical digital camera are\nrequired. In the second stage, RGB color\
    \ images are converted to HSV, which is easier\nfor extracting red tomato from\
    \ the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation,\nthresholding, and morphological\
    \ operations separate a red tomato from a green background\ncolor photograph.\
    \ The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see\nif it\
    \ produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes\
    \ for the\nharvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research\
    \ is limited to moving\nthe gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and\
    \ developing efﬁcient algorithms\nusing 3D gripper models to transform the existing\
    \ research system into industrial robots.\nOnly a few robotic devices that can\
    \ successfully perform watering, planting, and\nweeding activities now exist.\
    \ FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC\nmachine, has been\
    \ presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in\nagriculture.\
    \ What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete\n\
    the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting\n\
    tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time,\
    \ from\nsowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be\
    \ exchanged for crop\nharvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of\
    \ a tomato collector. Both the FaRo\nharvesting robot and the unique kinematics\
    \ of the continuum manipulator design were\nthoroughly discussed. Due to implementation\
    \ problems, the robot’s design is currently in\nthe development stage. The objective\
    \ of the proposed system is to build a model with an\nintelligent agricultural\
    \ monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot\nwill have sufﬁcient\
    \ information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human\nintervention\
    \ [36].\nA depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers\
    \ is proposed\nfor the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems.\
    \ This method included\ndata preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using\
    \ the SVD (singular value decom-\nposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation\
    \ and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample\nConsensus) algorithm edge line extraction\
    \ and corner point positioning, and fusion and\nvisualization of results on the\
    \ depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach\nis effective in\
    \ identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due\n\
    to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud\
    \ sites in\nthe agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the\
    \ forage harvester’s\nunloading system is still challenging [37].\nIntelligent\
    \ robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the in-\ntelligent\
    \ computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still\n\
    used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker\
    \ pay\nhikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s ﬁnancial\
    \ expenditures,\nand the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging.\
    \ As a result, the\nsmart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer\
    \ vision machinery by\nincorporating the robot arm, selector, ﬂexible carrier,\
    \ track procedure, and the intelligence\nunit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s\
    \ travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe\nfruit, and in addition a vision-based\
    \ binocular stereoscopic methodology employed for the\nfunctions of recognition\
    \ and placement. To begin with, precise segmentation recognition\nand maturity\
    \ evaluation of the target fruit is required for proper picking. Thus, the robot\n\
    picker may potentially replace human labor in manual picking. The most important\
    \ part\nof the recognition process is gathering fruit image samples, which is\
    \ performed using a\nCCD camera that shoots following the preprocessed fruit features\
    \ using image content.\nThe color model is then built up, and it separates the\
    \ fruit and surrounding surroundings\nusing segmentation technology before recognizing\
    \ the fruit. Additionally, it precisely traces\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n11 of\
    \ 21\nand goes for the fruit location in relation to the three-dimensional coordinate\
    \ information\nprovided by the infrared source and the fruit contour and image\
    \ differences taken by\nthe two cameras simultaneously. To ﬁnish the picking operation,\
    \ it must program the\npath recognition to avoid the obstacle [38]. The overall\
    \ architecture of IoT-based fruit\nidentiﬁcation for harvesting is shown in Figure\
    \ 4.\nFigure 4. General architecture of IoT-based fruit detection for harvesting.\n\
    4. Open Issues and Key Challenges in Smart Agriculture\nThe problems of deploying\
    \ IoT-based agricultural systems are discussed in this section.\nThe sensors’\
    \ durability and cost are described. The IoT-based system requires a constant\n\
    source of electricity. Depending on the size, a lot of electricity may be required.\
    \ However,\nin rural and village communities, obtaining such electricity is challenging.\
    \ To meet the\nenergy requirement, alternative energy sources, such as solar and\
    \ wind, must be employed.\nThis will also raise the price signiﬁcantly. It is\
    \ necessary to have a dependable internet\nconnection in rural and village regions.\
    \ It is the most crucial aspect of establishing an\nIoT-based system. The connection\
    \ must have a sufﬁcient bandwidth to transport data in\naccordance with the application’s\
    \ requirements. Farmers need basic computer/tablet (HID\ndevice) training and\
    \ an understanding of how the IoT system operates. It is also necessary\nto provide\
    \ proper education on the unique IoT deployment in their farm [39].\nThere are\
    \ six major obstacles to developing a green IoT-based agriculture system,\ninvolving\
    \ infrastructure, mobility, maintenance, hardware, data privacy, data analytics,\
    \ and\ndata security. The selection of meters and sensors used for Internet of\
    \ Things tools is one\nof the hardware issues. As a result, many different sensors\
    \ may be utilized in Internet of\nThings applications, such as the water quality\
    \ sensor, humidity sensor, chemical sensor,\npressure sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and more. The data analytics problem is machine\nlearning, deep learning methods,\
    \ and prediction algorithm applications in smart agricul-\nture to produce a nutritional\
    \ suspension using IoT records. Routine sensor inspections\nof all Internet of\
    \ Things appliances are a maintenance issue while it may be certainly\nharmed\
    \ in the farm area. The mobility problem is related to 4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan,\
    \ LoRa\nnetwork connection, which link sensors spread across a broad region in\
    \ the farm areas.\nSome infrastructural trials are developing and implementing\
    \ Internet of Things-connected\narchitectures that incorporate innovative technologies,\
    \ such as cloud and fog computing\nand network virtualization. Finally, the primary\
    \ issue in advancing smart agriculture based\non IoT is not physical maintenance\
    \ but rather ensuring security and privacy [8].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n12 of\
    \ 21\nThe UAVs that are linked wirelessly are subject to cyber-physical or harmful\
    \ assaults\nto fool the control signals due to open communication lines. Such\
    \ attempts represent a\nsigniﬁcant risk to the unmanned aerial vehicle system\
    \ in terms of private information\ncrash or theft, as well as mission failure.\
    \ Moreover, the faking of control signals may harm\nthe UAV mission and make it\
    \ harder to restore it. As a result, improving UAV wireless\ncommunication’s safety\
    \ and conﬁdentiality element, which necessitates in-depth research\nof security\
    \ concerns covering the entire network protocol layers [40], is an important\n\
    open subject.\nVisual harvesting of robots’ dynamic tracking of objects with great\
    \ precision remains\nan unresolved challenge. Further study should also aim to\
    \ enhance the precision placement\nand operation by merging smart behavior judgment,\
    \ adequate fault tolerance, robot vision\nwith artiﬁcial intelligence technology\
    \ for accurate placement, and function enhancement.\nThe recognition and location\
    \ accuracy are impacted when the crop situation is varied due\nto the lighting\
    \ and unconstrained circumstances of the ﬁeld ecosystem. A robot vision\napproach\
    \ would be efﬁcient in harvesting crops correctly to increase the success rate\
    \ of\nrobotic harvesting in such settings. The researchers used geometric features,\
    \ novel image\nalgorithms, and intelligent decision theory to address the challenges.\
    \ However, because\nmassive datasets are necessary to train efﬁcient deep learning\
    \ algorithms, further study\nis needed [33]. Table 3 presents a comparison of\
    \ the current state of the art on smart\nagriculture obstacles and beneﬁts.\n\

    One of the most challenging aspects of robotic grasping is estimation. Traditional\n\
    techniques have limitations since noise or partial loss of the point cloud might\
    \ impact the\nestimation’s accuracy and resilience. Estimation is more difﬁcult\
    \ in orchard situations than\nit was in interior environments.\nData Handling\
    \ and Processing\nTraditional vision algorithms’ performance is constantly restricted\
    \ in complicated\nand volatile settings [34]. World food consumption is predicted\
    \ to treble by 2050 due to\npopulation expansion and societal progress, yet increasing\
    \ food production is now difﬁcult\ndue to declining water, climate alterations,\
    \ less proper soil, and insects and illnesses. Pests\nand diseases have always\
    \ been signiﬁcant stumbling blocks to increased grain output.\nSatellite technology\
    \ is climate sensitive and has a limited illumination variation, making it\nchallenging\
    \ to satisfy the requirement for insects and infection management in farming\n\
    areas. Currently, low-altitude autonomous drones (offering excellent ﬂexibility\
    \ and image\nresolution) can satisfy the needs of agricultural insect and infection\
    \ management. In some\ncircumstances, such as when there is a high wind, drone\
    \ stability might be difﬁcult. As a\nresult, the drone’s ﬂight route must be designed\
    \ in conjunction with the actual conditions.\nLong ﬂights are necessary for ﬁeld\
    \ pest and disease data collection; thus, choosing a sunny\nday with a moderate\
    \ breeze might be a viable alternative [32]. Identifying malicious and\ncompromised\
    \ nodes among soil sensors interacting with the base station is a signiﬁcant\n\
    problem in the base station to cloud communications. The trust management method\
    \ is\npresented as one of the options for identifying these nodes in a lightweight\
    \ manner.\nFinally, the study highlighted the existing problems and possibilities\
    \ and future re-\nsearch in vegetable and fruit identiﬁcation and placement. The\
    \ majority of previous research\nshowed that illumination variations, grouping,\
    \ and unconstrained situations have been the\nmain obstacles to effective recognition\
    \ and localization of vegetables and fruits in the ﬁeld.\nFurther research will\
    \ be required to overcome the existing state-of-the-art challenges and\nenhance\
    \ the performance, accuracy, efﬁciency, effectiveness, recognition, and success\
    \ rate\nof controlling and image processing techniques. However, fruit recognition,\
    \ detection, posi-\ntioning, harvesting robots, and application robustness enhancement\
    \ need to minimize the\ninclusive computational cost and time. Future research\
    \ might include algorithms and cam-\nera operation advancements, sensor platforms\
    \ that can enhance illumination consistently,\nhorticultural changes, and human–machine\
    \ collaboration [29]. Furthermore, sophisticated\nmethodologies, algorithms, and\
    \ computational approaches are necessary to address the\nlack of precision in\
    \ harvesting operations.\n5. Discussion and Analysis\nIt is estimated that plant\
    \ diseases are a signiﬁcant contributor to global ﬁnancial\ndeﬁcits. Numerous\
    \ abiotic and biotic stresses and continual tension monitoring concerns\nthe impacts\
    \ of the loss of fruit-producing plants. Consequently, the $15 billion U.S. apple\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 127\n14 of 21\nindustry loses millions of dollars every year.\
    \ Fruits are one of the most signiﬁcant sources\nof nutrients in plants; yet,\
    \ illnesses, pests, fungous, infectious, and microbial diseases all\naffect the\
    \ quality and quantity of fruits. Using computer vision-based methods, the issue\n\
    may now be alleviated. Diseases/infections may be detected early and effectively\
    \ using\nthese methods.\nThe sickness classiﬁcation of various fruit leaves was\
    \ achieved using a deep convolu-\ntional neural network DCNN approach. The deep\
    \ features are retrieved by ﬁrst utilizing\ndeep learning networks, such as AlexNet\
    \ and VGG-s, and then tweaked using a transfer\nlearning approach. Before the\
    \ selection step, a multi-level fusion strategy is offered, and\nthe chosen features\
    \ analyzed to produce the entropy basis features. To categorize the\nobtained\
    \ feature map, we employed a multi-SVM classiﬁer. The diseases investigated in\n\
    the experiments include apple rust, scab, black rot, peach bacterial spots, and\
    \ cherry pow-\ndery mildew, and they were all gathered from a plant village dataset.\
    \ The recommended\nmethod’s better performance in terms of a 97.8% accuracy, 97.6%\
    \ sensitivity, 97.6% precision,\nand G-measure was observed in the classiﬁcation\
    \ results (97.6%) [44]. Some research has\ninvestigated whether computer vision\
    \ approaches may be employed for scalable and early\nplant sickness detection.\
    \ There is still a critical lack of non-lab data sets that can be utilized\nto\
    \ allow vision-based plant disease detection. For visual plant disease identiﬁcation,\
    \ the\nPlantDoc dataset was supplied. The collection has 2598 data points in total,\
    \ encompassing\n13 plant species and up to 17 disease categories, and was developed\
    \ by annotating internet-\nscraped photos for 300 human hours. Three models for\
    \ plant disease classiﬁcation were\ntrained to illustrate the dataset’s effectiveness.\
    \ The ﬁndings demonstrate that employing\nour dataset models may enhance the recognition\
    \ rate by up to 31%. The recommended\ndataset, we feel, will contribute to decreasing\
    \ the entry barrier for computer vision algo-\nrithms in plant disease detection.\
    \ For photos featuring leaves from various classes in a\ndataset with contextual\
    \ noise, and low-resolution leaf images, the model fails to give proper\nconclusions.\
    \ Using image segmentation methods to extract leaves from the photos can\nboost\
    \ the dataset’s utility. Although the dataset has been rigorously veriﬁed, particular\n\
    photographs in the collection may be wrongly labeled owing to a lack of sufﬁcient\
    \ topic\nknowledge [45].\nIt is necessary to construct an improved VGG16-based\
    \ DCNN model to detect apple\nleaf diseases (scab, frogeye spots, and cedar rust).\
    \ The global average pooling layer re-\nplaces the fully connected layer to lessen\
    \ restrictions and a batch normalization layer is\nattached to boost the model’s\
    \ computational performance. Furthermore, to avoid a long\ntraining time, a transfer\
    \ learning approach is applied. To detect apple leaf diseases, the\nsuggested\
    \ model makes use of 2446 apple leaves, 2141 photos in the training phase and\
    \ 305\nimages in the testing phase. The experimental data reveal that utilizing\
    \ the recommended\napproach, the total accuracy of apple leaf classiﬁcation may\
    \ reach 99.01%. Furthermore,\nthe ﬁndings demonstrate that cedar rust is accurately\
    \ diagnosed, but one healthy person is\nmisclassiﬁed as scab and the other as\
    \ frogeye spots.\nFurthermore, the model parameters are cut by 89% compared to\
    \ the standard VGG16.\nAs a result, the classiﬁcation performance is raised by\
    \ 6.3%, and the computational com-\nplexity is cut to 0.56% of the innovative\
    \ model. Consequently, the DCNN model developed\nin this study provides a more\
    \ accurate and speedier way for recognizing apple leaf infec-\ntions [46]. Table\

    -\nFor the recognition and detection of olive diseases, such as peacock spot,\
    \ anthracnose,\nand canker, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) dubbed\
    \ AlexNet was\nsuggested. Several innovations separate the proposed model from\
    \ others. It uses effective\nintelligent data preprocessing with a stable image\
    \ in each class, a transfer learning approach,\nand an extended and upgraded PlantVillage\
    \ dataset to work in more complicated situations.\nThe total accuracy of the suggested\
    \ technique is 99.11%, which is the best possible score.\nFurthermore, it possesses\
    \ precision, recall, and F1 measures of 99.49%, 99.11%, and 99.29%,\nrespectively.\
    \ Despite the fact that model training takes a long time, classiﬁcation during\n\
    testing takes only a few seconds on a CPU [47]. Citrus fruits, leaves, and stems\
    \ are included\nin the image dataset. The collection contains images of normal\
    \ and diseased citrus leaves\nand fruits, including greening, scab, blackspot,\
    \ canker, and melanosis. There are 759 images\nof normal and abnormal citrus leaves\
    \ and fruits in the data collection. The images had\na resolution of 5202 × 3465\
    \ (Mpix), and when scaled at 72 dpi, the width and height\nwere 256 × 256 pixels,\
    \ correspondingly. The contaminated images were divided into four\nvarious citrus\
    \ illnesses and left on their own. The entire process consists of four major\n\
    steps: (a) enhancing the dataset using Top-hat and then Gaussian functions; (b)\
    \ weighted\nsegmentation and segmentation of lesion through a saliency map, which\
    \ highlights the\ninfested area; (c) color, texture, and geometric feature extraction\
    \ from the diseased area;\nand (d) PCA, skewness, and entropy-based feature selection\
    \ and implementation.\nAgriculture management, water contamination, and air quality\
    \ analysis monitoring\nsystems were all investigated as part of the smart environment\
    \ monitoring (SEM) system.\nFigure 5 demonstrates that substantial investigation\
    \ of smart environment monitoring\nhas increased over the period in both cases,\
    \ speciﬁcally research involving the wireless\nsensor network and Internet of\
    \ Things along with research involving machine learning and\nInternet of Things\
    \ [41,51].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n16 of 21\nFigure 5. Research contribution\
    \ using IoT, WSN, and machine learning.\nImperfect network access, lack of a (or\
    \ no) power supply, and high framework costs\ncompared to an ordinary farmer’s\
    \ income were presented in a low-cost, energy-proﬁcient,\nprotected, dependable,\
    \ and heterogeneous three-layer approach for Internet of Things-\nbased smart\
    \ agriculture. IoT devices make up the ﬁrst layer, including IoT-based smart\n\
    agriculture monitoring like insect detection, theft detection, crop monitoring,\
    \ smart ir-\nrigation, smart poultry, food supply chain, and food preservation\
    \ monitoring systems.\nThe low-power LoRaWAN network connects the IoT devices\
    \ to the gateways. The next\nlayer is made up of local processing servers and\
    \ gateways that are connected with the\ngateways. The cloud layer, which uses\
    \ the publicly available FIWARE framework to offer a\nset of open-source API standards,\
    \ is the third layer. This study aimed to create diagnostic\ntechniques for packet\
    \ combination procedures at the fog node before they were sent over\nthe network\
    \ facility to cloud servers. This aims to decrease short IoT packet processing\n\
    overheads and optimize energy usage at the backbone, as billions of IoT devices\
    \ linked to\nfog nodes are projected to generate massive volumes of short IoT\
    \ packets [52].\nA Cuckoo Search Algorithm has been created, allowing water allocated\
    \ for farming\nunder all situations. Temperature, turbidity, pH, and moisture\
    \ were collected utilizing the\nInternet of Things (IoT) infrastructure outﬁtted\
    \ with wireless communication devices and\nsensors. ThingSpeak presented the sensor\
    \ data in the cloud system in this IoT platform.\nThe ThingSpeak data was utilized\
    \ in the suggested Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which\nidentiﬁed suitable yields for\
    \ a given soil [53]. Incorrect or late identiﬁcation can result in\noveruse or\
    \ underuse of chemicals, resulting in higher production costs and environmental\n\
    and health consequences. With varied lighting, angles, surfaces, noise, and high\
    \ resolutions,\n3651 real-time indication images of various apple infections were\
    \ manually collected.\nA subset of this dataset was labeled by experts, such as\
    \ cedar apple rust, scab, and normal\nleaves, and open-sourced for the Plant Pathology\
    \ Challenge to Kaggle community. We also\nused this data to train a standard CNN\
    \ (convolutional neural network), which obtained\n97% recognition on a held-out\
    \ test set and a maximum AUC value of 0.986. The project’s\ngoal was to keep adding\
    \ additional images to the pilot dataset from various perspectives,\nlighting,\
    \ and distances to create a bigger more complete labeled database by experts.\n\
    The dataset will contain pests and diseases, such as apple mites and aphids and\
    \ apple\nleaves comprising apple marssonina and alternaria leaf blotch, leaf spot,\
    \ frogeye, rot, cedar,\nand powdery mildew, ﬁre blight, and scab-labeled images.\n\
    Additionally, it will be photographed and remarked on fruit infected with apple\
    \ brown\nrot, bitter rot, or scab [54]. An Internet of Things-based cost-effective\
    \ monitoring system\nwas developed to address particular crop irrigation, soil\
    \ erosion, and irregular irrigation.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n17 of 21\nThe suggested\
    \ method entails building a distributed WSN (wireless sensor network), with\n\
    multiple sensor modules covering each part of the farm and transferring data to\
    \ a central\nserver. ML techniques will aid irrigation pattern forecasts based\
    \ on yields and climate\nenvironments. According to a comparison of several algorithms,\
    \ random forest regression\nhas a decent accuracy of 81.6%. However, due to harsh\
    \ weather conditions, the system\nis constrained in many ways: the forecast accuracy\
    \ is dependent on the setup’s correct\ninstallation, and the threat of wild animals\
    \ can harm the hardware setup [48]. Because\nhuman abilities and agricultural\
    \ gear are severely restricted compared to robot knowledge,\nrobotic systems in\
    \ agriculture can be highly beneﬁcial in achieving both high quality\nand quantity\
    \ goods. To integrate IoT systems with agricultural machinery, a new way\nof managing\
    \ control signals from the control system to the actuators is required. These\n\
    methods should increase economic viability while also lowering environmental impact\
    \ and\nenhancing food sustainability. It handles various agricultural tasks, including\
    \ moisture\nsensing, irrigation, crop monitoring, and insect and animal defense\
    \ [55]. Accordingly, a\nstate-of-the-art technologies-based accuracy comparison\
    \ is presented in Figure 6.\nFigure 6. Accuracy-based analysis of the different\
    \ state of the art techniques.\nWater monitoring is the most highly measured IoT\
    \ sub-vertical, followed by crop,\nsmart agriculture, animal, and irrigation monitoring.\
    \ All of these have the same proportion\nof peer-reviewed articles exploring the\
    \ possible uses of the Internet of Things. According\nto the ﬁndings, the most\
    \ important sensor data for measurement is 15.73% soil moisture,\n19.79% humidity,\
    \ and 24.87% ambient temperature. However, further sensor information,\nsuch as\
    \ soil pH and moisture, are also collected for IoT applications. Wi-Fi has the\
    \ highest\nclaimed use in farming and agriculture, with 30.27% and 21.10% use\
    \ of mobile tools, as\nshown in Figure 7. Other technologies like Bluetooth, WSN,\
    \ RFID, Raspberry Pi, ZigBee,\nLoRa, and GPRS are less popular in the agriculture\
    \ and farming industries. In the agri-\ncultural and farming business comparison,\
    \ the farming sector uses IoT for automation\nslower [42]. The Plant Server and\
    \ User View were created with phpMyAdmin to manage\nMySQL server management. The\
    \ F-RCNN-qualiﬁed model for anomaly detection had\n80% conﬁdence, while the technique\
    \ for the transfer of learning illness had 95.75% accu-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 127\n\

    \ IoT.\n6. Conclusions and Future Directions\nThe implementation of sustainable\
    \ communication technologies and sensors based on\nIoT is necessary to increase\
    \ agricultural productivity. Wireless sensors, unmanned aerial\nvehicles, and\
    \ cloud computing have been shown to be practical tools for guaranteeing\nlong-term\
    \ agricultural productivity. Many processes throughout the production cycle,\n\
    including irrigation, soil sample and mapping, fertilizer or pest control, yield\
    \ monitoring,\nforecasting, and harvesting, may be automated using smart devices,\
    \ allowing for improved\ncrop quality and growth capacity. The key effective features,\
    \ important applications, IoT-\nbased smart agriculture technology and equipment,\
    \ and open barriers and possibilities\nwere all examined in this study. This research\
    \ will be expanded in the future to include\nsecurity and privacy issues in smart\
    \ agriculture using IoT methods.\nAuthor Contributions: All authors contributed\

    \ on the use of modern technologies in the\ncyber-physical ﬁeld management cycle.\
    \ Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud\nComputing have\
    \ accelerated the digital transformation of the conventional agricultural practices\n\
    promising increased production rate and product quality. The adoption of smart\
    \ farming though is\nhampered because of the lack of models providing guidance\
    \ to practitioners regarding the necessary\ncomponents that constitute IoT-based\
    \ monitoring systems. To guide the process of designing\nand implementing Smart\
    \ farming monitoring systems, in this paper we propose a generic reference\narchitecture\
    \ model, taking also into consideration a very important non-functional requirement,\n\
    the energy consumption restriction. Moreover, we present and discuss the technologies\
    \ that incorporate\nthe seven layers of the architecture model that are the Sensor\
    \ Layer, the Link Layer, the Encapsulation\nLayer, the Middleware Layer, the Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, the Management Layer and the Application\nLayer. Furthermore, the proposed\
    \ Reference Architecture model is exempliﬁed in a real-world\napplication for\
    \ surveying Saffron agriculture in Kozani, Greece.\nKeywords: Wireless Sensor\

    \ of the agricultural sector is considered a priority to face the\nnumerous challenges\
    \ presented in the ﬁelds. Environmental monitoring and remote controlling in\n\
    agriculture is rapidly growing towards developing more productive and competitive\
    \ agricultural\nsystems and tools. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming can\
    \ lead to this direction. These two terms\nrefer to the integration of advanced\
    \ technologies into existing agricultural practices to achieve ﬁne-grid\ncrops\
    \ management. Smart farming systems can provide to farmers meaningful environmental\
    \ data\nfrom the cultivation ﬁelds aiming to boost competitiveness and proﬁt.\
    \ Almost every aspect of the\nagricultural ﬁeld can beneﬁt from these kinds of\
    \ technological advances ranging from planting and\nirrigation processes to plant\
    \ protection and harvesting methods.\nThe future of precision agriculture lies\
    \ upon modern technological advancements and remote\nsensing techniques using\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and different kind of smart sensors. Sensors\n\
    are measuring devices that convert an external stimulus or else input signal,\
    \ into an appropriately\nmeasurable output signal. Sensor devices can transform\
    \ a macroscopic size (light, power, pressure,\netc.) to an electrically measurable\
    \ size. Once the electrical signal is processed, it is converted into a\nstandardized\
    \ signal with certain characteristics. The sensor’s properties can be altered\
    \ in a measurable\nmanner, either directly or indirectly by the exposure to a\
    \ particular analyzer or change in environmental\nconditions. UAVs are ﬂying vehicles\
    \ that do not have a pilot on their spindle. Instead they ﬂy either\nInformation\

    \ Unmanned aircraft used for remote monitoring are part\nof Unmanned Aerial Systems\
    \ (UASs). UASs involve all necessary devices and procedures for UAV\noperation,\
    \ while managing data collection. UAVs enable Earth Observation (EO) towards improving\n\
    accuracy, executing more frequent and better monitoring of the ﬁelds and cover\
    \ large (not easily\naccessible) areas. Sensors and UAVs are a part of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) paradigm. The IoT is a\nmodern communication network involving\
    \ the employment of a vast number of distributed smart\ndevices around a uniﬁed\
    \ wide area network. Its basic characteristic stands upon the ability to recognize\n\
    and notify users instantly about real-time events by the use of smart objects.\
    \ Smart objects-devices\nhave basic computational skills, constrained resources\
    \ and unique identiﬁers for communication.\nThe adoption of smart farming though\
    \ is hampered because of the lack of models providing\nguidance to practitioners\
    \ regarding the necessary components that constitute IoT-based monitoring\nsystems.\
    \ The typically dense and heterogeneous nature of IoT deployments poses immense\
    \ challenges\non interoperability among the desired components. However, an efﬁciently\
    \ designed architecture based\non modern enhanced IoT technologies can pave the\
    \ way into easily adopting and deploying smart\nsystems into our everyday life\
    \ activities. The latest years a signiﬁcant number of efforts were presented\n\
    regarding the most suitable network structure and technologies for smart farming\
    \ applications [1–9].\nHowever, the architectural models presented in [1,7–9]\
    \ were based only on static sensor nodes, ignoring\nthe advantage of UAVs in monitoring\
    \ and failing to provide efﬁcient mapping of the ﬁeld to the\nfarmer. Furthermore,\
    \ no prediction mechanisms were employed in [2] towards improving production.\n\
    Moreover, limited contribution was provided in [3–5] regarding energy saving and\
    \ link layer IoT\ntechnologies in farm management information systems, while the\
    \ data-driven agricultural model\nproposed in [6] did not discuss data security\
    \ issues. In contrast to previous studies, the contribution\nof this paper lies\
    \ upon the presentation of a detailed architectural model for an advanced smart\n\
    farming monitoring system by using UAVs and taking into consideration energy-saving\
    \ and security\nrequirements. This architectural model engages novel IoT technologies\
    \ [10] and Wireless Sensor\nNetworks (WSNs) capabilities to provide a sufﬁcient\
    \ view of precision agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe proposed architecture enables\
    \ a combination of modern remote sensing techniques such as UAV\ntracking, Global\
    \ Positioning System (GPS) for location detection, Geographic Information Systems\n\
    (GIS), real-time monitoring with different types of sensors and intelligent input\
    \ control systems. These\ntechnologies have already been tested in various agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds in different countries for the\ncultivation of rice, wheat, tomatoes,\
    \ vegetables, potatoes, ornamental ﬂowers, chilly, cacao, pepper,\ncorn, olives,\
    \ apples, lemons, grape and others. By incorporating new technologies into agricultural\n\
    production and by using modern EO techniques growers will be able to manage their\
    \ crops at a\ndifferent and more advanced kind of level in detail that was not\
    \ possible a few years ago. This\npaper is an extension of our work in [11]. Towards\
    \ enhancing contribution a use case study is also\npresented regarding an ongoing\
    \ research project known as Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture\nSurveillance(DIAS).\
    \ The DIAS architectural model is based on the proposed paradigm.\nThis paper\
    \ is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the proposed smart\
    \ farming\nmonitoring system architecture. In Section 3, the sensor layer is introduced,\
    \ followed by the network\nlayer and its suitable protocols and technologies regarding\
    \ communication, routing, encapsulation\ntechniques and interoperability mechanisms\
    \ in Section 4. Section 5 is focused on the management\nlayer and the provided\
    \ services of the proposed monitoring system, while Section 6 focuses on IoT\n\
    agricultural applications. Section 7 deals with energy-saving technologies and\
    \ security mechanisms\nthat can be implemented in cooperation with networking\
    \ technologies of the system. The use case\nstudy of the DIAS architecture is\
    \ presented in Section 8. Existing challenges are mentioned and\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 9. Finally, Section 10 concludes this study.\n2. The Architecture of\
    \ a Smart Farming Monitoring System\nA precision agriculture monitoring system\
    \ consists mainly of the sensing agricultural parameters,\nthe identiﬁcation of\
    \ sensing location and data gathering, the routing of data from crop ﬁeld to\n\
    Information 2019, 10, 348\n3 of 25\ncontrol station for decision making, the actuation\
    \ and control decision based on sensed data and the\nvisualization of results\
    \ to the grower through an application. The architectural design of our model\n\
    follows the ISO/IEC 7498-1 standard or else known as the OSI Model [12], proposing\
    \ a communication\nsystem into seven abstraction layers. However, due the employment\
    \ of IoT technologies and artiﬁcial\nintelligence capabilities the basic agricultural\
    \ layers are deﬁned as presented in Figure 1:\nFigure 1. Remote Sensing System\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nThe Sensor Layer, referring to the Physical Layer of the OSI\
    \ Model, includes all kinds of\ncrops sensors and smart objects for data collection\
    \ and monitoring. Sensors can be placed\nunder ground(in the soil), on the crops\
    \ or on UAVs [6]. Underground sensors are especially\nmanufactured to be water\
    \ resistant and usually refer to measurements of moisture, pH and soil\nchemical\
    \ properties such as sulfur. UAV sensors measure environmental parameters such\
    \ as\nhumidity, temperature, wind speed, luminosity or solar radiation. However,\
    \ the most popular\nkind of sensors to be placed on UAVs are thermal cameras.\
    \ Thermal drones which use vision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n4 of 25\nimaging\
    \ cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all\
    \ objects\nand materials turning them into images and video.\n•\nThe Link Layer,\
    \ referring to the Data Link Layer of the OSI Model, constitutes of all available\n\
    networking and routing technologies between sensors for information exchange.\
    \ To deploy\nefﬁcient crop and ﬁeld management the IoT platform uses Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSNs).\nThe use of WSN in smart farming systems provides immediate\
    \ monitoring and optimization of\ncrop quality, while offering a potential for\
    \ large area surveillance with high sampling densities.\nThe constant monitoring\
    \ of a great number of environmental parameters by distributed sensor\nnodes along\
    \ the ﬁeld help the grower supervise and maintain optimal conditions to achieve\n\
    maximum productivity with remarkable energy savings.\n•\nThe Encapsulation Layer,\
    \ referring to the Network Layer of the OSI Model, focuses on the\nestablishment\
    \ of smart sensor connection to the IPv6-based internet. This layer consists of\n\
    IoT networking encapsulation techniques and routing protocols to transform the\
    \ regular WSN\nnetwork trafﬁc into smart information. In other words, the technologies\
    \ of this layer enable the\ncultivated ﬁeld sensory data to be encapsulated in\
    \ IPv6 routing packets and be forwarded to the\naccording network server.\n•\n\
    The Middleware Layer, referring to the Transport Layer of the OSI Model, uses\
    \ different application\nlevel transport protocols in order to forward the data\
    \ generated from IoT sensor devices based on\ndifferent paradigms. It also provides\
    \ interfaces that enable device communication for management\nor actuation purposes.\
    \ This layer facilitates the desired interoperability due to the existence of\n\
    diverse standards, which are endorsed by different entities.\n•\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer, referring to the Session and Presentation Layers of the OSI Model,\n\
    is situated between the Middleware Layer and the Management Layer. This layer\
    \ is responsible\nfor gathering the raw data coming from the devices or other\
    \ external services, curate, harmonize\nand possibly aggregate them, so that they\
    \ can be published as context information, or supplied\nto upstream data processing\
    \ algorithms or analytics. In addition, this layer is also capable of\nsending\
    \ actuation commands to the Middleware Layer. Finally, the Conﬁguration Layer\
    \ may\nalso be capable of gathering data from other data sources, such as agricultural\
    \ machinery or\npublic geo-services.\n•\nThe Management Layer involves the processing\
    \ and analysis of the collected data. In this layer\nthe most efﬁcient data management\
    \ and data mining techniques are adopted to obtain accurate\npredictions and support\
    \ regarding ﬁeld operations such as optimized pesticide application,\ndisease\
    \ detection, efﬁcient irrigation management. Data processing is supported by Decision\n\
    Support Systems (DSS) that take care of the overall management of available collected\
    \ information\nfrom the ﬁelds towards increasing productivity, optimizing crop\
    \ yield, maintaining quality\nand saving resources.\nIt is well known that farmers\
    \ suffer great economic losses due to\nincorrect weather forecasting or incorrect\
    \ irrigation methods. Data analysis is the most important\ncomponent of IoT agricultural\
    \ systems resulting in efﬁcient pesticide use and protection against\ndiseases.\
    \ This layer can be considered to be an additional layer regarding the OSI Model\
    \ enabling\nartiﬁcial intelligence advancements to the overall system.\n•\nThe\
    \ Application Layer, referring to the Application Layer of the OSI Model, includes\
    \ all\nsuitable application module interfaces for implementing fertilizer and\
    \ irrigation control, disease\nand animal detection, alerts regarding the cultivation\
    \ process and visualization of statistical\ndata. This layer enables the farmer\
    \ to monitor and manage his ﬁelds in a user-friendly way.\nData visualization\
    \ techniques such as graphs, heatmaps, orthomosaics, and three-dimensional\nmodels\
    \ are employed, among others, to allow easy and intuitive representation of the\
    \ knowledge\nacquired from the ﬁeld monitoring. The farmer can inspect the results\
    \ produced by the services\nof the system and take action accordingly.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 348\n5 of 25\nEnergy-saving mechanisms and data privacy and security\
    \ techniques are also considered to be\nvery important in the context of Smart\
    \ farming and should be applied vertically in all the layers of\nthe architecture.\
    \ To support the efﬁciency and effectiveness of a smart farming monitoring system\n\
    energy consumption should be kept under control. Due to the limited battery life\
    \ and constrained\nresources of sensor nodes, energy-saving techniques must be\
    \ applied across the sensor and network\nlayer accordingly. Energy-saving techniques\
    \ deal with the active and inactive operational time\nin each sensor node, the\
    \ scheduling of information transmission and the routing process of data\npackets.\
    \ Moreover, security mechanisms are vital for maintaining the privacy of the collected\
    \ data and\nsafeguarding farmers’ personal information exchange.\n3. The Sensor\
    \ Layer\nThe Sensor Layer is in charge of acquiring the data of the different\
    \ climatic and soil variables\ninvolved in the growth and production of the crops.\
    \ Data can be acquired either by ground sensors,\nlocated above or inside the\
    \ soil, or by UAV sensors involving embedded cameras, location and other\nsensors.\
    \ The Sensor Layer constitutes the cradle of modern EO approaches towards optimizing\n\
    decision support in remote sensing monitoring systems. EO monitoring of cultivation\
    \ areas is\nhighly enhanced using autonomous UAVs. Popular EO techniques include\
    \ satellite and radar-based\ntechnologies [13] towards estimating basic biophysical\
    \ parameters in the ﬁelds, such as Leaf Area\nIndex (LAI), crop height and water\
    \ requirements [14,15]. According to [16] radar-based technologies\nare used to\
    \ enable the estimation of soil moisture spatial variability and can efﬁciently\
    \ estimate LAI.\nHowever, EO can achieve sturdy higher spatial resolutions only\
    \ with calibration against accurate\nground truth instruments that measure at\
    \ within ﬁeld scale resolutions. UAVs deploy EO via using\nphotogrammetry techniques\
    \ enabling the generation of three-dimensional digital surface models of the\n\
    ﬁelds. In particular, autonomous, manual or GPS-based image acquisition, ortho-image\
    \ generation and\nimage triangulation and geo-referencing based on navigation\
    \ sensors are employed. More information\nregarding these methods is provided\
    \ in Sections 5 and 8.2. In the Sensor Layer each sensor sends the\nacquired data\
    \ in the cloud through a WSN. The WSN is made up of sensor nodes that operate\
    \ under a\nmesh or point-to-point topology, a coordinator node and a gateway.\
    \ Each node in such a network is\nconnected to one or more sensors [17]. In precision\
    \ agriculture the most important types of sensors for\nmeasuring the different\
    \ types of corps attributes are:\n•\nOptical Sensors/UAV Sensors: Optical sensors\
    \ are usually embedded in UAVs and use light\nreﬂection information to measure\
    \ the varying properties of soil and vegetation. In that case,\nthe sensors acquire\
    \ image data, which are further analyzed with photogrammetry techniques.\nObject\
    \ detectors and pattern recognition form the basic building block for extracting\
    \ information\nfrom the images. Such information may involve the vegetation and\
    \ soil color, the moisture\ncontent and temperature of soil and vegetation, the\
    \ position, height, size and shape of vegetation\nalong with the level of chlorophyll.\
    \ In this category we ﬁnd visible light sensors, multispectral\nsensors, hyperspectral\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors.\n•\nElectrochemical Sensors/Ground Sensors: These\
    \ types of sensors acquire data regarding the\nnutrient contents of soil and its\
    \ associated pH. Electrodes in these sensors work by detecting\nspeciﬁc ions in\
    \ the soil. Different families of electrochemical sensors can be recognized depending\n\
    on the electrical magnitude used for transduction of the recognition event: potentiometric,\
    \ which\nindicates change of membrane potential; conductometric, which indicates\
    \ change of conductance;\nimpedimetric, which indicates change of impedance; and\
    \ voltammetric or amperometric, which\nindicates change of current for an electrochemical\
    \ reaction with the applied voltage in the ﬁrst\ncase, or with time at a ﬁxed\
    \ applied potential in the latter.\n•\nLocation Sensors/UAV Sensors: Location\
    \ sensors are usually embedded in UAVs and provide\nspatial information regarding\
    \ the positioning of an element. These types of sensors use signals\nfrom GPS\
    \ satellites to determine latitude, longitude, and altitude to within feet. Three\
    \ satellites\nminimum are required to triangulate a position. Precise positioning\
    \ is the cornerstone of precision\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n6 of 25\nagriculture.\
    \ GPS integrated circuits such as the NJR NJG1157PCD-TE1 are a good example of\n\
    location sensors.\n•\nWeather Stations/Ground Sensors: Weather stations are free-standing\
    \ units situated at different\nlocations throughout the cultivating ﬁelds. These\
    \ stations measure various data for precision\nagriculture such as airﬂow, seasonal\
    \ rainfall, speed of wind, humidity level, direction of wind,\natmospheric pressure\
    \ and solar radiation, etc. Weather stations are an important component\nof EO\
    \ technologies since they can provide daily agro-meteorological information regarding\
    \ the\ncultivating ﬁelds.\nSummarizing the above, Table 1 presents the most frequently\
    \ acquired data by sensors in the\nagricultural domain. A sensor node consists\
    \ of a radio transceiver with an internal antenna or a\nconnection to an external\
    \ antenna, a micro-controller, an electronic circuit for interfacing with the\n\
    sensors and an energy source, usually a battery or a built-in energy harvested\
    \ form. There are numerous\ncommercial models of micro-controllers to be used\
    \ in precision agriculture applications. The most\npopular ones are the Arduino,\
    \ the Raspberry Pi, the Atmega328 and the LPC2148 boards. Accordingly,\ncommonly\
    \ used wireless communication modules used are the XBee module, the WSN802G module\n\
    and the NRF24L01 module. A sensor node can vary in size and cost, depending on\
    \ the complexity\nof its capabilities. Size and cost constraints result in corresponding\
    \ limitations on resources such as\nenergy, memory, computing speed, and bandwidth\
    \ of communications. The types of sensors that are\nmostly used in Smart farming\
    \ monitoring systems are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 1. Precision agriculture\

    In precision agriculture WSN communication protocols and technologies are used\
    \ to support\nthe connection between sensor nodes in the network and to provide\
    \ a channel for communication\nbetween the coordinator node and the gateway. According\
    \ to the type of application, such as precision\nfarming, ﬁeld irrigation management\
    \ or greenhouse crop management, the sensor network topology\nand communication\
    \ demands may differ. Hardware and software characteristics may also affect\n\
    the choice of communication technology to be used between the nodes. Each node\
    \ uses a routing\nprotocol [18] in the view of transferring the data collected\
    \ to the coordinator node.\nBased on many experimental studies on agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, there is not an ideal combination of a\nspeciﬁc communication technology\
    \ and a routing protocol. Discovering and keeping up with routes in\nWSNs is a\
    \ quite demanding task since energy restrictions and alterations in node status,\
    \ such as failure\nmay cause sudden changes in the network topology. It is a fact\
    \ that the wireless routing solution for\nagriculture applications should be highly\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, scalable, and autonomous. Up until now\nrouting tactics proposed\
    \ in the literature for WSNs employ speciﬁc methods such as data aggregation,\n\
    clustering, different node role assignment and data-centric methods.\nThe basic\
    \ goal is to build each smart monitoring system upon application appropriate networking\n\
    technologies to operate efﬁciently with minimum energy consumption. Once the coordinator\
    \ node\nobtains the data it forwards the ﬂow of information to the gateway to\
    \ reach the main server, where\nthe database is located. However, in some cases\
    \ the coordinator node can be substituted by a base\nstation to obtain the collected\
    \ data using a Wi-Fi connection as presented in [2], or another cellular\ncommunication\
    \ technology.\n4.1.1. Precision Agriculture Communication Protocols\nThere is\
    \ a wide variety of networking technologies suitable for the deployment of smart\
    \ farming\napplications. The most popular are the following:\n•\nThe IEEE 802.15.4\
    \ standard is a widely used networking technology in precision agriculture and\n\
    deﬁnes the physical layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) technique in Low-Rate\
    \ Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (LR-WPANs).\n•\nZigBee is another suitable\
    \ technology for short range radio communication in the ﬁelds using\nlow-power\
    \ devices capable of transmitting data over long distances using intermediate\
    \ stations.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n8 of 25\n•\nLoRa is a type of wireless\
    \ conﬁguration that has been created to achieve long-range connections\nfor Low-power\
    \ Wide Area Networks (LPWANs).\nLoRAWAN is a protocol for managing\ncommunication\
    \ between LPWAN gateways and nodes.\n•\nBluetooth Low Energy is a global personal\
    \ area network protocol built for transmitting small\ndata pieces infrequently\
    \ at low rates with signiﬁcantly low power consumption per bit.\n•\nRFID (Radio\
    \ Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a different technology that uses radio signals to\
    \ monitor\nand identify in real time objects without requiring line-of-sight communication.\
    \ An RFID\nsystem includes a reader, a tag, and a host and is presented as ideal\
    \ for ﬁeld monitoring in\nmultiple studies.\nMoreover, the communication between\
    \ sensor nodes and a base station can be supported by:\n•\nthe Wi-Fi protocol,\

    \ Agriculture Routing Protocols\nData routing algorithms play an important role\
    \ in WSNs by establishing the path of\ncommunication for data exchange between\
    \ sensor nodes and base stations on a network. A variety\nof routing techniques\
    \ have been proposed until now, aiming to achieve higher performance with\nminimal\
    \ power consumption. IoT and WSN routing protocols can be categorized according\
    \ to network\nstructure and the way information will be disseminated through the\
    \ network. A routing protocol can\nbelong to more than one category, aiming to\
    \ satisfy as many performance metrics as possible.\nAccording to the way by which\
    \ routing decisions are made proactive and reactive routing\ntechniques can be\
    \ used. Proactive routing (or table-driven) supports the periodic renewal and\n\
    updating of the routes and destinations that are formed between the nodes throughout\
    \ the network.\nOn the other hand, reactive routing (or on demand) includes discovering\
    \ routes on demand based\non the transmission of route request packets. The downside\
    \ to reactive protocols is their latency,\nsince transmissions over unknown or\
    \ expired routes face delays, for which either the application or\nthe routing\
    \ protocol must account by buffering or dropping data.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n9 of 25\nFurthermore, according to WSN structure, routing algorithms can\
    \ depend on neighbor nodes to\nbroadcast the collected information. Another popular\
    \ technique is based on dividing the network into\nclusters. Each cluster depends\
    \ on a cluster head node to manage the routing of information between\nother clusters\
    \ or base stations. Hierarchical routing is the most popular routing method in\
    \ smart\nfarming monitoring systems and soil parameter monitoring [23,24]. Multi-path\
    \ routing protocols\ncan also be used to implement a smart farm monitoring system\
    \ to balance the data transfer load and\nconserved energy. Table 4 presents characteristic\
    \ examples of routing protocols adopted in smart\nfarming systems according to\

    \ monitoring applications are based on machine to\nmachine (M2M) communication\
    \ support regarding real-time data transmission. There is a variety\nof communication\
    \ patterns to be used so that the terminal can receive the information necessary\
    \ to\nmonitor the production. WSN technologies, enhanced by the IoT paradigm,\
    \ enable smart sensor\ncommunication and connection to the IPv6-based internet,\
    \ by addressing the agricultural sensors\nwith IPv6 long addresses that can ﬁt\
    \ in lightweight IoT data link frames. IoT can immensely improve\nthe autonomous\
    \ capabilities of resourced-constrained nodes in a Low-power and Lossy Network\n\
    (LLN). An agricultural WSN is a LLN. In such a network, some of the nodes may\
    \ have a direct\nInternet connection to send and receive messages from the Internet.\
    \ However, other nodes from the\nsame network, may lack that kind of ability due\
    \ to hardware limitations, and require the use of the\nInternet-connected nodes\
    \ to access external services. Data exchange in a local context is also possible\n\
    without the necessity of transmitting data to the Internet. The task of discovering\
    \ the routes and\nallowing data messages to be transmitted among agricultural\
    \ sensor nodes is performed by the routing\nprotocol. Due to this fact, in such\
    \ networks, network performance is strongly related to how the\nrouting protocols\
    \ use the limited hardware resources of the network device.\n•\nThe 6LoWPAN [7,26]\
    \ is the most popular network encapsulation protocol for precision agriculture\n\
    applications. It refers to the transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over Low-Power\
    \ Wireless\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n10 of 25\nPersonal Area Networks. In a\
    \ smart farming monitoring system, it is used by sensor devices that\nare compatible\
    \ with the IEEE802.15.4 standard for WSNs. 6LoWPAN efﬁciently encapsulates\nIPv6\
    \ long headers in IEEE 802.15.4 small data frames for information exchange between\
    \ sensor\nnodes. The advantages of this protocol are that it uses a special header\
    \ compression method and\na fragmentation process to reduce the transmission overhead\
    \ [10].\n•\nThe IPv6 over LoRa [27] implementation enables the transmission of\
    \ IPv6 protocol packets over\nLoRa links. If LoRaWAN is chosen for sensor node\
    \ communication in a smart farming monitoring\nsystem, LoRa is the MAC protocol\
    \ responsible for establishing communication between the\nLoRa gateway and the\
    \ LoRa sensor end devices. In an agriculture monitoring system, the IPv6\nadaptation\
    \ enables the deployment of the IoT paradigm as a separate architectural layer.\
    \ The basic\naim of this layer is to manage header compression and packet fragmentation\
    \ to deal with the\nrequirements of LoRa modulation in the physical layer.\n•\n\
    The IPv6 over 802.11ah [10] or Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) is a low-power/low-rate protocol\
    \ able to support\nnumerous sensor node devices on a single base station. This\
    \ technology can be used for precision\nagriculture by enabling wireless base\
    \ stations in the ﬁeld to transmit data while also being energy\nconservative.\
    \ Wi-Fi-ah (HaLow) uses special characteristics of the 6LoWPAN technology for\n\
    effective transmission of IPv6 protocol packets over IEEE 802.11ah wireless networks.\n\
    •\nRPL (IPv6 Routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks) [26] is the most popular\
    \ IoT routing\nprotocol based on the distance vector routing technique. It is\
    \ a proactive protocol that constructs\na speciﬁc graph able to direct all trafﬁc\
    \ towards the sink node. RPL is the ideal routing protocol\nfor agricultural LLNs,\
    \ since it can quickly create network routes between sensor nodes in the\nﬁeld,\
    \ share routing knowledge and adapt the topology in an efﬁcient way. It is also\
    \ efﬁcient for\nmulti-hop, many-to-one and one-to-one communication.\n•\nLOADng-IoT\
    \ is another IoT routing protocol, proposed in [28] as an enhancement for reactive\n\
    protocol LOADng, which is considered to be the best current solution for LLNs.\
    \ LOADng-IoT is\nable to boost the process of route discovery, reduce the overhead\
    \ of control messages, and improve\nthe network′s quality-of-service(QoS). In\
    \ a smart farm monitoring system, this protocol will allow\nsensor nodes without\
    \ an Internet connection to forward their data packets to external Internet\n\
    services with much greater reliability and lower latency.\n4.3. The Middleware\
    \ Layer\nThe Middleware Layer is responsible for establishing and controlling\
    \ the association between\nIoT sensor devices. More speciﬁcally, the services\
    \ of this layer include smart device management by\nthe use of different transport\
    \ protocols to forward the generated data from the involved IoT devices.\nMost\
    \ of these transport standards use the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or\
    \ the User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP) for forwarding information. There is a wide\
    \ variety of data protocols [29] that belong\nto this layer towards developing\
    \ an efﬁcient managing platform for smart ﬁeld devices. However,\nchoosing the\
    \ most appropriate device management technology depends on software and hardware\n\
    speciﬁcations, network and technology architecture and communication standards\
    \ being used in the\naccording system to achieve maximum and efﬁcient performance.\
    \ In the view of using different kind of\nsmart entities in an agriculture monitoring\
    \ system, the services of this architectural layer facilitate the\ndesired interoperability\
    \ of the technologies introduced. All collected data will be stored on a remote\n\
    server and transmitted to the client machine through Application Programming Interfaces\
    \ (APIs) that\nprovide web services for third-party users. APIs enable device\
    \ communication in an application level\nfor different kinds of purposes and are\
    \ based on different architectures to transfer data from the server\nto the client.\n\
    •\nThe MQTT-SN (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport For Sensor Networks) is a\
    \ messaging\nprotocol that facilitates device data collection and communication\
    \ with servers using brokers.\nA broker is a network entity which arranges transactions\
    \ between other network entities. By using\nthe MQTT protocol, a precision agriculture\
    \ monitoring system can enable smart sensor devices to\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n11 of 25\npublish messages to a broker and/or subscribe to a broker in\
    \ order to receive certain messages.\nThe exchanged messages will be organized\
    \ by topics that act as a system for dispatching messages\nto subscribers.\n•\n\
    The CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is another popular protocol for IoT\
    \ device\ndata management. CoAP is based on a request/response pattern of communication\
    \ allowing\nconstrained devices to have web service functionalities. It is an\
    \ HTTP-like web transfer protocol\nwith the ability to extend the Representational\
    \ State Transfer (REST) architecture to Low-Power\nWireless Personal Area Networks\
    \ (LoWPANs). REST is an architectural style for providing\nstandards between computer\
    \ systems on the web, while distinguishing the concerns of client\nand server.\n\
    •\nThe XMPP-IoT (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open technology\
    \ for real-time\ncommunication based on XML messages between connected devices\
    \ and the available server.\nXMPP can efﬁciently power instant messaging, collaboration\
    \ and content syndication in a smart\nfarm monitoring system between all network\
    \ entities.\n•\nDevice and asset management in a precision agriculture monitoring\
    \ system can also be\nimplemented using the Mihini [30] software.\nMihini is an\
    \ open-source project by Eclipse\nTechnology that enables communication between\
    \ an M2M server and the applications running\non an embedded gateway. M3DA is\
    \ the protocol used for the transport of M2M data. M3DA can\nallow user applications\
    \ to exchange typed data/commands back and forth with an M2M server,\nin a way\
    \ that optimizes the use of bandwidth.\n•\nThe OMA SpecWorks’s Lightweight M2M\
    \ [31] is another device management protocol for M2M\nor IoT devices. It can be\
    \ used in a smart farming information system to efﬁciently transfer\nservice data\
    \ from the network to resource-constrained devices. In contrast to traditional\
    \ M2M\nstandards in which a device usually needs to keep up multiple stacks of\
    \ technologies, protocols\nand security services, the LwM2M scheme allows the\
    \ existence of one stack of technology for\ndevice management, not only on the\
    \ level of the device itself, but also on the application level.\nIn addition,\
    \ LwM2M is based on protocol and security standards from the Internet Engineering\n\
    Task Force (IETF).\n•\nThe ONEM2M [32] technical speciﬁcation standards are an\
    \ upcoming solution for device and\nasset management in precision agriculture.\
    \ ONEM2M is a middleware IoT platform that provides\nfunctions and APIs for different\
    \ service domains dealing with interoperability challenges. There\nare commercial\
    \ and open-source implementations of this technology.\n•\nA popular queuing protocol\
    \ for enabling server connection in IoT is the AMQP (Advanced\nMessage Queuing\
    \ Protocol). This open standard protocol can facilitate message orientation,\n\
    queuing, routing, reliability and security in precision agriculture applications.\n\
    •\nLast but not least, the DDS (Data-Distribution Service) [33] is the ﬁrst open\
    \ international M2M\nstandard directly addressing publish-subscribe communications\
    \ for real-time and embedded\nsystems. This protocol has the advantage of providing\
    \ fast data, event, and command exchange\namong the IoT sensor nodes in a precision\
    \ agriculture monitoring system.\n4.4. The Conﬁguration Layer\nThe Conﬁguration\
    \ Layer deals with protocols running on top of the IoT monitoring platform\nallowing\
    \ the exchange of data speciﬁed by its context regarding what is described, what\
    \ was measured,\nwhen, where, by what, the time of validity, ownership, and others.\
    \ The main objective of this layer\nis to curate, harmonize and aggregate the\
    \ collected raw data, so that it can be published as context\ninformation, or\
    \ supplied to upstream data processing algorithms or analytics. It is also capable\
    \ of\nsending operational commands to the Middleware Layer. Context information\
    \ is a term widely used\nin IoT research and characterizes data that may come\
    \ from existing systems, users, through mobile\napplications, IoT smart devices,\
    \ agricultural machinery or public geo-services. The Conﬁguration layer\nuses\
    \ an IoT broker to guarantee a common interpretation of information produced by\
    \ heterogeneous\ndata sources that typically employ different data formats and\
    \ ontologies, and therefore are unable to\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n12 of 25\n\
    directly share information among them. An IoT broker enables the forwarding of\
    \ lower-level device\ninformation to higher-level Thing Information.\n•\nRegarding\
    \ precision agriculture applications, a popular context broker is implemented\
    \ by the\nFIWARE NGSI technology, named Orion Context Broker. FIWARE is a framework\
    \ of open-source\nplatform components towards the deployment of the IoT paradigm.\
    \ FIWARE NGSI is the FIWARE\nversion of the OMA NGSI, an API based on HTTP that\
    \ enables the integration of components\nand provides the basis for the interoperability\
    \ and portability of IoT-enabled Smart Agriculture\napplications [34]. NGSI is\
    \ an information model developed by OMA SpecWorks to manage\ncontext information\
    \ with a meta-model based on entities, attributes and metadata. This protocol\n\
    manages data concerning context entities, such as the lifetime and quality of\
    \ information.\n•\nThe implementation of a smart farming monitoring system is\
    \ greatly depended upon geo-services,\nlocation detection tools and mapping technologies.\
    \ In such systems, the exchange of geographical\ninformation should be effortlessly\
    \ accomplished between the involved network entities across\nthe web. The Open\
    \ Geospatial Consortium-Web Feature Service (OGC-WFS) [35] constitutes a\ndesirable\
    \ asset in formulating geographic information and offering direct ﬁne-grained\
    \ access\nat feature property level of the data to IoT sensor nodes in precision\
    \ agriculture applications.\nOGC offers various standards that can ease the way\
    \ location data is exchanged and stored in\na smart farming system that is based\
    \ on drone monitoring. Furthermore, the OpenGIS Web\nMap Service Interface Standard\
    \ (WMS) [35] can be efﬁciently used by UAVs, since it provides a\nsimple HTTP\
    \ interface for requesting geo-registered map images from one or more distributed\n\
    geospatial databases.\n5. The Management Layer\nIn a smart farming monitoring\
    \ system, the basic component of intelligence is considered to be the\nstudy and\
    \ ﬁltering of the collected data. The use of EO techniques enable the advance\
    \ of cultivation\nprocedures and increase productivity by providing the base layer\
    \ for spatial information analysis and\nmonitoring of agricultural activities.\
    \ A large percentage of smart agriculture applications are based\non simulators,\
    \ commercial programs and speciﬁc programming languages for implementing and\n\
    controlling the data system. The Management layer uses modern software tools to\
    \ efﬁciently satisfy\nmultiple tasks, presented in Table 5.\nInformation management\
    \ is deployed so the farmer can consult, record and modify the\ninformation collected\
    \ by the sensors in tables, statistical graphs and interactive maps. In addition,\n\
    it can download daily, monthly and annual reports of historical data. However,\
    \ the farmer can\nmainly see the current data of the monitored variables of one\
    \ or all the WSN nodes and consult the\nhistory. The interaction with the network\
    \ and services layer is achieved using an intermediate layer of\nmanagement logic\
    \ [36]. WSN data will be stored in an online database [37].\nThe system also enables\
    \ Big Data analytics in agriculture monitoring by using tools such as\nthe Apache\
    \ Hadoop software and various Big Data hardware platforms [38] as possible resources.\n\
    Big Data refers to information assets characterized by such a high volume, velocity\
    \ and variety\nable to require speciﬁc technology and analytical methods for its\
    \ transformation into value [39].\nIn precision agriculture smart applications,\
    \ the collected data are recorded in a speciﬁc format,\nto discover patterns,\
    \ correct errors, eliminate duplicate and inconsistencies and to solve noise problems.\n\
    Big Data technologies are playing an essential role in modern farming systems,\
    \ since predictive insights\nare provided regarding optimizing the quality of\
    \ the crop, minimizing environmental impact, reducing\ncosts, increasing proﬁt\
    \ and generally optimizing production efﬁciency. In addition, Big Data enable\
    \ the\nmanagement of real-time operational decisions and the redesign of business\
    \ processes for advancing\nthe food supply chain.\nFurthermore, the proposed architectural\
    \ scheme promotes various data processing techniques that\nupgrade the impact\
    \ of EO technologies in agriculture. EO by satellite leads to the acquisition\
    \ of regular\nor spatially continuous data regarding large areas. It provides\
    \ essential information on the functioning\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n13 of 25\n\
    of ﬁelds and on the causes of environmental change. UAVs enable EO by using photogrammetry\n\
    techniques to extract three-dimensional digital surface models of the ﬁeld, as\
    \ well as orthophotographs.\nOne popular algorithm for this purpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [40]. An orthophotograph\ncan be used to create a realistic\
    \ map of the ﬁelds by measuring true distances and providing to the\nfarmer a\
    \ clearer helpful view from the sky. Based on photographs, digital image processing\
    \ tools,\nsuch as Pix4Dmapper can calculate various vegetation indices that can\
    \ lead to conclusions, either\non each photograph individually or after the production\
    \ of orthophotos regarding the crops’ state.\nVegetation indices are mathematical\
    \ quantitative combinations of the absorption and scattering of\nplant in different\
    \ bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [41]. Calculating vegetation indices will\
    \ help\nto identify useful crop characteristics concerning important biological\
    \ and physical parameters of the\nvegetation. The best-known vegetation index\
    \ is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\nwhich is the evolution\
    \ of the vegetation index ratio and is calculated by the visible and near infrared\n\
    light reﬂected from the vegetation.\nLast but not least, the smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring system also performs data mining processes\nbased on tools such as\
    \ the Apache Mahout Framework so as to identify and discover hidden patterns\n\
    in the collected data, once they are processed, in the form of reviews. In addition,\
    \ Machine Learning\ntechniques will be used in the smart monitoring platform in\
    \ order to estimate the extracted parameters\nof the crops’ growth rate and also\
    \ help to identify objects or animals trough the collected images by\nusing Object-Based\
    \ Image Analysis (OBIA) [42]. Moreover, new machine learning models—algorithms\n\
    focused on data classiﬁcation [43,44]—can be used to minimize the size of redundant\
    \ data and fasten\nthe analysis.\nTable 5. Smart farming monitoring system services.\n\

    \ monitoring system architecture, the farmer can\ninteract with the IoT applications\
    \ of the system to remotely manage the cultivation process.\nSuch applications\
    \ may concern any aspect of the agricultural ﬁeld ranging from planting and irrigation\n\
    processes to plant protection and harvesting methods [45]. The applications that\
    \ can be adopted may\ninvolve the fertilizer application, the weed mapping, the\
    \ spraying process, the irrigation of the ﬁeld\nand the alert system.\nThe Variable\
    \ Rate Fertilizer (VRF) application has as a target to optimize the usage of nutrients\
    \ by\ndeﬁning the amount of fertilizer applied based on the health of the plant.\
    \ Variable rate fertilizer in\nprecision agriculture is an area of technology\
    \ that focuses on the automated application of fertilizer to\na given landscape.\
    \ The way in which the materials are applied is based on data that is collected\
    \ by\nsensors, maps, and GPS. VRF applications bring several beneﬁts related to\
    \ savings on fertilizers and\nchemicals, potential yield increase and environmental\
    \ protection. In the same context is the Variable\nSpraying application. These\
    \ types of applications implement controllers that turn the herbicide\nsprayers\
    \ on and off. Usually variable spraying applications take into consideration information\n\
    coming from the weed mapping tools such as the weed locations. In that case the\
    \ appropriate volume\nof herbicide is estimated and applied in the ﬁeld based\
    \ on the weed intensity.\nThe Weed Mapping application focuses on the visualization\
    \ of the weed occurrences within\na certain crop ﬁeld with the help of mappings.\
    \ The GPS receiver with an aerial vehicle generates\nmaps which show the weed\
    \ occurrences. These weed maps can be combined with fertilizer maps\nand yield\
    \ maps. The IoT-based irrigation system use a micro-controller that serves as\
    \ information\ngateway receiving real-time information from soil moisture and\
    \ temperature sensors placed on the\nﬁelds. Generally, a moisture/temperature\
    \ threshold is speciﬁed based on which the micro-controller\nautomatically switches\
    \ on the water pump. The micro-controller also has servo motors to ensure that\n\
    the area is uniformly irrigated. The entire system can be managed remotely by\
    \ the end-user through\nthe dedicated application.\nAlert/ notiﬁcation applications\
    \ are also very popular in IoT-based precision agriculture. Producers\nand agriculture\
    \ companies implement IoT solutions for instantly tracking their crop ﬁelds. In\
    \ this case,\nthe data coming from IoT devices is processed and transformed into\
    \ knowledge properly visualized\nfor offering information regarding the health\
    \ of the vegetation and the soil, the behavior patterns of\nthe plants, detect\
    \ signs of disease on time, identify insects and harmful animals and instantly\
    \ alert\nproducers about potential difﬁculties. This type of applications serves\
    \ for storing and analyzing data,\nproviding producers with relevant recommendations.\n\
    The aforementioned applications aim at the efﬁcient ﬁeld and crop management to:\n\

    15 of 25\n7. Energy-Saving Techniques and Security Mechanisms\n7.1. Energy-Saving\
    \ Technologies\nIn precision farming applications sensor nodes are usually powered\
    \ by low-energy batteries that\nare difﬁcult or impossible to recharge or replace.\
    \ This is considered to be a major disadvantage to\nmaintain a real-time monitoring\
    \ system. Energy-saving techniques is vital to maintain the system’s\nefﬁciency\
    \ in smart farming. This kind of techniques can provide battery life extension\
    \ by reducing the\namount of communication between the nodes and the base station,\
    \ while minimizing the redundant\ndata in the network. Energy preservation techniques\
    \ for precision agriculture systems are presented as\na separate architectural\
    \ level covering the sensing and networking procedures of smart farming.\nIn the\
    \ Sensor layer, the proposed energy-saving approach is an on/off process which\
    \ is based on\nthe selection of a subset of nodes that will remain active for\
    \ a certain period of time, while others remain\ninactive. Following this assumption,\
    \ SWORD (sleep/wake on redundant data) is an energy preserving\nscheme that can\
    \ be used to collect data on soil moisture [19]. The SWORD algorithm performs\
    \ data\ncontrol by removing redundant data so as to minimize energy consumption\
    \ and increase the life of\nsensor nodes in the network.\nIn the Network layer,\
    \ data transmissions and receptions can also be scheduled based on the\nsleep/awake\
    \ periods of sensor nodes at predetermined intervals. For this purpose, A2S, an\
    \ automated\nagricultural precision tracking system can be used [46]. Based on\
    \ this energy-saving technology,\nwhenever the sensing period is set by the application\
    \ server, the sink node keeps the schedule and\nit spreads the sleep order message\
    \ over its network every sensing period. Each time a node receives\nthe sleep\
    \ message, it sets the sleep timer’s end time to the value of the duration ﬁeld\
    \ included in the\nmessage. When the meter time ends, the node detects the environment\
    \ and battery voltage level and\nsends the data to the source. Then, he expects\
    \ the next sleep request message.\nMoreover, another energy-saving scheduling\
    \ technique that can be deployed in the Network layer\ninvolves the use of unmanned\
    \ ﬂying vehicles in an agricultural crop monitoring system. Based on this\nscheme,\
    \ the node on the unmanned ﬂying vehicle wakes the ground nodes to retrieve the\
    \ measured\ndata. To perform this function, a coded radio signal is sent via a\
    \ transmitter to the ground nodes.\nThe nodes are in an inactive state, except\
    \ for a small receiver waiting to receive the trigger signal.\nFurthermore, taking\
    \ advantage of APTEEN hierarchical routing protocol, a time division multiple\n\
    access technique can be implemented as a scheduling method. Based on this technique,\
    \ messages are\nsent to put some nodes in sleep mode so as to avoid packet collisions\
    \ between sensor nodes belonging\nto different clusters. In addition, carrier\
    \ sense multiple access technique is another alternative method,\nwhich is equally\
    \ effective for avoiding collisions.\n7.2. Security Mechanisms\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ monitoring systems involve the exchange of sensitive information regarding\n\
    the cultivation process, the state of crops and personal data of authorized staff.\
    \ It is of great importance\nfor such systems to be protected against cyber-attacks.\
    \ An unauthorized entry of a malicious individual\nin the system may cause great\
    \ damage to the cultivation process or even acquire the farmers personal\ninformation\
    \ [47]. In the pursuit of safeguarding a smart farm monitoring system the conﬁdentiality\n\
    of data should be met. In addition, it is vital to ensure the reliability of the\
    \ data and the ability to\nconﬁrm that a message has not been tampered with, altered\
    \ or changed while on the network. Also,\nthe services of resources offered by\
    \ the network, or by a single sensor node must be available whenever\nrequired\
    \ and ﬁnally to be able to identify the origin of a message received. Basic security\
    \ mechanisms\nare already deployed by the combined IoT technologies in every architectural\
    \ level of the proposed\nsmart monitoring system. However, there are more ways\
    \ to increase the level of security in each\nlayer separately.\nOne popular way\
    \ of providing physical layer security in WSN and IoT systems is cryptography.\n\
    Physical layer security refers to the inner security capabilities of the Sensor\
    \ layer regarding the\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n16 of 25\nrandomness of wireless\
    \ channels, the signal-to-noise ratio gaps or intended jamming. There are\nthree\
    \ kinds of cryptographic methods used in WSNs, the symmetric and asymmetric ones\
    \ and hash\nfunctions. Hash functions are special mathematical functions which\
    \ map a given input to a certain\noutput with a ﬁxed size. Well-known cryptographically\
    \ secure hashes are the Secure Hash Algorithm-2\n(SHA-2) and Advanced Encryption\
    \ Standard (AES) algorithm. In symmetric cryptographic techniques,\na single shared\
    \ key is used between the two communicating nodes both for encryption and decryption.\n\
    This key stays known only to the nodes of the network. On the other hand, in asymmetric\
    \ cryptography,\na private key can be used to decrypt and sign data. A public\
    \ key is also used to encrypt and verify data.\nThe private key needs to be kept\
    \ conﬁdential while the public key can be published freely. Asymmetric\ncryptographic\
    \ techniques may use the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm, the ECC (Elliptical\n\
    Curve Cryptography) algorithm or the pairing technique. Popular frameworks of\
    \ symmetric and\nasymmetric technique can be found in [48].\nRegarding the Link\
    \ layer of our proposed architecture security mechanisms focus against the\ninterception,\
    \ modiﬁcation and fabrication of the exchanged data. Attack detection mechanisms\
    \ can\nbe applied, such as the misbehavior-aware threshold detection scheme for\
    \ LLNs proposed in [49].\nIn addition, secure routing protocols may be used such\
    \ as SAR(Secure aware routing protocol), which is\nbased on on-demand protocol\
    \ such as AODV or DSR and DPRAODV (Detection, Prevention and\nReactiveAODV) [50].\n\
    Middleware security mechanisms deal with unauthorized modiﬁcations that occur\
    \ due to\ntransmission errors (accidental) and require the use of digital signatures.\
    \ Digital signature schemes\nare cryptographic schemes that include key generation\
    \ algorithms, signing algorithms and signature\nverifying algorithms. A digital\
    \ signature is an authentication mechanism that enables the creator of the\nmessage\
    \ to attach a code that acts as a signature. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA),\
    \ developed by\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology, is one of\
    \ many examples of a signing algorithm.\nAccess control is an important building\
    \ block for the overall security of a precision agriculture\nmonitoring system.\
    \ The IoT requires access control models that apply authorization policies across\n\
    a multitude of smart sensors. In a smart farm monitoring platform, authentication\
    \ is required\nto prevent authorized users from accessing resources in an unauthorized\
    \ manner. For instance,\na worker in the ﬁelds is a legitimate user but does not\
    \ have the access rights as the main administrator\nfarmer. Most importantly,\
    \ access control prevents illegitimate users from gaining access to resources.\n\
    The Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model is a technique that assigns attributes\
    \ to each entity\nin the system. The attributes may refer to either a user or\
    \ a resource and are deﬁned as properties\nof every entity to enable authentication.\
    \ Another paradigm able to provide solid communication in\nthe application layer\
    \ is the Role-Based Access Control model (RBAC) where a user is assigned as\n\
    administrator or ordinary user that predetermines access rights policies. In the\
    \ Application layer,\neach user can be authenticated by the use of passwords or\
    \ a smart key card [51].\n8. Use Case Study: The DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS research\
    \ project stands for Drone Innovation in saffron Agriculture Surveillance.\nIt\
    \ is co-funded by the European Union and Greek national funds through the Operational\
    \ Program\nCompetitiveness, Entrepreneurship, and Innovation. University of Western\
    \ Macedonia (UOWM) in\ncooperation with Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative (KSPC)\
    \ aims at developing an integrated\nautomated surveillance system for saffron\
    \ cultivation.\nThis 24 h real-time saffron cultivation\nsurveillance system is\
    \ relied on signal and image collecting and processing, which is derived from\n\
    advanced surveillance, risk identiﬁcation and early warning systems, based on\
    \ integrated sensor\nnetworks, and aerial unmanned vehicles.\n8.1. Saffron Cultivation\n\
    The saffron cultivation is considered to be of extreme importance for the Western\
    \ Macedonia\ncitizens, due to the activity over saffron cultivation by a large\
    \ number of citizens, the limited farming\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n17 of 25\n\
    geography, the unique production process to plant the saffron seeds, and the unique\
    \ production risk\nthat this operation faces. The only kind of saffron that is\
    \ systematically cultivated around the world,\nfor at least ten centuries, is\
    \ the edible saffron or as it known in scientiﬁc (botanical) terminology Crocus\n\
    Sativus Linneaus.\nThe cultivation process includes harvesting the ﬂowers, as\
    \ presented in Figure 2, splitting the\nstigmas and stamens from the petals, drying\
    \ and sorting of saffron. The picking of 1000 ﬂowers is\nprocess of a duration\
    \ around 45–55 min, while additional 100 to 130 min are required for removing\n\
    the stigmas for drying. In total, 370 to 470 h are required to produce 1 kg of\
    \ dried saffron [52].\nThe ﬂowers are picked exactly when they are fully bloomed,\
    \ and the saffron strand or stigma is at its\nreddest. The harvesting process\
    \ begins shortly after dawn to minimize the further sunlight exposure\nto the\
    \ crops, since they may lose their color and even ﬂavor. Saffron cultivation requires\
    \ dry soil\nwith speciﬁc levels of moisture, controlled irrigation and right amounts\
    \ of nitrogen, phosphorus\nand potassium. Cultivation is commonly disturbed by\
    \ mice, moles and rats wrecking the stems.\nFurthermore, fungi may cause speciﬁc\
    \ diseases at the early stages of saffron growth.\nFigure 2. Saffron harvesting.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to improve the production process, by offering the ability\
    \ of immediate\ninterference in case of animal, disease or wild weeds detection.\
    \ The farmer will be able to monitor the\nﬁelds in real time and getting alerts\
    \ in case of unwanted incidents regarding the state of the plants\nduring all\
    \ cultivation period, while raising proﬁts. To satisfy these goals, the monitoring\
    \ process will\nbe aligned speciﬁcally with the farmers concerns and actions during\
    \ each month of cultivation as\npresented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Saffron cultivation\
    \ yearly stages.\n8.2. DIAS Architecture\nThe DIAS platform follows the architectural\
    \ design of the proposed remote sensing monitoring\nsystem. As presented in Figure\
    \ 4 the DIAS system is consisted of seven architectural layers. In each\nlayer\
    \ the most suitable aforementioned technologies are used towards achieving the\
    \ overall system’s\nefﬁcient performance and reliable operations. The saffron\
    \ cultivation is a quite demanding and delicate\nprocess requiring the deployment\
    \ of tailor-based technologies and continuous crop monitoring to\navoid animal\
    \ and disease interventions.\nIn the Sensor layer, quadcopter UAVs with thermal,\
    \ hyperspectral and RGB cameras are being\nused in cooperation with multiple wireless\
    \ nodes equipped with various sensors for data collection\nregarding the crops.\
    \ Saffron cultivation monitoring requires the study of small sized crops and\n\
    the notice of minimal crop state variations during each month. To select the desired\
    \ information\nUAVs must ﬂy in a certain distance and place for a speciﬁc period\
    \ of time and by using different\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n18 of 25\nposition\
    \ angles. Quadcopter UAVs is considered to be the best choice for saffron monitoring\
    \ since\nthey have rotary wings, which provide them with the ability of maneuverability,\
    \ while also ﬂying\nin low speed. Regarding RGB cameras, they are ideal since\
    \ saffron cultivation requires the capture\nof data-images in different weather\
    \ conditions avoiding inadequate or excessive exposure of the\nimage. Using multispectral\
    \ or hyperspectral sensors, UAVs can also obtain information related to\nspectral\
    \ absorption and reﬂection of the crops in several bands. This quite useful since\
    \ the provided\ninformation can then be used to calculate vegetation indices and\
    \ monitor the state of saffron crops\nbased on them. On the other hand, thermal\
    \ imaging detects speciﬁc levels of radiation and translates\nit into a grayscale\
    \ image, using brighter and darker shades of heat representation. This ability\
    \ is also\nessential in saffron cultivation since the ﬁelds are regularly trampled\
    \ by animals that are not being\ndetected on time in before they cause any damage.\
    \ The DIAS monitoring system uses different ground\nand on-leaf sensors to collect\
    \ useful data for improving the cultivation process. More speciﬁcally,\nenvironmental\
    \ humidity and temperature is evaluated since saffron requires speciﬁc conditions\
    \ to\nprosper. Additionally, the levels of luminosity, leaf-wetness, soil moisture,\
    \ pH and wind speed are also\nof great importance. Furthermore, the amounts of\
    \ nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil can\nhave a severe impact on\
    \ the plant’s growth, as well as the moisture levels in the soil. The farmer will\n\
    be able to predict production loss efﬁciently due to a round knowledge of the\
    \ saffron ﬁelds condition\nand even intervene with possible treatments to change\
    \ its course for the better.\nRegarding the Link and Encapsulation layer, sensor\
    \ data exchange in the DIAS platform is enabled\nby the LoRaWAN technology and\
    \ the IPv6 protocol. LoRa technology offers several advantages.\nThe LoRa physical\
    \ layer uses ISM bands 868 and 915 MHz—frequencies that are free to use anywhere\n\
    in the world. In addition, LoRa devices consume very little power making it ideal\
    \ for battery-powered\ndevices and it can also transmit and receive data for up\
    \ to 15 km in suburban areas and 5 km in\nurban areas. Another advantage of LoRa\
    \ is its high network capacity. In LoRaWAN, a single gateway\ncan accommodate\
    \ 1000 end-node devices. On the other hand, IPv6 offers large addressing space\n\
    and has built-in support for network auto-conﬁguration. In the DIAS platform,\
    \ each sensor node\nis characterized by its own IP address and uses a power saving\
    \ scheduling and routing protocol to\ntransmit the collected data to the nearest\
    \ LoRa Gateway. The information to be exchanged is encrypted\nbefore transmission.\
    \ Each LoRa gateway forwards the information to the according network router for\n\
    Internet access and data storage to the system’ database. UAVs’ data transmission\
    \ and communication\nis enabled by the IEEE 802.11ah networking standard in cooperation\
    \ with the IPv6 protocol, to forward\nthe collected images to the network server\
    \ as well.\nIn the Middleware layer, the DIAS platform will employ the MQTT-SN\
    \ protocol. MQTT-SN\nenables the management of all DIAS networking devices through\
    \ message exchanges coordinated by\nthe FIWARE’s context broker. It is essential\
    \ to maintain the monitoring’s system reliability towards\nachieving meaningful\
    \ data collection. Based on this protocol, the exchanged messages can be organized\n\
    by topics and importance regarding device management commands, transmission requests\
    \ initiated by\na higher layer and data acquisition. Sixteen number of message\
    \ types are supported and transmitted\nin an asynchronous way of communication\
    \ by the publish-subscribe model. TCP and UDP will also be\nused as transport\
    \ protocols. MQTT is ideal for the DIAS system since it excels in smart sensor\
    \ device\ncommunication on a wide area network, due to the publish/subscribe architecture\
    \ with the broker\nin the middle. MQTT is also very useful if the bandwidth is\
    \ limited to enhance network reliability\nand availability.\nIn the according\
    \ Conﬁguration layer, all saffron ﬁeld collected data will be grouped and\nformulated\
    \ to reach the information management unit. This layer facilitates the FIWARE\
    \ NGSI\nAPI so to produce the desired information model of the acquired ﬁeld data\
    \ based on efﬁcient\ncontext management.\nThe FIWARE’s Orion Context Broker has\
    \ powerful features enhancing\nthe capabilities and performance of the DIAS monitoring\
    \ system such as enabling asynchronous\napplication notiﬁcations. The basic operations\
    \ of the current layer include enabling the publication,\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 348\n19 of 25\nconsumption, subscription and processing of all the information\
    \ relevant to the crops and the\ncultivation process in the DIAS platform.\nFigure\
    \ 4. The DIAS architecture.\nThe Management layer constitutes the basic operation\
    \ center of the DIAs platform. It stores,\nmaintains, analyzes the collected data\
    \ and produces predictions for the progress of the crops growth\nrate and statistics\
    \ regarding they current state. According to the commands acquired from the user\
    \ of\nthe platform in the highest architectural layer, the information management\
    \ logic initiates the according\nprocesses. Data processing includes the use of\
    \ the Random Forest machine learning classiﬁcation\nalgorithm for direct extraction\
    \ of conclusions regarding the growth and health of vegetation. This\nalgorithm\
    \ is directly applied on the data of the images acquired by the UAVs, evaluating\
    \ the RGB\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n20 of 25\ncolors and the intensity of each\
    \ pixel. The Random Forest scheme performs very well with high\ndimensionality\
    \ and can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features.\
    \ This\nmethod is chosen since very little pre-processing is required and the\
    \ data does not need to be rescaled\nor transformed. Digital image processing\
    \ of geospatially corrected aerial images (orthophotographs)\nfocuses on producing\
    \ the according vegetation indexes for evaluating the state of saffron plants.\
    \ Two\nkind of vegetation indexes will be calculated by the PiX4D image processing\
    \ tool. Vegetation indexes\nderived from multispectral information, such as NDVI\
    \ will enable the detection of unhealthy or sparse\nvegetation that reﬂects more\
    \ visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\n\
    growth and health of saffron crops. On the other hand, regarding the use of RGB-based\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) is based on the assumption\
    \ that saffron plants will display a\nclear high degree of greenness, while soil\
    \ being the only background element. Finally, the Normalized\nDifference Index\
    \ (NDI) will be also used since it can enable the separation of saffron plants\
    \ from\nsoil and residue background images, using only green and red channels.\
    \ Spectral information can\nhelp signiﬁcantly in assessing a lot biological and\
    \ physical characteristics of the saffron crops. Any\nkind of wild weeds or animal\
    \ detection based on thermal imaging in the ﬁelds initiates alerts for\nimmediate\
    \ intervention and is taken into consideration as a note in the cultivation calendar\
    \ created by\nthe platform for the farmer. For this purpose, the OBIA algorithm\
    \ is also used to recognize weeds or\ndiscriminate species. Object-based image\
    \ analysis is based on the comparison between sets of similar\npixels called image\
    \ objects in measures of spectral properties (i.e., color), size, shape, and texture,\n\
    as well as context. The OBIA algorithm is chosen since it is more suited to landscape-scale\
    \ analyses\nand can ﬁlter out meaningless information and assimilate other pieces\
    \ of information into a single\nobject. After processing, all the collected sensor\
    \ data are categorized and evaluated in accordance with\nthe desired vegetation\
    \ index values, moisture levels and general plant state for each month during\n\
    the cultivation process. For these tasks, the DIAS platform employs powerful and\
    \ well-known tools,\nthe Apache Spark Framework focusing on Big Data analytics\
    \ and the WEKA (Waikato Environment)\nFramework specializing in data mining tasks.\
    \ The evaluation results will point out the vulnerable\nspots in the ﬁeld with\
    \ helpful statistical graphs and suggest possible solutions to the farmer, such\
    \ as\nthe use of fertilizer.\nIn the Application Layer, each user can access the\
    \ DIAS platform by using his/her own unique\npassword. According to their authority\
    \ and activities in the saffron ﬁeld the users have different access\nrights in\
    \ the DIAS platform. A user may be the administrator of the platform, a representative\
    \ of the\nKSPC board, a farmer or a worker in the ﬁelds. For instance, a worker\
    \ can only observe the evaluation\nresults in order to aid the farmer in treating\
    \ the plant growth, while the KSPC representative can\nadd observation notes,\
    \ can schedule and initiate sensor data collection in a speciﬁc ﬁeld and also\n\
    manage the ﬂight plan of UAVs. On the other hand, the platform administrator is\
    \ only one who can\nadd new users and new saffron ﬁelds for cultivation to be\
    \ observed in the system. Access in the\nDIAS platform is forbidden for non-authorized\
    \ users. In the Application layer, the management of\nthe four basic operational\
    \ units of the DIAS system can be initiated. These are the Visualization Unit,\n\
    the Data Management Unit, the Prediction Unit and the Data collection Unit. By\
    \ entering the Data\ncollection Unit, a user can initiate sensor data collection\
    \ in a selected ﬁeld or modify existing data\nin the platform. By entering the\
    \ Data Management Unit, the user can evaluate orthophotographs\nand calculate\
    \ vegetation indexes according to speciﬁc data in a speciﬁc saffron ﬁeld with\
    \ the help of\nPix4DMapper tool. The Visualization Unit is related to the presentation\
    \ of statistical results and graphs\nregarding each saffron ﬁeld, while the Prediction\
    \ Unit employs the aforementioned data mining tools\nto produce a sufﬁcient evaluation\
    \ of the collected data. All system information is stored in the central\nserver\
    \ database.\nBased on the acquired and processed data, farmers can produce statistics\
    \ regarding the progress in\nsaffron production and avoid ﬁnancial loss, while\
    \ improving the quality of the crops and accomplishing\na considerable rise in\
    \ production.\nInformation 2019, 10, 348\n21 of 25\n8.3. Beneﬁts and Costs\nGreece\
    \ is the second largest saffron producing country, with an average output of 4\
    \ tons of p.a.\nduring the last four decades, most of which is directed in export\
    \ markets. The establishment of the\n‘Kozani Saffron Producers Cooperative’ marked\
    \ the beginning of a good decade for this product\nwith production reaching its\
    \ height record of more than 12 tons in 1982 [53]. Nevertheless, in the\nperiod\
    \ following Greece’s accession to the European Community, farmers began abandoning\
    \ saffron\ncultivation. This fact resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in yield with\
    \ an average yield of 800 g per\nstremma (1 ha = 10 stremmas = 1000 m2 ). However,\
    \ this trend seems to be reversed since 2010 and\ncurrently yields vary around\
    \ 1 ton per stremma. Currently, Greek saffron price is about 1200 euros per\n\
    Kg. Nearly 5000 spots are needed to produce 100 g of red saffron. The average\
    \ produce per acre is 6 kg\nof dried stigmas (red product). The lower production\
    \ of the plant is on the ﬁrst year of the plantation,\nwhile the highest on the\
    \ third and the fourth.\nIn the year of 2015, a study in Greek saffron cultivation\
    \ resulted that farm managers need\nto address the efﬁciency of input use and\
    \ raise capital and labor productivities to maintain\ncompetitiveness [53]. The\
    \ saffron quality is determined by the color, ﬂavor and size of the stigmas.\n\
    The DIAS platform aims to upgrade proﬁt earnings by the adoption of new technologies,\
    \ ensuring\nﬂower picking at appropriate time in a proper collection material\
    \ at an appropriate age. Animal\nintrusions in the ﬁelds, causing a huge loss\
    \ in production, will be prevented and crops diseases will\nbe detected in time.\
    \ The overall equipment cost is considered to be a safe investment for farmers\n\
    since most of the technologies involved are open source and the initial cost of\
    \ the related hardware\nand software can be shared across producers. Currently,\
    \ the DIAS initiative is under construction\nand no experimental results are available\
    \ to conﬁrm the proposed objectives. However, in Table 6\nwe present the production\
    \ rate of Greek Saffron as recorded in [53], while in Table 7 an average\nestimation\
    \ is provided regarding the increase in cultivation operations by adopting the\
    \ DIAS platform.\nThese percentages are the estimations provided by two of the\
    \ producers whose ﬁelds participate in\nthe pilot study. The estimations show\
    \ that on average the farmers calculate an increase of around\n20% in production,\
    \ this percentage is in accordance to other types of cultivations such as olives\
    \ and\npotatoes [54].\nThe use of the DIAS project can offer a signiﬁcant increase\
    \ in saffron production. Nevertheless,\nsince no pilots have been implemented\
    \ yet in the project, the Return on Investment (ROI) is difﬁcult to be\nestimated.\
    \ An investment of time and money from the DIAS consortium is required to investigate\
    \ how\nthe data gathered from UAVs can connect to and affect other things that\
    \ are happening on the ﬁelds.\nSaffron growers need that information to provide\
    \ context and create a correlation regarding causes\nand effects. At that point\
    \ ROI becomes signiﬁcant promoting UAVs as a part of the desired solution\nand\
    \ not as the solution itself. Furthermore, due to shared costs between project\
    \ partners, ROI becomes\na collective performance measure that can be estimated\
    \ only when each member has acquired the\naccording technological beneﬁts. A complex\
    \ proﬁtability study is required to specify the precision\nservice offerings,\
    \ as presented in [55,56]. Each partner in the DIAS project owns and offers different\n\
    assets in this endeavor, thus calculating the overall ROI of UAV usage from the\
    \ side of farmers is not\nyet possible.\nTable 6. Greek saffron cultivation economic\

    \ system in precision agriculture faces\nseveral challenges. The greatest challenge\
    \ in the sensor layer is for sensor nodes to achieve efﬁcient and\ncontinuous\
    \ operation for a long time in a natural environment, while taking into account\
    \ the climate\nchange and wildlife interventions. The battery life of sensor nodes\
    \ is not considered satisfactory,\nand it is necessary to design and implement\
    \ energy-saving protocols with the highest possible\nsystem performance among\
    \ other precautions. In addition, depending on the type of application,\nthe supported\
    \ agricultural work and the implementation technologies, the problems that arise\
    \ can be\ndifferentiated. For instance, the use of sensors and controllers from\
    \ different manufacturers prevents\ncommunication between them and makes it more\
    \ difﬁcult to interconnect with other agricultural\ncomponents. Also, the sensor\
    \ inertia phenomenon was observed in a high-speed WSN due to non-steep\nchanges\
    \ in humidity and soil temperature.\nIn the network layer, the basic challenges\
    \ regarding the operation of a crop monitoring system\nwith WSN and IoT technologies\
    \ include the limited computational capabilities of sensor nodes.\nThe restricted\
    \ memory of the nodes disables them to handle large amounts of communication data\n\
    and cluster-based interconnection procedures. Due to this fact, long data queues\
    \ are created in each\nnode, leading to greater delay in transmissions. The same\
    \ outcome can be triggered by the long\ncommunication distance of sensor nodes.\
    \ One major issue that routing algorithms must deal with in\nsuch cases is the\
    \ high level of energy consumption, which leads to a reduction in the overall\
    \ viability\nof the network. In precision agriculture monitoring systems routing\
    \ protocols should offer minimum\ndelay, be able to provide efﬁcient services\
    \ in many sensor nodes, while taking into account the limited\nresources. They\
    \ should also be capable of accepting all sorts of environments including severe\
    \ and loss\nenvironments, while providing information security and privacy. Most\
    \ routing protocols use some\nlocalization technique to obtain knowledge concerning\
    \ their locations. The performance of the routing\nprotocol is a function of network\
    \ size and transmission media. Therefore, transmission media of good\nquality\
    \ enhances the network performance directly.\nHowever, in many cases the failure\
    \ of such advanced monitoring system may be due to the\ngeographic, cultural or\
    \ socio-economic distance between system designers and the intended user\ncommunity.\
    \ Cost is an important limiting factor in the implementation of such systems.\
    \ The cost\ndepends to a great extent on the quality of the materials and the\
    \ topology of the network.\n10. Conclusions\nThis paper proposes the architectural\
    \ components of a smart farming monitoring system, based on\nmodern IoT communication\
    \ technologies and WSN capabilities, in cooperation with energy-saving\nprotocol\
    \ schemes. A use case study based on the DIAS project is also presented, enhancing\
    \ the reliability\nand contribution of our model. The IoT agricultural applications\
    \ enable farmers to collect and analyze\nmeaningful data. Large landowners and\
    \ small farmers should welcome the potential of IoT market\nfor agriculture by\
    \ installing smart technologies to increase competitiveness and sustainability\
    \ in their\nproductions. The rapid growth of population forces farmers to meet\
    \ the demand by implementing\nagricultural IoT solutions in a prosperous manner.\
    \ In the future, an in-depth study will be carried out\nregarding the real-time\
    \ performance of the proposed model in the DIAS project.\nInformation 2019, 10,\

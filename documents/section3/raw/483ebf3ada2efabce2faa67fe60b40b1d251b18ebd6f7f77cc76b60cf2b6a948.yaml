    Metrics Abstract: Water loss and improper scheduling are problems with traditional
    irrigation techniques, making it difficult to meet the growing demand for food
    production while also preserving precious water resources. To address these challenges,
    this paper introduces a cutting-edge smart irrigation system that leverages the
    power of the Internet of Things (IoT), data analysis, and machine learning to
    determine the most efficient way to apply and schedule water for irrigation. The
    cornerstone of this innovative system is the utilization of a carefully curated
    dataset, "Crop Irrigation Scheduling," sourced from Kaggle. This dataset comprises
    six crucial attributes: Crop Type, Crop Days, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity,
    and Irrigation. These attributes, described in detail in the dataset’s metadata,
    provide the foundational information required for precise irrigation management.
    The system operates seamlessly by deploying IoT sensors to collect real-time data
    from the field. This data is then preprocessed to ensure its quality and consistency.
    Subsequently, a machine learning model is trained using this dataset to make intelligent
    irrigation decisions in real time. The model’s predictions are seamlessly integrated
    with control mechanisms that govern the irrigation process. Moreover, the system
    offers an intuitive API for easy data access and management, allowing agricultural
    professionals to monitor and adjust irrigation strategies effortlessly. Experimental
    findings validate the system’s utility, with particular emphasis on the decision
    tree model, which demonstrates the best balance of accuracy, precision, recall,
    and F1 score. This system maximizes crop yield and minimizes water waste, contributing
    to a more sustainable and productive agricultural ecosystem. Published in: 2023

    Location: Giza, Egypt SECTION I. Introduction Drought, issues with crop quality
    and production, and challenges with yield forecast [1] are just some of the issues
    that modern agriculture must contend with. According to United Nations'' Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, the global population will reach
    8 billion by 2025, an increase of three people per second (or 250,000 people per
    day), and rise to an estimated 9.6 billion by 2050 [2]. Farmers need to drastically
    expand food production while protecting the environment and efficiently using
    natural resources to keep up with the growing global population. Still, they can
    not achieve this independently, and traditional farming methods are not equipped
    to handle the task. To that end, technological advancements are crucial in meeting
    the global population’s expanding dietary requirements. Farmers need to know how
    much water their crops will use, when that water will be used, and how much water
    will evaporate from the surface of lakes and dams for free [3]. The ultimate goal
    of smart irrigation management is to achieve efficient and effective water use,
    making it an increasingly significant administrative activity. Good irrigation
    management aims to apply the appropriate amount of water at the appropriate time.
    New and improved technologies are helping the vast majority of people in many
    different ways. The Internet of Things (IoT) and data analysis through machine
    learning [4] significantly enhance people’s ability to shape their environments
    in their daily lives. IoT and machine learning are widely used in the agro-industrial
    sector for diagnosing and managing smart irrigation systems, both of which supply
    crucial data for successful farming. Smart irrigation that efficiently uses water
    could benefit from IoT-based solutions, which have already proven useful in many
    areas of the agricultural environment [5]. An intelligent irrigation system must
    consider soil moisture, precipitation, and evaporation. A smart irrigation system
    is proposed in this paper, which would utilize machine learning algorithms and
    the IoT to conserve water and power. Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and
    rainfall are just some variables the system’s array of sensors may track. A machine
    learning system is fed data from these sensors about the crop moisture level to
    formulate an ideal irrigation schedule. In addition, the system incorporates IoT
    devices, which provide full transparency by enabling remote user control and system
    monitoring. The smart irrigation system is effective because it uses machine learning
    algorithms to analyze crop data in real time and predict plant development and
    harvest. The benefits of the smart irrigation system are discussed in this study
    as well, including decreased water consumption, increased crop production, decreased
    energy consumption, and decreased operational expenses. The rest of this paper
    is organized in the following manner. Section 2 reviews the related work and section
    3 presents the proposed methodology in detail. While section 4 presents the experimental
    evaluation, section 5 presents the system prototype. Finally, the paper is concluded
    in section 6. SECTION II. Related Work IoT, machine learning capabilities, data
    analytics and mining [6], and wireless technologies [7] contribute to developing
    smart agriculture management. Many works presented a lot of suggestions as well
    as several approaches to general agricultural activities that make use of this
    new technology. In [8], an overview of agricultural irrigation systems that use
    the Internet of Things is presented. In their literature study, the authors analyze
    wireless technologies, sensor nodes, and IoT systems alongside the most important
    indicators for characterizing water quality in irrigation, soil, and weather situations
    [9] and discuss the methods used to monitor and manage automated watering systems
    like sprinklers. In order to attain precision irrigation for increased food safety
    and water conservation, the authors offer new insights into how existing monitoring
    and advanced control systems might be developed. Critical agricultural applications
    are identified and examined, and the potential of IoT technology, practices, and
    future research are all explored in [10]. The research projects reviewed the state
    of the art in smart agriculture monitoring in both laboratory and field settings.
    In [11], a mathematical model was provided for corn tempering drying that considers
    the thermo-physical heterogeneity of the kernel’s components. In [12], an infrastructure
    for implementing smart irrigation systems was presented, utilizing LoRaWAN and
    fog computing. In order to determine when to irrigate, the proposed system exploited
    IoT nodes that communicate with nearby fog computing nodes and a distant cloud.
    No system has been proposed where data can be stored and tracked locally. According
    to the results of their analysis, cloud computing is more expensive. In [13],
    a Windows GUI program was described for multifractal analysis of soil and plant
    structures. In [14], a user-friendly smartphone app, REUTIVAR-App, was introduced
    for fertigation scheduling in olive trees with recycled water. Farm-scale irrigation
    and fertilization recommendations are also tracked daily in real-time as part
    of their research. However, the study did not focus on IoT uses. In proposing
    an IoT platform, the authors in [15] showed how to collect, analyze, and visualize
    sensor data for use in smart farming. In [16], a proposal was made for monitoring
    environmental parameters in chicken farms using inexpensive gear and software.
    Several experiments were also conducted to contrast the proposed prototype with
    existing commercial options. Intending to realize long-term and cost-effective
    monitoring, the authors in [17] proposed a soil environment monitoring system
    based on RFID sensors and LoRa for tracking soil’s temperature, moisture level,
    and chloride ion concentration. The authors of [18] present a method for recommending
    when and how much water should be used for irrigation by combining agglomerative
    clustering with machine learning methods like regression trees and support vector
    machines. The recommendation system did well on its collected data set and the
    publically available agricultural data set. The authors of [19] created an IoT
    and a data-driven irrigation system. Predictions of soil moisture content are
    performed using this method and compared to those made using alternative state-space
    models. Results show that the suggested strategy outperforms the status quo, and
    predictions for soil moisture content are positive. Since a water resource is
    most misused in irrigation, monitoring and controlling the agricultural field
    or irrigation are key factors to be met in an efficient, smart irrigation system
    [20]. The widespread availability of mobile phones makes this possibility possible.
    For off-site, real-time field data monitoring, an IoT-based strategy was developed
    and operated [21]. In [22], the authors proposed a system that used the ThingSpeak
    cloud platform based on the IoT to enable remote monitoring and control of the
    irrigation system. By allowing for remote monitoring and control, the system made
    the farmer’s job easier in terms of optimizing the irrigation system. Incorporating
    foresight utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence is a hot topic
    of study. Modern irrigation techniques are necessary to prevent water shortages
    [23]. The next section details the suggested methodology and the basic prerequisites
    needed to implement it. In order to predict the agronomist’s irrigation suggestions,
    this study [24] set out to establish a model that incorporates his irrigation
    planning process. Machine learning techniques applied to an integrated dataset
    from multiple sources allowed us to accomplish our goal. The dataset included
    agronomist-determined irrigation levels and sensor-based characteristics, weather-based
    features, and features describing plots. Three machine learning techniques, the
    standard linear regression, the nonparametric gradient boosted regression trees,
    and the nonparametric boosted trees classifiers, were used to build various irrigation
    recommendation prediction models utilizing this comprehensive dataset. Eight distinct
    feature subsets were used to train the models. Predicting agricultural yields
    and water availability using a hybrid of the wrapper feature selection methodology
    and the PART classification technique is offered [25], called WPART. There are
    four phases to the proposed system: the first is data collection, wherein environmental
    indicator data is gathered via the IoT system; the second is data preprocessing;
    the third is feature selection, wherein the wrapper feature selection approach
    is used to analyze environmental indicators and select the effective indicators
    of the farming system; and the fourth is drought prediction, wherein PART supervised
    machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the selected indicators. SECTION
    III. The Proposed System Architecture Figure 1 depicts the proposed system’s design.
    There are three phases: Data collection, ML model building, API integration, and
    irrigation scheduling. The watering scheduler is improved by the data fusion model
    used in the cloud service. The data model can be customized for various use cases
    by selecting and feeding in data from specialized domains of knowledge. In addition,
    the watering schedule may be monitored and adjusted remotely using a web interface.
    Fig. 1. The proposed system architecture Show All A. Data collection The smart
    irrigation system comprises various components for efficient data collection.
    Sensors such as a soil moisture sensor and a DH11 sensor for temperature and humidity
    air measurements are deployed in the field. These sensors are connected to an
    Arduino Uno microcontroller, which serves as the central control unit. The microcontroller
    collects real-time data from the sensors, facilitating data processing and communication
    with other system components. A Node MCU is also utilized to establish an internet
    connection, enabling data transmission to the cloud. The collected sensor data,
    including soil moisture levels, temperature, and humidity, is stored in a database
    server, providing a reliable and scalable solution for data management. B. ML
    model building Once the data is collected from the sensors and stored in the database
    server, it is transmitted to the cloud for processing and analysis. In the cloud-based
    environment, data undergoes rigorous preprocessing to ensure its optimal quality
    and relevance, a crucial step given the significance of smart irrigation systems.
    The initial phase involves addressing missing values, often a result of intermittent
    connectivity or sensor malfunctions. To achieve uniformity in the disparate measurements,
    data such as temperature and humidity are standardized using Min-Max scaling.
    Further, categorical variables, like soil types, undergo a transformation process
    called one-hot encoding, making them digestible for machines without implying
    any ordinal significance. A pivotal step in the preprocessing journey is the partitioning
    of data into training and test subsets. This division is paramount to avert overfitting,
    a situation where a model might excel on its training data but falter drastically
    with unfamiliar data. By training the model on one subset and testing it on an
    unseen one, a more realistic gauge of the model’s performance in real-world scenarios
    is achieved. Once preprocessed, the data is utilized to train a machine learning
    model hosted in the cloud, with the test data serving the purpose of model evaluation.
    The cloud platform also hosts an API for users to access system functionalities.
    It stores and manages the system’s data, ensuring scalability, reliability, and
    security. Additionally, it enables integration with other services and applications,
    acting as a centralized hub for data processing, analysis, and decision-making
    in the smart irrigation system. Once the collected sensor data goes through a
    comprehensive analysis process in the cloud platform, the smart irrigation system
    leverages the power of machine learning to ensure accurate and efficient irrigation
    decisions. A labeled dataset is then prepared, incorporating historical sensor
    data and corresponding irrigation procedures, providing valuable insights into
    when to activate or deactivate irrigation based on sensor readings. The machine
    learning model is trained to capture the intricate relationships between sensor
    readings and irrigation requirements using sophisticated machine learning algorithms
    such as decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), or logistic regression
    (LR). Once trained, the model is deployed in the cloud platform, enabling real-time
    inference for predicting optimal irrigation actions based on the learned patterns
    and relationships. This intelligent decision-making significantly improves water
    efficiency and empowers farmers with precise and timely irrigation strategies.
    C. API integration API integration is critical in enabling real-time decision-making
    for irrigation control in a smart irrigation system. By integrating machine learning
    models with a cloud server through APIs, the system can harness the power of data
    analysis and predictive algorithms to optimize irrigation operations. Users can
    retrieve sensor readings, watering recommendations, and system configurations
    through an API. It allows users to access real-time data, monitor sensor readings,
    configure irrigation settings, and switch between manual and automatic modes.
    The API provides a unified interface, enabling seamless integration with external
    services or applications. This integration allows users to interact with the system
    and make informed decisions. The API serves as a key component to share data,
    control the system, and facilitate smart irrigation system integration with other
    systems or applications. D. Irrigation scheduling The smart irrigation system
    works automatically by harnessing the power of machine learning. By integrating
    machine learning models with the system, it is automatically decides to pump or
    not without user intervention. In addition to its automatic capabilities, the
    smart irrigation system also provides manual control through an IoT cloud Arduino
    service, such as a web application. Users can access the web application interface,
    which allows them to monitor sensor readings, adjust irrigation settings, and
    manually control irrigation actions. By selecting the manual mode and using the
    web application, users can override the automatic irrigation decisions made by
    the machine learning models. They have the flexibility to customize irrigation
    parameters based on their preferences or specific crop needs. For instance, users
    can choose to activate or deactivate the irrigation system, adjust the watering
    duration, or set specific irrigation schedules. The manual control feature provides
    users with a higher level of control and adaptability, allowing them to fine-tune
    the irrigation process to suit their specific requirements or respond to unexpected
    environmental changes. SECTION IV. Results and discussions A. Dataset profiling
    The dataset consists of six attributes; CropType, CropDays, SoilMoisture, Temperature,
    Humidity, and Irrigation. The dataset attributes description is depicted in Table
    1. The dataset "Crop Irrigation Scheduling," used in this work, was downloaded
    from Kaggle [26]. TABLE 1. The dataset attributes description Irrigation decisions
    are crucial in agriculture to ensure that crops receive the right amount of water
    at the right time. This attribute may contain data or actions related to irrigation
    management. These attributes collectively provide essential information for managing
    and optimizing crop cultivation, irrigation, and overall agricultural practices.
    They are valuable for making data-driven decisions in agriculture and optimizing
    crop yield and quality. B. Results When comparing the results of decision trees,
    logistic regression, and vector machine support models, their performance based
    on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and accuracy are analyzed. The experimental evaluation
    method is the confusion matrix shown in Fig. 2 for the classifier decision tree,
    as an example. The mentioned evaluation measures are computed from the confusion
    matrix [27]. Fig. 2. The confusion matrix of the decision tree classifier Show
    All The values of computed evaluation measures, accuracy, precision, recall, and
    f1 score are depicted in Table 2. Table 2. The performance measures of different
    classification model Based on these comparisons, the DT model performs better
    overall, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-score for the results as shown
    in the Fig. 3. In the development of our smart irrigation system using IoT and
    machine learning techniques, the Decision Tree classifier played a pivotal role
    in decision-making processes, achieving the highest performance. While various
    training parameters can be adjusted to refine the performance of Decision Trees,
    for the scope of this study, we relied on the default parameters to ensure consistency
    and replicability. Specifically, the criterion for the quality of a split was
    set to "gini" which measures the impurity of the data, the maximum depth of the
    tree was left undefined allowing the tree to expand until all leaves are pure,
    the minimum samples split was set to 2, and the minimum samples leaf was set to
    1. By employing these default values, a foundational benchmark for the system’s
    performance is established, which can serve as a reference point for future iterations
    and optimizations. C. Comparison with literature This section presents and discusses
    a comparison with work in the literature that is related to our proposed method.
    In the realm of agri-tech, our work underscores the promise of combining IoT with
    machine learning. Iorliam et al. [28] tested various models on IoT-based irrigation
    data, where logistic regression reached 71.76% accuracy, and the support vector
    machine achieved 90.21%. Interestingly, our decision trees model’s 89.68% accuracy
    is nearly on par with their SVM results. Tas et al. [29] crafted a versatile,
    efficient irrigation system. Using sensors to track soil humidity, temperature,
    and rain, they tested several models. The KNN model was most impressive, with
    a 98.3% accuracy and 0.12 RMSE. Notably, their dataset differs from ours. Research
    [30] proposed an advanced Irrigation Water Quality Prediction (IWQP) model utilizing
    convolutional neural architectures. When stacked against Logistic Regression (LR),
    Support Vector Regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), their approach
    leaned more towards traditional machine learning, aligning with low-capability
    IoT devices. Mishra and Somkunwar [31] advocated for logistic regression in smart
    irrigation, considering various parameters. In comparison, our various models,
    including logistic regression, could be marginally (0.0553%) more precise. Fig.
    3. The comparison between DT, SVM and LR Show All SECTION V. System Prototyping
    As shown in Fig. 4, a system prototype is presented that synergizes IoT technology
    and machine learning to optimize water usage and augment crop yield. By seamlessly
    integrating sensors, a microcontroller, and cloud connectivity, the prototype
    continuously monitors and analyzes environmental data to generate adaptive irrigation
    schedules. Through real-time decision-making and remote control functionality,
    the objective is to enhance sustainability and efficiency in agricultural practices.
    The prototype of the smart irrigation system was meticulously implemented in a
    small house garden, effectively demonstrating its practicality and efficacy within
    a confined space. The primary aim was to develop a compact and efficient system
    that could be effortlessly installed and operated by homeowners. The smart irrigation
    system comprised the following components: First: Hardware Components Microcontroller

    conditions, including temperature and humidity. These sensors provided essential
    information for determining optimal watering requirements based on prevailing
    weather conditions. Water Pump: A compact water pump was seamlessly integrated
    into the system to ensure efficient water delivery to the plants. Upon detecting
    the need for irrigation based on sensor readings, the microcontroller promptly
    activated the water pump to supply water to the garden. Power Supply: A consistent
    power supply was ensured to facilitate uninterrupted operation of the microcontroller
    and sensors. Second: Software Components Machine Learning Algorithms: The prototype
    harnessed advanced machine learning algorithms to effectively analyze sensor data
    and make accurate predictions and decisions regarding irrigation schedules. These
    algorithms were meticulously trained using historical data to discern irrigation
    patterns and optimize watering schedules based on the unique requirements of different
    crop types. Arduino IoT Cloud: The Arduino IoT Cloud platform served as the central
    hub for efficient data management and seamless system control. It empowered users
    with real-time monitoring capabilities, robust data storage, and remote access
    to system configurations through an intuitive user interface. API Integration:
    To enhance system flexibility and enable seamless interaction with external systems,
    we developed a custom API. This API facilitated effortless customization, scalability,
    and potential integration with other agricultural management systems. Its functionality
    included facilitating the retrieval of sensor readings, configuration of irrigation
    settings, and real-time interaction with the system. During the development of
    the prototype, we meticulously integrated the hardware and software components
    to create a cohesive and seamlessly functioning system. The microcontroller served
    as the intelligent core, effectively receiving data from the sensors and executing
    the irrigation control algorithm based on the trained machine learning models.
    IoT connectivity enabled robust communication between the microcontroller and
    the cloud platform, facilitating uninterrupted data transmission and remote access
    to the system. The software components, comprising machine learning algorithms
    and the Arduino IoT Cloud, worked synergistically to analyze sensor data, make
    real-time decisions, and provide users with a user-friendly interface for monitoring
    and controlling the irrigation system. The seamless integration of the hardware
    and software components ensured the smooth operation of the prototype. Sensor
    data collected by the hardware components served as critical input for the machine
    learning algorithms, which generated precise irrigation schedules tailored to
    the specific requirements of different crop types. The Arduino IoT Cloud platform
    facilitated real-time monitoring, data storage, and remote access, empowering
    users to interact with the system and make necessary adjustments as per their
    needs. The API integration further enhanced system flexibility and potential for
    integration with other agricultural management systems. Fig. 4. The prototype
    of the proposed system Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In conclusion, this research

    the support vector machine (0.8415) in this comparison of machine learning techniques''
    efficacy. In comparison to logistic regression and support vector machine techniques,
    the decision tree approach has a greater precision (0.0553 vs. 0.0454). The prototype
    implementation in a small garden further validates the practicality and effectiveness
    of the system in promoting water conservation and supporting healthy plant growth.

    Based on the diverse needs of interdisciplinary studies within this research plan,
    a program called the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER)
    was implemented. The overall objective of HiWATER is to improve the observability
    of hydrological and ecological processes, to build a world-class watershed observing
    system, and to enhance the applicability of remote sensing in integrated ecohydrological
    studies and water resource management at the basin scale. This paper introduces
    the background, scientific objectives, and experimental design of HiWATER. The
    instrumental setting and airborne mission plans are also outlined. The highlights
    are the use of a flux observing matrix and an eco-hydrological wireless sensor
    network to capture multiscale heterogeneities and to address complex problems,
    such as heterogeneity, scaling, uncertainty, and closing water cycle at the watershed
    scale. HiWATER was formally initialized in May 2012 and will last four years until
    2015. Data will be made available to the scientific community via the Environmental
    and Ecological Science Data Center for West China. International scientists are
    welcome to participate in the field campaign and use the data in their analyses.
    CORRESPONDING AUTHOR: Dr. Xin Li, 320 West Donggang Road, Cold and Arid Regions
    Environmental and Engineering Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
    Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Province, China, E-mail: lixin@lzb.ac.cn An eco-hydrological
    experiment designed from an interdisciplinary perspective addresses problems including
    heterogeneity, scaling, uncertainty, and closing water cycle at the watershed
    scale. A major research plan entitled “Integrated research on the eco-hydrological
    process of the Heihe River Basin” (hereafter referred to as the Heihe Plan) was
    launched by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) in 2010. The
    scientific objectives of the Heihe Plan is to reveal the processes and mechanisms
    of the eco-hydrological system in an inland river basin at different scales (e.g.,
    leaf, individual plant, community, landscape, and watershed scales); to improve
    the research capabilities and predictability of the evolution of hydrological,
    ecological, and economic systems; to determine the responses of eco-hydrological
    processes to climate change and human activities; and to provide fundamental theory
    and technical support for water security, ecological security, and sustainable
    development in inland river basins. Eventually, the implementation of the Heihe
    Plan will establish a research platform that integrates the observation, data
    management, and model simulation of both physical and socioeconomic processes
    to foster twenty-first-century watershed science in China. The Heihe River basin
    (HRB) in the arid region of northwest China has been selected as an experimental
    watershed to carry out this research plan. This area was selected because, first,
    the HRB is a typical inland river basin (endorheic basin). Inland river basins
    occupy approximately 11.4% of world''s land area. Most of them are distributed
    over arid regions, where water-stressed ecosystems are massively distributed (Rodriguez-Iturbe
    and Porporato 2004), eco-hydrological processes are more complicated, and the
    environment is more fragile to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance and
    therefore the water conflict between ecosystem''s demand and economic development
    is more severe. All of the above extremes are found in the HRB (Cheng, 1996; Wang
    and Cheng 1999; Li et al. 2001). Second, the HRB has long served as a test bed
    for integrated watershed studies as well as land surface or hydrological experiments
    (Cheng 2009). Comprehensive experiments such as the Heihe Basin Field Experiment
    (HEIFE; Hu et al. 1994) and Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (WATER;
    Li et al. 2009) have taken place in the HRB. A prototype watershed observing system
    has been developed (Li et al. 2010b). The above-mentioned reasons have made the
    HRB an ideal field laboratory to further pursue integrated eco-hydrological studies
    and integrated river basin management that can benefit both the natural ecosystem
    and society. Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER)
    was initialized based on the reasons provided in the background above. It is designed
    to be a comprehensive eco-hydrological experiment in the framework of the Heihe
    Plan, based on the diverse needs of the interdisciplinary studies of the research
    plan and the existing observing infrastructures in the basin. The overall objective
    of HiWATER is to improve the observability of hydrological and ecological processes,
    to build a world-class watershed observing system, and to enhance the applicability
    of remote sensing in integrated eco-hydrological studies and water recourse management
    at the basin scale. However, determining how these goals are to be met is a challenging
    task. The first challenge is how to take advantage of new trends in hydrological
    and ecological experiments as well as new Earth observing techniques. In Earth
    science, there is a tradition of using comprehensive experiments as a tool to
    improve the understanding of processes, and to test scientific hypotheses and
    new measurement techniques. However, most land surface or hydrological experiments
    conducted to date put their emphases on large-scale processes to serve the parameterization
    of subgrid processes for general circulation or land surface models (André et
    al. 1986; Sellers et al. 1988). River basin hydroclimatic studies have also focused
    on the continent scale (Stewart et al. 1998; Raschke et al. 2001; Lawford et al.
    2004). Only in recent years has the trend shifted toward using the watershed as
    a basic observing entity. Some research plans, such as the Consortium of Universities
    for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science (CUAHSI; CUAHSI 2007), Critical Zone
    Observatories (Anderson et al. 2008), Water and Environmental Research Systems
    Network (NRC 2010), and Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO; Bogena
    et al. 2006) have selected representative river basins in different climate zones
    to carry out comprehensive experiments or build multiscale observatories. Indeed,
    measurement techniques are rapidly advancing. Remote sensing is reshaping hydrological
    observations. Many traditionally unobservable variables, such as groundwater and
    river flow, can now be retrieved by remote sensing (NRC 2008a). On the ground,
    new technologies, such as the eddy covariance system (EC), large aperture scintillometer
    (LAS), cosmicray neutron probe, and wireless sensor network are being applied
    (NRC 2008b). However, how to effectively use these technical advances in modeling
    and understanding eco-hydrological processes remains elusive. Understanding how
    to take advantage of the aforementioned research trends is therefore a serious
    challenge in HiWATER. The second challenge is how to capture the strong land surface
    heterogeneities and associated uncertainties within a watershed. Observing and
    modeling at the watershed scale is more challenging than at the point scale because
    of inherent multiscale heterogeneity (Sivapalan et al. 2003). New generation observing
    techniques (e.g., those introduced in the paragraph above) are reliable in their
    direct measurements. However, in terms of spatial representativeness, which requires
    appropriate scaling, both remote sensing and in situ observations feature much
    greater uncertainties. In terms of the reliability of retrieval and estimation
    models, which transform direct measurements into the necessary hydrological and
    ecological variables or parameters, these observations also feature much greater
    uncertainties. This means, while the original measurements do capture the heterogeneities,
    translating these measurements into useful information in understanding eco-hydrological
    processes requires appropriate scaling schemes and carefully developed models
    that can provide reliable retrievals. In turn, optimal observation network designs
    and sampling strategies as well as suitable approaches to quantify the uncertainties
    associated with scaling and estimation/retrieval models are needed. The third
    challenge is more specific: how to close the water cycle in a river basin. Water
    should be closed on the various scales of drainage basins, from tens of square
    kilometers to hundreds to tens of thousands of square kilometers for entire river
    basins. This problem, though not difficult in principle, still involves great
    uncertainties in the measurement and estimation methods used to study many water
    cycle components. Evapotranspiration might be the most uncertain component. Its
    measurement using the EC technique is challenged by the energy balance closure
    problem (Foken 2008); its remote sensing estimation is far from reaching a mature
    stage (NRC 2008a). Precipitation, in both cold and arid regions, features great
    spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Reliable areal estimations of total precipitation
    and the associated spatiotemporal variation require careful calibrations for different
    types of precipitation and a specially designed ground observation network (Yang
    et al. 2009). Soil moisture, when measured by remote sensing, is currently only
    available at a very coarse resolution that is not particularly useful for watershed-scale
    applications. Snow water equivalent in mountainous areas still cannot be accurately
    measured from space (NRC 2008a). Therefore, although HiWATER will measure both
    hydrological and ecological processes, closing water cycle is a top priority.
    Addressing the above-mentioned challenges with innovative ideas will make HiWATER
    different from previous hydroclimatic experiments and its predecessor WATER. In
    short, HiWATER is a watershed-scale eco-hydrological experiment designed from
    an interdisciplinary perspective to address complex problems, such as heterogeneity,
    scaling, uncertainty, and closing the water cycle at the watershed scale. SCIENTIFIC
    OBJECTIVES. The overall objective of HiWATER is to improve the observability of
    hydrological and ecological processes, to build a world-class watershed observing
    system, and to enhance the applicability of remote sensing in integrated eco-hydrological
    studies and water recourse management at the basin scale. This is being achieved
    through the following specific objectives: 1 To develop a watershed observing
    system that serves watershed science and integrated water resource management;
    2 To precisely measure each component of water cycle using multiscale observations
    in order to close water cycle at the river basin scale; 3 To obtain multiscale
    data critical to understanding ecosystem dynamics and its relationship with water
    resource availability in the inland river basin; 4 To produce a series of high-quality
    remote sensing products that can support basin-scale integrated eco-hydrological
    studies; 5 To validate remote sensing models, algorithms and products through
    purposeful validation experiments; and 6 To integrate observation data and remote
    sensing products into a distributed hydrology model, coupled surface water-groundwater-crop
    growth model and water consumption model upstream, middle stream and downstream
    of the HRB, respectively. It is expected that through these empirical case studies
    the applicability of remote sensing in eco-hydrological studies and water recourse
    management can be enhanced. There are six scientific questions that will be explored
    in HiWATER. Most of the questions are proposed from a methodological point of
    view. 1 How well can remote sensing data be used to improve our understanding
    of the eco-hydrological processes in a river basin? How can we develop more reliable
    and robust eco-hydrological remote sensing methods through field experiments?
    2 Which types of remote sensing products are urgently needed in eco-hydrological
    studies? How can remote sensing products be tailored toward water cycle and ecological
    processes at the watershed scale with better quality and finer resolution? 3 How
    well can we capture the spatio-temporal variations of each observation item at
    the basin scale? How well can we design an in situ observation network? What is
    the optimum density and scale of each individual observation sensor? 4 How can
    we design in situ sampling strategies aimed at remote sensing validation? How
    can we acquire ground truths at the pixel scale over heterogeneous land surfaces
    that can be used as a reference truth for remote sensing validation? 5 How can
    we effectively use remote sensing observations and products in integrated eco-hydrology
    studies? 6 How can we integrate remote sensing observations, in situ measurements,
    and model simulations to accurately estimate the state variables and fluxes in
    water cycle and ecological processes, and to improve the accuracies of hydrological
    and ecological simulations and predictions at the basin scale? EXPERIMENTAL AREA.
    The experiment will be performed in the Heihe River basin (Fig. 1), which is located
    within 37.7°–42.7°N, 97.1°–102.0°E, covering an area of approximately 1,432,000
    km2.1 This basin is characterized by its distinct cold and arid landscapes: glaciers,
    frozen soil, alpine meadow, forest, irrigated crops, riparian ecosystem, and desert,
    which are distributed upstream to downstream. In the whole river basin, three
    key experimental areas (KEAs) were selected to conduct intensive and long-term
    observations. These KEAs are the cold region experimental area in the mountain
    cryosphere of the upper reaches, the artificial oasis experimental area in the
    middle reaches, and the natural oasis experimental area downstream. Within each
    KEA, the foci experimental area (FEA), the experiment site (ES), and the elementary
    sampling plot (ESP) were designed as hierarchically nested locations of multiscale
    ground observations. View Full Size Fig. 1. Experimental areas in HiWATER. Citation:

    Download Figure Download figure as PowerPoint slide 1 The cold region experimental
    area consists of the upstream regions of the main stream of the Heihe River (102,009
    km2). Observation experiments are performed at three scales: the main stream basin,
    sub-basin (Babao River basin), and watershed (Hulugou catchment). The Babao River
    basin is a sub-basin in the upper reaches of the HRB with an area of approximately
    2452 km2 and an elevation ranging from 2640 to 5000 m. The Hulugou catchment is
    a typical alpine catchment with an area of 23.1 km2. These two FEAs have almost
    all of the typical landscapes of cold regions, including alpine grassland, swamp,
    alpine meadow, valley bush, Picea crassifolia, and Qilian juniper, among others.
    Permafrost, seasonal frozen soil, alpine cold desert, snow, and glaciers exist
    in the area. 2 The artificial oasis experimental area is located in an artificial
    oasis–riparian ecosystem–wetland–desert compound in the middle reaches of the
    HRB. Some typical irrigation districts (e.g., Yingke and Daman as well as Pingchuan)
    are selected as the FEAs. The precipitation in this area is approximately 100–250
    mm per year, but potential evaporation is as high as 1200–1800 mm per year. The
    major crops are maize, wheat, and vegetables. 3 The natural oasis experimental
    area is located in the Ejin Banner oasis, which is downstream of the HRB. The
    landscapes are composed of sandy and gravel deserts, a natural oasis dominated
    by Populus euphratica, Tamarix, and other arid region species, as well as terminal
    lakes. Regions of the river bank from Erdaoqiao to Qidaoqiao are selected as the
    core FEA. This area is an extremely arid region, with precipitation of less than
    50 mm per year and potential evaporation of approximately 3755 mm per year. OBSERVING
    VARIABLES AND PARAMETERS. Three categories of variables/parameters are to be observed.
    These include the state variables and fluxes of key eco-hydrological processes,
    atmospheric forcing data, and parameters (e.g., vegetation, soil, terrain, hydrology,
    and aerodynamic parameters). These variables and parameters were selected with
    reference to some typical distributed hydrological models, groundwater models,
    crop growth models, dynamic vegetation models, and land surface models; most of
    these models have been employed in hydrological and ecological studies in the
    HRB (Li et al. 2010a). The major referenced distributed hydrological models are
    the Distributed Hydrology Vegetation Model (DHSVM; Wigmosta et al. 1994), the
    Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT; Arnold and Fohrer 2005), GEOtop (Rigon et
    al. 2006), and a distributed biosphere hydrological model (WEB-DHM; L. Wang et
    al. 2009). Various versions of ModFLOW are used as core groundwater models (Harbaugh
    et al. 2000). The Lund–Potsdam–Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM;
    Sitch et al. 2003) is the dynamic vegetation models and WOFOST (Vandiepen et al.
    1989) is the crop growth model. The Simple Biosphere Model, version 2 (SiB2; Sellers
    et al. 1996), Common Land Model (CoLM; Dai et al. 2003), and Community Land Model
    (CLM; Oleson et al. 2010) are referenced as land surface models. The newly developed
    coupled models for the HRB have also been used as reference models (Tian et al.
    2012; Zhang et al. 2013; Zhou et al. 2012). Tabulation of the variables and parameters
    can be found online at http://hiwater.westgis.ac.cn/english/index.asp. EXPERIMENT
    COMPOSITION. HiWATER is composed of fundamental, thematic, application experiments
    and integrated studies. Fundamental experiments. The fundamental experiments focus
    on the establishment of observing system, provision of basic datasets, enhancement
    of observation capabilities, and development of reliable and robust methods. The
    four following experiments are included. Airborne remote sensing experiment An
    imaging spectrometer, light detection and ranging (lidar) system, charge-coupled
    device (CCD), multi-angle thermal infrared camera, and microwave radiometer are
    used in the airborne missions. The goal of these missions is to improve the remote
    sensing methods for observing key eco-hydrological processes and to develop scaling
    methods by acquiring multispatial-resolution remote sensing data. The airborne
    sensors used in HiWATER are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Airborne sensors used
    in HiWATER. View Table Hydrometeorological network This aims to establish a comprehensive
    hydrometeorological observation network composed of super, research, ordinary,
    and conventional stations that cover the whole HRB to provide representative atmospheric
    forcing data and validation data for the watershed models. The ordinary automatic
    meteorological station (AMS) measures the radiation, precipitation, air pressure,
    wind speed and direction, air temperature, humidity, soil moisture and temperature
    profiles, and soil heat flux. The superstation is outfitted with an EC system,
    a Bowen ration energy balance system, an LAS, and a lysimeter (optional) to measure
    fluxes at multiple scales. Additionally, besides the standard observations performed
    in an ordinary station, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and land surface
    temperature (LST) are measured at a superstation. Precipitation is highly uncertain
    in cold and arid regions for wind-induced error and wetting loss (Yang et al.
    2009). Therefore, a precipitation correction experiment is carried out to develop
    calibration formulas for different rain gauges employed in the HRB. Additionally,
    intensive river runoff observations supplement existing hydrological stations
    along the mainstream of the Heihe River. Eco-hydrological wireless sensor network
    The eco-hydrological wireless sensor network (WSN) in HiWATER aims to integrate
    a variety of hydrological, ecological, and meteorological observation facilities
    distributed in the HRB. Three types of new sensor nodes are designed or used,
    including the WATERNET (Fig. 2a), SoilNet (Fig. 2b), and leaf area index (LAI)
    measurement systems (Fig. 2c). The AMSs and flux towers are reconfigured with
    wireless transmission capacities. Relevant studies about the optimal spatial sampling
    strategy of the sensor nodes have been performed to capture the spatiotemporal
    variations of key eco-hydrological parameters over heterogeneous land surface,
    for example, at the watershed or pixel scale (Ge et al. 2012). View Full Size

    Figure Download figure as PowerPoint slide The sensor nodes communicate with the
    data center through wireless transmission techniques such as Zigbee, General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS), and microwave antenna. A software platform for the WSN has
    been developed. This system has the functions of transmitting and archiving automatically
    observed data and controlling sensor nodes and instruments remotely. As a result,
    the platform is anticipated to establish an automatic, intelligent, and remote-controllable
    ecohydrological WSN in the HRB (Jin et al. 2012). Calibration and validation experiment
    The main tasks of the calibration and validation experiment are as follows. Calibration.
    Measurements on the radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, and geometric
    rectification of airborne and satellite remote calibration, atmospheric correction,
    and geometric rectification of airborne and satellite remote sensing data are
    carried out. In particular, air temperature and humidity profiles and aerosol
    properties are measured by a digital sounder and sun spectrophotometers. GPS-tracking
    sounding balloons are released before and after each airborne mission. The wind
    speed at various heights above the ground and the thermodynamic structure of the
    lower layer of the atmosphere are measured by an acoustic wind profiler, with
    a vertical range of up to 1000 m above the ground. Ground-based remote sensing.
    The emissivity spectra of different land surfaces during different seasons are
    systematically measured by an infrared spectrum analyzer. The microwave radiation
    characteristics of typical land surfaces are measured using a ground-based microwave
    radiometer. Validation. The remote sensing products to be validated are products
    of land cover type, plant structure, vegetation type, LST, albedo, soil moisture,
    snow depth, LAI, fraction of PAR (FPAR), fraction of vegetation cover (FVC), net
    primary production (NPP), and net ecosystem production (NEP). Pixel-scale ground
    truths are obtained simultaneously with airborne and satellite overpasses with
    the aid of the WSN. Thematic experiments. The thematic experiments are concentrated
    on specific hydrological or ecological processes. The first thematic experiment
    in HiWATER is the multiscale observation experiment on evapotranspiration (ET)
    over inhomogeneous land surfaces (Liu et al. 2013, unpublished manuscript). During
    the lifetime of HiWATER, more thematic experiments are planned, such as one for
    soil moisture and one for ecosystem biomass. ET is the most important component
    of the water cycle in arid regions. It is also a key process that links hydrology
    with ecosystem dynamics, from stoma to landscape scales. Therefore, a multiscale
    observation experiment on ET using a flux observing matrix is carried out to reveal
    the spatial heterogeneities of ET, to explore the energy balance closure problem,
    to identify scaling effects, and to provide ground truths that correspond to the
    development of the remote sensing models and scale transformation approaches for
    ET over heterogeneous land surfaces (Jia et al. 2012). Application experiments.
    The application experiments aim to prove the applicability of remote sensing in
    integrated eco-hydrological modeling and water resource management by carrying
    out comprehensive experiments in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the HRB,
    in association with fundamental experiments. The following experiments are included.
    Remote sensing hydrology experiment for cold regions Carefully designed observations
    will be performed to calibrate and validate distributed cold region hydrological
    models that feature detailed descriptions of snow and soil freeze/thaw processes.
    Algorithms for the estimation of snow cover area (SCA) under complex terrains
    and a dynamic function between SCA and snow water equivalent (SWE) at the grid
    scale will be developed and validated through airborne missions and in situ measurements.
    These algorithms are expected to improve the forecasting of runoff, especially
    spring runoff, in mountainous areas by assimilating remote-sensed SCA and soil
    moisture products into a distributed cold region hydrological model. Remote sensing
    experiment for optimal allocation of irrigation water in the middle stream of
    the HRB Measurements of water balance components in some irrigation districts
    are being carried out to calibrate and improve coupled surface water–groundwater–crop
    growth models. With the aid of remote sensing products, such as vegetation type,
    vegetation coverage, phenophase, NPP, and soil moisture, the coupled model is
    to be expanded to the irrigation district scale based on a state-of-the-art data
    assimilation method. With these data, the coupled model is expected to realize
    real-time monitoring and the short-term forecast of water demand/supply and crop
    growth situation at the irrigation district scale to further optimize irrigation
    management and enhance water use efficiency. Remote sensing experiment to support
    scale transformation of ecosystem water consumption in the downstream oases of
    the HRB This experiment will carry out multiscale comprehensive observations to
    measure the water consumption of the oasis ecosystem downstream to validate and
    calibrate scale transformation approaches of water consumption from the single
    plant-canopy-community to regional scale. Airborne lidar missions will be performed
    to acquire key vegetation structure parameters that are needed in scale transformation.
    In this context, the water consumption of the riparian forest ecosystem will be
    quantified with the support of remote sensing. Integrated studies. Except for
    field campaigns, integrated research also plays an important role in HiWATER.
    These studies aim at producing remote sensing products to study water cycle and
    key ecological processes. For water cycle, a daily SCA product with a resolution
    of 500 m will be created by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) data and based on a nonlinear spectral mixture analysis model. A soil
    moisture product with a resolution of 1 km will be generated by merging microwave
    remote sensed data and MODIS VI products. Hourly precipitation products with resolutions
    of 1–5 km will be created by assimilating passive microwave observations, Doppler
    radar, and ground measured rainfall data into the Weather Research And Forecasting
    (WRF) model. For ecological variables/parameters, monthly vegetation maps across
    the whole HRB will be generated based on differences in topography, vegetation
    type, and vegetation structure to reveal the characteristics of vegetation phenology.
    The data products of FVC, LAI, FPAR, NPP, and other key parameters that can represent
    plant growth processes will be produced with a spatial resolution finer than 1
    km. INSTRUMENT SETTINGS AND AIRBORNE MISSIONS. Upstream area. Three-level nested
    experimental areas are chosen. The first level is the upstream area of the Heihe
    River main stream, the second level is composed of the two FEAs, and the third
    level consists of a snow observatory and a frozen soil observatory (Fig. 3). View

    CCD camera and an imaging spectrometer are flown over the Heihe River Valley.
    In the Hulugou and other selected catchments, a 1-m resolution digital elevation
    model (DEM) is to be generated using airborne lidar. The L-, K-, and Ka-band radiometers
    are flown with manned and unmanned missions to develop more reliable remote sensing
    methods for deriving soil moisture (including surface soil freeze/thaw status),
    snow depth, and SWE. The upstream area of the Heihe River main stream The whole
    region is equipped with 10 AMSs and 3 flux towers (Fig. 3a). The flux towers are
    installed in a permafrost area, a seasonally frozen ground area and a snow-covered
    area. The Babao River basin It will be instrumented with a densely distributed
    network of AMSs and WSN. Six ordinary AMSs and a superstation at A''rou will be
    installed in different landscapes and elevation zones to capture the heterogeneity
    of near-surface atmospheric states (Fig. 3b). A WSN with more than 40 WATERNET
    nodes will be deployed according to an optimal design based on the spatial variation
    of terrain, soil moisture, and soil temperature, so that the major hydrological
    heterogeneity can be captured (Ge et al. 2012) (Fig. 3b). The observation items
    of a WATERNET node include soil moisture, soil temperature, LST, precipitation,
    snow depth, air temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction. Snow observatory
    and frozen soil observatory In the Hulugou catchment, a snow observatory was constructed
    (Fig. 3c). A γ-ray (GMON) observation system is employed to measure the SWE with
    a footprint of 100 m2. A snow water sensor (SWS) is used to measure the snowpack
    liquid water content, snow density, and SWE. FlowCapt records the blowing snow
    flux and the EC system observes the evaporation and sublimation on the snow surface.
    A snow pillow records the SWE and the melts. A digital camera monitors snow coverage.
    Snow stakes are laid out at an interval of 10 m to periodically measure snow depth.
    The frozen soil observatory is located at the A''rou Superstation. In addition
    to the basic observations configured in the superstation, the top 30-cm depth
    soil is stratified into 5-cm intervals and the soils at a depth of 30–100 cm are
    stratified into 10-cm intervals. In each layer, soil temperature and moisture
    are measured. Soil heat flux and water potential are measured in selected layers.
    Additionally, a footprint-scale (approximately 600-m diameter) soil moisture is
    measured by a cosmic-ray soil moisture observing system, in association with WSN
    (Fig. 3d). Middle stream area. Airborne missions VNIR imaging spectrometers (i.e.,
    the CASI and SASI systems) are flown over the experimental area (Fig. 4) to support
    the inversion of surface reflectance, albedo, FPAR, LAI, chlorophyll content,
    and FVC. The TASI imaging spectrometer is utilized to measure the emission characteristics
    of soils, vegetation, and desert and for the retrieval of LST and emissivity.
    The WiDAS is flown to measure the directional characteristics of surface reflectance
    and thermal radiation. The lidar and CCD camera are to measure the structure parameter
    of crops and other vegetation and to derive the aerodynamic roughness. The L-band
    microwave radiometer is flown during different growing seasons to derive soil
    moisture products and to validate the soil moisture algorithms. These observations
    will be further used to estimate some components of water and carbon cycles, such
    as ET and NPP. View Full Size Fig. 4. Instrumentation setting in the middle stream

    slide Very high-resolution airborne CCD images (~20 cm) are used to map land cover
    and vegetation types and to obtain the characteristics of the channels in the
    irrigation district, including their spatial distribution, types, roughness, and
    other static parameters. Multi-scale observation on ET The instrumentation plan
    is illustrated in Figs. 4a and 4b. In larger areas, the observation system is
    used to monitor the spatial– temporal variation of ET and its impact factors within
    the oasis–desert ecosystem. Four AMSs are installed around the oasis (i.e., sandy
    desert, desert steppe, Gobi, and wetland stations) and each one is supplemented
    with an EC system (Fig. 4a). The Daman Superstation is installed in the central
    oasis, which is a 40-m boundary layer tower. Within the oasis, an observing matrix
    composed of 17 EC towers and ordinary AMSs and 4 pairs of LAS systems that span
    2–3 km each are located in the Yingke and Daman irrigation district, where the
    land surface is heterogeneous, dominated by seed corn, corn interplanted with
    spring wheat, vegetables, orchards, and residential areas (Fig. 4b). Continuous
    single-point and simultaneous multipoint soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration
    partitioning measurements are implemented using stable isotope technology to obtain
    the temporal and spatial patterns of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration.
    A WSN composed of 50 WATERNET, 50 SoilNet, and 45 LAI measurement system nodes
    and another soil moisture measurement system are deployed to capture the heterogeneity
    of soil moisture, soil temperature, LST, and LAI (Fig. 4b). The configuration
    of the WSN has been optimized by the means of surfaces with the stratified nonhomogeneity
    method (J.-F. Wang et al. 2009; J. Kang et al. 2012, unpublished manuscript).
    Irrigation and the water balance Other components of water balance in an irrigation
    district (conceptualized in Fig. 4c) are measured, including the surface water
    irrigation that flows into and the surface return flow that drains out of the
    irrigation district, the lateral groundwater flow that seeps into and drains out
    of the irrigation district, and channel evaporation. In particular, because of
    the effects of seepage and channel evaporation, the amount of water loss accounts
    for 49% of the total amount of water in the channels, so this phenomenon cannot
    be ignored. Therefore, flow meters are installed at the entrance and terminal
    in some typical main canals, subcanals, and field ditches to observe flows in
    different levels of the channels, in association with section measurements to
    calculate the amount of water losses based on water balance method. The leakage
    pools are set up to obtain the amount of water seepage. Eventually, the water
    use efficiency of different channels can be calculated. Meanwhile, groundwater
    exploitation and spring flow are also key components in irrigation water balance.
    Water meters are performed to quantify the amount of groundwater exploited. Spring
    flows are estimated from measurements at wells. All these data support determining
    the total and segmental amount of irrigation water in the channels and different
    farmland parcels. Downstream area. In Ejin Basin, Populus euphratica and Tamarix
    are primarily distributed in the area between Erdaoqiao and Qidaoqiao, which is
    selected as the aviation area (Fig. 5). Airborne lidar is flown to acquire structure
    parameters (e.g., tree height and diameter at breast height of the typical vegetation).
    The airborne multi-angle VNIR and thermal imager are used to estimate land surface
    albedo, LST, canopy temperature, FPAR, LAI, and chlorophyll content. View Full

    Intensive ground measurements are performed in several relatively homogeneous
    plots toward Populus euphratica and Tamarix. In these plots, which are focused
    on a “standard tree” (Fig. 5c), a series of instruments, including sap flow instruments,
    Li-6400, TDRs, and tensiometers, are set up to measure the parameters related
    to multiscale eco-hydrological processes to eventually improve our understanding
    of these processes in arid regions. DATA MANAGEMENT AND SATELLITE DATA COLLECTION.
    Data management in HiWATER involves data collection, standardization, quality
    control, processing, warehousing, and release. It must achieve the following tasks
    to provide data services for HiWATER: 1) formulate observing specifications and
    standards for various observations and data and metadata formats; 2) design, plan,
    and implement data gathering and management; and 3) perform quality control and
    store data (including metadata). Various satellite remote sensing data from VNIR,
    thermal infrared, and active and passive microwave and lidar sensors are being
    collected by data sharing programs, international cooperation, and limited commercial
    purchase. Data are ordered before airborne missions and in situ measurements are
    deployed to guarantee the completion of simultaneous satellite–airborne–ground-based
    observations and corresponding calibration/validation activities. In addition,
    to run data assimilation systems, medium and low spatial resolution remote sensing
    data will be acquired on a daily basis from 2012 to 2015. The open data policy
    of HiWATER will ensure that the experimental data are timely and adequately utilized.
    However, there will be a protection period so that observers can have priority
    in using original data. After the data protection period, HiWATER data will be
    submitted to the data management and sharing platform of the Environmental and
    Ecological Science Data Center for West China (http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn/).
    EXPERIMENTAL DURATION. HiWATER is planned to last four years, from 2012 to 2015.
    Within this period, a 1-yr intensive observation will be conducted in each of
    the three KEAs. The HiWATER intensive observation period field work started in
    May 2012 from the middle stream. The persistent observations period over the whole
    river basin will continue from 2013 to 2015. Airborne missions with a manned airplane
    are mainly executed in summer 2012. Unmanned airborne missions are to be performed
    periodically in three KEAs according to the requirements. SUMMARY. This paper
    introduces the background, scientific objectives, and overall experimental design
    of HiWATER. The instrumental setting and airborne mission plans of HiWATER are
    also outlined. More detailed information regarding the implementation plan can
    be found online at http://hiwater.westgis.ac.cn. HiWATER has formally kicked off
    in May 2012, the field campaigns are currently going on, and some important data
    have been obtained. Data will be available half a year later for each experiment.
    Scientists internationally are welcomed to participate in the field campaigns
    and use the data in their analyses. As a comprehensive eco-hydrological experiment,
    HiWATER should make a difference in continental-scale hydroclimatic or hydrometeorological
    experiments. It should address the large issues that have puzzled watershed-scale
    hydrological and ecological studies for a long time, such as heterogeneity, scaling,
    uncertainty, and closing water cycle at the watershed scale. Practical utilization
    for water resource management should also be considered. Compared with WATER,
    HiWATER will be more oriented toward answering scientific questions and more organized,
    with more information integration. It will provide a test bed to testify or falsify
    new ideas on eco-hydrology and new hypotheses on scaling because it is designed
    to capture multiscale heterogeneities within a river basin with very diverse landscapes.
    Finally, HiWATER must be well coordinated, within the experiment itself and within
    the NSFC Heihe Plan, to ensure that the scientific objectives envisioned are accomplished
    and to best meet the diverse needs of interdisciplinary studies in the Heihe Plan
    and ultimately the needs of integrated eco-hydrological studies. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    ice reservoirs (AIRs), also called ice stupas, are a climate-change adaptation
    strategy developed in the Indian Himalayas (Ladakh). With this technology, otherwise
    unused stream/spring water is stored in large ice towers during the winter. The
    surplus melt water generated in spring is used to satisfy irrigation water demands.
    Recent studies have shown that, during AIR construction, over 75% of the water
    sprayed is lost. In order to reduce these water losses, different fountain scheduling
    strategies implemented on two AIRs under identical weather conditions were compared.
    In one scheduling strategy, the fountain was operated manually (non-scheduled
    fountain) whereas in another it was operated via an automation system (scheduled
    fountain). The automation system computed recommended discharge rates using real-time
    meterological input and location metadata. Scheduled fountains produced similar
    ice volume while consuming one-tenth of the water the non-scheduled fountain used.
    Simulations converting non-scheduled fountains into scheduled fountains showed
    a threefold improvement in water-use efficiency. Overall, these results show that
    automated fountain water supply management can increase water-use efficiency of
    AIRs and reduce their maintenance without compromising their meltwater production.

    engineering 1. Introduction Climate warming has resulted in retreat and thinning
    of mountain glaciers (IPCC, 2022). This has implications for water availability
    in river basins that have considerable glacierized areas in their headwaters,
    such as High Mountain Asia (HMA). Glaciers in HMA provide an important gradual
    release of water that is used by many people locally and downstream for irrigation,
    drinking water and hydropower. Climate change in this densely populated region
    may have serious consequences for glacier melt water supply to the rivers (Immerzeel
    et al., 2020). In this context, the development of water storage technologies
    is crucial to ensure continued sustenance of cryosphere-fed irrigation networks.
    These issues are particularly pronounced in arid and semiarid regions, where it
    is estimated that between 50% and 90% of freshwater resources originate from mountain
    catchments (Mukhopadhyay and Khan, 2015). Especially in the cold-arid Trans-Himalayan
    region of Ladakh, meltwater supply from the cryosphere is of utmost importance
    for irrigated agriculture in spring and summer, when water demand is highest.
    Due to the short growing period, central Ladakh is a single-cropping area with
    barley and wheat as important staples, complemented by vegetables, pulses, and
    oil seeds. Depending on the altitude, irrigation with complete flooding of fields
    starts between March and April prior to the melting of high-altitude glaciers.
    This results in increased demand during a period of reduced supply at the onset
    of the agricultural season (Nüsser et al., 2019a, Nüsser et al., 2019b). To cope
    with this recurrent water scarcity, villagers have developed artificial ice reservoirs
    (AIRs; Fig. 1a). AIRs capture water during autumn and winter, freezing and holding
    it until spring, when this water melts and flows down to irrigate the fields (IPCC,
    2019; Vince, 2009; Clouse et al., 2017; Nüsser et al., 2019a); thus retaining
    a previously unused portion of the annual flow and facilitating its use to compensate
    the decreased flow during the following spring. Over the past decade, several
    AIRs have been built to supplement the irrigation water supply of mountain villages
    in India (Wangchuk, 2020; Palmer, 2022; Aggarwal et al., 2021), Pakistan (Awaz
    Production, 2022), Kyrgyzstan (BBC News, 2020), Nepal, and Chile (Reuters, 2021).
    In total, more than 500 farmers have constructed AIRs across 30 villages in the
    Alps, Andes and HMA. Download : Download high-res image (467KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. (a) Schematic overview of artificial ice reservoirs (AIRs)
    located at altitudes between the glaciers and the irrigation networks in the cultivated
    areas; (b) ice terraces and (c) ice stupas are located at higher and lower altitudes,
    respectively. Adapted from: Nüsser and Baghel (2016). A spirit of improvisation
    guides the construction strategy of AIRs, challenging their classification. Construction
    strategies using fountain systems form AIRs which tend towards a conical shape,
    whereas other strategies form flat sheets of ice. Therefore, in the present study,
    the AIRs are classified based on whether or not fountain systems are used for
    their construction. AIRs using fountain systems are called ice stupas (Fig. 1c)
    and those without are called ice terraces (Fig. 1b). In the present work, the
    ice stupa form of AIRs are investigated. A common issue of AIR construction systems
    is fountain scheduling, namely answering the questions “when to spray?,” “how
    much?,” and “for how long?.” Starting a fountain spray too early, spraying too
    much water, or running a fountain spray for too long might lead to overwatering;
    at the very least, this practice wastes water. Similarly, starting the fountain
    spray too late, spraying too little water, or not running the system for long
    enough might lead to underwatering and can cause reduced ice volume or freeze
    the water supply pipelines. Previous work (Balasubramanian et al., 2022) has shown
    that manual construction systems suffer from overwatering. To avoid this issue,
    the energy balance model developed in Balasubramanian et al. (2022) can be used
    to regulate fountain water supply through its surface freezing rate estimations.
    Recommended discharge rates can be produced from such estimations if uncertainties
    of the fountain, meteorological and surface characteristics are resolved. However,
    some of these properties like fountain spray radius, cloudiness, albedo and AIR
    slope cannot be predicted beforehand. Additionally, discharge rates recommended
    need to be sensitive to constraints on water supply or weather conditions at the
    construction site; for example, locations limited by their water supply such as
    Ladakh, India would prioritize water-use efficiency, whereas those limited by
    the duration of their favorable weather windows such as Guttannen, Switzerland
    would prioritize maximum ice volume. Therefore, the upper and lower bound of each
    uncertain variable/parameter can be associated with two model types depending
    on their influence on the freezing rate estimation. The model type that overestimates
    freezing rates can be used to regulate fountains in locations that want higher
    ice volumes and the other model type can be used to regulate fountains in locations
    that want higher water-use efficiency. Other practical issues need to be addressed
    along with fountain scheduling processes: for example, in Indian AIRs, the fountain
    discharge rate could theoretically be halved since this is always twice as high
    as the modelled freezing rate (Balasubramanian et al., 2022). However, in practice,
    a reduction of the discharge rate could increase the maintenance cost due to a
    higher risk of freezing events in the fountain pipeline. Therefore, an optimum
    fountain operation strategy should prevent the occurrence of any freezing events
    by setting a minimum threshold for the recommended discharge rate. Adjusting fountain
    discharge rates in response to significant diurnal and seasonal variations of
    freezing rates requires the use of automation systems. Therefore, this paper describes
    such an automated construction strategy that can reduce water losses and maintenance
    requirements compared to manual construction strategies. First, two AIRs were
    built in the same location with and without automated fountain scheduling strategies;
    both were measured and compared. In a second step, differences in construction
    strategies between Indian and Swiss AIRs studied in previous winters were quantified
    using model simulations. 2. Site locations and data collection In the present
    work, data sets from Balasubramanian et al. (2022) are used along with new data
    sets. These old data sets record the meteorological conditions and fountain characteristics
    of AIRs built in Gangles, India (IN21) and Guttannen, Switzerland (CH21) during
    the winter of 2020–21. The new AIR data sets were collected in Guttannen, Switzerland
    during the winter of 2021–22 (CH22). The Guttannen site (46.66°N, 8.29°E) is situated
    in the Berne region, Switzerland at an altitude of 1047 m a.s.l. During the winter
    (Oct-Apr), mean daily minimum and maximum air temperatures vary between −13and
    15 °C. Clear skies are rare, averaging around 7 days during winter. Daily winter
    precipitation can sometimes be as high as 100 mm. These values are based on 30
    years of hourly historical weather data measurements (Meteoblue, 2021). Two AIRs
    were constructed by the Guttannen Bewegt Association, the University of Fribourg,
    and the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts during the winter of 2021–22
    using a manual and an automated construction strategy. The automated and manual
    AIRs were constructed adjacent to each other with different fountain designs,
    as shown in Fig. 2. This ensures both AIRs share water source and identical weather
    conditions. In addition, a webcam guaranteed continuous surveillance of the automated
    AIR. Download : Download high-res image (655KB) Download : Download full-size

    and automated AIRs at Guttannen. Photo: Daniel Bürki. In the AIR constructed with
    the manual strategy, tree branches were laid covering the fountain pipe to initiate
    and accelerate the ice cone formation process. In the AIR constructed with an
    automated strategy, only the fountain pipe was placed before the water spray started.
    Construction of both AIRs began on December 8, 2021 (start date) on a 0.1-m-thick
    snow bed and ended on April 12, 2022 (expiry date). In the manual AIR, the fountain
    was always operated at maximum possible discharge rate, whereas in the automated
    AIR, the fountain discharge rate was controlled using real-time weather input
    and several control parameters which could be modified via a user interface (Fig.
    3). Henceforth, the fountain used in the manual AIR is referred as non-scheduled
    fountain and the fountain used in the automated AIR is referred as scheduled fountain.

    data To calculate the surface energy balance of an AIR, the following variables
    are required: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, pressure, precipitation,
    incoming longwave radiation, shortwave radiation, and cloudiness index. The primary
    weather data source is an automatic weather station (AWS) located within 20 m
    from the AIRs. It measured all the required variables except precipitation and
    cloudiness index at an hourly resolution from November 30 to April 12, 2022. Additionally,
    ground temperature measurements at a depth of 0.3 m were also recorded by the
    AWS to obtain approximate values of the fountain water temperature. Less than
    0.4% of data was missing, and data gaps were filled by linear interpolation. The
    cloudiness index and precipitation variables were obtained from ERA5 reanalysis
    dataset (Hersbach et al., 2020) and a MeteoSwiss AWS located 184 m from the AIRs
    (Station ID: 0–0756-0-GTT), respectively. 2.2. Fountain pipeline observations
    Figure 3 presents all the attributes of the scheduled fountain pipeline system.
    Discharge rate (Q) represents the discharge rate of water measured by the flowmeter.
    Fountain height (hF) denotes the height of the fountain pole. Fountain water temperature
    (TF) is the temperature of water droplets produced by the fountain. Source water
    pressure (Psource) is the pressure of water measured at the pipeline input. Pipeline
    length and diameter (LP, diaP) denotes the dimensions of the pipeline used. Palt
    is the pressure loss due to the altitudinal difference between the pipeline input
    and fountain output. The frictional pressure losses of the pipeline are denoted
    by Pfriction. The nozzle pressure loss (PF) denotes the pressure consumed during
    the formation of water droplets. The nozzle diameter (diaF) denotes the size of
    the aperture through which water droplets are ejected. Spray radius (rF) denotes
    the radius formed by the fountain water droplets. Height was increased in steps
    of 1 m for both fountains. For the scheduled fountain, the initial height was
    3 m and was increased to 4 m on December 23. For the non-scheduled fountain, the
    initial height was 3.7 m and was increased twice—December 23 and February 12.
    Figure 4 shows the temporal variation in temperature and discharge rate for both
    the scheduled and non-scheduled fountains. The non-scheduled fountain showed variations
    in discharge rate whenever the fountain height was increased. The discharge rate
    variations of the scheduled fountain were caused by the ball valve of the automation
    system (Fig. 3). The ball valve position between 0 and 100% (or 0 to 90°) was
    regulated by the control box using real-time meteorological conditions measured
    by the AWS. Throughout the study period, the ball valve was opened completely
    (100%) only once, corresponding to the moment in time when temperature attained
    its minimum of −13° C on December 20. The ball valve was never opened beyond 34%
    thereafter. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Temperature and discharge measurements of the two fountains at the
    Guttannen construction site. The non-scheduled fountain was manually operated
    to spray all the available discharge until a fountain freezing event interrupted
    the discharge on February 17. Unfortunately, no discharge rate measurements were
    recorded for the non-scheduled fountain. However, the non-scheduled fountain presented
    a higher discharge rate compared with the scheduled fountain due to its higher
    aperture diameter (Fig. 2). Therefore, we conservatively assume the discharge
    rate of the non-scheduled fountain to be equal to the maximum discharge rate of
    the scheduled fountain, which was observed to be 13 l/min and 11 l/min at a fountain
    height of 3 m and 4 m, respectively. 2.3. Drone surveys Several photogrammetric
    surveys were conducted on the manual and the automated AIRs. The digital elevation
    models (DEMs) generated from the obtained imagery were analysed to document ice
    radius, surface area, and volume of the ice structures. Ice radius measurements
    from drone flights showed either an increase in AIR circumference or volume and
    were averaged to determine the fountain spray radius. The number of drone surveys
    conducted for the manual and the automated AIRs was 8 and 6, respectively (Table
    1). We attach a high uncertainty of ±10% for all AIR observations to accommodate
    for the uncertainties in the geodetic processing methodology described in the
    supplementary materials of Balasubramanian et al. (2022). Table 1. Summary of

    Fountain scheduling software Recommended discharge rates can be produced only
    when information about AIR surface properties and weather conditions is available.
    In particular, resolving the uncertainty in the expected freezing rate requires
    quantification of slope, albedo, and cloudiness. However, these properties cannot
    be predicted, and therefore, the upper and lower bound of each variable is associated
    with a different model depending on whether these increase the freezing rate or
    not. The equations quantifying the influence of albedo, slope and cloudiness on
    all the energy fluxes are provided in Appendix A. Higher albedo and slope values
    decrease the net shortwave radiation impact. Higher cloudiness values increase
    both the net shortwave and the longwave radiation impact. The model overestimating
    the freezing rate is hereinafter referred as ice volume optimized model (IVOM)
    and the model underestimating the freezing rate, water-use efficiency optimized
    model (WEOM). Accordingly, the values assigned for all three variables in each
    model are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Assumptions for the parametrization introduced
    to simplify the ice volume optimized model (IVOM) and the water-use efficiency
    optimized model (WEOM). αsnow/ice represents albedo of snow or ice. Estimation
    of Symbol IVOM WEOM Slope scone 1 0 Albedo α αsnow αice Cloudiness cld 0 1 The
    discharge scheduling software implements two types of fountain scheduling strategies
    depending on which model type is suitable. The WEOM model type is used when the
    location presents limited water quantity, as this is expected to produce better
    water-use efficiency. The IVOM model type is used when the location presents limited
    duration of favorable weather windows, as this is expected to produce higher ice
    volume. These two types of scheduled fountains are hereafter referred as water-sensitive
    fountain and weather-sensitive fountain, respectively. The assumptions described
    in Table 2 are applied on the one-dimensional description of energy fluxes as
    used in Balasubramanian et al. (2022) to obtain the rate of change of AIR ice
    mass as follows: (1) Upward and downward fluxes relative to the ice surface are
    positive and negative, respectively. The first term represents the mass change
    rate due to freezing of the fountain water and melting of the ice. qSW is the
    net shortwave radiation; qLW is the net longwave radiation; qL and qS are the
    turbulent latent and sensible heat fluxes, respectively; qF is the fountain discharge
    heat flux; qR is the rain water heat flux; qG is the bulk heat flux between the
    AIR surface and its interior; qT is the heat flux accounting for surface temperature
    fluctuations, and Acone is the area of the AIR surface. LF and LV represent latent
    heat of fusion and vaporization, respectively. The derivation of these individual
    terms for the IVOM and WEOM model versions are discussed in Appendix A. Eq. 1
    is implemented in the automation software. The user interface of the software
    enables input of the spray radius, altitude, latitude, and longitude of the construction
    location. The automation hardware consists of an AWS, control box, flowmeter,
    ball valve, drain valves, air valves, fountain and a pipeline (Fig. 3). The control
    box feeds the AWS data to the automation software to obtain the recommended discharge
    rate. Then, to match this recommendation, it adjusts the ball valve position based
    on the information from the flowmeter. In case a termination criterion gets met,
    the drain and air valves are opened to allow removal of water and entry of air
    in the pipeline, respectively. The recommended discharge rate is equal to the
    mass change rate. However, these termination criteria override the discharge rate
    recommendation and drain the pipeline to prevent water loss or fountain freezing
    events: – High water loss is assumed when wind speed is greater than user-defined
    critical wind speed. – High risk of fountain freezing is assumed when mass change
    rate is lower than user-defined minimum fountain discharge rate. – Freezing events
    in fountain pipeline are assumed when measured discharge rate equals zero for
    at least 20 s. – Pipeline leakage is assumed when measured discharge rate is greater
    than user-defined maximum fountain discharge rate. 3.2. Modelling fountain spray
    radius Fountain spray radius is defined as the largest horizontal distance covered
    by fountain water droplets. This can be determined by modelling the trajectory
    of these droplets using the projectile motion equation. This projectile motion
    starts at the fountain nozzle and ends at the AIR surface. To obtain the droplets
    speed (v), the measured aperture diameter (dia = 0.001 m) and discharge rate of
    the scheduled fountain is used with the following equation: (2) where v is the
    droplet speed in m/s and Q is the discharge rate of the fountain in l/min. To
    obtain the spray radius (rF), the optimum launch angle θ = 45 is used in the projectile
    motion equation to get: (3) The influence of wind-driven redistribution can be
    included in the spray radius by multiplying wind speed by time of flight of water
    droplets. 3.3. Determination of pressure losses The fountain pipeline system delivering
    water to the ice stupa suffers several pressure losses, which limit the maximum
    height that the fountain can achieve. These lossses can be (a) altitudinal (Palt),
    (b) frictional (Pfriction), and (c) nozzle (PF) losses as illustrated in Fig.
    3. The altitudinal losses depend on the altitude difference between the source
    and the fountain. The frictional losses are proportional to the length of the
    pipeline and inversely proportional to their diameter. The nozzle losses depend
    on the engineering design of the fountain nozzle. All the pressure variables are
    measured in bars. Pressure losses can be determined using the Bernoulli equation
    as follows: (4) The frictional loss of the pipeline used in the experiment can
    be determined using the Hagen–Poiseuille equation (Batchelor, 2000): (5) where
    LP is measured in meters. Note that the above equation only applies for laminar
    flow, the one investigated in the present work. 3.4. Model updates The present
    study focuses on the integration of fountain scheduling processes with the AIR
    model (Balasubramanian et al., 2022). For details on model internals and calculation
    of surface processes, please refer to the respective literature references. In
    the previous version of the model (Balasubramanian et al., 2022), fountain water
    droplet temperature (TF) was estimated as a constant parameter. However, in reality,
    this is a poor approximation because it does not account for two processes, namely
    temperature fluctuations during transit from the source to the fountain nozzle
    or temperature fluctuations during the flight time of water droplets after leaving
    the fountain nozzle. Therefore, the first process is approximated with hourly
    ground temperature values. To approximate the second process, the water temperature
    is assumed to cool down to 0  C during subzero air temperature conditions. In
    the previous version of the model (Balasubramanian et al., 2022), fountain discharge
    events were reset from surface albedo to ice albedo. However, this assumption
    limits the accuracy of the model, especially for the automated AIR, where several
    fountain discharge events of short duration occur. Therefore, the discharge events
    are assumed to reduce the albedo decay rate (τ) by a factor of . Additionally,
    both AIRs experienced numerous precipitation events. Therefore, instead of assuming
    AIR density (ρcone) to be equal to ice density—which was no longer accurate—the
    density parametrization was changed as follows: (6) where MF is the cumulative
    mass of the fountain discharge, Mppt is the cumulative precipitation, Mdep is
    the cumulative accumulation through water vapour deposition, ρice is the ice density
    (917 kg m−3), and ρsnow is the density of wet snow (300 kg m−3) taken from Cuffey
    and Paterson (2010). Rain events were not considered in the previous version of
    the model, but these occurred in this experiment. The influence of rain events
    on the albedo and the energy balance was assumed to be similar to the discharge
    events. However, the water temperature of a rain event was assumed to be equal
    to the air temperature; accordingly, the rain water heat flux (qR) generated due
    to a rain event was equal to: (7) where Mppt is the hourly precipitation in meters,
    cwater is the specific heat of water, and Acone is the surface area. 3.5. Calibration
    The model parameters were calibrated to the mean values of the ranges presented
    in Appendix Table A1. However, the surface layer thickness parameter was calibrated
    to a value of 0.09 m for the automated AIR instead of the default value of 0.05
    m. This calibration was necessary to prevent hourly surface temperature fluctuations
    from assuming unphysical values above 40° C. The validation of the model for the
    manual and automated AIRs were evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE)
    between volume estimates and measurements. Performance of the IVOM and WEOM versions
    of the physical model were assessed by comparing the correlation of its discharge
    rate estimates with the validated freezing rates of the manual AIR. 4. Results
    4.1. Model validation The volume estimation for the automated and manual AIRs
    showed an RMSE of 8 m3 and 6 m3, respectively, with the drone volume observations.
    These are within 13% and 11% of the maximum volume of the automated and the manual
    AIR, respectively. The estimated and measured AIR volumes are shown in Fig. 5.

    influence of the two different fountain scheduling strategies in the mass and
    energy balance of their respective AIRs. The overall impact of the radiation fluxes—longwave
    and shortwave—and the turbulent fluxes—sensible and latent—on the freezing and
    melting energies is determined by their energy turnover, which is calculated as
    the sum of energy fluxes in absolute values (Table 3). Table 3. Summary of the

    discharge input and fountain spillwater output by an order of magnitude. However,
    this does not result in an appreciable difference in the volume evolution of the
    automated or manual AIR, as shown in Fig. 5. This is due to two counteracting
    surface processes during fountain spray: process A consists in the dampening of
    albedo to ice albedo and process B consists in the absorption of heat energy from
    the fountain water droplets. The temporal variation of the magnitude of these
    processes is shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (290KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 6. (a) Surface albedo and (b) fountain discharge
    heat flux (qF) showed considerable variations between the two AIRs due to differences
    in their discharge rates. A considerable difference exists in the contribution
    of the shortwave radiation due to process A. Although the non-scheduled fountain
    was active for a longer duration, frequent snowfall events counteracted the albedo
    feedback of the fountain discharge. In contrast, the albedo of the automated AIR
    was reduced by late fountain spray events, in particular in March and April, as
    shown in Fig. 6. These poorly timed fountain spray events occurred because of
    the global solar radiation diurnal variation, since these were calibrated based
    on values for February in the automation system. Therefore, poor calibration of
    the automation system resulted in an increased impact of shortwave radiation on
    the automated AIR. Similarly, the fountain discharge heat flux for the manual
    AIR was enhanced due to process B. The higher discharge value of the non-scheduled
    fountain and its longer duration are responsible for the higher contribution of
    fountain discharge heat flux in the overall energy turnover. Therefore, higher
    melt of the automated AIR due to process A counteracted the higher melt of the
    manual AIR due to process B. 4.3. Benefits of scheduling fountains The difference
    in water-use efficiency and maximum ice volume between non-scheduled and scheduled
    fountains in the Indian and Swiss locations across two winters is shown in Fig.
    7a. Four experimental values (highlighted in circles) and five simulated values
    (highlighted in squares) are shown together. The experimental values were taken
    from the IN21 and CH21 AIRs studied in Balasubramanian et al. (2022) and the CH22
    AIR investigated in the present work. Download : Download high-res image (606KB)

    efficiency estimated for AIRs constructed in different locations (represented

    Experimental values are highlighted in circles and simulated values are highlighted
    in squares. (b) Comparison of the non-scheduled and scheduled fountain discharge
    rates at the IN21 location. The water-use efficiency of all the non-scheduled
    fountains is below 20%. In general, water-use efficiency exhibits a threefold
    increase when the weather- or water-sensitive fountains are used in both locations.
    For the Indian location, the three different kinds of fountains yielded significantly
    different results owing to discharge duration and maximum discharge rate (Fig.
    7b). The non-scheduled fountain showed a maximum discharge rate more than twice
    that of the scheduled fountains, resulting in higher water loss; freezing events
    in its pipeline caused frequent interruptions in the non-scheduled discharge rate
    (Fig. 7b). In contrast, the mean freezing rates of the other two fountains during
    these events were above their median values. This is because very cold temperatures
    freeze the water inside rather than outside the fountain system, instigating these
    freezing events in the fountain pipeline. Therefore, the discharge duration of
    the non-scheduled fountain was much lower, resulting in lower ice volume. The
    water-sensitive fountain underestimated the freezing rate during the construction
    period and therefore produced much lower ice volume compared with the weather-sensitive
    fountain. For the Swiss locations, scheduled fountains yielded better water-use
    efficiency but did not significantly alter the maximum volume obtained. The maximum
    volume and the water-use efficiency of the scheduled fountain used in the CH22
    experiment was similar but not equal to the simulated values produced from the
    IVOM model (Fig. 7a). This was because the IVOM model was approximated with linear
    and gaussian equations due to the limitations of the fountain scheduling software
    implemented in the automation system. 4.4. Performance of weather- and water-sensitive
    fountains The WEOM and IVOM model versions estimated the freezing rate of the
    non-scheduled fountain with an RMSE less than 0.8 l/min and 1.8 l/min, respectively,
    and a correlation of 0.4. The discharge rate values of the weather-sensitive fountain
    overestimated the freezing rate 93% of the fountain spray duration, whereas those
    of the water-sensitive fountain overestimated the freezing rate 70% of the non-scheduled
    fountain spray duration, as illustrated by Fig. 8. Therefore, the IVOM model version
    was successful in prioritizing the maximum ice volume by overestimating the discharge
    rates, but the WEOM model version could not sufficiently underestimate its discharge
    rate values to optimize water-use efficiency. Download : Download high-res image

    rate estimated for the non-scheduled fountain and the discharge rate of the scheduled
    fountains. However, for the Indian location, considerable differences can be observed
    among the three kinds of fountains. The modelled weather- and water-sensitive
    discharge rate values were a factor of two and three smaller, respectively, than
    the measured non-scheduled discharge rate (Fig. 7b). 4.5. Pressure losses Pressure
    consumption across the fountain pipeline provides insights into how it can be
    better optimized. The pipeline configuration of the automated ice stupa fountain
    is presented in Table 4. Pressure drops due to frictional losses across the length
    of the pipeline and due to the design of the fountain nozzle. Maximum frictional
    loss occurs during maximum discharge, which was measured to be 11 l/min. By substituting
    the corresponding values in Eq. 5, we get Pfriction to be 0.3 bar. The speed v
    can be determined from the discharge rate observation using Eq. 3. Therefore,
    from Eq. 4, PF was estimated to be 4.6 bar, which represents more than 75% of

    spray radius The estimated volume changes during the month of January of the Swiss
    AIRs built in the winter of 2021–22 is less than half that of the AIRs from the
    previous winter (CH21). This difference cannot respond to warmer temperatures
    during the CH22 winter, as the median January temperature of CH22 winter was colder
    than that of the CH21 winter (Fig. 9a). Moreover, the volume growth of CH20 AIR
    is 6 times that of the CH22 AIR, despite CH20 winter being 3 C warmer. Download

    (a) Estimated volume change and temperature. (b) Observed spray radius and wind
    speed during January for AIRs built across three winters. We suspect the primary
    driver of volume difference across different winters to be the spray radius (Fig.
    9b). However, this observation contradicts our expectation that AIRs using the
    same water source and fountain designs would present similar spray radius. Moreover,
    manual measurements of the fountain spray radius were lower than the drone observations
    of the ice radius. These two observations imply that wind drift of water droplets
    could play a major role in temporal fluctuations of ice radius. To validate this
    hypothesis, the projectile motion of scheduled fountain water droplets were modelled
    with wind speed values taken from CH22 and CH21 experiments. Fig. 10 shows the
    modelled spray radius produced using these two wind datasets and compares them
    with the measured spray radius values. As illustrated, wind speed drives the temporal
    variation in the spray radius. Moreover, the spray radius of the scheduled fountain
    is much higher with CH22 wind values than with those of CH21. Therefore, the determination
    of the fountain spray radius cannot be performed using the characteristics of
    the fountain nozzle alone, as this is strongly influenced by the temporal variation
    of the wind speed. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download : Download

    5.1. Recommendations and challenges to improve AIR hardware tools The present
    study shows one strategy that can improve the water-use efficiency of AIRs. We
    chose this strategy because it enables the use of the AIR model in a simple and
    effective manner. However, all these construction strategies are limited by the
    tools they use, namely the fountain, the pipeline and the automation system as
    described below: 5.1.1. Fountain optimisation Contrary to the model assumptions,
    the parameters used to define the fountain were not independent. The fountain
    height, aperture diameter, discharge rate, water temperature and spray radius
    were related through the trajectories of the water droplets. The fountain nozzle
    design is crucial for increasing the ice volume obtained. It determines the diameter
    of the water droplets and the angle of launch for their projectile motion. The
    choice of these two parameters determines the rate of nuclueation process, pressure
    losses and discharge rate ranges. For example, during the IN21 experiment, snow
    formation was observed, indicating that the fountain water droplets have the potential
    to freeze before deposition on the AIR surface. In the CH22 experiment, the higher
    aperture diameter of the non-scheduled fountain nozzle (Fig. 2) produced bigger
    droplets and, therefore, had a lower fountain pressure loss when compared to the
    scheduled fountain. However, fountains with large aperture diameters lose their
    ability to form water droplets at low discharge rates. Therefore, the scheduled
    fountain nozzle design was used since it was able to produce water droplets with
    discharge rates as low as 2 l/min. However, no methodology currently exists to
    rank the different fountain nozzles used for construction. Quantifying processes
    influenced by the fountain nozzle is challenging as it would require modelling
    the conduction, convection, wind redistribution, and nucleation processes that
    droplets of varying diameters undergo during their flight time. Instead, controlled
    experiments comparing the freezing rates between different fountain diameters
    have a better chance to yield insights on the engineering design of fountain nozzles.
    5.1.2. Pipeline optimisation An ideal pipeline configuration could make this technology
    cheaper and maintenance free. However, optimization of the pipeline material and
    diameters is yet to be performed—despite the time lost on pipeline freezing events
    and the potential cost reduction with cheaper pipeline materials and sizes. Larger
    pipeline diameters reduce the occurence of pipeline freezing events but increase
    the cost dramatically. In Ladakh, pipeline diameters used have a wide range (from
    0.03 to 0.3 m) since the choice of pipeline diameter also depends on the additional
    insulation provided and whether or not it is buried. Therefore, a comprehensive
    cost-benefit analysis of different combinations of insulation and pipeline materials
    is required to determine the optimum design of the insulated pipeline system.
    5.1.3. Cost reduction of automation system Our strategy is not yet suitable for
    application in current AIR construction sites due to the cost of the automation
    system (around 8000 USD). However, we believe upto 10 fold cost reduction is possible
    through simpler automation systems which control only the duration of fountain
    spray and not their quantity. 5.2. New ways to upscale irrigation water supply
    In this section, two hypothetical ice stupa construction scenarios namely, present
    and future are described. The present scenario is a depiction of the construction
    efforts based on oral interviews and field experience. The future scenario is
    a depiction of how the automation system developed can transform current construction
    efforts. The objective of both the scenarios is to maximize the meltwater available
    for irrigation. Both these scenarios are motivated by the construction campaigns
    conducted in the Gangles valley of Ladakh during the winter of 2019/20 (Fig. 11).
    This is the same valley where the IN21 study site was located enabling us to extrapolate
    some of the freezing rates and ice volume estimations from Balasubramanian et
    al. (2022). We conservatively assume that the valley had a total water supply
    of around 120 l/min, a winter duration of 4 months and the fountain was operational
    for only 8 h per day for both the scenarios. Download : Download high-res image
    (543KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. More than a month of effort
    from a dozen farmers were required to build five ice stupas across the Gangles
    valley in the winter of 2019/20. This research provides tools that two farmers
    can leverage to guarantee two times more winter water storage and reduce maintenance
    requirements to just a few days. 5.2.1. Present scenario In the present scenario,
    only two fountains could be operated simultaneously using the available water
    supply. This limited the construction period of each ice stupa to just two months.
    Moreover, pipelines froze inside with ice blocks every few nights (Fig. 7b). This
    resulted in two farmers investing more than two months removing ice blocks and
    repairing the fountain pipeline system to make four ice stupas. Assuming each
    ice stupa had a maximum ice volume similar to IN21, we expect the total ice volumes
    frozen in this valley to be around 3 million litres. 5.2.2. Future scenario In
    the future scenario, the automation system reduces the water consumption of each
    ice stupa by half. This enabled two farmers to build eight ice stupas spending
    less than a week of effort since there were no pipeline freezing events to deal
    with. The total ice volumes frozen, however, resulted in more than two times higher
    irrigation water supply from mid-April to mid-June. 6. Conclusions An automated
    AIR construction strategy was compared with a manual one using data collected
    in Guttannen, Switzerland and Gangles, India. The main purpose of the present
    study is to quantify the influence of different fountain scheduling strategies
    on the water-use efficiency and ice volume of AIRs exposed to identical weather
    conditions. It was found that overwatering by non-scheduled fountains not only
    increased the fountain spillwater production but also enhanced the melting rate
    of AIRs, mainly due to surface albedo and fountain heat flux feedbacks. Scheduled
    fountains, in contrast, consumed only 13% of the non-scheduled fountain water
    supply. However, volume evolution of both AIRs showed no significant variations.
    Two different model forcing strategies were used to recommend two types of scheduled
    discharge rates: limited weather windows to favor higher ice volume and water
    supply to favor water-use efficiency. These model versions were able to capture
    more than 44% of the freezing rate variations of the manual AIR. Simulations converting
    non-scheduled fountains of Swiss and Indian locations to scheduled ones showed
    that at least a threefold increase in water-use efficiency is possible without
    compromising meltwater production. The influence of wind-driven redistribution
    on the spray radius resulted in AIRs six times larger, despite 3°C higher temperatures.
    This implies that higher wind speed caused the volume differences in the AIRs
    constructed at the Swiss location through three consecutive winters. Future selection
    of construction locations and design of automation algorithms need to capitalize
    on wind-driven redistribution effects to further increase water-use efficiency.
    Fountain nozzles play an important role in the construction process. First, these
    consume most of the input water pressure to form water droplets. Second, their
    engineering design determines the droplet size distribution and spray radius.
    Future research, therefore, must be devoted to engineer fountain nozzles able
    to create water droplets with a size distribution that consumes less energy and
    a trajectory that increases the spray radius. Funding This work was supported

    Appendix A. Model forcing based on water-use efficiency and maximum ice volume
    objectives To reduce model complexity and data requirement (Balasubramanian et
    al., 2022), assumptions that optimize ice volume (IVOM) or water-use efficiency
    (WEOM) were used. The freezing rate and melting rate were defined as the positive
    and negative mass change rate, respectively. The assumptions chosen were based
    on whether these overestimate or underestimate the freezing rate. IVOM assumptions
    overestimate freezing rate, whereas WEOM assumptions underestimate freezing rate.
    The application of these two kinds of assumptions on each energy balance component
    are described below. A.1. Surface area Acone assumptions Determination of surface
    area during the accumulation period is achieved by assuming a constant ice cone
    radius equal to the fountain spray radius. The surface area scales the freezing
    rate of the AIR. Hence, for the IVOM version, the maximum possible slope was assumed
    to be 1 for the ice cone. Therefore, area is estimated as: (A1) Similarly, for
    the water-use efficiency objective, the area of the conical AIR is approximated
    to the area of its circular base. Therefore, area is estimated as: (A2) A.2. Net
    shortwave radiation qSWLg assumptions The net shortwave radiation qSW is computed
    as follows: (A3) where α is the albedo value, SWdirect is the direct shortwave
    radiation, SWdiffuse is the diffuse shortwave radiation, and fcone is the solar
    area fraction. The data requirement was reduced by estimating the global shortwave
    radiation and pressure using directly the location''s coordinates and altitude
    through the solar radiation model described in Holmgren et al. (2018). The algorithm
    used to estimate the clear-sky global radiation is described in Ineichen (2008).
    The diffuse and direct shortwave radiation are determined using the estimated
    global solar radiation as follows: (A4) where cld is the cloudiness factor. cld
    is assumed to be 1 and 0 for the water-use efficiency and ice volume objective,
    respectively. The variations in the albedo were ignored and it was assumed to
    be equal to snow albedo and ice albedo for the ice volume and water-use efficiency
    objective, respectively. The solar area fraction fcone of the ice structure exposed
    to the direct shortwave radiation depends on the shape considered and is computed
    as: (A5) For the ice volume objective, the slope of the cone was assumed to be
    1; fcone is determined as follows: (A6) Similarly, for the water-use efficiency
    objective, the slope of the cone was assumed to be negligible. (A7) A.3. Net longwave
    radiation qLWLg assumptions To determine outgoing longwave radiation, Tice = 0∘C
    was assumed. To constrain the minimum ice temperature is challenging; therefore,
    this assumption was maintained for both our objectives. However, to estimate atmospheric
    emissivity, cld was assumed to be 1 and 0 for the water-use efficiency and ice
    volume objective, respectively. A.4. Turbulent fluxes assumptions Turbulent fluxes
    estimation depends on the slope of the cone through the μcone parameter. As suggested
    by Oerlemans et al. (2021), this parameter was estimated as follows: (A8) Hence,
    the μcone parameter takes values of 1.5 and 1 for the ice volume and water-use
    efficiency objective, respectively. Since turbulent fluxes impact both the freezing
    and the melting rates, this assumption may not favor the corresponding objectives
    for certain sites. Table A1. Parameters in the model categorized as constant,
    model hyperparameters, and weather parameters with their respective values/ranges.

    \ May 2011\nAbstract. In situ measurements of soil moisture are invalu-\nable\
    \ for calibrating and validating land surface models and\nsatellite-based soil\
    \ moisture retrievals.\nIn addition, long-\nterm time series of in situ soil moisture\
    \ measurements them-\nselves can reveal trends in the water cycle related to cli-\n\
    mate or land cover change. Nevertheless, on a worldwide\nbasis the number of meteorological\
    \ networks and stations\nmeasuring soil moisture, in particular on a continuous\
    \ ba-\nsis, is still limited and the data they provide lack standardiza-\ntion\
    \ of technique and protocol. To overcome many of these\nlimitations, the International\
    \ Soil Moisture Network (ISMN;\nhttp://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu) was initiated\
    \ to serve as\na centralized data hosting facility where globally available\n\
    in situ soil moisture measurements from operational net-\nworks and validation\
    \ campaigns are collected, harmonized,\nand made available to users. Data collecting\
    \ networks share\ntheir soil moisture datasets with the ISMN on a voluntary\n\
    and no-cost basis.\nIncoming soil moisture data are auto-\nmatically transformed\
    \ into common volumetric soil moisture\nunits and checked for outliers and implausible\
    \ values. Apart\nfrom soil water measurements from different depths, impor-\n\
    tant metadata and meteorological variables (e.g., precipita-\ntion and soil temperature)\
    \ are stored in the database. These\nwill assist the user in correctly interpreting\
    \ the soil moisture\ndata. The database is queried through a graphical user in-\n\
    terface while output of data selected for download is pro-\nvided according to\
    \ common standards for data and metadata.\nCorrespondence to: W. A. Dorigo\n(wd@ipf.tuwien.ac.at)\n\
    Currently (status May 2011), the ISMN contains data of 19\nnetworks and more than\
    \ 500 stations located in North Amer-\nica, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The time\
    \ period spanned\nby the entire database runs from 1952 until the present, al-\n\
    though most datasets have originated during the last decade.\nThe database is\
    \ rapidly expanding, which means that both\nthe number of stations and the time\
    \ period covered by the\nexisting stations are still growing. Hence, it will become\
    \ an\nincreasingly important resource for validating and improving\nsatellite-derived\
    \ soil moisture products and studying climate\nrelated trends. As the ISMN is\
    \ animated by the scientiﬁc\ncommunity itself, we invite potential networks to\
    \ enrich the\ncollection by sharing their in situ soil moisture data.\n1\nIntroduction\n\
    Across many landscapes, soil moisture and its freeze/thaw\nstate control evapotranspiration,\
    \ thus providing the link be-\ntween terrestrial and atmospheric water, energy,\
    \ and carbon\ncycles (Robock et al., 2000). In addition, surface soil mois-\n\
    ture is a determinant of the partitioning of surface precipita-\ntion into inﬁltration\
    \ and runoff. The availability of better spa-\ntial estimates of surface soil\
    \ moisture conditions can there-\nfore help to improve forecasting of precipitation,\
    \ droughts\nand ﬂoods as well as climate projections and predictions\n(Dirmeyer\
    \ et al., 2006).\nIt will also contribute to further\nthe development of other\
    \ hydrological applications that can\nsupport water managers and water resource\
    \ decision-makers.\nThe importance of soil moisture in the global climate system\n\
    Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n\
    1676\nW. A. Dorigo et al.: The International Soil Moisture Network\nhas recently\
    \ been underlined by the Global Climate Observ-\ning System (GCOS) by endorsing\
    \ soil moisture as an Essen-\ntial Climate Variable1.\nThe value of soil moisture\
    \ for various applications is re-\nﬂected by the large number of satellite-based\
    \ soil moisture\nproducts that have emerged during the last decade. Only in\n\
    2000, Robock et al. (2000, p. 1298) concluded their paper\nstating: “There are\
    \ no existing global soil moisture datasets\nmeasured from remote sensing”. Today,\
    \ a wide variety of op-\nerational global soil moisture products are available\
    \ for ex-\nisting microwave sensors such as AMSR-E (Jackson, 1993;\nNjoku et al.,\
    \ 2003; Koike et al., 2004; Owe et al., 2008),\nTRMM-TMI (Owe et al., 2008), SSM/I\
    \ (Owe et al., 2008),\nWindSat (Li et al., 2010), ERS 1 and 2 (Wagner et al.,\
    \ 1999;\nScipal et al., 2002), and ASCAT (Naeimi et al., 2009). In ad-\ndition,\
    \ special missions dedicated to soil moisture either have\nbeen recently launched,\
    \ i.e. the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity Mission (SMOS) of the European Space\
    \ Agency\n(ESA; Kerr et al., 2001; Wigneron et al., 2007), or are sched-\nuled\
    \ for the near future, such as the Soil Moisture Active\n& Passive (SMAP) mission\
    \ of the United States National\nAerospace Space Administration (NASA; Entekhabi\
    \ et al.,\n2010a).\nIn addition, global soil moisture products based\non land\
    \ surface models are being made available routinely\nthrough operational forecast\
    \ systems, e.g. from the European\nCentre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (Drusch\
    \ and\nViterbo, 2007), re-analyses (Uppala et al., 2005; Simmons et\nal., 2007)\
    \ or the soil moisture ﬁelds provided by the Global\nLand Surface Data Assimilation\
    \ System (Rodell et al., 2004)\nand the Global Soil Wetness Project (Dirmeyer\
    \ et al., 1999).\nTo calibrate and validate such satellite- and model-based\n\
    soil moisture estimates, in situ measurements are an indis-\npensable source of\
    \ information (e.g. Ceballos et al., 2005;\nWagner et al., 2007; Balsamo et al.,\
    \ 2009; Gruhier et al.,\n2010; Jackson et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011).\nMoreover,\n\
    in situ soil moisture measurements provide information that\nfacilitates the study\
    \ of the spatial and temporal variability\nof soil moisture at different scales\
    \ (Famiglietti et al., 1999;\nEntin et al., 2000; Brocca et al., 2007), the exchange\
    \ of water\nbetween different layers within the soil column or between\nthe land\
    \ surface and the atmosphere (Mahfouf and Noilhan,\n1991; Chen and Hu, 2004; Albergel\
    \ et al., 2008), and climate\nrelated trends in soil moisture (Robock et al.,\
    \ 2005).\nSince the early 1980s, several dedicated soil moisture ﬁeld\ncampaigns\
    \ in the US, Europe, and Australia have resulted in\nboth short term and long\
    \ term soil moisture datasets. Most\nof these campaigns were designed for satellite\
    \ validation pur-\nposes. Of great historical importance were the soil moisture\n\
    ﬁeld experiments performed at the Beltsville Agricultural\nResearch Center (BARC)\
    \ where for one the ﬁrst times remote\nsensing measurements were coupled with\
    \ ﬁeld observations\n(Wang et al., 1980). Being one of the ﬁrst datasets publicly\n\
    available, the BARC datasets triggered many researchers to\n1http://gosic.org/ios/MATRICES/ECV/ECV-Introduction.htm\n\
    study the ability of retrieving soil moisture from space obser-\nvations. Other\
    \ historically important experiments include the\nBotswana experiment (Van De\
    \ Griend et al., 1989), HAPEX-\nSahel (Prince et al., 1995), EFEDA (Braud et al.,\
    \ 1993), FIFE\n(Peck and Hope, 1995), and the soil moisture experiments\ncoordinated\
    \ by the United States Department of Agriculture\n(e.g. Jackson et al., 2002).\n\
    The importance of soil moisture has been growing in im-\nportance also in the\
    \ meteorological and hydrological com-\nmunities and as a result several networks\
    \ now measure soil\nmoisture as a routine observation (e.g. Beyrich and Adam,\n\
    2007; Calvet et al., 2008) . Nevertheless, on a global basis\nthe number of long-term\
    \ in situ monitoring networks is still\nsmall and mostly restricted to mid-latitude\
    \ regions. Only few\nmeasurements are being made in Africa and South America.\n\
    Complicating the easy utilization of network data is the lack\nof a standard measurement\
    \ technique and a standard mea-\nsurement protocol (Robock et al., 2000). Also,\
    \ the fact that\nthe various datasets are managed by a large number of dif-\n\
    ferent organizations makes clear that global studies incorpo-\nrating in situ\
    \ soil moisture measurements are tedious to per-\nform.\nActions to collect data\
    \ from several networks and to offer a\ncentralized portal for dissemination are\
    \ basically conﬁned to\nthe historical Global Soil Moisture Data Bank previously\
    \ ex-\nisting at Rutgers University, NJ (Robock et al., 2000, 2005).\nThis data\
    \ archive provided data and metadata for various his-\ntorical and operative networks\
    \ around the globe. The dozens\nof scientiﬁc publications relying on its datasets\
    \ have afﬁrmed\nthe importance of this dissemination platform. Although the\n\
    Global Soil Moisture Data Bank was a good starting point for\nglobal validation\
    \ efforts, the last update of the data base oc-\ncurred in 2005 which made it\
    \ unusable for the most recent\nand upcoming satellite-based soil moisture products\
    \ listed\nabove. In addition, the observations of the various networks\nin the\
    \ Global Soil Moisture Data Bank were not harmonized\nin terms of measurement\
    \ units. They were presented either\nas plant-available volumetric or as total\
    \ volumetric soil mois-\nture in cm or percent for a given soil layer depth. Hence,\
    \ the\nsoil water units needed to be carefully checked before per-\nforming a\
    \ comparison.\nThe need for intensiﬁed international cooperation in estab-\nlishing\
    \ new monitoring networks and constructing central-\nized and harmonized global\
    \ soil moisture datasets has been\nbroadly recognized by the international community\
    \ (Grabs\nand Thomas, 2002; Jackson et al., 2005). Hence, in 2006\nthe International\
    \ Soil Moisture Working Group (ISMWG)\nwas established to facilitate the creation\
    \ of multi-source soil\nmoisture datasets, including in situ observations. The\
    \ de-\nvelopment of these datasets and an in situ soil moisture net-\nwork was\
    \ consequently included in the Group on Earth Ob-\nservation (GEO) 2009–2011 Work\
    \ Plan under sub-task WA-\n08-01a lead by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Exper-\n\
    iment (GEWEX) and ESA. Its implementation is coordi-\nnated through the ISMWG\
    \ under auspices of GEWEX. The\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\n\

    \ Soil Moisture Network\n1677\nlaunch of SMOS in November 2009 has given a strong\
    \ im-\npulse to the establishment of a centralized data hosting fa-\ncility for\
    \ in situ soil moisture measurements in support of a\nreliable calibration and\
    \ validation of the mission soil mois-\nture products. It was recognized that\
    \ an integrated system\nwas needed to host quality-controlled and harmonized soil\n\

    \ and networks. For this reason, ESA\nhas supported the development and ﬁrst phase\
    \ of operation\nof a data hosting facility called the International Soil Mois-\n\
    ture Network (Dorigo et al., 2011). The International Soil\nMoisture Network (ISMN)\
    \ has been implemented by the Vi-\nenna University of Technology and provides\
    \ no-cost access\nto its datasets for all users.\nThis article gives an overview\
    \ of the ISMN, which can be\naccessed through http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu.\
    \ To put\nthe structure of the system and the data manipulations per-\nformed\
    \ within the system into a clearer context, the article\nstarts with an overview\
    \ of soil moisture deﬁnitions and the\nmeasurement techniques and instruments\
    \ commonly used to\nmeasure soil moisture in situ (Sect. 2). Section 3 provides\n\
    an overview of the technical design and implementation of\nthe ISMN, and the methods\
    \ used for harmonizing the soil\nmoisture datasets. Section 4 summarizes the datasets\
    \ cur-\nrently contained in the database. Even though the number of\nnetworks\
    \ and stations are still rapidly increasing (visit http:\n//www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu/index.php/news.html\
    \ for news\non recent updates), this section intends to provide insight in\nthe\
    \ diversity of the datasets that are considered for integra-\ntion in the ISMN.\
    \ Section 5 discusses the possible outreach\nof the ISMN and some issues that\
    \ should be taken into con-\nsideration if in situ soil moisture data are used\
    \ for calibration\nand validation of remote sensing products and land surface\n\
    models. Section 6 concludes this paper by looking into the\nfuture and outlining\
    \ some prerequisites for a successful con-\ntinuation of the ISMN.\n2\nMeasuring\
    \ in situ soil moisture\n2.1\nSoil moisture deﬁnitions and units\nSoil moisture\
    \ (2) is usually deﬁned as the water present\nin the unsaturated part of the soil\
    \ proﬁle, i.e., between the\nsoil surface and the ground water level and can be\
    \ expressed\nin different units (e.g. Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Hillel,\n1998;\
    \ Robock et al., 2000; Seneviratne et al., 2010). An\nunderstanding of the different\
    \ deﬁnitions is crucial for ho-\nmogenization of the soil moisture measurements.\
    \ The most\ncommon deﬁnition of soil moisture is volumetric soil mois-\nture.\
    \ It is either expressed as the volumetric fraction of water\nin a given soil\
    \ depth [m3 water per m3 soil] or as the depth of\na column of water contained\
    \ in a given depth of soil [mm wa-\nter per mm soil]. The volumetric fraction\
    \ [m3 m−3] is most\nwidespread in earth observation. Therefore, this is also the\n\
    unit adopted in the ISMN. Datasets that are provided in other\nunits will be converted\
    \ to this unit (Sect. 3.3.2). Some other\nrelevant descriptors are presented below.\n\
    Soil moisture can also be expressed as fraction of satura-\ntion. A fraction of\
    \ the soil, typically less than 0.5, consists\nof pores that can be ﬁlled with\
    \ air or water. This fraction is\ncalled the porosity (P). If this fraction were\
    \ completely ﬁlled\nwith water, the soil would reach its maximum soil moisture\n\
    content or saturation. The saturation ratio varies between 0\n(no soil moisture)\
    \ and 1 (full saturation). The porosity, or\nwater storage capacity, is needed\
    \ to convert the saturation ra-\ntio into volumetric fraction.\nAnother commonly\
    \ used term is plant available water\n(PAW), which is the volume of water available\
    \ to plants.\nPAW is computed by subtracting the volume of water cor-\nresponding\
    \ to the permanent wilting point from the total vol-\numetric soil water content.\
    \ Below the wilting point water is\nheld too strongly by the soil matrix and is\
    \ not accessible to\nplants (Hillel, 1998). The wilting point depends on soil\
    \ prop-\nerties such as soil texture, and thus varies geographically.\nEssential\
    \ for the deﬁnition of soil moisture is the char-\nacterization of the soil volume,\
    \ as soil moisture content is\nnot homogeneously distributed vertically and horizontally\n\
    and thus depends on the soil volume considered.\nThis is\nof high relevance for\
    \ intercomparing in situ measurements\noriginating from different stations and\
    \ for the comparison of\nin situ measurements with Earth observation and land\
    \ sur-\nface model data. For example, some methods sample only\nsoil moisture\
    \ in the top few millimeters to centimeters of the\nsoil (e.g., microwave remote\
    \ sensing), a small volume at a\ngiven depth (e.g., Time Domain Reﬂectometry (TDR)\
    \ mea-\nsurements Sect. 2.2), or provide an integral measure down\nto the water\
    \ table depth. Moreover, for certain soil moisture\ndeﬁnitions (e.g., root zone\
    \ soil moisture, total soil moisture),\n2 may be a function of space and time\
    \ (i.e., as a function of\nthe plants’ rooting depth or the water table depth).\n\
    For a more extensive description of soil moisture deﬁni-\ntions we refer the reader\
    \ to existing literature (e.g. Hillel,\n1998; Seneviratne et al., 2010).\n2.2\n\
    Measurement techniques\nSeveral techniques are available for measuring soil moisture\n\
    content in situ (Ward and Robinson, 1990; Robock et al.,\n2000; Walker et al.,\
    \ 2004; Robinson et al., 2008; Senevi-\nratne et al., 2010). They can be categorized\
    \ either as direct\nor indirect methods. The most frequently used methods are\n\
    summarized below. For a more detailed discussion we refer\nto the references cited\
    \ above.\n2.2.1\nGravimetric method\nThe gravimetric method is the only method\
    \ that measures\nsoil moisture directly. Typically, soil samples are taken using\n\
    coring devices or augers at speciﬁc depths and locations. The\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\
    Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\n1678\nW. A. Dorigo et al.: The\
    \ International Soil Moisture Network\nsamples are weighted before and after drying,\
    \ and from the\nchanges in mass, the soil moisture content can be derived.\nThe\
    \ method is labor-intensive and destructive (i.e., a sam-\nple cannot be taken\
    \ at exactly the same location more than\nonce). When implemented as a monitoring\
    \ technique, the\ntemporal resolution of long-term measurement networks us-\n\
    ing this technique is usually coarse, typically of the order of\n1–2 weeks at\
    \ best (Seneviratne et al., 2010). Nevertheless,\nas the gravimetric method is\
    \ low-tech and simple, it makes\nan excellent technique for long homogeneous climatological\n\
    records (Robock et al., 2000). Today, most systematic obser-\nvations are based\
    \ on indirect methods; however, calibration\ntypically requires using the gravimetric\
    \ method.\n2.2.2\nNeutron probes\nNeutron probes are relatively easy to use, accurate,\
    \ and capa-\nble of measurements in real time. This indirect method uses\na radioactive\
    \ source of fast (high-energy) neutrons, which is\nlowered into a borehole, and\
    \ the backscattered slow neutrons\nare measured.\nA detector counts the number\
    \ of neutrons\nslowed down or thermalized by collisions with hydrogen nu-\nclei,\
    \ mainly representing soil water. A relationship with vol-\numetric soil moisture\
    \ content is obtained by calibrating the\nslow neutron counts with gravimetric\
    \ samples of soil mois-\nture content and bulk densities (Vachaud et al., 1977).\
    \ Since\nradioactive scattering occurs over a spherical domain, a neu-\ntron probe\
    \ samples a volume of soil rather than a point. The\nprobe’s relatively large\
    \ volume of inﬂuence makes observa-\ntions at shallow depths prone to errors,\
    \ as adjoining air is\nalso sampled. Disadvantages of neutron probes include their\n\
    requirement to be calibrated to soil types and zones over a pe-\nriod of time\
    \ with different soil moisture fractions, that they\nare also labor-intensive,\
    \ the need for precautions associated\nwith handling radioactive material, and\
    \ the relatively high\ncosts. It is also not adaptable to frequent and automated\
    \ ob-\nservations. The neutron probe is mostly used to measure soil\nmoisture\
    \ differences rather than absolute soil moisture con-\ntent.\n2.2.3\nElectromagnetic\
    \ techniques\nSoil capacitance measurements, TDR, and Frequency Do-\nmain Reﬂectometry\
    \ (FDR) are electromagnetic techniques\nthat make use of the dependency of the\
    \ dielectric permittivity\nof the soil on soil moisture content, caused by the\
    \ difference\nbetween the dielectric constant of soil components and wa-\nter,\
    \ respectively. These techniques are non-destructive and\nnon-radioactive and\
    \ can be easily set up for automated oper-\nation with a data logger. This facilitates\
    \ frequent measure-\nments up to several measurements per hour. TDR and FDR\n\
    sensors, operating at higher frequencies, are more accurate\nthan capacitance\
    \ sensors (e.g. Robinson et al., 2008). How-\never, the latter are of much lower\
    \ cost, which can allow for\na higher number of instruments and thus much denser\
    \ net-\nworks (e.g., Bogena et al., 2007). On the other hand, FDR is\nsensitive\
    \ to temperature ﬂuctuations and ideally would need\nto be corrected for these.\
    \ All techniques require calibration\nwith gravimetric samples.\n2.2.4\nCosmic-ray\
    \ neutrons\nRecently, a non-invasive method has been proposed that\nmeasures low-energy\
    \ cosmic-ray neutrons that are generated\nwithin the soil, moderated mainly by\
    \ hydrogen atoms, and\ndiffused back to the atmosphere (Zreda et al., 2008; Desilets\n\
    et al., 2010). These neutrons are sensitive to water content\nchanges, but largely\
    \ insensitive to variations in soil chem-\nistry. Their intensity above the surface\
    \ is inversely correlated\nwith hydrogen content of the soil. Portable neutron\
    \ detec-\ntors are placed a few meters above the ground and allow for\na sampling\
    \ interval of several minutes to hours. Soil mois-\nture information is inferred\
    \ over a depth of 15 to 70 cm. In\ncontrast to the methods presented above, cosmic-ray\
    \ mea-\nsurements integrate soil moisture measurements over much\nlarger horizontal\
    \ scales (diameter ∼670 m) and hence have\nthe potential to bridge the spatial\
    \ mismatch between point\nmeasurements using contact methods and remote sensing\
    \ es-\ntimates over large areas. Several operational and experimen-\ntal networks\
    \ based on this method are currently set-up world-\nwide2.\n2.2.5\nOther indirect\
    \ techniques\nTensiometers and electrical resistance blocks are capable of\nmeasuring\
    \ the matric potential of soil water, which is di-\nrectly related to the ability\
    \ of plants to extract water from\nsoil. However, each instrument has a limited\
    \ accessible wa-\nter potential range. Tensiometers work well only in wet soils,\n\
    whereas resistance blocks (mostly made of gypsum) do bet-\nter in moderately dry\
    \ soils (WMO8, 2008). Keeping in mind\nthese known limitations they are sufﬁciently\
    \ reliable and in-\nexpensive. However, tensiometers are relatively service in-\n\
    tensive and sensitive to temperature ﬂuctuations while resis-\ntance blocks need\
    \ careful (re-)calibration during longer op-\neration periods. Both sensor types\
    \ are frequently used for\nagricultural purposes. A detailed description of these\
    \ meth-\nods can be found in (WMO8, 2008).\nHeat dissipation (or pulse) sensors\
    \ measure temperature\nchanges in response to a heat pulse (Robock et al., 2000).\
    \ It\nmakes use of the principle that the thermal behavior of the\nsoil is closely\
    \ related to its water content. Other indirect soil\nmoisture measurement techniques\
    \ include gamma densitom-\netry (based on the relatively greater gamma radiation\
    \ atten-\nuation factor of water compared to other soil components)\nand psychrometers.\
    \ All these indirect techniques need to be\nrecalibrated with gravimetric samples.\n\

    \ to provide a system for\nthe dissemination of quality-controlled and harmonized\
    \ soil\nmoisture measurements from various ground validation cam-\npaigns and\
    \ operational networks. Harmonization and quality\ncontrol of soil moisture datasets\
    \ can only be performed if suf-\nﬁcient data and metadata are available (Sects.\
    \ 3.3 and 3.4).\nThe information that is useful in interpreting the soil mois-\n\
    ture measurements can be subdivided into information that is\nconsidered either\
    \ static (site characteristics) or that is highly\nvariable over time (e.g. most\
    \ meteorological and hydrologi-\ncal variables).\nThe static variables that are\
    \ included in the ISMN are sum-\nmarized in Table 1. The coordinates of the measurement\
    \ sta-\ntions are obligatory. Conditional variables like bulk density\nand soil\
    \ porosity are needed if soil moisture data are pro-\nvided in units other than\
    \ volumetric soil moisture and, as a\nconsequence, the data need to be converted\
    \ (Sect. 3.3.2). All\nother variables are not obligatory, but are very useful\
    \ for a\nqualitative interpretation of observed soil moisture dynam-\nics or encountered\
    \ anomalies, e.g., between satellite-derived\nsoil moisture and soil moisture\

    Sect. 4.\n3.2\nSystem overview\n3.2.1\nGeneral layout\nThe data hosting facility\
    \ has been designed fulﬁlling the fol-\nlowing requirements: Firstly, the data\
    \ hosting facility had to\nbe able to store all relevant information for the networks,\
    \ the\nstations, the datasets, and the measurements techniques. Sec-\nondly, this\
    \ information should also be easily accessible, e.g.,\nby users who are looking\
    \ for datasets within a speciﬁc region\nof interest, or by users that for satellite\
    \ product validation are\ninterested only in soil moisture measurements of the\
    \ top soil\nlayer. Finally, any modiﬁcations made to the original data,\nlike\
    \ harmonization, should be traceable and the user should\nbe able to invert this\
    \ procedure to obtain the original mea-\nsurement values (e.g., plant available\
    \ water).\nBased on these considerations the following system was\nimplemented\
    \ (Fig. 1):\n1. software for automated reading, conversion, harmoniza-\ntion,\
    \ and quality checking of input data,\n2. a database containing the harmonized\
    \ data and meta-\ndata, and\n3. a web portal to provide the interface between\

    The last two items are presented in this section, whereas\ndata harmonization\
    \ and quality control are discussed in\nSects. 3.3 and 3.4, respectively.\nThe\
    \ system is automated to the highest degree possible to\nfacilitate the processing\
    \ of large datasets and frequent up-\ndates. In practice, this means that data\
    \ harmonization, qual-\nity control, and archiving are performed in a fully automated\n\
    way.\nOnly the ingestion into the system of the original\ndatasets needs to be\
    \ tailored to the speciﬁc network, as the\ndata made available to the ISMN (e.g.,\
    \ by email or by down-\nload) are very heterogeneous with respect to ﬁle naming,\
    \ ﬁle\ntype, ﬁle format, the variables measured, and the metadata\navailable.\
    \ All data manipulations are performed in the Inter-\nactive Data Language (IDL)\
    \ of ITT-VIS3.\n3.2.2\nDatabase\nThe database (or archive) is the core of the\
    \ ISMN data host-\ning facility. Its design was very critical, since inadequate\n\
    design considerations can signiﬁcantly slow down operation\nwhen the database\
    \ gets ﬁlled or leads to a database structure\nthat is incapable of assimilating\
    \ new networks with a differ-\nent design or measurement setup. The design and\
    \ content of\nthe database was established after inventorying potential con-\n\
    tributing networks, expected soil moisture and other datasets,\npossible users,\
    \ and standards for hydrometeorological and\nspatial data and metadata (Sect.\
    \ 3.2.4). Thus, an overview\nof expected database entries, data volumes, and data\
    \ trafﬁc\ncould be established. A prototype of the data hosting facil-\nity was\
    \ ﬁrst tested with a selected number of users and data\nproviders and, wherever\
    \ feasible, modiﬁed to their sugges-\ntions.\nThe database distinguishes between\
    \ mandatory, condi-\ntional, and optional database entries (see also Tables 1-2)\
    \ and\nuses the following hierarchy: network > station > dataset.\n3http://www.ittvis.com\n\
    Apart from data and metadata of soil moisture and other vari-\nables, additional\
    \ relevant information on the networks and\nthe stations is included, e.g., the\
    \ responsible organization or\nreferences to more detailed information on the\
    \ networks and\nsites. Among others, an important design consideration has\nbeen\
    \ the use of a measurement depth interval (“from – to”)\nto comply with the different\
    \ measurement techniques and in-\nstallation positions of the sensors. In the\
    \ case of a variable\nmeasured at a speciﬁc depth, the “from” and “to” depths\
    \ are\nidentical.\nThe database was implemented in the open-source object-\nrelational\
    \ database management system PostgreSQL4 (ver-\nsion 8.4) including the spatial\
    \ database extension PostGIS5\n1.3.6.\n3.2.3\nWeb portal\nThe ISMN can be accessed\
    \ at http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/\ninsitu. It consists of two major parts: (i)\
    \ a project website\nproviding details about networks, partners, and the project\n\
    itself, and (ii) the data hosting centre itself where users can\nquery, view,\
    \ and download the data contained in the database.\nFigure 2 shows a screenshot\
    \ of the initial view of the data\nhosting centre. It embeds a Google Maps application\
    \ pro-\ngramming interface (API), which offers the user a map-based\nselection\
    \ tool to view and download the available data. In ad-\ndition, through the satellite\
    \ data and orthophotos in Google\nMaps the user is able to obtain additional information\
    \ about\nthe land use/land cover and topography in the vicinity of the\nmeasurement\
    \ stations. By clicking on the markers, the user\nobtains a summary of important\

    \ various networks and stations measure at different tem-\nporal sampling intervals.\
    \ Whereas the datasets contained in\nthe Global Soil Moisture Data Bank (Robock\
    \ et al., 2000)\nsupply only several observations per month, most modern\nautomated\
    \ stations provide several measurements per hour\n(Sect. 4). Following recommendations\
    \ from the World Me-\nteorological Organization, co-sponsored programs and appli-\n\
    cations for satellite soil moisture products9, we decided that\nfor the ISMN a\
    \ temporal resolution of 1 hour is sufﬁcient for\nall applications, including\
    \ regional numerical weather pre-\ndiction.\nObservation datasets, which are available\
    \ at sub-hourly\nsampling rates, have been thinned selecting the individual\n\
    measurements at the hourly UTC reference time step (Ta-\nble 4).\nIf at this hourly\
    \ sampling interval no measure-\nment is available (e.g., indicated by a dummy\
    \ value like\n“−99.90”), the database entry will receive the value “NaN”\n(Not\
    \ a Number). This is illustrated in Table 4 for the time\nstep 18:00 UTC. If no\
    \ valid measurement is available, which\nmeans that the measurement value is outside\
    \ a plausible\nrange, the database entry for this measurement is labeled\nwith\

    \ it is not a common practice\nthat soil moisture networks provide quality indicators\
    \ with\ntheir data.\nTherefore, we decided to integrate the alloca-\ntion of quality\
    \ indicators in the data hosting facility itself.\nA rather conservative quality\
    \ checking scheme was imple-\nmented, so that suspect observations can be detected\
    \ more\neasily. We decided to provide only quality indicators that\ncan be checked\
    \ in an objective way. Hence, indicators like\n“Bad” and “Good” are not included.\
    \ This leads to the subset\nof CEOP quality ﬂags presented in Table 6.\nTable\
    \ 7 shows the possible ranges for the most important\nmeteorological variables.\
    \ If a measured data value exceeds\nthis range (on either side of the range) the\
    \ measurement re-\nceives the ﬂag value “C.” If a measurement is missing, its\n\
    quality ﬂag is set to “M.” All other dataset values have been\nset to “U” for\
    \ unchecked.\nIn contrast to the other meteorological measurements, for\nsoil\
    \ moisture also the quality ﬂag “Questionable/Dubious\n(D)” is adopted. This quality\
    \ ﬂag is adopted when a soil\nmoisture measurement in combination with another\

    \ net-\nworks, which are listed in alphabetical order. The overview\nof the datasets\
    \ presented here is just a snapshot of the current\nsituation while the ISMN is\
    \ continuously evolving. Several\nother networks have already announced their\
    \ participation\nand will be included in the near future. To keep up to date\n\
    with the most recent developments, we advise regular vis-\nits to the news section\
    \ of the ISMN or a subscription to the\nnewsletter (see http://www.ipf.tuwien.ac.at/insitu/\
    \ for more\ndetails).\n4.1\nAMMA\nSoil moisture data from this network have been\
    \ collected\nwithin The African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis\n(AMMA)11 experiment,\
    \ which is an international and inter-\ndisciplinary cooperation designed to investigate\
    \ the interac-\ntions between atmospheric, oceanic and terrestrial systems\nand\
    \ their joint controls on tropical monsoon dynamics in\nWest Africa (Lebel et\
    \ al., 2009).\nThe soil moisture sta-\ntions are located in three mesoscale sites\
    \ in three different\ncountries sampling the West-African eco-climatic gradient.\n\
    For the Mali station, soil moisture measurements at a given\ndepth have been taken\
    \ at the bottom, middle, and top of a\nsand dune. In Niger, the stations were\
    \ positioned in a way\nto describe the gradient from a plateau down to the valley\n\
    bottom. More details on the AMMA network and project\ndetails are found in various\
    \ publications (Cappelaere et al.,\n2009; de Rosnay et al., 2009; Mougin et al.,\
    \ 2009; Pellarin et\nal., 2009a) and in Table 9. Soil moisture measurement taken\n\
    at the AMMA sites have been extensively used for satellite\nproduct validation\
    \ (e.g., Gruhier et al., 2008, 2010; Pellarin\net al., 2009b; Zribi et al., 2009)\
    \ and hydrological modeling\n(Pellarin et al., 2009a).\n4.2\nCALABRIA\nThe stations\
    \ of the CALABRIA network are found on var-\nious locations across the Calabria\
    \ region in southern Italy.\n11http://amma-international.org/\nHydrol. Earth Syst.\

    The network was installed by the Centro Funzionale Multi-\nrischi – ARPACAL1212\
    \ for civil protection activities related\nto hydrometeorological monitoring for\
    \ ﬂood and landslide\nrisk mitigation. More details on this network are found\
    \ in\nBrocca et al. (2011) and Table 9. Soil moisture measure-\nments provided\
    \ by this network have been used for the vali-\ndation of various satellite-based\
    \ soil moisture products from\nAMSR-E and ASCAT (Brocca et al., 2011).\n4.3\n\
    CAMPANIA\nThe CAMPANIA network is located near the city of Naples\nin the Campania\
    \ region in southern Italy.\nThe data are\nmeasured and prepared by the Centro\
    \ Funzionale per la\nPrevisione Meteorologica e il Monitoraggio Meteo-Pluvio-\n\
    Idrometrico e delle Frane, Settore Programmazione Inter-\nventi di Protezione\
    \ Civile sul Territorio, Regione Campa-\nnia.13 Details on the measurements performed\
    \ in this net-\nwork are found in Brocca et al. (2011) and Table 9. Soil\nmoisture\
    \ measurements provided by this network have been\nused for the validation of\
    \ various satellite-based soil moisture\nproducts from AMSR-E and ASCAT (Brocca\
    \ et al., 2011)\n4.4\nCHINA\nThis dataset was previously contained in the Global\
    \ Soil\nMoisture Data Bank (Robock et al., 2000). The observa-\ntions were taken\
    \ at the 8, 18 and 28th of each month during\nthe period 1981–1999 and served\
    \ agricultural purposes. For\nsome stations, no measurements were taken in the\
    \ cold sea-\nson due to the frozen surface. Despite the low sampling rate,\nthe\
    \ soil moisture measurements provide detailed information\non the vertical distribution\
    \ of soil water as measurements\nwere taken at 11 depth intervals over the upper\
    \ 1 m soil layer.\nMore details are found in Table 9 and Robock et al. (2000).\n\
    Data from the CHINA network have been extensively used\nfor a large range of applications,\
    \ including fundamental re-\nsearch on the behavior of soil moisture (e.g., Entin\
    \ et al.,\n2000), improvement of land surface and reanalysis models\n12http://www.cfcalabria.it/\n\
    13http://www.regione.campania.it/\n(e.g., Rodell et al., 2004), evaluating drought\
    \ severity mod-\nels (e.g., Dai et al., 2004), and satellite soil moisture product\n\
    validation (e.g., Reichle et al., 2004).\n4.5\nCNR-IRPI\nThe CNR-IRPI network\
    \ is located near the city of Perugia\nin central Italy. The network is maintained\
    \ by the Research\nInstitute for Geo-Hydrological Protection (IRPI) of the Ital-\n\
    ian National Research Council (CNR)14 to serve ﬂood fore-\ncasting. Additional\
    \ information on the sites can be found in\nTable 9 and in Brocca et al. (2008,\
    \ 2009). Data from the\nCNR-IRPI network have been used to test the reliability\
    \ of\nvarious AMSR-E and ASCAT-based soil moisture products\n(Brocca et al., 2010b,\
    \ 2011; Liu et al., 2011) and to study\nthe spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture\
    \ (Brocca et al.,\n2007, 2010a).\n4.6\nFMI\nThis network is operated by the Finish\
    \ Meteorological In-\nstitute (FMI) as part of an operational weather observatory.\n\
    Currently it consists of a single station (FMI Arctic Research\nCentre in Sodankyl¨a)15\
    \ that measures soil moisture in a fully\nautomated operational mode at three\
    \ different locations a few\nmeters apart. The network has participated in several\
    \ inter-\nnational projects and initiatives, such as FLUXNET (Baldoc-\nchi et\
    \ al., 2001) and the validation of diverse SMOS products\n(Rautiainen et al.,\
    \ 2011). More information on the FMI can\nbe found in Rautiainen et al. (2011)\
    \ and in Table 9. The\nFMI network is the ﬁrst network in the ISMN that provides\n\
    updates on a fully automated basis. Once a day, data sets\nare downloaded from\
    \ the FMI server, processed and qual-\nity controlled, and ingested into the database\
    \ of the ISMN.\nData sets of the FMI network were used for studying the rela-\n\
    tionship between soil moisture and microwave emissions and\nbackscatter in L-.,\
    \ C-, and X-band (Pulliainen et al., 1994;\nRautiainen et al., 2011).\n4.7\nICN\n\
    The Illinois Climate Network (ICN)16 is coordinated by the\nWater and Atmospheric\
    \ Resources Program of the Illinois\nState Water Survey. This network was also\
    \ contained in the\nGlobal Soil Moisture Data Bank. Measurements began in\n1981\
    \ and the network continues to operate until present. The\nmain purpose of the\
    \ network is to provide information on ex-\ntreme and usual weather events, as\
    \ well as short and long-\nterm trends in climate data. The dataset contained\
    \ in the\nISMN covers the period 1983 through July 2008 while an\nupdate with\
    \ the most recent datasets is foreseen for the near\nfuture. The ﬁrst two years\
    \ were removed because of spin-up\n14http://www.irpi.cnr.it/\n15 http://fmiarc.fmi.ﬁ/index.html\n\

    \ 9 and Hollinger and Isard (1994). Apart from climate re-\nsearch (e.g., Hollinger\
    \ and Isard, 1994; Robock et al., 2000),\nseveral scientiﬁc disciplines already\
    \ beneﬁted form this net-\nwork including the evaluation of land surface ﬂuxes\
    \ and state\ndatasets (e.g., Findell and Eltahir, 1997; Dirmeyer, 2000;\nMaurer\
    \ et al., 2002), the assessment of drought severity mod-\nels (e.g., Dai et al.,\
    \ 2004), evaluation of climate models (e.g.,\nRobock et al., 1998; Oleson et al.,\
    \ 2008), long-term weather\nforecasting (e.g., Huang et al., 1996), designing\
    \ soil mois-\nture observational networks (e.g., Vinnikov et al., 1999a) and\n\
    satellite soil moisture product validation (e.g., Vinnikov et\nal., 1999b; Owe\
    \ et al., 2001; Njoku et al., 2003; Reichle et\nal., 2004; Owe et al., 2008).\n\
    4.8\nIOWA\nThe IOWA dataset was transferred from the Global Soil\nMoisture Data\
    \ Bank and consists of soil moisture observa-\ntions from two different catchments\
    \ located in the southwest\nof Iowa. Soil moisture observations were taken for\
    \ scientiﬁc\npurposes until 1994 when it ceased operation. The gravi-\nmetric\
    \ method was used to measure soil moisture for the top\n5 layers, neutron probes\
    \ for the deeper layers. On average,\nobservations were made twice a month between\
    \ April and\nOctober. More information about this network can be found\nin Table\
    \ 9, Entin et al. (2000), and Robock et al. (2000). The\nIOWA dataset has been\
    \ used e.g. for trend analysis in soil\nmoisture (Robock et al., 2000), satellite\
    \ product validation\n(Reichle et al., 2004) and for studying the temporal and\
    \ spa-\ntial scales of soil moisture dynamics (Entin et al., 2000).\n4.9\nLindenberg\
    \ Meteorological Observatory\nThe Lindenberg Meteorological Observatory – Richard\
    \ Ass-\nmann Observatory (MOL-RAO)17 is situated close to Berlin,\nGermany. It\
    \ is operated by the German Meteorological Ser-\nvice DWD and perfoms systematic\
    \ observations of the atmo-\nsphere and the land surface. Soil moisture is operationally\n\
    measured at a grassland site (Falkenberg) and a forest site\n(Kerigh) since 1998\
    \ and 2002, respectively. Being part of\nan operational meteorological observatory,\
    \ also several other\nrelevant hydrometeorological variables are provided and\
    \ soil\nproperties are well documented. Information on the network\ncan be found\
    \ in Table 9, in Beyrich and Adam (2007) and in\nvarious web sources 18. Soil\
    \ moisture data of the MOL-RAO\nnetwork have been used to study the effect of\
    \ soil moisture on\nsurface heat ﬂuxes (Beyrich et al., 2006; Heret et al., 2006).\n\
    4.10\nMONGOLIA\nAlso this dataset was previously contained in the Global\nSoil\
    \ Moisture Data Bank. Soil moisture datasets were col-\nlected by the National\
    \ Agency of Meteorology, Hydrology\nand Environment Monitoring in Ulaanbaatar\
    \ for agricultural\npurposes. All observations were initially provided as volu-\n\
    metric plant-available water. As the original measured wilt-\ning levels, required\
    \ to convert PAW into fractional volumet-\nric soil moisture content, could not\

    \ is situated in the center of the\nIberian Peninsula. It was set up in 1999 as\
    \ an experimen-\ntal network by the Centro Hispano Luso de Investigaciones\nAgrarias\
    \ (CIALE) group of the University of Salamanca20.\nThe stations lie in an agricultural\
    \ area. In the vicinity of a\nfew stations irrigation occurs. As a result, large\
    \ jumps in\nmeasured soil moisture that cannot be coupled to meteoro-\nlogical\
    \ events and very high soil moisture fractions (up to\n0.95 m3 m−3) may be observed\
    \ here. As irrigation usually\nis a very local phenomenon, the stations that are\
    \ affected\nshould be treated with caution when interpreted in a spa-\ntial context.\
    \ Details of the network can be found in Table 9\nand in Mart´ınez-Fern´andez\
    \ and Ceballos (2005). Datasets\nof the REMEDHUS network have been used by study\
    \ the\nspatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture (Mart´ınez-\nFern´andez\
    \ and Ceballos, 2003, 2005) and for satellite prod-\nuct validation (Ceballos\
    \ et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2007; Liu\net al., 2011; Parinussa et al., 2011).\n\
    4.13\nRUSWET-AGRO\nSoil moisture datasets for 78 districts in the Former Soviet\n\
    Union were prepared for agricultural purposes by the Rus-\nsian Hydrometeorological\
    \ Center, Moscow, Russia and ini-\ntially distributed through the Global Soil\
    \ Moisture Databank.\nThe soil moisture observations were originally provided\
    \ as\nvolumetric plant-available water [volumetric %]. Due to the\nlag between\
    \ observations and the publication of the data in\nreference books, and geo-political\
    \ changes during the era,\ninformation on the wilting points (required to convert\
    \ plant\navailable water into volumetric soil moisture) has gone lost.\nTo resolve\
    \ this problem and make the data compatible, the\npredictive equations of Saxton\
    \ and Rawls (2006) were used\nto estimate the wilting points from soil texture\
    \ and organic\ncarbon content. Input to the equations was provided by the\nHarmonized\
    \ World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-\nCAS/JRC, 2009). As the RUSWET-AGRO\
    \ dataset was de-\nsigned for monitoring soil moisture at agricultural ﬁelds,\n\
    datasets were separately available for spring cereal crops and\nwinter cereal\
    \ crops for all locations. In the ISMN stations\nwith the sufﬁx “a” represent\
    \ spring cereal crops while sta-\ntions with “b” illustrate winter cereal crops.\
    \ Measurements\nare available three times a month during the growing period\n\
    of 1987 and 1988. More information about this network is\n20http://campus.usal.es/∼hidrus/\n\
    available in Table 9, Vinnikov and Yeserkepova (1991), and\nRobock et al. (2000).\
    \ The RUSWET-AGRO datasets have\nbeen widely used for climate research (Robock\
    \ et al., 2000),\nevaluation of drought severity models (Dai et al., 2004), land\n\
    surface model evaluation (Balsamo et al., 2009), and satellite\nproduct validation\
    \ (Reichle et al., 2004).\n4.14\nRUSWET-GRASS\nThe RUSWET-GRASS dataset is a merger\
    \ of the RUSWET-\n130STA and RUSWET-50STA networks from the former So-\nviet Union\
    \ previously contained in the Global Soil Moisture\nData Bank.\nMeasurements were\
    \ originally used for agri-\ncultural predictions. As soil moisture was originally\
    \ pro-\nvided as plant available water, wilting points were needed\nto covert\
    \ the measurements into volumetric soil moisture.\nSimilarly as for the RUSWET-AGRO\
    \ network, the predic-\ntive equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006) were used to\
    \ es-\ntimate the wilting points from soil texture and organic car-\nbon content\
    \ while input to the equations was provided by the\nHarmonized World Soil Database\
    \ (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-\nCAS/JRC, 2009). The dataset covers the years 1952–1985,\n\
    but the spatial extent of these data is poor until about 1975.\nObservations were\
    \ made with a temporal resolution of about\n10 days during the warm season, and\
    \ once a month during\nwinter. The provided measurements are the average of four\n\
    samples taken within an area of about 1000 m2. More in-\nformation on this dataset\
    \ can be found in Table 9, Vinnikov\nand Yeserkepova (1991), and Robock et al.\
    \ (2000).\nThe\nRUSWET-GRASS datasets have been widely used for cli-\nmate research\
    \ (e.g., Robock et al., 2000), evaluation of land\nsurface models (e.g., Robock\
    \ et al., 1995, 1998; Yang et\nal., 1997), evaluation of drought severity models\
    \ (e.g., Dai\net al., 2004), and satellite product validation (e.g., Reichle\n\
    et al., 2004).\n4.15\nRUSWET-VALDAI\nSoil moisture datasets for 3 catchments located\
    \ in the Val-\ndai basin were collected by the State Hydrological Institute\n\
    in St. Petersburg from 1960 to 1990 for water balance stud-\nies. The catchments\
    \ are characterized by different types of\nvegetation. Soil moisture [volumetric\
    \ %] was computed us-\ning data from 9–11 observational points distributed over\
    \ the\nbasin area. The resulting ﬁles contain monthly means of soil\nmoisture\
    \ for three different depth intervals. Thus, soil mois-\nture values are available\
    \ as monthly means, precipitation as\nmonthly totals [mm], and temperature [◦C]\
    \ as daily values.\nOther variables measured but not included into the ISMN\n\
    are runoff, monthly averaged water table depth, snow water\nequivalent, and evaporation.\
    \ More information can be found\nin Table 9, Vinnikov and Yeserkepova (1991),\

    different depths. More info is found in Table 9 and Mar-\nczewski et al. (2010).\
    \ Primary purpose of the network will\nbe the validation of satellite–based soil\

    \ Research Center for\nAgriculture. It is funded by the German Aerospace Centre\n\
    (DLR) through the project SMOSHYD21. At some stations\nsoil moisture of a speciﬁc\
    \ layer is measured by multiple\nsensors. Details on the UDC SMOS network can\
    \ be found\nin Ttable 9 and Loew et al. (2009). Loew and Schlenz (2011)\nused\

    \ in the Po river plain in Northern Italy.\nIt is part of an operational meteorological\
    \ network operated\nby the Service of Hydrology, Meteorology and Climate of the\n\
    Regional Agency for Environmental Protection in Emilia-\nRomagna (ARPA – SIMC)\
    \ mainly for agricultural purposes.\nMore information is given in Table 9. Soil\
    \ moisture data of\nthis network have been used for satellite product validation\n\
    and intercomparison (Brocca et al., 2011).\n5\nDiscussion\n5.1\nImpact of the\
    \ ISMN for satellite products and land\nsurface models\nEven though initial funding\
    \ for the establishment of the\nISMN, as provided by ESA, mainly focuses on the\
    \ SMOS\nmission, other satellite-based soil moisture products from the\nexisting\
    \ and future missions such as AMSR-E, ASCAT, and\nSMAP can proﬁt from the established\
    \ network (for refer-\nences see the individual networks in Sect. 4). However,\
    \ the\nintention of the ISMN is to go beyond the role of satellite val-\nidation\
    \ resource and to serve other scientiﬁc and application-\noriented communities\
    \ as well, such as hydrological model-\ning, numerical weather forecasting, and\
    \ water management.\nTo fulﬁll this task, the ISMN stores not only surface soil\n\
    moisture but also soil water content of the deeper layers and\nrelevant hydrometeorological\
    \ variables such as precipitation\nand temperature of the air and soil. In addition,\
    \ to better\nserve time critical applications (ranging from several hours\nto\
    \ a few days), the ISMN has been structured in a way that\nenables processing\
    \ incoming soil moisture measurements on\na fully automated basis. The automated\
    \ daily update of data\nfrom the FMI network shows that a NRT assimilation and\n\
    redistribution of data is possible. Nevertheless, prerequisite\nfor the added\
    \ value of such a mode is the presence of opera-\ntional measurement and processing\
    \ chains on the part of the\ndata providers in order to guarantee timely data\
    \ delivery to\nthe ISMN.\n5.2\nConsiderations on data representativeness and\n\
    quality\nThe appropriateness of one or more soil moisture datasets\nfrom the ISMN\
    \ for a speciﬁc application strongly depends\non the spatial and temporal scales\
    \ of the in-situ measure-\nments and of the process that the user wishes to describe.\n\
    For example, if the aim is to validate satellite-derived surface\nsoil moisture,\
    \ the user should be aware that these products\ncontain information only about\
    \ the upper few millimeters to\ncentimeters of the soil column, whereas a technique\
    \ based\non cosmic-ray neutrons provides information up to a depth\nof ∼70 cm.\
    \ On the other hand, the latter provides estimates\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\

    \ International Soil Moisture Network\nthat are spatially more consistent than\
    \ single electromagnetic\ndevices or gravimetric measurements.\nApart from the\
    \ choice of the measurement technique itself,\nalso its employment has a strong\
    \ impact on what is exactly\nobserved. The in-situ measurements are inﬂuenced\
    \ by sev-\neral factors including:\n– Installation depth of the sensor.\n– Placement\
    \ of the sensor, e.g., is sensor positioned hori-\nzontally or vertically?\n–\
    \ Is soil moisture measured at a speciﬁc depth or inte-\ngrated over a certain\
    \ soil depth interval? This is often\nclosely related to the positioning of the\
    \ instrument.\n– Density and geographical distribution of measurements.\n– Characterization\
    \ of the soil, including texture, porosity,\nand organic matter content.\n– Calibration\
    \ of the sensor\nIdeally, all these factors should be accounted for when har-\n\
    monizing in situ soil measurements from different sites, so\nthat observed variations\
    \ are related only to real differences in\nsoil moisture. However, such a harmonization\
    \ of data would\ngo beyond the current objective of the ISMN.\nThe choice of the\
    \ measurement technique may also have a\nstrong impact on the data quality. In\
    \ Sect. 2.2 and several ad-\nvantages and disadvantages of the different techniques\
    \ were\nhighlighted while the relative performance of various sensors\nhas been\
    \ extensively documented in literature (Baumhardt et\nal., 2000; Walker et al.,\
    \ 2004; Czarnomski et al., 2005; Mit-\ntelbach et al., 2011). Even if TDR sensors\
    \ nowadays are of-\nten considered as benchmark for operational ﬁeld monitoring\n\
    of soil moisture, other, less expensive systems may in many\nsituations show comparable\
    \ performance (e.g. Czarnomski\net al., 2005) and therefore should not be excluded\
    \ on before-\nhand from data analysis.\nThe relative accuracy and precision of\
    \ stations may differ\nfrom site to site (even when employing similar instruments)\n\
    and can shift over time due to sensor degradation or external\ndisturbances. Not\
    \ considering these differences in further us-\nage of the data may falsely affect\
    \ results obtained and con-\nclusions drawn by a study. Therefore, adequate quality\
    \ char-\nacterization of the individual networks and stations is highly\ndesired.\
    \ As the current quality control procedure is only able\nto detect evident outliers\
    \ but does not give us any informa-\ntion about subtle differences between stations,\
    \ future efforts\nwill primarily focus on improved quality control. This will\n\
    be done at the level of individual measurement values as well\nas at the station\
    \ and network level.\n5.3\nUtilization strategies for ISMN datasets\nEvaluating\
    \ satellite- and model-derived soil moisture re-\ntrievals with in situ soil moisture\
    \ measurements is commonly\nbased on the root-mean-square metric (Jackson et al.,\
    \ 2010).\nHowever, to use in situ soil moisture measurements from\nthe ISMN in\
    \ satellite and land surface model validation and\ncalibration, the user should\
    \ be aware of the systematic dif-\nferences that may exist between in situ measurements\
    \ and\nsoil moisture estimates from models and satellite observa-\ntions (Entekhabi\
    \ et al., 2010b). Even though the ISMN pro-\nvides soil moisture measurements\
    \ in the same volumetric\nunit that is returned by most satellite products and\
    \ models, bi-\nases and differences in the dynamic range may exist between\nthe\
    \ datasets, e.g., by assumptions and generalizations made\nwithin the retrieval\
    \ concept, scaling issues, or due to the dif-\nferent soil layers or soil depths\
    \ considered. Thus, other met-\nrics, such as the Pearson or Spearman correlation\
    \ coefﬁcient,\noften provide valuable and complementary information on\nthe performance\
    \ (Entekhabi et al., 2010b).\nTo combine in situ soil moisture measurements with\
    \ satel-\nlite retrievals and a ﬁrst guess predicted by a land surface\nmodel,\
    \ e.g., in the framework of data assimilation, it is often\nnecessary to minimize\
    \ systematic differences between the in-\ndividual datasets (e.g. Drusch, 2007).\
    \ These correction meth-\nods include standard rescaling techniques, e.g. based\
    \ on sim-\nple statistic descriptors of both datasets such as minimum,\nmaximum,\
    \ mean, and variance (Dorigo et al., 2010; Miralles\net al., 2010), linear regression\
    \ (Scipal et al., 2008), or CDF-\nmatching (Drusch et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2011).\
    \ Other studies\npropose the use of exponential ﬁlters or land surface models\n\
    to ﬁnd a robust relationship between the soil moisture dy-\nnamics observed at\
    \ different observation depths and in dif-\nferent observation spaces (Wagner\
    \ et al., 1999; Sabater et al.,\n2007; Albergel et al., 2008).\n5.4\nAdditional\
    \ science beneﬁts of the ISMN\nSince for the ﬁrst time a globally harmonized soil\
    \ moisture\ndataset is available, the ISMN may help to ﬁnd comprehen-\nsive answers\
    \ to fundamental science questions regarding soil\nmoisture and its role in the\
    \ integrated water cycle, such as:\n– Can we reﬁne our understanding of the memory\
    \ of soil\nmoisture (e.g., Entin et al., 2000)? How does it depend\non climate\
    \ variability, climate persistence and soil hy-\ndraulic properties? How do vegetation\
    \ characteristics\naffect this memory?\n– How is surface soil moisture dynamics\
    \ linked with that\nin the subsurface proﬁle? How does soil moisture at the\n\
    surface and below the surface respond to precipitation\nevents and drydowns?\n\
    Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 15, 1675–1698, 2011\nwww.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/15/1675/2011/\n\
    W. A. Dorigo et al.: The International Soil Moisture Network\n1693\n– Can long-term\
    \ trends and changes in the frequencies of\nextremes that have been regionally\
    \ observed in regional\nin situ observations (e.g., Robock et al., 2005) be ex-\n\
    trapolated to the global scale?\n– What are the functional relationships between\
    \ soil mois-\nture and evaporation (e.g. Jung et al., 2010)? How does\nit depend\
    \ on vegetation, soil type and structure?\nIn addition, existing knowledge on\
    \ the temporal stability and\nspatial correlation of soil moisture (e.g. Vachaud\
    \ et al., 1985;\nMart´ınez-Fern´andez and Ceballos, 2005; Cosh et al., 2008),\n\
    can now be strengthened with global evidence. Moreover,\nthere is a proven strong\
    \ relationship between soil moisture\nand the biogeochemical cycles (e.g. Ciais\
    \ et al., 2005) while,\nat the same time, our knowledge on how this interaction\
    \ ex-\nactly takes place is still very limited (van der Molen et al.,\n2011).\
    \ The ISMN may help to gain further inside in this pro-\ncess.\n6\nConclusions\
    \ and outlook\nWith the establishment of the ISMN data hosting center pre-\nsented\
    \ in this paper, a ﬁrst important step has been taken to-\nward a global soil\
    \ moisture observing system. Although soil\nmoisture is now recognized as an essential\
    \ climate variable\nby GCOS, the growth and continuity of this effort will de-\n\
    pend upon the commitment of ﬁnancial support and the co-\noperation of data providers\
    \ on a long-term basis. To reach\nthe goal of a fully integrated global soil moisture\
    \ observing\nsystem it will be necessary to establish, expand and improve\ncurrent\
    \ soil moisture observations, both in situ and remotely\nsensed. The in situ efforts\
    \ should focus on:\n– Developing a coordinated plan for soil moisture net-\nworks\
    \ at both the national and international levels.\n– Designing a supersite program,\
    \ approximately satellite\nfootprint size regions with high density measurements,\n\
    needed to provide the comprehensive datasets required\nfor satellite sensor evaluation\
    \ and calibration, and to\nprovide a basis for developing soil wetness algorithms\n\
    for satellite measurements and the evaluation of cli-\nmate model outputs. For\
    \ example, we expect the newly\nestablished National Ecological Observatory Network\n\
    (NEON) in the US and the densely sampled watershed\nvalidation networks operated\
    \ by USDA, to help serve as\na model for such efforts.\n– Enhancing consistency\
    \ and standardization of measure-\nments, data, and metadata.\n– Striving for\
    \ data continuity and automation.\n– Advancing data exchange.\nThe positive and\
    \ vital contributions of international orga-\nnizations such as WCRP, GEWEX and\
    \ GEO, the support of\nSpace Agencies, and the voluntary efforts of numerous in-\n\
    dividual scientists contributing to the ISMN have raised the\nconﬁdence that the\
    \ consciousness and willingness to realize\nsuch an integrated soil moisture observing\
    \ system are ubiq-\nuitous.\nFinally, we would like to emphasize that the ISMN\
    \ is a\ngrowing entity animated by the scientiﬁc community itself.\nWe therefore\
    \ solicit users to download, use, and give feed-\nback on the datasets currently\
    \ contained in the database, and\ninvite potential networks to enrich the collection\
    \ by shar-\ning their data with the ISMN. As was demonstrated by the\nsuccess\
    \ the Global Soil Moisture Data Bank (Robock et al.,\n2000), the beneﬁt of sharing\
    \ soil moisture data free of cost\nwith the scientiﬁc community is valuable not\
    \ only for data\nusers but also for the networks. Networks may become em-\nbedded\
    \ as key networks in international calibration and val-\nidation activities or\
    \ climate monitoring programs, e.g. like\nhappened to the ﬂux tower sites participating\
    \ to FLUXNET\n(Baldocchi et al., 2001) or the stations participating to the\n\
    Baseline Surface Radiation Network (Ohmura et al., 1998).\nThis in turn may lead\
    \ to vast international scientiﬁc recog-\nnition and pave the way for access to\
    \ extended funding re-\nsources.\nAcknowledgements. We greatly thank all data\

    Get rights and content Abstract The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are
    developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat
    Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching
    the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume
    responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing
    data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth
    orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI),
    will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185 km swath
    with a 30 m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15 m panchromatic band.
    The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data
    for two thermal bands with a 100 m resolution over a 185 km swath. Both sensors
    offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will
    coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground
    system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing
    well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free
    distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a
    December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite “Landsat 8” following
    launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat
    data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive
    with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow
    long-term studies of regional and global land cover change. Highlights ► NASA

    (NASA) and the Department of Interior (DOI) United States Geological Survey (USGS)
    will build, launch, and operate the next Landsat satellite through a cooperative
    effort called the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA leads the development
    and launch of the satellite observatory consisting of the spacecraft and its sensor
    payload. USGS leads the development of the ground system and will assume responsibility
    for satellite operations following launch and an initial on-orbit checkout period.
    The LDCM is the follow-on mission to Landsat 7 and USGS has committed to christening
    the LDCM observatory as Landsat 8 once it has achieved orbit and begun nominal
    operations. This paper will use the current “LDCM” designation to refer to the
    satellite subsystems and readers are reminded here that “LDCM” and “Landsat 8”
    refer to the same satellite and may be used interchangeably in other papers and
    references. We describe here the LDCM satellite system currently in development
    including the mission operations concept, the two-sensor payload, the spacecraft,
    the launch vehicle, and the ground system. The description includes discussions
    of requirements and specifications along with a presentation of some initial pre-launch
    test data for sensor performance. Additionally, we describe the planned LDCM data
    products that will be available to the public for free. This development is on
    schedule for a December 2012 launch with nominal system operations beginning in
    early 2013. 2. Background 2.1. Implementation strategy The current development
    of the LDCM satellite system represents the third mission implementation strategy
    attempted by NASA and USGS. The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 (U.S. Code
    Title 15, Chapter 82) directed the federal agencies involved in the Landsat program
    to study options for a successor mission to Landsat 7, ultimately launched in
    1999 with a five-year design life, that maintained data continuity with the Landsat
    system. The Act further expressed a preference for the development of this successor
    system by the private sector as long as such a development met the goals of data
    continuity. In accordance with this guidance, NASA and USGS initially attempted
    to form a public–private partnership where the U.S. Government would procure data
    meeting continuity requirements from a privately owned and operated satellite.
    Following system formulation studies, NASA released a request for proposals (RFP)
    in January 2003 soliciting a private sector partner to share the risk and cost
    of system development in return for ownership of the satellite and data sales
    to the U.S. Government. NASA in consultation with the USGS subsequently declined
    to accept any of the proposals submitted in response to the RFP and canceled the
    solicitation in November 2003. NASA concluded that the proposals failed to meet
    the objective of forming a fair and equitable partnership leading to a reduction
    in the Government''s cost for acquiring Landsat data. NASA and USGS adopted the
    name “Landsat Data Continuity Mission” for this initial implementation approach
    and the name has persisted to the subsequent strategies. The Executive Office
    of the President convened an interagency working group in the wake of the solicitation
    termination to identify other options for LDCM implementation. An August 2004
    memorandum from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) directed NASA
    to implement the group''s recommendation to incorporate Landsat-type sensors on
    the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS)
    satellite platforms (Marburger, 2004). The group''s intent was to transition the
    Landsat land observation program from the NASA research and development environment
    to the operational environment envisioned for the NPOESS program. NASA began working
    with the NPOESS Integrated Program Office to specify requirements for a Landsat-type
    sensor, labeled the Operational Land Imager (OLI), and to identify the necessary
    accommodations aboard the NPOESS spacecraft. The technical and programmatic challenges
    of integrating a moderate resolution Landsat sensor onto a spacecraft already
    designed for a crowded payload of coarser resolution sensors soon became apparent.
    Recognition of these challenges and the impact on both the LDCM and NPOESS projects
    led to a final change in the LDCM strategy. A second OSTP memorandum dated December
    23, 2005 superseded the 2004 memorandum and directed NASA and the USGS to implement
    LDCM as a single “free-flyer” satellite (Marburger, 2005). The “free-flyer” designation
    provided guidance for the development and operation of a satellite system exclusively
    to meet LDCM requirements. NASA and USGS have since worked to implement this third
    strategy by developing the system described here. The strategic changes have delayed
    the LDCM launch to a point more than seven years past the five-year design life
    of Landsat 7. 2.2. LDCM requirements The basic LDCM requirements remained consistent
    through the extended strategic formulation phase of mission development. The 1992
    Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (U.S. Code Title 15, Chapter 82) established data
    continuity as a fundamental goal and defined continuity as providing data “sufficiently
    consistent (in terms of acquisition geometry, coverage characteristics, and spectral
    characteristics) with previous Landsat data to allow comparisons for global and
    regional change detection and characterization.” This direction has provided the
    guiding principal for specifying LDCM requirements from the beginning with the
    most recently launched Landsat satellite, Landsat 7, serving as a technical minimum
    standard for system performance and data quality. The 1992 Land Remote Sensing
    Policy Act (U.S. Code Title 15, Chapter 82) also transferred responsibility for
    Landsat 7 development from the private sector to the U.S. Government. An October
    2000 amendment to a 1994 Presidential Decision Directive (Executive Office of
    the President, 2000) ultimately assigned Landsat 7 responsibility to NASA and
    USGS as an interagency partnership. NASA and USGS established several new practices
    for Landsat 7 to better serve the public relative to earlier Landsat missions
    (Irons & Masek, 2006). These practices included rigorous in-orbit calibration
    and performance monitoring of the Landsat 7 sensor, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus
    (ETM +), the systematic scheduling and collection of images providing coverage
    of the global land surface at least once per season, and the distribution of data
    products at a lower cost leading eventually to the current policy of distributing
    Landsat data for free. The interagency partnership persists intact for the LDCM
    and the partnership has propagated forward the practices established for Landsat
    7 to the LDCM requirements. The highest-level LDCM requirements, referred to as
    Level 1 requirements by NASA, are now captured in an internal NASA document called
    the “Earth Systematic Missions Program Plan.” This Plan states the mission objectives
    as follows: • collect and archive moderate-resolution, reflective multispectral
    image data affording seasonal coverage of the global land mass for a period of
    no less than five years; • collect and archive moderate-resolution, thermal multispectral
    image data affording seasonal coverage of the global land mass for a period of
    no less than three years; • ensure that LDCM data are sufficiently consistent
    with the data from the earlier Landsat missions, in terms of acquisition geometry,
    calibration, coverage characteristics, spectral and spatial characteristics, output
    product quality, and data availability to permit studies of land cover and land
    use change over multi-decadal periods; • and distribute standard LDCM data products
    to users on a nondiscriminatory basis and at no cost to the users. The plan goes
    on to specify baseline science requirements for LDCM data including the number
    of images collected per day, the spectral bands, the spatial resolution for each
    band, and the quality and characteristics of the LDCM standard data products.
    These objectives and requirements all flow down to lower-level specifications
    for the LDCM subsystems and will be discussed further below. 2.3. LDCM management
    NASA and USGS have well defined roles and responsibilities for the mission. NASA
    leads the development of the LDCM spacecraft and its sensor payload and is responsible
    for the launch. NASA also leads mission system engineering for the entire system
    and therefore acts as the system integrator with responsibility for mission assurance
    efforts through an on-orbit check out period. The NASA Associate Administrator
    for the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) has delegated program management responsibility
    through the Earth Science Division within SMD to the Earth Systematic Mission
    Program Manager at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Program management
    has assigned responsibility for technical implementation to the LDCM Project Office
    in the Flight Projects Directorate at GSFC. USGS leads the development of the
    ground system, excluding development of one ground element under NASA management,
    and will take responsibility for LDCM mission operations after completion of the
    on-orbit checkout period. Mission operations will include the scheduling of data
    collection along with receiving, archiving and distributing LDCM data. The USGS
    Director for Climate and Land-Use Change leads USGS program management for LDCM
    through the Land Remote Sensing Program. Responsibility for ground system implementation
    and LDCM operations is assigned to the USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science
    (EROS) Center. EROS maintains the U.S. archive of data from all of the previous
    Landsat satellites. 3. LDCM system overview and mission operations concept 3.1.
    System overview Following launch, the LDCM satellite system will consist of two
    major segments: the observatory and the ground system. The observatory consists
    of the spacecraft bus and its payload of two Earth observing sensors, the Operational
    Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). OLI and TIRS will collect
    the LDCM science data. The two sensors will coincidently collect multispectral
    digital images of the global land surface including coastal regions, polar ice,
    islands, and the continental areas. The spacecraft bus will store the OLI and
    TIRS data on an onboard solid-state recorder and then transmit the data to ground
    receiving stations. The ground system will provide the capabilities necessary
    for planning and scheduling the operations of the LDCM observatory and the capabilities
    necessary to manage the science data following transmission from the spacecraft.
    The real-time command and control sub-system for observatory operations is known
    as the Mission Operations Element (MOE). A primary and back-up Mission Operations
    Center (MOC) will house the MOE with the primary MOC residing at NASA GSFC. A
    Data Processing and Archive System (DPAS) at EROS will ingest, process, and archive
    all LDCM science and mission data returned from the LDCM observatory. The DPAS
    also provides a public interface to allow users to search for and receive data
    products over the internet. The DPAS will become an integral part of the USGS
    Landsat data archive system. 3.2. Mission operations concept The fundamental LDCM
    operations concept is to collect, archive, process, and distribute science data
    in a manner consistent with the operation of the Landsat 7 satellite system. To
    that end, the LDCM observatory will operate in a 716 km near-circular, near-polar,
    sun-synchronous orbit (728 km apogee, 704 km perigee, 705 km altitude at the equator).
    The observatory will have a 16-day ground track repeat cycle with an equatorial
    crossing at 10:00 a.m. (+/− 15 min) mean local time during the descending node
    of each orbit. In this orbit, the LDCM observatory will follow a sequence of fixed
    ground tracks (also known as paths) defined by the second Worldwide Reference
    System (WRS-2). WRS-2 is a path/row coordinate system used to catalog the image
    data acquired from the Landsat 4, Landsat 5, and Landsat 7 satellites. These three
    satellites have all followed the WRS-2 paths and all of the science data are referenced
    to this coordinate system. Likewise, the LDCM science data will be referenced
    to the WRS-2 as part of the ground processing and archiving performed by the DPAS
    (Irons & Dwyer, 2010). The LDCM launch and initial orbit adjustments are planned
    to place the observatory in an orbit close to Landsat 5 providing an eight-day
    offset between Landsat 7 and LDCM coverage of each WRS-2 path. OLI and TIRS will
    collect the LDCM science data on orbit. The MOC will send commands to the satellite
    once every 24 h via S-band communications from the Ground Network Element (GNE)
    within the ground system (Fig. 1) to schedule daily data collections. A Long Term
    Acquisition Plan (LTAP-8) will set priorities for collecting data along the WRS-2
    ground paths covered in a particular 24-hour period. LTAP-8 will be modeled on
    the systematic data acquisition plan developed for Landsat 7 (Arvidson et al.,
    2006). OLI and TIRS will collect data jointly to provide coincident images of
    the same surface areas. The MOC will nominally schedule the collection of 400
    OLI and TIRS scenes per day where each scene is a digital image covering a 185-by-180
    km surface area. The objective of scheduling and data collection will be to provide
    near cloud-free coverage of the global landmass each season of the year. Download

    Drawing of the Operational Land Imager (Courtesy of Ball Aerospace & Technologies
    Corporation). The LDCM observatory will initially store OLI and TIRS data on board
    in a solid-state recorder. The MOC will command the observatory to transmit the
    stored data to the ground via an X-band data stream from an all-earth omni antenna.
    The LDCM GNE will receive the data at several stations and these stations will
    forward the data to the DPAS at EROS. In addition, data will be transmitted directly
    from the observatory to a network of international stations operated under the
    sponsorship of foreign governments referred to as International Cooperators (ICs).
    Data management and distribution by the ICs will be in accordance with bilateral
    agreements between each IC and the U.S. Government. The DPAS will ingest, store,
    and archive the data received from the GNE and will also generate LDCM data products
    for distribution. The DPAS will merge the OLI and TIRS data for each WRS-2 scene
    to create a single product containing the data from both sensors. The data from
    both sensors will be radiometrically corrected and co-registered to a cartographic
    projection with corrections for terrain distortion to create a standard orthorectified
    digital image called the Level 1T product. The interface to the LDCM data archive
    is called the User Portal and it will allow anyone in the general public to search
    the archive, view browse images, and request data products that will be distributed
    electronically through the internet for no charge. 4. The Earth observing sensors
    The OLI and TIRS represent an evolution in Landsat sensor technology. All earlier
    Landsat sensors (with the exception of the little-used Return Beam Vidicon sensors
    aboard the first three Landsat satellites), the Multispectral Scanner System (MSS)
    instruments, the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensors, and the ETM+, were “whiskbroom”
    imaging radiometers that employed oscillating mirrors to scan detector fields
    of view cross-track to achieve the total instrument fields of view. In contrast,
    both OLI and TIRS use long, linear arrays of detectors aligned across the instrument
    focal planes to collect imagery in a “push broom” manner. This technical approach
    offers both advantages and challenges as shown by a “push broom” sensor called
    the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) flown on the Earth Observing-1 satellite (Ungar
    et al., 2003), a technology demonstration mission. The major advantage of the
    push broom design is improved signal-to-noise performance relative to a “whiskbroom”
    sensor. The challenges include achieving spectral and radiometric response uniformity
    across the focal plane with the attendant need to cross-calibrate thousands of
    detectors per spectral band. Co-registration of the data from multiple spectral
    bands also presents some difficulty. 4.1. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) NASA
    released an RFP in January 2007 for an OLI to acquire visible, near infrared,
    and short wave infrared image data from an LDCM spacecraft. The RFP specified
    instrument performance rather than a specific technology although the specifications
    were informed by the performance of the ALI push broom sensor. NASA awarded a
    contract to Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation (BATC) in July 2007 after
    an evaluation of proposals. BATC conducted a successful OLI critical design review
    in October 2008, and proceeded to instrument assembly, integration, and test.
    The OLI has completed environmental testing and is scheduled to ship in August
    2011 for integration onto the LDCM spacecraft. Environmental testing included
    vibration tests to ensure that the instrument will survive launch, electromagnetic
    compatibility and electromagnetic interference testing to ensure that the instrument
    neither causes nor is susceptible to electromagnetic disturbances, and thermal
    balance and thermal cycling in a thermal vacuum chamber to verify thermal control
    performance and to ensure that the sensor can endure the space environment. 4.1.1.
    OLI requirements The OLI requirements specified a sensor that collects image data
    for nine spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m (15 m panchromatic band)
    over a 185 km swath from the nominal 705 km LDCM spacecraft altitude. Key requirements
    include: a five-year design life; spectral band widths, center wavelengths, and
    cross-track spectral uniformity; radiometric performance including absolute calibration
    uncertainty, signal-to-noise ratios, polarization sensitivity, and stability;
    ground sample distances and edge response; image geometry and geolocation including
    spectral band co-registration; and the delivery of data processing algorithms.
    The OLI is required to collect data for all of the ETM + shortwave bands to partially
    fulfill the data continuity mandate. Table 1 provides the specified spectral bandwidths
    in comparison to the ETM + spectral bands along with the required ground sample
    distances (GSDs). The widths of several OLI bands are refined to avoid atmospheric
    absorption features within ETM + bands. The biggest change occurs in OLI band
    5 (0.845–0.885 μm) to exclude a water vapor absorption feature at 0.825 μm in
    the middle of the ETM + near infrared band (band 4; 0.775–0.900 μm). The OLI panchromatic
    band, band 8, is also narrower relative to the ETM + panchromatic band to create
    greater contrast between vegetated areas and surfaces without vegetation in panchromatic
    images. Additionally, two new bands are specified for the OLI; a blue band (band
    1; 0.433–0.453 μm) principally for ocean color observations in coastal zones and
    a shortwave infrared band (band 9; 1.360–1.390 μm) that falls over a strong water
    vapor absorption feature and will allow the detection of cirrus clouds within
    OLI images (cirrus clouds will appear bright while most land surfaces will appear
    dark through cloud-free atmospheres containing water vapor). Note that the refined
    near-infrared band (band 5) and the new shortwave infrared band (band 9) both
    closely match spectral bands collected by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites. Note also that the OLI band widths are
    required to remain within plus-or-minus 3% of the specified band widths across
    the field-of-view. Table 1. OLI and ETM + spectral bands. OLI spectral bands ETM
    + spectral bands # Band width (μm) GSD (m) # Band width (μm) GSD (m) 1 0.433–0.453

    30 3 0.630–0.690 30 5 0.845–0.885 30 4 0.775–0.900 30 6 1.560–1.660 30 5 1.550–1.750
    30 7 2.100–2.300 30 7 2.090–2.350 30 8 0.500–0.680 15 8 0.520–0.900 30 9 1.360–1.390
    30 NASA placed stringent radiometric performance requirements on the OLI. The
    OLI is required to produce data calibrated to an uncertainty of less than 5% in
    terms of absolute, at-aperture spectral radiance and to an uncertainty of less
    than 3% in terms of top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance for each of the spectral
    bands in Table 1. These values are comparable to the uncertainties achieved by
    ETM + calibration. The OLI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) specifications, however,
    were set higher than ETM + performance based on results from the ALI. Table 2
    lists the OLI specifications next to ETM + performance (Markham et al., 2003)
    for ratios at specified levels of typical, Ltyp, and high, Lhigh, spectral radiance
    for each spectral band. Commensurate with the higher ratios, OLI will quantize
    data to 12 bits as compared to the eight-bit data produced by the TM and ETM +
    sensors. Table 2. Specified OLI signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) compared to ETM +

    a focal plane with long arrays of photosensitive detectors (Irons & Dwyer, 2010).
    A four-mirror anastigmatic telescope focuses incident radiation onto the focal
    plane while providing a 15-degree field-of-view covering a 185 km across-track
    ground swath from the nominal LDCM observatory altitude (Fig. 1). Periodic sampling
    of the across-track detectors as the observatory flies forward along a ground
    track forms the multispectral digital images. The detectors are divided into 14
    modules arranged in an alternating pattern along the centerline of the focal plane
    (Fig. 2). Data are acquired from nearly 7000 across-track detectors for each spectral
    band with the exception of the 15 m panchromatic band that requires over 13,000
    detectors. The spectral differentiation is achieved by interference filters arranged
    in a “butcher-block” pattern over the detector arrays in each module. Silicon
    PIN (SiPIN) detectors collect the data for the visible and near-infrared spectral
    bands (Bands 1 to 4 and 8) while Mercury–Cadmium–Telluride (MgCdTe) detectors
    are used for the shortwave infrared bands (Bands 6, 7, and 9). Download : Download
    high-res image (392KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Drawing of
    the OLI focal plane (Courtesy of Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation). The
    OLI telescope will view the Earth through a baffle extending beyond the aperture
    stop. A shutter wheel assembly sits between the baffle and the aperture stop.
    A hole in the shutter wheel will allow light to enter the telescope during nominal
    observations and the wheel will rotate when commanded to a closed position and
    act as a shutter preventing light from entering the instrument. A second baffle,
    for solar views, intersects the Earth-view baffle at a 90° angle and a three-position
    diffuser wheel assembly dissects the angle. A hole in the diffuser wheel allows
    light to enter the telescope for nominal Earth observations. Each of the other
    two wheel positions introduces one of two solar diffuser panels to block the optical
    path through the Earth-view baffle. When the wheel is in either of these two positions,
    the solar-view baffle will be pointed at the sun and a diffuser panel will reflect
    solar illumination into the telescope. One position will hold a “working” panel
    that will be exposed regularly to sunlight while the other position will hold
    a “pristine” panel that will be exposed infrequently and used to detect changes
    in the “working” panel spectral reflectance due to solar exposure. Additionally,
    two stimulation lamp assemblies will be located just inside the telescope on the
    aperture stop. The two assemblies will each hold six small lamps inside an integrating
    hemisphere and will be capable of illuminating the full OLI focal plane through
    the telescope with the shutter closed. These assemblies, the shutter wheel, diffuser
    wheel, and stimulation lamp assemblies, constitute the OLI calibration subsystem
    and their use for calibration is discussed further below. 4.1.3. Pre-launch OLI
    performance BATC has conducted robust testing of OLI performance in accordance
    with their proposal and contract. These prelaunch tests indicate that OLI performance
    meets specification with requirements exceeded in most cases. Fig. 3, Fig. 4,
    for example, show SNRs derived from data collected by the OLI while illuminated
    by known spectral radiance from an integrating sphere traceable to National Institute
    of Standards and Technology sources. The OLI was operating within a thermal-vacuum
    chamber in a space-like environment when the data were collected. The observed
    SNRs are substantially greater than the required SNRs for all spectral bands at
    both typical, Ltyp, and high, Lhigh, levels of spectral radiance. Download : Download

    band, for each of the focal plane modules. The test data were collected with the
    OLI in the thermal-vacuum chamber and illuminated by narrow-band radiation from
    a double-monochrometer. The plot indicates that the OLI meets band 5 specifications
    for band width, band center, spectral flatness, and spectral uniformity across
    the focal plane. Test data show that these specifications were met for all of
    the spectral bands. Download : Download high-res image (155KB) Download : Download

    focal plane module (FPM). 4.2. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) Thermal imaging
    was initially excluded from the LDCM requirements in a departure from the data
    continuity mandate. Several earlier Landsat satellites collected data for a thermal
    spectral band in addition to data for shortwave spectral bands. The MSS on Landsat
    3 collected data for a single thermal band with a 240 m spatial resolution (these
    data were not extensively used due to performance problems), the TM sensors on
    Landsat 4 and Landsat 5 collected a single band of thermal data with a 120 m resolution,
    and the ETM + on Landsat 7 continues to collect thermal data for a single band
    with a 60 m resolution. The benefits of thermal images were not deemed worth the
    cost of the capability in the early LDCM formulation efforts. Potential private
    sector partners did not see a sufficient return on investment during the attempt
    to form a public–private LDCM partnership. This perspective persisted during the
    effort to incorporate Landsat sensors on NPOESS platforms and the NPOESS platform
    manifest left inadequate space for a separate thermal sensor. Applications of
    Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + thermal data, however, began to blossom during
    this period due to the increased attention to rigorous calibration and to the
    systematic, reliable collection of data. The application of Landsat data to measuring
    water consumption over irrigated agricultural fields, in particular, began to
    emerge as a viable tool for water resources management in the semi-arid western
    U.S. (Allen et al., 2005). When NASA received direction to implement LDCM as a
    free-flyer satellite, western state water management agencies led by the Western
    States Water Council began to advocate for the restoration of thermal imaging
    to LDCM requirements (Western States Water Council, 2010). NASA reacted by first
    procuring a satellite with sufficient space, mass, and power to accommodate the
    addition of a thermal sensor in a payload with an OLI. Next, NASA Headquarters
    directed GSFC to conduct instrument concept studies with the goal of defining
    a thermal sensor that could be built in time to prevent any delay in the December
    2012 launch data set for an LDCM satellite carrying only an OLI. GSFC designed
    the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and laid out an accelerated schedule for its
    development. NASA Headquarters gave approval in December 2009 for GSFC to build
    TIRS in house and add the sensor to the LDCM payload while holding to the 2012
    launch date. The LDCM project offices at both GSFC and EROS are currently meeting
    the challenge of this late addition with a rapid instrument development effort,
    spacecraft accommodations for this second sensor, and the ground system modifications
    necessary to capture, archive, and process TIRS data in conjunction with OLI data.
    4.2.1. TIRS requirements TIRS requirements are specified in a manner similar to
    the OLI requirements. The specifications require TIRS to collect image data for
    two thermal infrared spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 120 m across
    a 185 km swath from the nominal 705 km Landsat altitude (Table 3). The two bands
    were selected to enable atmospheric correction of the thermal data using a split-window
    algorithm (Caselles et al., 1998) and represent an advancement over the single-band
    thermal data collected by previous Landsat satellites (the ETM + and TM sensors
    collect data for a 10.0–12.5 μm thermal band). The 120 m spatial resolution is
    a step back from the 60 m ETM + thermal band resolution and was specified as a
    compromise to the necessity of a rapid sensor development. The 120 m resolution
    is deemed sufficient for water consumption measurements over fields irrigated
    by center pivot systems (note that the instrument design exceeds requirements
    with a 100 m spatial resolution). These fields dot the U.S. Great Plains and many
    other areas across the world as circles 400 m to 800 m in diameter. Table 3. TIRS
    spectral bands and spatial resolution (as built). Band # Center wavelength (μm)
    Minimum lower band edge (μm) Maximum upper band edge (μm) Spatial resolution (m)
    10 10.9 10.6 11.2 100 11 12.0 11.5 12.5 100 Like OLI, the TIRS requirements also
    specify cross-track spectral uniformity; radiometric performance including absolute
    calibration uncertainty, polarization sensitivity, and stability; ground sample
    distances and edge response; image geometry and geolocation including spectral
    band co-registration. The TIRS noise limits are specified in terms of noise-equivalent-change-in-temperature
    (NEΔT) rather than the signal-to-noise ratios used for OLI specifications (Table
    4). The radiometric calibration uncertainty is specified to be less than 2% in
    terms of absolute, at-aperture spectral radiance for targets between 260 K and
    330 K (less than 4% for targets between 240 K and 260 K and for targets between
    330 K and 360 K). Table 4. TIRS saturation radiance and noise-equivalent-change-in-temperature
    (NEΔT) specifications. Band # Saturation temperature Saturation radiance NEΔT
    at 240 K NEΔT at 300 K NEΔT at 360 K 10 360 K 20.5 W/m2 sr μm 0.80 K 0.4 K 0.27
    K 11 360 K 17.8 W/m2 sr μm 0.71 K 0.4 K 0.29 K A major difference between OLI
    and TIRS specifications is that TIRS requires only a three-year design life. This
    relaxation was specified to help expedite the TIRS development. The designers
    were able to save schedule through more selective redundancy in subsystem components
    rather than the more robust redundancy required for a five-year design life. 4.2.2.
    TIRS design Like OLI, TIRS is also a push broom sensor employing a focal plane
    with long arrays of photosensitive detectors (Fig. 6). A four-element refractive
    telescope focuses an f/1.64 beam of thermal radiation onto a cryogenically cooled
    focal plane while providing a 15-degree field-of-view matching the 185 km across-track
    swath of the OLI. The focal plane holds three modules with quantum-well-infrared-photodetector
    (QWIP) arrays arranged in an alternating pattern along the focal plane centerline
    (Fig. 7). Each module is covered by spectral filters that transmit the two specified
    band widths. Each QWIP array is 640 detectors long cross-track allowing for overlap
    between the arrays to produce an effective linear array of 1850 pixels spanning
    the 185 km ground swath with a 100 m spatial resolution. TIRS will be the first
    spaceflight instrument to use QWIP arrays. A mirror controlled by a scene select
    mechanism will flip the field-of-view between nadir (Earth), an internal blackbody,
    and a deep space view for on-orbit radiometric calibration without changing the
    nominal earth-viewing attitude of the LDCM spacecraft (Irons and Dwyer, 2010,
    Montanaro et al., 2011). Download : Download high-res image (457KB) Download :

    A mechanical, two-stage cryocooler (Fig. 8) will cool the focal plane to permit
    the QWIP detectors to function at a required temperature of 43 K. BATC was selected
    to build the cryocooler through a competitive proposal process and BATC delivered
    the cryocooler to GSFC for instrument integration in April 2011. The cryocooler
    has the same three-year design life as the rest of the instrument. Two radiators
    will be mounted to the side of the instrument structure, one to dissipate heat
    from the cryocooler and the other to passively maintain a constant TIRS telescope
    temperature of 185 K. Download : Download high-res image (597KB) Download : Download

    & Technologies Corporation). 4.2.3. TIRS status All of the TIRS subsystems have
    successfully completed environmental testing as of June 2011 and have been delivered
    to GSFC for integration and test at the assembled instrument level. These subsystems
    include: the cryocooler; the scene select mechanism; the integrated telescope,
    focal plane, and focal plane electronics; the main electronics box; harnessing
    to electrically connect the subsystems; thermal hardware to monitor and maintain
    instrument temperatures; and the structure that will hold it all together on the
    spacecraft. The next steps are to integrate these subsystems into the assembled
    instrument, perform pre-launch calibration and performance characterization, and
    conduct environmental testing. TIRS is scheduled to ship from GSFC for integration
    onto the spacecraft in December 2011. 4.3. On-orbit sensor calibration The LDCM
    will perform rigorous on-orbit sensor calibrations to monitor the in-flight performance
    of OLI and TIRS and to develop the requisite radiometric and geometric correction
    and calibration coefficients for generating the LDCM science data products. Instrument
    calibration through the operational life of the mission involves observation of
    the on-board calibration sources augmented by ground-based measurements. The major
    observations for in-flight calibration data collection are summarized in Table
    5. Table 5. LDCM on-orbit calibration observations. Type of calibration observation
    Frequency of calibration data collection Closed OLI shutter Twice every Earth
    imaging orbit (approximately every 40 min) TIRS black body Twice every Earth imaging
    orbit TIRS deep space Twice every Earth imaging orbit OLI stimulation lamps Once
    per day OLI solar diffuser panel Once per week Lunar Once per month Earth surface
    calibration sites Variable The calibration observations will be made at different
    frequencies. The OLI shutter will be closed before the first scheduled Earth imaging
    interval in an orbit and then again just after the last imaging interval to provide
    the dark bias in the radiometric responses across the OLI detectors. The OLI stimulation
    lamps will be turned on once per week with the shutter closed to monitor stability
    of the OLI radiometric responses to the lamp illumination Similarly, the TIRS
    scene select mirror will point the TIRS field of view at deep space once before
    and once after the Earth imaging portion of each orbit to determine the dark bias
    in the radiometric responses across the TIRS focal plane. The select mirror will
    also point the field of view at the TIRS black body after each deep space view
    to monitor the radiometric response to the radiance emitted from the black body
    at a known and controlled temperature. The OLI “working” diffuser panel will be
    observed once per week and will serve as the primary source for a reflectance-based
    radiometric calibration of the OLI. The observation will require an LDCM spacecraft
    maneuver to point the solar-view baffle directly at the sun when the spacecraft
    is in the vicinity of the northern solar terminus. The solar diffuser wheel will
    rotate the panel into position to diffusely reflect the illumination entering
    the baffle into the telescope. The spectral reflectance of the working and pristine
    panels will be measured pre-launch and the pristine panel will be observed infrequently
    to monitor changes to the working panel reflectance. The LDCM spacecraft will
    also maneuver once per month to provide the OLI a view of the moon near its full
    phase during the dark portion of the LDCM orbit. The lunar surface reflectance
    properties are stable and a number of Earth observing satellites have used the
    moon as a calibration source. For example, the EO-1 satellite pointed the ALI
    at the moon for calibration (Kieffer et al., 2003). The USGS Robotic Lunar Observatory
    in Flagstaff, Arizona provides a model that will be used to predict the lunar
    brightness for the view and illumination geometries at the times of OLI observations
    (Kieffer et al., 2003). The OLI lunar data will be used to validate the OLI radiometric
    calibration. OLI and TIRS will additionally collect data over a variety of Earth
    surface calibration sites at irregular intervals. The calibration sites include
    relatively homogenous sites such as the dry lake playa, Railroad Valley, near
    Ely, Nevada. Field measurements will be made of surface reflectance and atmospheric
    conditions as the LDCM passes over such sites to predict the spectral radiance
    received by the OLI. The predicted radiance will be used to validate OLI radiometric
    calibration, an approach referred to as vicarious calibration. Likewise, data
    will be collected over lakes where instrumented buoys measure the surface temperature
    of the water for the validation of TIRS radiometric calibration. A comprehensive
    set of geometric “super” sites will provide a number of ground control points
    with highly accurate locations and elevations. Images collected over these sites
    will be used to characterize geometric performance and calibrate the OLI and TIRS
    lines-of-sight. The sensors on the earlier Landsat satellites and many other Earth
    observing sensors have collected similar surface observations for calibration.
    5. The LDCM spacecraft NASA awarded a contract for the LDCM spacecraft to General
    Dynamics Advanced Information Systems (GDAIS) in April 2008. Orbital Science Corporation
    (Orbital) subsequently acquired the spacecraft manufacturing division of GDAIS
    in April 2010. Orbital has thus assumed responsibility for the design and fabrication
    of the LDCM spacecraft bus, integration of the two sensors onto the bus, satellite-level
    testing, on-orbit satellite check-out, and continuing on-orbit engineering support
    under GSFC contract management (Irons & Dwyer, 2010). The specified design life
    is five years with an additional requirement to carry sufficient fuel to maintain
    the LDCM orbit for 10 years; the hope is that the operational lives of the sensors
    and spacecraft will exceed the design lives and fuel will not limit extended operations.
    The spacecraft design calls for a three-axis stabilized vehicle built primarily
    of aluminum honeycomb structure with a hexagonal cross-section. It is being built
    in Orbital''s spacecraft manufacturing facility in Gilbert, Arizona. 5.1. Spacecraft
    Design The spacecraft will supply power, orbit and attitude control, communications,
    and data storage for OLI and TIRS. The spacecraft consists of the mechanical subsystem
    (primary structure and deployable mechanisms), command and data handling subsystem,
    attitude control subsystem, electrical power subsystem, radio frequency (RF) communications
    subsystem, the hydrazine propulsion subsystem and thermal control subsystem. All
    the components, except for the propulsion module, will be mounted on the exterior
    of the primary structure. A 9 × 0.4 m deployable solar array will generate power
    that will charge the spacecraft''s 125 amp-hour nickel–hydrogen (Ni–H2) battery.
    A 3.14-terabit solid-state data recorder will provide data storage aboard the
    spacecraft and an earth-coverage X-band antenna will transmit OLI and TIRS data
    either in real time or played back from the data recorder. The OLI and TIRS will
    be mounted on an optical bench at the forward end of the spacecraft (Fig. 9).

    Fig. 9. Drawing of the LDCM Observatory (Courtesy of Orbital Sciences Corporation).
    A successful spacecraft critical design review was held in October 2009. When
    fully assembled, the spacecraft without the instruments will be approximately
    3 m high and 2.4 × 2.4 m across with a mass of 2071 kg fully loaded with fuel.
    The spacecraft with its two integrated sensors will be referred to as the LDCM
    observatory. The observatory is scheduled to ship from the manufacturing facility
    to the launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California in September 2012.
    5.2. On-board data collection and transmission The LDCM observatory will daily
    receive a load of software commands transmitted from the ground. These command
    loads will tell the observatory when to capture, store, and transmit image data
    from the OLI and TIRS. The daily command load will cover the subsequent 72 h of
    operations with the commands for the overlapping 48 h overwritten each day. This
    precaution will be taken to ensure that sensor and spacecraft operations continue
    in the event of a one or two day failure to successfully transmit or receive commands.
    The observatory''s Payload Interface Electronics (PIE) will ensure that image
    intervals are captured in accordance with the daily command loads. The OLI and
    TIRS will be powered on continuously during nominal operations to maintain the
    thermal balance of the two instruments. The two sensors'' detectors will thus
    continuously produce signals that are digitized and sent to the PIE at an average
    rate of 265 megabits per second (Mbps) for the OLI and 26.2 Mbps for TIRS. Ancillary
    data such as sensor and select spacecraft housekeeping telemetry, calibration
    data, and other data necessary for image processing will also be sent to the PIE.
    The PIE will receive the OLI, TIRS, and ancillary data, merge these data into
    a mission data stream, identify the mission data intervals scheduled for collection,
    perform a lossless compression of the OLI data (TIRS data will not be compressed)
    using the Rice algorithm (Rice et al., 1993), and then send the compressed OLI
    data and the uncompressed TIRS data to the 3.14 terabit solid-state recorder (SSR).
    The PIE will also identify those image intervals scheduled for real time transmission
    and will send those data directly to the observatory''s X-band transmitter. The
    International Cooperator receiving stations will only receive real time transmissions
    and the PIE will also send a copy of these data to the on-board SSR for playback
    and transmission to the LDCM Ground Network Element (GNE) receiving stations (USGS
    will capture all of the data transmitted to International Cooperators). Recall
    that OLI and TIRS will collect data coincidently and therefore the mission data
    streams from the PIE will contain both OLI and TIRS data as well as ancillary
    data. The observatory will broadcast mission data files from its X-band, earth-coverage
    antenna. The transmitter will be able to send data to the antenna on multiple
    virtual channels providing for a total data rate of 384 Mbps. The observatory
    will transmit real time data, SSR playback data, or both real-time data and SSR
    data depending on the time of day and the ground stations within view of the satellite.
    Transmissions from the earth coverage antenna allow a ground station to receive
    mission data as long as the observatory is within view of the station antenna.
    6. The LDCM launch vehicle The LDCM observatory will launch from Space Launch
    Complex-3E at Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard an Atlas V 401 launch vehicle built
    by the United Launch Alliance (ULA). This rocket is an evolved expendable launch
    vehicle capable of placing a 9370 kg satellite in low-Earth orbit. This capability
    offers ample mass margin for the LDCM observatory. A 4 m-diameter extended payload
    fairing will encapsulate the observatory atop the rocket through launch. The NASA
    Kennedy Space Center selected the Atlas V 401 for LDCM in December 2009. 7. The
    LDCM ground system The LDCM ground system will perform two main functions. The
    first will be to command and control the LDCM observatory in orbit. The second
    will be to manage the data transmitted from the observatory. The daily software
    command loads that control the observatory will originate within the LDCM Mission
    Operations Center (MOC) at GSFC and will be transmitted to the observatory from
    the antenna of the LDCM Ground Network Element (GNE). The data transmitted by
    the observatory will be received by the GNE and then sent to the Data Processing
    and Archive System (DPAS) at EROS. The DPAS will archive the data and produce
    the LDCM data products distributed for science and applications. USGS manages
    ground system development and USGS successfully conducted a Ground System critical
    design review in March 2010. 7.1. The LDCM Mission Operations Center (MOC) A flight
    operations team (FOT) will operate two computer systems within the MOC, the Collection
    Activity Planning Element (CAPE) and the Mission Operations Element (MOE). The
    CAPE will plan science data collection by building activity requests for the LDCM
    imaging sensors each day. The MOE will translate the activity requests into software
    command loads transmitted to the observatory. The CAPE collection activity requests
    will include the following: requests supporting the LDCM Long-Term Acquisition
    Plan-8 (LTAP-8); International Cooperator requests; requests for observations
    of calibration sites; and special requests. Within the CAPE, LTAP-8 will address
    the mission objective of providing global coverage of the landmass on a seasonal
    basis. Each day the LTAP-8 will identify the WRS-2 scenes within view of the observatory
    during the next 72 h. For each of those three days, it will place scenes in a
    priority order for science data collection. The process will repeat every day
    with priorities reset for the overlapping 48 h. To set priorities, the LTAP-8
    will use historical cloud fraction climatology and daily cloud cover predictions
    to minimize cloud contamination, will analyze historical records of vegetation
    indices to identify seasonal windows within which to capture vegetation dynamics,
    will account for data collection during previous observatory overpasses, and will
    constrain imaging in high latitude areas to periods of sufficient solar illumination.
    The LTAP-8 will thus be a daily instantiation of the long-term mission objective.
    Special image requests, such as images of natural disasters or images supporting
    unique science research campaigns, will be forwarded to an LDCM Data Acquisition
    Manager (DAM) responsible for coordinating and approving special requests. The
    DAM will designate special requests requiring urgent data distribution (e.g.,
    images supporting emergency response) as priority requests. The DAM will flag
    priority requests for expedited distribution through the entire image collection
    and production process. The CAPE will daily accept the priority list of scenes
    from the LTAP, factor in special requests and the other requests listed above,
    incorporate observatory scheduling constraints provided by the MOE, and then generate
    a scene-based list of images for collection by the imaging sensors over the next
    72 h with an average of 400 scenes requested per day. The CAPE will assign a unique
    identifier (WRS-2 path, row, and date) to each scene or imaging sensor activity
    in the request. The CAPE will share the identifiers with the MOE and the DPAS
    so that every individual scene request can be tracked throughout the entire planning,
    data collection, and data production process. The CAPE will pass its daily list
    of scene requests to the MOE where observatory and ground system activities will
    be planned, coordinated, and scheduled. The MOE will convert requested scenes
    to imaging intervals; that is, periods of time over which imaging sensor data
    are collected and stored on the solid state recorder (SSR). Imaging intervals
    will be assigned a unique identifier and the MOE will maintain a scene to interval
    mapping table. The MOE will put the imaging interval requests together with health
    and safety maintenance requirements to generate a daily schedule of observatory
    activities with health and safety always taking precedence. The MOE will convert
    the activities schedule to a daily command load transmitted to the observatory
    through S-band communications from the LDCM GNE. The GNE will consist of three
    transmission and data receiving stations: one at USGS EROS in Sioux Falls, South
    Dakota; one at Gilmore Creek, Alaska; and one at Svalbard, Norway. Initial versions
    of the CAPE and the MOE have been installed in the MOC. USGS EROS is developing
    the CAPE. NASA awarded a contract to The Hammers Company, Incorporated in September
    2008 to build the MOE. The MOC is currently engaged in a sequence of tests leading
    to launch readiness. Upgrades and revisions to the CAPE and the MOE will be delivered
    through the testing process until the full command-and-control capability is in
    place and proven ready for mission operations. USGS will assume responsibility
    for MOC operations following the launch and in-orbit check out of the LDCM observatory.
    7.2. The LDCM Data Processing and Archive System (DPAS) The USGS is also developing
    the DPAS to manage the mission data transmitted from the LDCM observatory. The
    DPAS will be operated at EROS along with the rest of its Landsat data archive
    and it will consist of several subsystems: Storage and Archive (SA), Ingest System
    (IS), Subsetter System (SS), Image Assessment System (IAS), Level 1 Product Generation
    System (LPGS), and User Portal (UP). These subsystems will work together to ingest,
    store, and archive LDCM data and will also generate LDCM data products for distribution.
    The GNE will send LDCM mission data to EROS over the internet. The Storage and
    Archive (SA) subsystem will first receive, store, and archive the data in the
    file-based format received from the GNE. These data will be archived offline with
    an additional backup copy archived off site. The SA will also perform all archive
    and storage functions in support of the other DPAS subsystem functions. The SA
    will pass data from the GNE to the Ingest System (IS). The IS will process the
    OLI and TIRS file-based mission data into an interval-based format for the on-line
    archive and will create the associated inventory metadata. In the process the
    IS will decompress the OLI data, analyze the data for impulse noise and saturated
    pixels, fill dropped data, eliminate duplicate data, correct ancillary data, generate
    metadata, and collect processing metrics. The data in this format will be called
    Level-0 Reformatted archive (L0Ra) data. The DPAS will use Hierarchical Data Format
    5 (HDF5) for the L0Ra data with the data grouped in multiple HDF5 files(Folk &
    Choi, 2004), one file per OLI or TIRS spectral band plus an ancillary data file,
    metadata file, and checksum file. Each raw 12-bit datum from OLI or TIRS will
    be stored across two eight-bit bytes. The IS will send the Level 0Ra data files
    to the SA for online storage. The L0Ra data will be the format archived for long-term
    storage and this archive will be part of the USGS National Satellite Land Remote
    Sensing Data Archive (NSLRSDA). The Subsetter System (SS) will retrieve L0Ra data
    from the SA and subset the OLI and TIRS L0Ra data into Landsat WRS-2 scenes for
    distribution or for the generation of Level-1 products and their associated metadata.
    These scene-based data sets will be called Level-0 Reformatted product (L0Rp)
    data and will be stored in the same HDF5 format as LORa data. No data processing
    will be performed up to this point with the exception of reformatting and filling
    in dropped data; L0Ra and L0Rp data files will contain raw OLI and TIRS data.
    With the use of 2 B for 12-bit data each uncompressed LDCM L0Rp data product will
    consist of 1384 MB for a full WRS-2 scene. In comparison, LDCM ETM + data products,
    with 8-bit data stored on single bytes, consist of less than 500 MB per scene.
    The DPAS will therefore store a daily average of 540 GB of L0Rp data given an
    average reception of 400 LDCM scenes per day. L0Rp data files will be sent back
    to the SA for on-line storage and the Level-1 Product Generation System (LPGS)
    will retrieve each L0Rp scene to radiometrically and geometrically correct the
    image data. The radiometric correction will transform raw OLI data to digital
    counts linearly scaled to top-of-the-atmosphere spectral reflectance and will
    transform raw TIRS data to digital counts linearly scaled to at-aperture spectral
    radiance. In both cases the LPGS will scale the raw 12-bit data to 16-bit integers
    for the Level 1 products. The geometric correction will use digital elevation
    models and ground control points to resample the radiometrically corrected data
    using cubic convolution and create orthorectified images of Earth''s surface registered
    to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) cartographic projection or, in the
    case of polar scenes, registered to the Polar Stereographic projection. The OLI
    pixels will be resampled to a 30 m ground sample distance for each spectral band
    with the exception of the panchromatic band resampled to a 15 m ground sample
    distance. The TIRS data will be over-sampled from the 100 m sensor resolution
    to a 30 m ground sample distance for alignment to the OLI data in the final product.
    The co-registered and terrain corrected OLI and TIRS data will be merged to create
    a single integrated Level-1 data product. The LPGS will also generate a full-resolution
    browse image and a quality assurance band that identifies filled-in pixels, identifies
    pixels obscured by terrain, and provides a cloud cover mask generated by an automated
    cloud cover assessment algorithm. The corrected digital images along with metadata
    and the quality assurance band will be referred to as Level-1T (L1T) data. The
    L1T data product will consist of a set of uncompressed GeoTiff files for each
    of the OLI and TIRS spectral bands, a file containing the scene-based metadata,
    and a file for the quality assessment band. LPGS will routinely generate a L1T
    product and a browse image for each of the 400 scenes collected per day. The Image
    Assessment System (IAS) will perform OLI and TIRS data characterization, analysis,
    and trending over the operational life of the mission to monitor LDCM observatory
    performance and to create the calibration parameters required by the LPGS for
    Level-1 product generation. Calibration coefficients will initially be derived
    from pre-launch OLI, TIRS, and integrated observatory testing. The IAS will update
    coefficients during mission life using on-orbit OLI and TIRS observations of observatory
    calibration sources, surface calibration sites, and the moon. The IAS will make
    the calibration coefficients available to accompany requests for L0Rp data as
    well as to International Cooperators to help them remain current and consistent
    with products distributed by the LDCM ground system. The IAS will also manage
    and update the auxiliary data sets used by the LPGS to create L1T products. These
    auxiliary data sets include a ground control point library and digital elevation
    models. The L0Rp and L1T WRS-2 scenes will constitute the standard LDCM science
    data products. The general public will be able to search, browse, and order L0Rp
    and L1T scenes from the User Portal (UP) on the internet. The UP will electronically
    transmit ordered scenes over the internet to LDCM data users at no cost to the
    users. Access through the UP will be nondiscriminatory and no restrictions will
    be placed on the use and redistribution of the data. These subsystems of the DPAS
    will together orchestrate LDCM data archiving, processing, and distribution to
    meet key requirements. L1T data product quality requirements include a geolocation
    uncertainty of less than 12 m circular error, a band-to-band co-registration uncertainty
    of less than 4.5 m for the OLI spectral bands, a co-registration uncertainty of
    less than 24 m for the two TIRS spectral bands, and a co-registration uncertainty
    of less than 30 m between the OLI and TIRS spectral bands where all of these uncertainties
    are at a 90% confidence level. Ground system performance requirements include
    the processing of 85% of the LDCM scenes to L1T products within 48 h of data collection
    by the observatory, the processing of 400 scenes per day to L1T, and distributing
    3500 scenes per day by the third year of the mission. Current best estimates indicate
    that the ground system will be capable of substantially exceeding these performance
    requirements with a predicted data processing latency of 12 h for 85% of the data,
    the capacity to process 890 scenes per day, and the ability to distribute 4700
    scenes per day. 8. Conclusion The end result of the LDCM satellite system development
    and operation will be the archiving and distribution of image data that meet the
    Landsat data continuity mandate. LDCM data will be comparable to data from the
    earlier Landsat satellites in terms of spatial resolution, swath width, global
    geographic coverage, and spectral coverage and this compatibility will allow comparisons
    to earlier data for land cover change detection and characterization over time.
    The Landsat satellite system will also offer advancements with respect to refined
    spectral band widths, two new shortwave spectral bands, two thermal spectral bands
    rather than one, improved radiometric performance, and a ground system with greater
    capacities for capturing, archiving, processing, and distributing data. The Landsat
    data archive managed by USGS provides the longest record of land cover change
    as viewed from space with almost 40 years of observations. The LDCM will extend
    that record with well-calibrated data providing global coverage each season of
    the year. The LDCM will be the first Landsat satellite launched during an era
    of free Landsat data distribution by the USGS. The relatively recent decision
    to provide data at no cost has fostered rapid advancements in the ability to process
    and analyze large numbers of Landsat images for long-term and large-scale assessments
    of change over time. Previously, the high cost of data hindered the development
    and applications of methodologies for handling such large volumes of Landsat data
    collected over multiple dates by the different sensors on the Landsat satellite
    series. Now, the true value of the Landsat program and its data archive is being
    revealed as researchers and managers begin to put the entire archive to work.
    A full return on investment in the LDCM requires a continuation of the current
    data policy so that its data may be added to the analyses and assessments without
    restriction. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The
    launch cannot occur too soon. The two Landsat satellites currently remaining in
    operation, Landsat 5 and Landsat 7, are both well beyond their design lives; Landsat
    5 was launched in 1984 with a three-year design life and Landsat 7 was launched
    in 1999 with a five-year design life. The operations of both are impaired by subsystem
    degradations and failures due to age. Additionally, land cover and land use are
    changing at accelerating rates due to population growth and advances in technology.
    These changes have profound consequences for society with respect to food and
    fiber production, water resource management, ecosystem services, air and water
    quality, health, and climate change. Landsat data are critical to characterizing,
    understanding, trending, and predicting global land cover change and a Landsat
    data gap would disrupt the time series of observations and impede the ability
    to monitor the global land surface. A successful LDCM will prevent a data gap
    and hopefully lead to an operational strategy for the Landsat program with the
    launch of a follow-on mission coinciding approximately with the end of the LDCM
    design life. References Allen et al., 2005 R.G. Allen, M. Tasumi, A.T. Morse,

    Get rights and content Highlights • A review of state-of-the-art Internet of Things
    applications for smart grid and home. • Definition of smart home holistic framework
    with key features from literature review. • General description of a smart home
    management model based on the holistic framework. • Discussion of current and
    future challenges for Internet of Things based solutions. Abstract Although Internet
    of Things (IoT) brings significant advantages over traditional communication technologies
    for smart grid and smart home applications, these implementations are still very
    rare. Relying on a comprehensive literature review, this paper aims to contribute
    towards narrowing the gap between the existing state-of-the-art smart home applications
    and the prospect of their integration into an IoT enabled environment. We propose
    a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks
    proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects
    in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model
    for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each
    level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data
    processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability.
    We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as
    a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home
    solutions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Internet of
    ThingsSmart homeHolistic frameworkSmart grid 1. Introduction With the expected
    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase

    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.
    Query# Term1 Term2 Term3 Total number of results Query 1 “Wireless Sensor Network”

    Home” “Smart Grid” 1050 Query 6 “IoT” “Home Automation” “Smart Grid” 747 Only
    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution
    Consumers Real-time generation monitoring Transmission lines controlling Underground

    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave

    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave

    2.4 GHz Gaussian, frequency-shift keying (GFSK) manchester channel encoding Frequency-shift
    keying (FSK) The price is another aspect that can be considered when choosing
    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities
    of IoT parts for smart home management system. Empty Cell Network topology Communication

    LTE/optical fiber/Wi-Fi very high very high Third party not applicable LTE/optical
    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability

    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Advances in field phenotyping are needed to
    capitalize on developments in genetics. • We present developments in field phenotyping
    platforms for crop breeding. • Platforms need more focus on environmental monitoring
    and capturing field variability. • Improvements in data management and use will
    spread the adoption of field platforms. Constraints in field phenotyping capability
    limit our ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits, particularly
    those related to yield and stress tolerance (e.g., yield potential as well as
    increased drought, heat tolerance, and nutrient efficiency, etc.). The development
    of effective field-based high-throughput phenotyping platforms (HTPPs) remains
    a bottleneck for future breeding advances. However, progress in sensors, aeronautics,
    and high-performance computing are paving the way. Here, we review recent advances
    in field HTPPs, which should combine at an affordable cost, high capacity for
    data recording, scoring and processing, and non-invasive remote sensing methods,
    together with automated environmental data collection. Laboratory analyses of
    key plant parts may complement direct phenotyping under field conditions. Improvements
    in user-friendly data management together with a more powerful interpretation
    of results should increase the use of field HTPPs, therefore increasing the efficiency
    of crop genetic improvement to meet the needs of future generations. Previous

    sensingspatial variabilitystress tolerance Why is phenotyping so important in
    the breeding pipeline? Crop production must double by 2050 to meet the predicted
    production demands of the global population [1]. However, achieving this goal
    will be a significant challenge for plant breeders because crop yields would have
    to increase at a rate of 2.4% per year, yet the average rate of increase is only
    1.3%, with yields stagnating in up to 40% of land under cereal production 2, 3.
    Extensive breeding and agronomic efforts over the past 50 years have been responsible
    for tripling cereal yields [4]. Continuing advances in the techniques available
    to breeders offer the potential to increase the rate of genetic improvement [5].
    Attempts to exploit new molecular tools to their full potential (Figure 1), particularly
    the ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits such as yield and stress
    tolerance 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, are limited by our ability to phenotype. However, plant
    breeders and farmers have been making selections based on phenotypes long before
    the discovery of DNA and molecular markers. The development of improved varieties
    relies on the ability to identify the best genetic variation for advancement.
    Breeding is essentially a numbers game: the more crosses and environments used
    for selection, the greater the probability of identifying superior variation.
    Plant breeders want to be able to phenotype large numbers of lines rapidly and
    accurately identify the best progeny. To meet future needs there is a need to
    increase breeding efficiency. Advances in high-throughput genotyping have provided
    fast and inexpensive genomic information. Low cost, high-throughput genotyping
    has paved the way for the development of large mapping populations and diversity
    panels of thousands of recombinant inbred lines for phenotyping [11]. Although
    molecular breeding strategies, such as marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS)
    and genomic selection, place greater focus on selections based on genotypic information,
    they still require phenotypic data [12]. In genomic selection, phenotypes are
    not used for selection but are used to train a prediction model [13]; whereas
    in MARS, a single phenotyping cycle is used to identify markers for subsequent
    selection through generations. Similarly, phenotyping is necessary to identify
    promising events in transgenic studies 14, 15. Given that molecular breeding populations
    can include up to 5000 lines, the ability to accurately characterize all lines
    simultaneously is challenging [11]. Advances in phenotyping are likely to be essential
    to capitalize on developments in conventional, molecular, and transgenic breeding
    and ensure genetic improvement of crops for future food security. Download : Download

    Redrawn from [20]. High-throughput phenotyping In recent years, there has been
    increased interest in high-throughput phenotyping platforms (HTPPs) 16, 17. Most
    HTPPs, both those run by the big transnational seed companies and the most advanced
    public plant research institutions around the world, such as the Australian Plant
    Phenomics Facility (http://www.plantphenomics.org.au/), the European Plant Phenotyping
    Network (http://www.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/eppn/structure), and the USDA
    (http://www.nifa.usda.gov/nea/plants/pdfs/whitepaper_finalUSDA.pdf), (http://www.wheatgenetics.org/downloads/Projects/HTP_ProjectNarrative_20130219.pdf)
    are fully automated facilities in greenhouses or growth chambers with robotics,
    precise environmental control, and remote sensing techniques to assess plant growth
    and performance. However, low-cost HTPP approaches are now starting to be developed
    [18]. In this review, we examine the need for high-throughput field phenotyping,
    the current technical developments, and the factors that limit its implementation,
    together with the future avenues that will pave the way for its wide adoption
    in practical breeding. Field phenotyping Although HTPPs enable detailed, non-invasive
    information to be captured throughout the plant life cycle in a carefully controlled
    environment, quantitative trait loci and candidate genes identified within controlled
    environments have generally not translated into gains in grain yield in the field
    19, 20, 21. Field conditions are notoriously heterogeneous and the inability to
    control environmental factors makes results difficult to interpret. However, results
    from controlled environments are far removed from the situation plants will experience
    in the field and, therefore, are difficult to extrapolate to the field. The problems
    associated with controlled environments are well established 6, 22, 23 (Figure
    2). For example, the volume of soil available to roots within a pot is considerably
    smaller than in the field, thereby reducing the amount of water and nutrients
    available to plants 24, 25, 26. The soil environment plays a crucial role in plant
    growth and development and is difficult to simulate under controlled conditions
    [27]. Drought stress phenotyping is particularly challenging because declining
    soil moisture content is associated with increased mechanical impedance in the
    field, which is an effect that is difficult to replicate within pots [28]. Moreover
    plants in the field do not growth isolate but configuring a canopy. Varietal improvement
    has heavily relied on multilocation screening within the target environment [29].
    Here, plants experience a range of stresses throughout their life cycle. In many
    cases, the environmental characteristics are not monitored and, hence, are poorly
    understood. This further complicates the ability to mimic the field environment
    under controlled conditions. Phenotyping under field environmental conditions
    remains a bottleneck for future breeding advances 7, 10, 19, 30, 31. Besides the
    above considerations, the choice of phenotyping under controlled conditions versus
    field environments largely depends on the purpose of phenotyping and the heritability
    of the trait, together with the logistical considerations of collecting the data
    [10]. For example, there are no feasible spatial or temporal options for testing
    high atmospheric CO2 in the field [32]. Download : Download full-size image Figure
    2. Continuum of environments for drought-resistance screening. The control over
    environmental factors decreases from the use of growth chambers to the target
    population environment (TPE), whereas the correlation of performance with the
    target commercial environments increases. Rainout shelters are designed to protect
    a selected area of land against receiving precipitation so that an experimentally
    controlled drought stress can be imposed on that area. Redrawn from [24]. Traits
    for phenotyping The most successful traits for evaluation integrate in time (throughout
    the crop cycle) and space (at the canopy level) the performance of the crop in
    terms of capturing resources (e.g., radiation, water, and nutrients) and how efficiently
    these resources are used 19, 33. Different methodological approaches have been
    proposed to evaluate these traits in the field (Figure 1). Using the criteria
    proposed in [20] they can be summarized into three categories: (i) proximal (remote)
    sensing and imaging, (ii) laboratory analyses of samples, and (iii) near-infrared
    reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis in the harvestable part of the crop.
    Besides the choice of the most appropriate traits, it is also crucial to determine
    the key time(s) for their evaluation. Measuring these traits at more or less frequent
    intervals during the crop cycle together with the measurements of the harvestable
    components would be unfeasible (or at least impractical) and may even be negative
    in terms of the impact of the trait for breeding. Proximal (remote) sensing: different
    categories of sensors Remote sensing phenotyping methods are non-destructive,
    non-invasive approaches 20, 34, 35 based mostly on the information provided by
    visible/near-infrared (VIS-NIR) radiation reflected (or transmitted) and far-infrared
    (thermal) radiation emitted by the crop 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. These methods
    are termed proximal in the sense that information is gathered ‘near’ the crop.
    Remote sensing techniques may be deployed in in situ screening for a wide range
    of breeding objectives, including yield potential, adaptation to abiotic (water
    stress, extreme temperatures, salinity) and biotic (susceptibility to pests and
    diseases) limiting conditions, and even quality traits. Many categories of traits
    may be measured under different environmental conditions using remote sensing
    approaches, ranging, for example, from green biomass through to photosynthetic
    transpirative gas exchange and on to quality traits or even to predict grain yield
    [39]. For example, the same authors [39] working with a set of 300 maize testcrosses
    grown under different water and temperature regimes reported that partial least
    square regression (PLSR) models from hyperspectral reflectance of maize explained
    up to 40% of the variation in grain yield in each trial, with a relative efficiency
    of selection of 0.88 and 0.68 using leaf and canopy reflectance, respectively.
    Moreover, strong agreement has been reported between remote sensing and imaging
    values of traits measured by HTPPs at the land and aerial levels, as well as through
    manual phenotyping approaches, with determination values ranging between 0.35
    and 0.82 in the case of cotton under different water regimes [42]. These results
    confirmed the ability of the phenotyping system to measure multiple traits rapidly
    and accurately. Concerning NIRS, it is already routinely used in breeding for
    a wide array of food and feed quality traits [43]. In fact, NIRS can be applied
    to drought or nutrient use efficiency screening, or other more general breeding/gene
    discovery objectives. The implementation in imaging formats of proximal sensing
    with VIS-NIR and far-infrared radiation has enabled the process of taking measurements
    to be upscaled: for example, from measuring a single plot to dissecting an entire
    trial composed of different plots, providing that the image has enough resolution
    (pixels). However, imaging speed is limited by post-processing, which may include
    image alignment, geometric and radiometric calibrations, atmospheric correction,
    automatic mosaicking, and algorithms for automatic image segmentation 44, 45.
    Proximal (remote) sensing and imaging techniques include different approaches.
    The approaches that are most implemented (feasible) for field phenotyping can
    be grouped into three different categories (see Box 1 for images): (i) VIS-NIR
    spectroradiometry (including multispectral and the even less developed hyperspectral
    imaging) [45], (ii) infrared thermometry and thermal imaging, and (iii) conventional
    digital photography (RGB color cameras). The first approach is undergoing rapid
    technical advances associated with the use of high-resolution full-range spectroradiometers
    that reach into the NIR region wavelengths around 2500 nm. This, together with
    the use of special adaptors with their own light source, enables such spectroradiometers
    to be used as field-portable NIRS devices, generating large amounts of data with
    a wide range of potential applications. Examples include the development of empirical
    models to assess specific photosynthetic characteristics related to radiation
    use efficiency [46], or to predict a complex trait such as grain yield [39], and
    the use of single spectroradiometrical indices to predict yield [41]. At the imaging
    level, hyperspectral sensors are being developed along similar lines, although
    it is not possible for them to carry their own light source (specifically for
    large-scale images), thus this may represent a limitation [44]. Nevertheless,
    hyperspectral imagery enables assessment of complex traits, such as canopy photosynthesis
    and fluorescence under natural sunlight conditions 45, 47. There are several software
    programs available to process information to extract phenotype data from images,
    including free options [10]. Box 1 Cameras for crop monitoring Different categories
    of imaging systems for remote sensing evaluation of vegetation are detailed below
    with examples of prototypes capable of being carried by UAPs of limited payload
    (Figure I). Download : Download full-size image Figure I. Examples of false-color
    images taken with different categories of cameras: (A) RGB/CIR, (B) multispectral,
    (C) hypespectral, and (D) thermal imaging. RGB/CIR cameras The combination of
    color infrared (CIR) and red, green, and blue light (called visible or RGB) imagery
    enables the estimation of green biomass (NDVI type of information). Miniaturization
    is advancing fast with cameras that weigh only 100 g and have spectral range bands
    in red, green, and NIR. Figure IA shows an image taken with a multispectral mono
    lens camera (ADC Lite) of three bands. Multispectral cameras Multispectral imagers
    are widely used for crop monitoring via remote sensing. They can acquire a limited
    number of spectral bands at once in the VIS-NIR regions. Besides vegetation indices
    for evaluating green biomass, multispectral imagers can be formulated to other
    different spectral indices targeting senescence evaluation, nutrient status, pigment
    degradation, photosynthetic efficiency, or water content [84]. Figure IB shows
    an image taken with a multispectral camera (miniMCA-6) of six lens. Hyperspectral
    visible and near-infrared imager The hyperspectral visible and near-infrared imager
    enables the acquisition of hundreds of images at once, covering the entire electromagnetic
    spectrum between the visible and the near-infrared regions in a continuous mode
    (wavelengths ranging from 400 to 900 nm). Other configurations cover the range
    from 1000 to 2500 nm. Therefore, it is possible to run empirical calibrations
    (like in a ‘NIRS mode’) against a wide and miscellaneous set of traits. Figure
    IC shows an image taken with a hyperspectral (Microhyperspec VNIR) camera. Long-wave
    infrared cameras or thermal imaging cameras Long-wave infrared cameras and thermal
    imaging cameras render infrared radiation in the range of μm as visible light.
    Potential use of thermal imaging in phenotyping includes predicting water stress
    in crops, disease, and pathogen detection in plants, evaluating the maturing of
    fruits and bruise detection in fruits and vegetables 50, 37, 85, 38. The low resolution
    of the imaging (current cameras are in the range of 640 × 500 pixels) may limit
    the use of such cameras from aerial platforms. Thermal images obtained from a
    UAP using this type of camera have a resolution in the range of 20–40 cm [41].
    Figure ID shows an image taken with a thermal (MIDAS) camera. For more information
    about imaging sensors, visit http://quantalab.ias.csic.es/pdf/. Conventional digital
    cameras (NDVI type work) Conventional digital cameras are low-cost instruments
    that enable, for example, plant cover (green biomass) or senescence to be estimated.
    Moreover, the software needed is usually freely available. A general limitation
    of spectroradiometrical approaches lies in the differences in plant architecture
    and developmental stage, together with the anisotropic characteristics of the
    leaf (mostly due to the leaf surface: roughness, trichomes, epicuticular waxes).
    These may negatively affect the estimation of traits (mostly of biochemical traits)
    by spectroradiometrical approaches [10]. The effect of leaf anisotropy is more
    evident in the remote sensing-based approaches that use reflected instead of transmitted
    radiation, which is the situation in the majority of systems. Moreover, care should
    be taken, for example, to standardize measures with plants at similar developmental
    stages and exhibiting a narrow range of variability in plant architecture, whereas
    sun elevation should also be taken into consideration because the majority of
    spectroradiometrical evaluations in the field use passive sensors. In the case
    of canopy temperature, variation in development and canopy architecture must be
    taken into account (e.g., plant height, soil covering, emerged spikes, leaf angle
    and size) when interpreting performance and selecting cooler breeding lines 48,
    49. This is in addition to the environmental variability (e.g., in light intensity,
    temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) and timing of measurements, which
    affects the accuracy of thermal measurements [50]. Digital photography is also
    a promising approach given the low cost of the sensor (i.e., a conventional camera)
    and access to free software for data processing that enables estimation of green
    biomass, soil cover, plant color 51, 52, or even agronomical components such as
    plant or inflorescence density. Moreover, alongside these approaches, other techniques
    are starting to be adopted for field phenotyping, such as the use of laser imaging
    detection and ranging (Lidar). This is an active remote sensing technique that
    uses Lidar sensors to directly measure the 3D distribution of plant canopies as
    well as subcanopy topography, thus providing high-resolution topographic maps
    and highly accurate estimates of vegetation height, cover, and canopy structure
    53, 54, 55. Furthermore, laser scanning and fluorescence enables evaluation of
    photosynthetic performance and has potential in areas such as plant pathology
    [56]. Field-based high-throughput phenotyping platforms By combining advances
    in remote sensing, aeronautics and high-performance, computing is paving the way
    for the development of field-based HTPPs. Recently, several platforms have been
    developed, ranging from ground-based to aerial systems (e.g., the Australian Plant
    Phenomics Facility, http://www.plantphenomics.org/hrppc/capabilities/technology).
    Ground-based HTPPs include modified vehicles equipped with a global positioning
    system (GPS) navigation device and sensors often referred to as ‘phenomobiles’.
    Different ‘phenomobiles’ have been developed within the past few years 20, 42,
    57, 58, 59, 60 (http://www.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/eppn/inra_diaphen). For
    example, in the case of cotton a system has been developed that carries four sets
    of sensors to measure canopy height, reflectance, and temperature simultaneously
    on four adjacent rows, enabling the collection of phenotypic data at a rate of
    0.84 ha h−1 [42]. The mounting of sensors (such as NIRS) on agricultural harvesters
    may also be included within the category of ‘phenomobiles’ 61, 62. Ground-based
    HTPPs enable data to be captured at the plot level and require little post-processing.
    However, this also limits the scale at which ground-based HTPPs can be used. Furthermore,
    simultaneous measurements of all plots within a trial are not possible with ground-based
    platforms.Aerial platforms are increasingly being considered as an alternative
    option to overcome limitations associated with ground-based HTPPs. Aerial HTPPs
    enable the rapid characterization of many plots within minutes. Initial aerial
    HTPPs used small airplanes (e.g., crop-dusting airplanes); however, this is costly
    and it is difficult to safely achieve the low speeds required for high-definition
    images at low altitude. The current generation of aerial HTPPs significantly varies
    in payload, initial costs, maintenance costs, and control. Recently developed
    alternatives include ‘phenotowers’ [63] and blimps [64]. However, this type of
    aerial HTPP has a maximum height of 50 m. Blimps are helium-filled balloons that
    can be held in a stationary position and have sensors mounted underneath. They
    can carry a heavy payload (several kilograms), enabling many sensors to be used
    concurrently; however, they require many people for control and considerable room
    for storage when inflated. Alternatives to blimps are unmanned aerial platforms
    (UAPs) such as polycopters (e.g., Ascending Technologies: http://www.asctec.de;
    MikroKopter: http://www.mikrokopter.de) and airplanes (see ‘Innovative agricultural
    technologies for sustainable intensification’ at the MAIZE Annual Report of the
    CGIAR Research Program: http://repository.cimmyt.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10883/3209/98018.pdf?sequence=1).
    Although the payload of UAPs is lower than blimps, they can generally carry up
    to 2 kg, enabling at least two sensors to be mounted for simultaneous image capture.
    UAPs enable greater flight control and autonomy and are becoming increasingly
    affordable. Unlike airplanes, polycopters can be maneuvered into a stationary
    position; however, advances in aeronautics and sensors now enable high-quality
    images to be obtained from unmanned airplanes. Furthermore, the autonomy and area
    covered by airplanes is larger and the risk of destruction by crashing lower than
    for polycopters. Most UAPs carry an RGB/CIR camera, together with a thermal-imaging
    sensor [and sometimes a conventional color (RGB) digital camera]. Replacing the
    RGB/CIR camera with a multispectral or hyperspectral imaging sensor increases
    the payload but opens up a huge range of new possibilities (Box 1). The software
    requirements for UAPs include programs to: (i) plan flight missions, (ii) gather
    the images, and (iii) extract the data for plots within the images. UAPs are controlled
    by an autopilot for autonomous flying; the ground control station and the UAP
    are radio linked, transmitting position, altitude, and status. The imager is operated
    from the ground station. Laboratory and NIRS analyses In addition to proximal
    sensing approaches, the analysis of plant samples, for example, the analysis of
    stable isotopes [65], may complement direct phenotyping under field conditions.
    When breeding for yield potential and adaption to abiotic stresses such as drought,
    carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) in dry matter is a promising tool that frequently
    exhibits high heritability and genetic correlation with yield 66, 67, 68, and
    has already been applied to breeding programs [69]. The use of grain Δ13C relies
    on a good understanding of tested populations and assumes no confounding of genotypic
    differences in phenology, anthesis biomass, pre-anthesis water use, and remobilization
    of stem carbohydrates 19, 66, 69. Whereas Δ13C is still an expensive tool for
    use in large-scale phenotyping, there are low cost surrogates (see next paragraph).
    In addition, if analyzed through the regular (mass spectrometry) technique, Δ13C
    can still be used on just the tails to complement HTPP approaches. Other traits
    that may be deployed as indicators of transpiration and, hence, of water use are
    the total minerals accumulated in transpiring organs [70]. NIRS is regularly deployed
    not only at the laboratory level but also in harvesting machinery to analyze grain
    characteristics. When used in harvesting machinery, this technique secures a broad
    distribution of measurements within plots and covers substantially larger amounts
    of plot material than analyses at the laboratory level using conventional sample-based
    methods 61, 62. In any case, the near-infrared spectrum captures physical and
    chemical characteristics of the samples, either of vegetative plant tissues or
    harvested seeds. By using calibration models, several traits can be determined
    on the basis of a single spectrum. Thus, NIRS is regularly used to analyze, for
    example, the protein, nitrogen, starch and oil content, grain texture, and grain
    weight of (intact) seeds 20, 61, 62, 71. However, the same spectrum may be used
    to develop prediction models for analyzing traits of potential interest for phenotyping
    for stress adaptation, such as Δ13C, mineral content, or the composition of other
    stable isotopes 34, 72, 73. Although the precision of these indirect estimations
    may be lower than those of direct analysis, the rapid, low-cost, and non-destructive
    nature of NIRS may justify its use, at least in the early generations of a breeding
    program, as a first screening approach when thousands of genotypes need to be
    evaluated. Although considerable advances have been made for evaluating the aerial
    parts of plants, roots are still hidden in terms of phenotyping, despite their
    importance in capturing resources for the crop. A broad overview of the different
    approaches proposed for root phenotyping under field conditions is set out in
    Box 2. Box 2 Phenotyping roots Roots are notoriously difficult to phenotype in
    the field 26, 86. Besides technical considerations, screening under field conditions
    is limited by significant soil environment–genotype interactions [87]. Traditional
    studies have focused on excavation techniques, from which root depth and root
    length density can be determined. Trenching is labor intensive and slow. Recently,
    the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)
    implemented a high-throughput soil-sampling system to evaluate the maximum root
    depth and distribution [86]. This system uses a hydraulic push press: 2–5 min
    per core and 200 cores (200 cm long) per day. The system is being used to assess
    the impact of root architecture traits on water uptake. To that end, continuous
    logging of soil water content (gypsum blocks) and canopy temperature is combined
    with root architecture. Another approach that has been proposed for use in graminaceous
    crops and that is less intensive in terms of the resources deployed is ‘shovelomics’
    [88]. Values for root architectural traits are derived from the visual scoring
    of roots, which includes in the case of maize (Zea mays), numbers, angles, and
    branching patterns of crown and brace roots. Several non-invasive (i.e., indirect)
    techniques have been proposed. These include, for example, electrical capacitance
    [89]. At the level of root imaging, ground-penetrating radar has been explored,
    but resolution limitations mean that it is still likely to be restricted to trees
    and woody plants 86, 90. The use of electrical resistance tomography, even if
    still mostly at the container level [91], is perhaps more promising for mapping
    soil moisture and root biomass in herbaceous crops in the field [92]. Other techniques
    such as magnetic resonance imaging are still restricted to use at the container
    level [63]. Root biomass and performance can also be assessed (indirectly) through
    the evaluation of shoot proxy traits. This is the case for the natural abundances
    of stable oxygen and deuterium isotopes in shoot water [93]. The increasing availability
    of laser analyzers is making such determination faster and less expensive than
    conventional mass spectrometry. Canopy temperature has been used for remote sensing
    of wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines with deeper roots [94]. In the same way, Δ13C
    in dry matter may also be a valuable indicator of differences in access to water
    by mature root systems 95, 96s. Shoot biomass may also be considered as an indirect
    indicator of root biomass and performance 86, 96. However, problems of reliance
    on indirect measures of root growth may be encountered under field conditions
    60, 86. More than traits and tools: spatial variability and environmental monitoring
    Earlier HTPP initiatives have largely focused on phenotyping and little emphasis
    has been placed on environmental monitoring and reducing error variances. The
    phenotyping environment plays a vital role in the quality of phenotypic data generated
    through experiments and, consequently, in the efficiency of breeding. Field variation
    increases error variances, thereby masking important genetic variation for key
    traits and reducing repeatability, regardless of the cost and precision of a phenotyping
    platform [74]. Spatial variation can be caused by several factors, including the
    soil, which is inherently heterogeneous even in relatively uniform experimental
    sites. HTTPs allow a larger number of genotypes to be phenotyped, thereby increasing
    the likelihood of soil variability masking genetic effects. In general, as the
    land requirement of an experiment increases the harder it becomes to find an area
    with minimum soil heterogeneity. Information on field variability can be incorporated
    into field designs by avoiding areas of high spatial variation [75]. The basic
    concept is to create homogeneous blocks in which the ‘noise’ factors are held
    constant, whereas the factor of interest (‘signal’) is allowed to vary. Earlier
    measurements of field variation relied on direct (i.e., destructive soil sampling)
    and subsequent laboratory analysis. However, advances in proximal and remote sensing
    technologies enable high-resolution mapping of spatial variability [76] (Figure
    1). Proximal sensors include cone penetrometers, which can be used to measure
    soil mechanical impedance and depth. However, measurements are time consuming
    and, therefore, soil penetrometers are of limited use for obtaining the necessary
    detail required to create field maps over large areas [28]. Apparent soil electrical
    conductivity is closely related to clay, water, and ionic content and electromagnetic
    surveys can be used to determine field gradients in soil texture 30, 60. Crop
    performance provides the best indicator of field variability. Imaging techniques
    in parallel with wireless sensor networks and geographical information systems
    will allow a more precise mapping and monitoring of, for example, spatial variability
    [77]. For example, aerial HTPPs that enable fast non-destructive GPS-linked measurements
    of biomass using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used
    to measure field variability either on a single variety planted in the off-season
    to develop subsequent planting maps or within experiments to build up performance
    maps to guide planting of the next season. Compared with proximal sensors of field
    variability (Figure 1), aerial HTPPs allow the rapid characterization of experimental
    blocks (less than 30 min for 1 ha plus data processing). Environmental variability
    inconsistently affects phenotypic observation over both space and time and must
    be accounted for in any statistical models that are used to estimate parameters
    of interest [10]. Spatial modeling is a key requirement because of the size of
    the trials, the time taken to collate traits, and the use of high-throughput phenotyping
    approaches. In that context, multitrait mixed modeling looks promising for the
    analysis of traits collected by aerial remote sensing platforms where multiple
    traits derived from the same procedure may produce correlated errors [26]. Linear
    models have long been the mainstay of quantitative genetic experiments and are
    the most commonly applied statistical approach to understanding phenotypic variation.
    However, they have inherent limitations when measurements are not adequately replicated
    and not normally distributed. In this regard, alternatives such as the Bayesian
    inference may overcome the limitations imposed by a maximum-likelihood approach
    [10]. In HTPPs, the implementation of environmental characterization is essential
    to facilitate data interpretation, meta-data analysis, and, in the case of drought
    phenotyping, understanding patterns of water availability [74]. Weather data are
    frequently sourced from nearby weather stations at the end of experiments; however,
    soil moisture is often not measured [75]. The need for environmental data is particularly
    pertinent in drought screening where knowledge of soil moisture availability is
    necessary to ensure that the field environment and the type of drought imposed
    are representative of the target environment [56]. Real-time information on soil
    moisture can be used to facilitate irrigation decisions, which is becoming increasingly
    important with increased climatic variability in the off-season when managed drought
    phenotyping is often conducted. The development of wireless sensor networks to
    characterize both climatic and soil moisture conditions should enable real-time
    monitoring of environmental conditions (Figure 3). Download : Download full-size
    image Figure 3. Summary of the different components of the breeding process where
    high-throughput phenotyping is involved. These include evaluation of key traits
    at the right moment, assessment of spatial variability, environmental characterization,
    and further integration of all the information. A better understanding of the
    stresses prevailing under the target conditions is still needed [78]. Managed
    Environment Facilities are becoming more important as they permit selection under
    controlled stress [60]. Controlling environmental conditions increases the accuracy
    of performance measurements and the attribution of phenotypic effects to individual
    traits and the underlying genetic makeup [79]. Field phenotyping bottleneck HTPPs
    have benefitted in recent years from the rapid progress that has been made in
    the development of a wide array of technologies including novel sensors, image
    analysis and modeling, robotics, and remote control and data mining. Previously,
    time was the largest limitation to phenotyping, but HTPPs now allow plot-level
    measurements within seconds. However, the bottleneck that may slow down the full
    implementation of these platforms is the management of the huge amount of information
    generated 10, 50. Two of the main limiting factors that need to be improved are:
    data management and use of bioinformatics to mine the volumes of phenotypic data,
    and the way in which modeling is used to incorporate genotypic, phenotypic, environmental,
    and management data 48, 80. Advanced analysis tools are required beyond even the
    usual statistical tools [20]. We do not even have a physical concept of what some
    of the numbers obtained by HTPPs mean in terms of plant or crop performance [10].
    Much of the data are just mathematical transformations of numbers, but perhaps
    some linear combination of them will, for reasons we do not yet understand, have
    some correlation with important traits such as leaf angle and planting density
    [21]. However, in the case of information generated through hyperspectral sensors,
    the generation of a set of indices, even of a miscellaneous nature, does not enable
    full advantage to be taken of the hundreds of wavelengths measured. In this regard,
    the ‘NIRS approach’, although it represents construction of a purely empirical
    model, might use the most relevant information regardless of whether it has a
    clear physiological meaning or not [7]. Moreover, such an approach might share
    with genomic selection the possibility of training a model by adding new sets
    of data periodically. Pyramiding all levels of information (different categories
    of traits measured at different times, spatial variability, environmental information)
    in a coherent manner requires the setting down of a strong modeling foundation
    based on a wide but deep understanding of the ecophysiological and genetic factors
    determining crop performance. Above all, more user-friendly post-processing of
    the raw data generated is needed. Improved software tools to optimize automation
    and speed up robust data analysis should support such a trend [81]. Concluding
    remarks and future perspectives The capacity for undertaking precision phenotyping,
    particularly under repeatable and representative growing conditions in the field,
    is lagging far behind the capacity to generate genomic information. This is constraining
    breeding advances. Developments (e.g., sensors, platforms, and analytical capability)
    in HTPPs have enabled these measurements to be made in situ; however, the integration
    of data is lagging behind. Field phenotyping of the appropriate traits, using
    low cost, easy-to-handle tools, should become an integral and key component in
    the breeding pipeline. Using technological advances with regard to phenotyping
    instrumentation should also go hand-in-hand with methods to characterize and control
    field site variation (for improving repeatability), adopting appropriate experimental
    designs, selection of the right traits, and, finally, proper integration of heterogeneous
    datasets, analysis, and application, including prediction models 8, 19, 21, 82,
    83. Efficient integration of all the components of the system is needed to pave
    the way for the adoption of field HTPPs in the near future. This includes more
    user-friendly data management combined with data gathering and processing. Acknowledgments

    of a fully connected world and provide ubiquitous wireless connectivity for all.
    Transformative solutions are expected to drive the surge for accommodating a rapidly
    growing number of intelligent devices and services. Major technological breakthroughs
    to achieve connectivity goals within 6G include: (i) a network operating at the

    DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2689040 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The development of big data and the Internet of things (IoT) is rapidly accelerating
    and affecting all areas of technologies and businesses by increasing the benefits
    for organizations and individuals. The growth of data produced via IoT has played
    a major role on the big data landscape. Big data can be categorized according
    to three aspects: (a) volume, (b) variety, and (c) velocity [1]. These categories
    were first introduced byGartner to describe the elements of big data challenges
    [2]. Immense opportunities are presented by the capability to analyze and utilize
    huge amounts of IoT data, including applications in smart cities, smart transport
    and grid systems, energy smart meters, and remote patient healthcare monitoring
    devices. The widespread popularity of IoT has made big data analytics challenging
    because of the processing and collection of data through different sensors in
    the IoT environment. The International Data Corporation (IDC) report indicates
    that the big data market will reach over US$125 billion by 2019 [3]. IoT big data
    analytics can be defined as the steps in which a variety of IoT data are examined
    [4] to reveal trends, unseen patterns, hidden correlations, and new information
    [5]. Companies and individuals can benefit from analyzing large amounts of data
    and managing huge amounts of information that can affect businesses [6]. Therefore,
    IoT big data analytics aims to assist business associations and other organizations
    to achieve improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed
    decisions. Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze huge
    amounts of unstructured data that can be harnessed using traditional tools [5].
    Moreover,big data analytics aims to immediately extract knowledgeable information
    using data mining techniques that help in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and making decisions [7]. Techniques in data
    mining are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized data
    analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    IoT data are different from normal big data collected via systems in terms of
    characteristics because of the various sensors and objects involved during data
    collection, which include heterogeneity, noise, variety, and rapid growth. Statistics
    [8] show that the number of sensors will be increased by 1 trillion in 2030. This
    increase will affect the growth of big data. Introducing data analytics and IoT
    into big data requires huge resources, and IoT has the capability to offer an
    excellent solution. Appropriate resources and intensive applications of the platforms
    are provided by IoT services for effective communication among various deployed
    applications. Such process is suitable for fulfilling the requirements of IoT
    applications, and can reduce some challenges in the future of big data analytics.
    This technological amalgamation increases the possibility of implementing IoT
    toward a better direction. Moreover, implementing IoT and big data integration
    solutions can help address issues on storage, processing, data analytics, and
    visualization tools. It can also assist in improving collaboration and communication
    among various objects in a smart city [9]. Application areas, such as smart ecological
    environments, smart traffic, smart grids, intelligent buildings, and logistic
    intelligent management, can benefit from the aforementioned arrangement. Many
    studies on big data has focused on big data management; in particular, big data
    analytics has been surveyed [10], [11]. However, this survey focused on IoT big
    data in the context of the analytics of a huge amount of data. The contributions
    of this survey are as follows. State-of-the-art research efforts conducted in
    terms of big data analytics are investigated. An architecture for big IoT data
    analytics is proposed. Several unprecedented opportunities brought by data analytics
    in the IoT domain are introduced. Credible use cases are presented. Research challenges
    that remain to be addressed are identified and discussed. These contributions
    are presented from Sections 3 to 6. The conclusion is provided in Section 7. SECTION
    II. Overview of IoT and Big Data An overview of IoT technologies and big data
    is provided before the discussion. A. IoT IoT offers a platform for sensors and
    devices to communicate seamlessly within a smart environment and enables information
    sharing across platforms in a convenient manner. The recent adaptation of different
    wireless technologies places IoT as the next revolutionary technology by benefiting
    from the full opportunities offered by the Internet technology. IoT has witnessed
    its recent adoption in smart cities with interest in developing intelligent systems,
    such as smart office, smart retail, smart agriculture, smart water, smart transportation,
    smart healthcare, and smart energy [12], [13]. IoT has emerged as a new trend
    in the last few years, where mobile devices, transportation facilities, public
    facilities, and home appliances can all be used as data acquisition equipment
    in IoT. All surrounding electronic equipment to facilitate daily life operations,
    such as wristwatches, vending machines, emergency alarms, and garage doors, as
    well as home appliances, such as refrigerators, microwave ovens, air conditioners,
    and water heaters are connected to an IoT network and can be controlled remotely.
    Ciufo [14] stated that these devices “talk” to one another and to central controlling
    devices. Such devices deployed in different areas may collect various kinds of
    data, such as geographical, astronomical, environmental, and logistical data.
    A large number of communication devices in the IoT paradigm are embedded into
    sensor devices in the real world. Data collecting devices sense data and transmit
    these data using embedded communication devices. The continuum of devices and
    objects are interconnected through a variety of communication solutions, such
    as Bluetooth, WiFi, ZigBee, and GSM. These communication devices transmit data
    and receive commands from remotely controlled devices, which allow direct integration
    with the physical world through computer-based systems to improve living standards.
    Over 50 billion devices ranging from smartphones, laptops, sensors, and game consoles
    are anticipated to be connected to the Internet through several heterogeneous
    access networks enabled by technologies, such as radio frequency identification
    (RFID) and wireless sensor networks. Reference [15] mentioned that IoT could be
    recognized in three paradigms: Internet-oriented, sensors, and knowledge [16].
    The recent adaptation of different wireless technologies places IoT as the next
    revolutionary technology by benefiting from the full opportunities offered by
    Internet technology. B. Big Data The volume of data generated by sensors, devices,
    social media, health care applications, temperature sensors, and various other
    software applications and digital devices that continuously generate large amounts
    of structured, unstructured, or semi-structured data is strongly increasing. This
    massive data generation results in “big data” [17]. Traditional database systems
    are inefficient when storing, processing, and analyzing rapidly growing amount
    of data or big data [18]. The term “big data” has been used in the previous literature
    but is relatively new in business and IT [19]. An example of big data-related
    studies is the next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity; McKinsey
    Global Institute [20] defined big data as the size of data sets that are a better
    database system tool than the usual tools for capturing, storing, processing,
    and analyzing such data [18]. “The Digital Universe” study [21] labels big data
    technologies as a new generation of technologies and architectures that aim to
    take out the value from a massive volume of data with various formats by enabling
    high-velocity capture, discovery, and analysis. This previous study also characterizes
    big data into three aspects: (a) data sources, (b) data analytics, and (c) the
    presentation of the results of the analytics. This definition uses the 3V’s (volume,
    variety, velocity) model proposed by Beyer [2]. The model highlights an e-commerce
    trend in data management that faces challenges to manage volume or size of data,
    variety or different sources of data, and velocity or speed of data creation.
    Some studies declare volume as a main characteristic of big data without providing
    a pure definition [22]. However, other researchers introduced additional characteristics
    for big data, such as veracity, value, variability, and complexity [23], [24].
    The 3V’s model, or its derivations, is the most common descriptions of the term
    “big data.” SECTION III. Big Data Analytics Big data analytics involves the processes
    of searching a database, mining, and analyzing data dedicated to improve company
    performance [25]. Big data analytics is the process of examining large data sets
    that contain a variety of data types [4] to reveal unseen patterns, hidden correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful business information [5].
    The capability to analyze large amounts of data can help an organization deal
    with considerable information that can affect the business [6]. Therefore, the
    main objective of big data analytics is to assist business associations to have
    improved understanding of data, and thus, make efficient and well-informed decisions.
    Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze a large volume
    of data that may not be harnessed using traditional tools [5]. Big data analytics
    require technologies and tools that can transform a large amount of structured,
    unstructured, and semi-structured data into a more understandable data and metadata
    format for analytical processes. The algorithms used in these analytical tools
    must discover patterns, trends, and correlations over a variety of time horizons
    in the data [26]. After analyzing the data, these tools visualize the findings
    in tables, graphs, and spatial charts for efficient decision making. Thus, big
    data analysis is a serious challenge for many applications because of data complexity
    and the scalability of underlying algorithms that support such processes [27].
    Talia (2013) highlighted that obtaining helpful information from big data analysis
    is a critical matter that requires scalable analytical algorithms and techniques
    to return well-timed results, whereas current techniques and algorithms are inefficient
    to handle big data analytics. Therefore, large infrastructure and additional applications
    are necessary to support data parallelism. Moreover, data sources, such as high-speed
    data stream received from different data sources, have different formats, which
    makes integrating multiple sources for analytics solutions critical [28]. Hence,
    the challenge is focused on the performance of current algorithms used in big
    data analysis, which is not rising linearly with the rapid increase in computational
    resources [19]. Big data analytics processes consume considerable time to provide
    feedback and guidelines to users, whereas only a few tools [29] can process huge
    data sets within reasonable amount of processing time. By contrast, most of the
    remaining tools use the complicated trial-and-error method to deal with massive
    amounts of data sets and data heterogeneity [30]. Big data analytics systems exist.
    For example, the Exploratory Data Analysis Environment [31] is a big data visual
    analytics system that is used to analyze complex earth system simulations with
    large numbers of data sets. A. Existing Analytics Systems Different analytic types
    are used according to the requirements of IoT applications [32]. These analytic
    types are discussed in this subsection under real-time, off-line, memory-level,
    business intelligence (BI) level, and massive level analytics categories. Moreover,
    a comparison based on analytics types and their levels is presented in Table 1.
    TABLE 1 Comparison of Different Analytics Types and Their Levels Real-time analytics
    is typically performed on data collected from sensors. In this situation, data
    change constantly, and rapid data analytics techniques are required to obtain
    an analytical result within a short period. Consequently, two existing architectures
    have been proposed for real-time analysis: parallel processing clusters using
    traditional relational databases and memory-based computing platforms [33]. Greenplum
    [34] and Hana [35] are examples of real-time analytics architecture. Off-line
    analytics is used when a quick response is not required [32]. For example, many
    Internet enterprises use Hadoop-based off-line analytics architecture to reduce
    the cost of data format conversion [36]. Such analytics improves data acquisition
    efficiency. SCRIBE [37], Kafka [38], Time-Tunnel [39], and Chukwa [40] are examples
    of architectures that conduct off-line analytics and can satisfy the demands of
    data acquisition. Memory-level analytics is applied when the size of data is smaller
    than the memory of a cluster [32]. To date, the memory of clusters has reached
    terabyte (TB) level [41]. Therefore, several internal database technologies are
    required to improve analytical efficiency. Memory-level analytics is suitable
    for conducting real-time analysis. MongoDB [42] is an example of this architecture.
    BI analytics is adopted when the size of data is larger than the memory level,
    but in this case, data may be imported to the BI analysis environment [43]. BI
    analytic currently supports TB-level data [32]. Moreover, BI can help discover
    strategic business opportunities from the flood of data. In addition, BI analytics
    allows easy interpretation of data volumes. Identifying new opportunities and
    implementing an effective strategy provide competitive market advantage and long-term
    stability. Massive analytics is applied when the size of data is greater than
    the entire capacity of the BI analysis product and traditional databases [44].
    Massive analytics uses the Hadoop distributed file system for data storage and
    map/reduce for data analysis. Massive analytics helps create the business foundation
    and increases market competitiveness by extracting meaningful values from data.
    Moreover, massive analytics obtains accurate data that leverage the risks involved
    in making any business decision. In addition, massive analytics provides services
    effectively. B. Relationship Between IoT and Big Data Analytics Big data analytics
    is rapidly emerging as a key IoT initiative to improve decision making. One of
    the most prominent features of IoT is its analysis of information about “connected
    things.” Big data analytics in IoT requires processing a large amount of data
    on the fly and storing the data in various storage technologies. Given that much
    of the unstructured data are gathered directly from web-enabled “things,” big
    data implementations will necessitate performing lightning-fast analytics with
    large queries to allow organizations to gain rapid insights, make quick decisions,
    and interact with people and other devices. The interconnection of sensing and
    actuating devices provide the capability to share information across platforms
    through a unified architecture and develop a common operating picture for enabling
    innovative applications. The need to adopt big data in IoT applications is compelling.
    These two technologies have already been recognized in the fields of IT and business.
    Although, the development of big data is already lagging, these technologies are
    inter-dependent and should be jointly developed. In general, the deployment of
    IoT increases the amount of data in quantity and category; hence, offering the
    opportunity for the application and development of big data analytics. Moreover,
    the application of big data technologies in IoT accelerates the research advances
    and business models of IoT. The relationship between IoT and big data, which is
    shown in Figure 1, can be divided into three steps to enable the management of
    IoT data. The first step comprises managing IoT data sources, where connected
    sensors devices use applications to interact with one another. For example, the
    interaction of devices such as CCTV cameras, smart traffic lights, and smart home
    devices, generates large amounts of data sources with different formats. This
    data can be stored in low cost commodity storage on the cloud. In the second step,
    the generated data are called “big data,” which are based on their volume, velocity,
    and variety. These huge amounts of data are stored in big data files in shared
    distributed fault-tolerant databases. The last step applies analytics tools such
    as MapReduce, Spark, Splunk, and Skytree that can analyze the stored big IoT data
    sets. The four levels of analytics start from training data, then move on to analytics
    tools, queries, and reports. FIGURE 1. Relationship between IoT and big data analytics.
    Show All C. Big Data Analytics Methods Big data analytics aim to immediately extract
    knowledgeable information that helps in making predictions, identifying recent
    trends, finding hidden information, and ultimately, making decisions [7]. Data
    mining techniques are widely deployed for both problem-specific methods and generalized
    data analytics. Accordingly, statistical and machine learning methods are utilized.
    The evolution of big data also changes analytics requirements. Although the requirements
    for efficient mechanisms lie in all aspects of big data management [30], such
    as capturing, storage, preprocessing, and analysis; for our discussion, big data
    analytics requires the same or faster processing speed than traditional data analytics
    with minimum cost for high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety data [45].
    Various solutions are available for big data analytics, and advancements in developing
    and improving these solutions are being continuously achieved to make them suitable
    for new big data trends. Data mining plays an important role in analytics, and
    most of the techniques are developed using data mining algorithms according to
    a particular scenario. Knowledge on available big data analytics options is crucial
    when evaluating and choosing an appropriate approach for decision making. In this
    section, we present several methods that can be implemented for several big data
    case studies. Some of these analytics methods are efficient for big IoT data analytics.
    Diverse and tremendous size data sets contribute more in big data insights. However,
    this belief is not always valid because more data may have more ambiguities and
    abnormalities [7]. We present big data analytics methods under classification,
    clustering, association rule mining, and prediction categories. Figure 2 depicts
    and summarizes each of these categories. Each category is a data mining function
    and involves many methods and algorithms to fulfill information extraction and
    analysis requirements. For example, Bayesian network, support vector machine (SVM),
    and k -nearest neighbor (KNN) offer classification methods. Similarly, partitioning,
    hierarchical clustering, and co-occurrence are widespread in clustering. Association
    rule mining and prediction comprise significant methods. FIGURE 2. Overview of
    big data analytics methods. Show All Classification is a supervised learning approach
    that uses prior knowledge as training data to classify data objects into groups
    [46]. A predefined category is assigned to an object, and thus, the objective
    of predicting a group or class for an object is achieved (see Figure 2). Finding
    unknown or hidden patterns is more challenging for big IoT data. Furthermore,
    extracting valuable information from large data sets to improve decision making
    is a critical task. A Bayesian network is a classification method that offers
    model interpretability. Bayesian networks are efficient for analyzing complex
    data structures revealed through big data rather than traditional structured data
    formats. These networks are directed acyclic graphs, where nodes are random variables
    and edges denote conditional dependency [47]. Naïve, selective naïve, semi-naïve
    Bayes, and Bayes multi-nets are the proposed categories for classification [48].
    Analyzing data patterns and creating groups are efficiently performed using SVM,
    which is also classification approach for big data analytics. SVM utilizes statistical
    learning theory to analyze data patterns and create groups. Several applications
    of SVM classification in big data analytics include text classification [49],
    pattern matching [50], health diagnostics [51], and commerce. Similarly, KNN is
    typically designed to provide efficient mechanisms for finding hidden patterns
    from big data sets, such that retrieved objects are similar to the predefined
    category [52]. Using cases further improve the KNN algorithm for application in
    anomaly detection [53], high-dimensional data [54], and scientific experiments
    [55]. Classification has other extensions while adopting a large number of artificial
    intelligence and data mining techniques. Consequently, classification is one of
    the widespread data mining techniques for big data analytics. Clustering is another
    data mining technique used as a big data analytics method. Contrary to classification,
    clustering uses an unsupervised learning approach and creates groups for given
    objects based on their distinctive meaningful features [56]. As we have presented
    in Figure 2 that grouping a large number of objects in the form of clusters makes
    data manipulation simple. The well-known methods used for clustering are hierarchical
    clustering and partitioning. The hierarchical clustering approach keeps combining
    small clusters of data objects to form a hierarchical tree and create agglomerative
    clusters. Divisive clusters are created in the opposite manner by dividing a single
    cluster that contains all data objects into smaller appropriate clusters [57].
    Market analysis and business decision making are the most significant applications
    of big data analytics. The process of association rule mining involves identifying
    interesting relationships among different objects, events, or other entities to
    analyze market trends, consumer buying behavior, and product demand predictions
    (see Figure 2). Association rule mining [58] focuses on identifying and creating
    rules based on the frequency of occurrences for numeric and non-numeric data.
    Data processing is performed in two manners under association rules. First, sequential
    data processing uses priori-based algorithms, such as MSPS [59] and LAPIN-SPAM
    [60], to identify interaction associations. Another significant data processing
    approach under association rule is temporal sequence analysis, which uses algorithms
    to analyze event patterns in continuous data. Predictive analytics use historical
    data, which are known as training data, to determine the results as trends or
    behavior in data. SVM and fuzzy logic algorithms are used to identify relationships
    between independent and dependent variables and to obtain regression curves for
    predictions, such as for natural disasters. Furthermore, customer buying predictions
    and social media trends are analyzed through predictive analytics [61] (see Table
    2). In the case of big data analytics, processing requirements are modified according
    to the nature and volume of data. Fast data access and mining methods for structured
    and unstructured data are major concerns related to big data analytics. Furthermore,
    data representation is a significant requirement in big data analytics. Time series
    analysis reduces high dimensionality associated with big data and offers representation
    for improved decision making. Research related to time series representation includes
    ARMA [62], bitmaps [63], and wavelet functions [64]. TABLE 2 Applications of Big
    Data Mining for IoT The big data analytics methods discussed in this section are
    widely adopted in many application areas of big data, such as disaster management,
    healthcare, business, industry, and e-governance. In Table 2, we present the application
    areas of big data mining functionalities that are elaborated in this section,
    ‘ ✓ ’ is used to show the support for an application whereas ‘-’ denotes that
    it is not obvious whether the method supports to an application or not. In particular,
    Table 2 shows that classification methods are suitable for medical imaging, industry,
    speech recognition, natural language processing, and e-governance. Clustering
    and association rule-based data analytics methods are applicable to industry and
    e-governance and are well adopted in healthcare, e-commerce, and bioinformatics.
    Predictive analytics are useful for disaster and market predictions, whereas time
    series analysis is used in disaster forecasting, medical imaging, speech recognition,
    social network analysis, and e-governance. D. IoT Architecture for Big Data Analytics
    The architectural concept of IoT has several definitions based on IoT domain abstraction
    and identification. It offers a reference model that defines relationships among
    various IoT verticals, such as, smart traffic, smart home, smart transportation,
    and smart health. The architecture for big data analytics offers a design for
    data abstraction. Furthermore, this standard provides a reference architecture
    that builds upon the reference model. Many IoT architectures are found in the
    literature [13], [66], [67]. For example, [13] offered an IoT architecture with
    cloud computing at the center and a model of end-to-end interaction among various
    stakeholders in a cloud-centric IoT framework for better comparison with the proposed
    IoT architecture. This architecture is achieved by seamless ubiquitous sensing,
    data analytics, and information representation with IoT as the unifying architecture.
    However, the current architecture focuses on IoT with regard to communications.
    To our knowledge, our proposed architecture, which integrates IoT and big data
    analytics, has not been studied in the current literature. Figure 3 illustrates
    the IoT architecture and big data analytics. In this figure, the sensor layer
    contains all the sensor devices and the objects, which are connected through a
    wireless network. This wireless network communication can be RFID, WiFi, ultra-wideband,
    ZigBee, and Bluetooth. The IoT gateway allows communication of the Internet and
    various webs. The upper layer concerns big data analytics, where a large amount
    of data received from sensors are stored in the cloud and accessed through big
    data analytics applications. These applications contain API management and a dashboard
    to help in the interaction with the processing engine. FIGURE 3. IoT architecture
    and big data analytics. Show All A novel meta-model-based approach for integrating
    IoT architecture objects is proposed. The concept is semi-automatically federated
    into a holistic digital enterprise architecture environment. The main objective
    is to provide an adequate decision support for complex business, architecture
    management with the development of assessment systems, and IT environment. Thus,
    architectural decisions for IoT are closely connected with code implementation
    to allow users to understand the integration of enterprise architecture management
    with IoT. SECTION IV. Use Cases This section presents a number of use cases for
    big IoT data analytics. Although the use cases are relevant to IoT applications,
    the choices have been guided for the ones that are most commonly used in IoT applications
    and for the amount of data that can be generated for analytics. A. Smart Metering
    Smart metering is one of the IoT application use cases that generates a large
    amount of data from different sources, such as smart grids, tank levels, and water
    flows, and silos stock calculation, in which processing takes a long time even
    on a dedicated and powerful machine [68]. A smart meter is a device that electronically
    records consumption of electric energy data between the meter and the control
    system. Collecting and analyzing smart meter data in IoT environment assist the
    decision maker in predicting electricity consumption. Furthermore, the analytics
    of a smart meter can also be used to forecast demands to prevent crises and satisfy
    strategic objectives through specific pricing plans. Thus, utility companies must
    be capable of high-volume data management and advanced analytics designed to transform
    data into actionable insights. B. Smart Transportation A smart transportation
    system is an IoT-based use case that aims to support the smart city concept. A
    smart transportation system intends to deploy powerful and advanced communication
    technologies for the management of smart cities. Traditional transportation systems,
    which are based on image processing, are affected by weather conditions, such
    as heavy rains and thick fog. Consequently, the captured image may not be clearly
    visible. The design of an e-plate system [69] using RFID technology provides a
    good solution for intelligent monitoring, tracking, and identification of vehicles.
    Moreover, introducing IoT into vehicular technologies will enable traffic congestion
    management to exhibit significantly better performance than the existing infrastructure.
    This technology can improve existing traffic systems in which vehicles can effectively
    communicate with one another in a systematic manner without human intervention.
    Satellite navigation systems and sensors can also be applied in trucks, ships,
    and airplanes in real time. The routing of these vehicles can be optimized by
    using the bulk of available public data, such as traffic jams, road conditions,
    delivery addresses, weather conditions, and locations of refilling stations. For
    example, in case of runtime address change, the updated information (route, cost)
    can be optimized, recalculated, and passed on to drivers in real time. Sensors
    incorporated into these vehicles can also provide real-time information to measure
    engine health, determine whether equipment requires maintenance, and predict errors
    [70]. C. Smart Supply Chains Embedded sensor technologies can communicate bidirectionally
    and provide remote accessibility to over 1 million elevators worldwide [71]. The
    captured data are used by on-and off-site technicians to run diagnostics and repair
    options to make appropriate decisions, which result in increased machine uptime
    and enhanced customer service. Ultimately, big IoT data analytics allows a supply
    chain to execute decisions and control the external environment. IoT-enabled factory
    equipment will be able to communicate within data parameters (i.e., machine utilization,
    temperature) and optimize performance by changing equipment settings or process
    workflow [72]. In-transit visibility is another use case that will play a vital
    role in future supply chains in the presence of IoT infrastructure. Key technologies
    used by in-transit visibility are RFIDs and cloud-based Global Positioning System
    (GPS), which provide location, identity, and other tracking information. These
    data will be the backbone of supply chains supported by IoT technologies. The
    information gathered by equipment will provide detailed visibility of an item
    shipped from a manufacturer to a retailer. Data collected via RFID and GPS technologies
    will allow supply chain managers to enhance automated shipment and accurate delivery
    information by predicting time of arrival. Similarly, managers will be able to
    monitor other information, such as temperature control, which can affect the quality
    of in-transit products. D. Smart Agriculture Smart agriculture is a beneficial
    use case in big IoT data analytics. Sensors are the actors in the smart agriculture
    use case. They are installed in fields to obtain data on moisture level of soil,
    trunk diameter of plants, microclimate condition, and humidity level, as well
    as to forecast weather. Sensors transmit obtained data using network and communication
    devices. These data pass through an IoT gateway and the Internet to reach the
    analytics layer shown in Table 1. The analytics layer processes the data obtained
    from the sensor network to issue commands. Automatic climate control according
    to harvesting requirements, timely and controlled irrigation, and humidity control
    for fungus prevention are examples of actions performed based on big data analytics
    recommendations. E. Smart Grid The smart grid is a new generation of power grid
    in which managing and distributing electricity between suppliers and consumers
    is upgraded using two-way communication technologies and computing capabilities
    to improve reliability, safety, efficiency with real-time control, and monitoring
    [73], [74]. One of the major challenges in a power system is integrating renewable
    and decentralized energy. Electricity systems require a smart grid to manage the
    volatile behavior of distributed energy resources (DERs) [75]. However, most energy
    systems have to follow governmental laws and regulations, as well as consider
    business analysis and potential legal constraints [76]. Grid sensors and devices
    continuously and rapidly generate data related to control loops and protection
    and require real-time processing and analytics along with machine-to-machine (M2M)
    or human-to-machine (HMI) interactions to issue control commands to the system.
    However, the system must fulfill visualization and reporting requirements. F.
    Smart Traffic Light System The smart traffic light system consists of nodes that
    locally interact with IoT sensors and devices to detect the presence of vehicles,
    bikers, and pedestrians. These nodes communicate with neighboring traffic lights
    to measure the speed and distance of approaching transportation means and manage
    green traffic signals [77]. IoT data gathered using the system require real-time
    analytics processing to perform necessary tasks, such as changing the timing cycles
    according to traffic conditions, sending informative signals to neighboring nodes,
    and detecting approaching vehicles that use IoT sensors and devices to prevent
    long queues or accidents. Moreover, smart traffic light systems can send their
    collected IoT data to cloud storage for further analytics. Table 3 presents the
    use cases of IoT big data analytics. TABLE 3 Comparison of IoT Big Data Analytics
    use Cases As shown in Table 3, most use cases are related to M2M communication
    technologies and decrease the role of human interaction. However, the technologies
    use prediction methods and decision-making techniques to improve real-time control,
    monitoring, and performance. Textual data are among the common data types generated
    by IoT devices, which are mostly sensors and cameras. Text-based data are suitable
    for analysis by distributed file systems, such as Hadoop. SECTION V. Opportunities
    IoT is currently considered one of the most profound transitions in technology.
    Current IoT provides several data analytics opportunities for big data analytics.
    Figure 4 shows the examples of use cases and opportunities discussed in Sections
    4 and 5. FIGURE 4. Example of use cases and opportunities for big IoT data analytics
    architecture. Show All A. E-Commerce Big IoT data analytics offers well-designed
    tools to process real-time big data, which produce timely results for decision
    making. Big IoT data exhibit heterogeneity, increasing volume, and real-time data
    processing features. The convergence of big data with IoT brings new challenges
    and opportunities to build a smart environment. Big IoT data analytics has widespread
    applications in nearly every industry. However, the main success areas of analytics
    are in e-commerce, revenue growth, increased customer size, accuracy of sale forecast
    results, product optimization, risk management, and improved customer segmentation.
    B. Smart Cities Big data collected from smart cities offer new opportunities in
    which efficiency gains can be achieved through an appropriate analytics platform/infrastructure
    to analyze big IoT data. Various devices connect to the Internet in a smart environment
    and share information. Moreover, the cost of storing data has been reduced dramatically
    after the invention of cloud computing technology. Analysis capabilities have
    made huge leaps. Thus, the role of big data in a smart city can potentially transform
    every sector of the economy of a nation. Hadoop with YARN resource manager has
    offered recent advancement in big data technology to support and handle numerous
    workloads, real-time processing, and streaming data ingestion. C. Retail and Logistics
    IoT is expected to play a key role as an emerging technology in the area of retail
    and logistics. In logistics, RFID keeps track of containers, pallets, and crates.
    In addition, considerable advancements in IoT technologies can facilitate retailers
    by providing several benefits. However, IoT devices generate large amounts of
    data on a daily basis. Thus, powerful data analytics enables enterprises to gain
    insights from the voluminous amounts of data produced through IoT technologies.
    Applying data analytics to logistic data sets can improve the shipment experience
    of customers. Moreover, retail companies can earn additional profit by analyzing
    customer data, which can predict the trends and demands of goods. By looking into
    customer data, optimizing pricing plans and seasonal promotions can be planned
    efficiently to maximize profit. D. Healthcare Recent years have witnessed tremendous
    growth in smart health monitoring devices. These devices generate enormous amounts
    of data. Thus, applying data analytics to data collected from fetal monitors,
    electrocardiograms, temperature monitors, or blood glucose level monitors can
    help healthcare specialists efficiently assess the physical conditions of patients.
    Moreover, data analytics enables healthcare professionals to diagnose serious
    diseases in their early stages to help save lives. Furthermore, data analytics
    improves the clinical quality of care and ensures the safety of patients. In addition,
    physician profile can be reviewed by looking into the history of treatment of
    patients, which can improve customer satisfaction, acquisition, and retention.
    SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Future Directions IoT and big data analytics have
    been extensively accepted by many organizations. However, these technologies are
    still in their early stages. Several existing research challenges have not yet
    been addressed. This section presents several challenges in the field of big IoT
    data analytics. A. Privacy Privacy issues arise when a system is compromised to
    infer or restore personal information using big data analytics tools, although
    data are generated from anonymous users. With the proliferation of big data analytics
    technologies used in big IoT data, the privacy issue has become a core problem
    in the data mining domain. Consequently, most people are reluctant to rely on
    these systems, which do not provide solid service-level agreement (SLA) conditions
    regarding user personal information theft or misuse. In fact, the sensitive information
    of users has to be secured and protected from external interference. Although
    temporary identification, anonymity, and encryptions provide several ways to enforce
    data privacy, decisions have to be made with regard to ethical factors, such as
    what to use, how to use, and why use generated big IoT data [7]. Another security
    risk associated with IoT data is the heterogeneity of the types of devices used
    and the nature of generated data, such as raw devices, data types, and communication
    protocols. These devices can have different sizes and shapes outside the network
    and are designed to communicate with cooperative applications. Thus, to authenticate
    these devices, an IoT system should assign a non-repudiable identification system
    to each device. Moreover, enterprises should maintain a meta-repository of these
    connected devices for auditing purposes. This heterogeneous IoT architecture is
    new to security professionals, and thus, results in increased security risks.
    Consequently, any attack in this scenario compromises system security and disconnects
    interconnected devices. In the context of big IoT data, security and privacy are
    the key challenges in processing and storing huge amounts of data. Moreover, to
    perform critical operations and host private data, these systems highly rely on
    third party services and infrastructure. Therefore, an exponential growth in data
    rate causes difficulty in securing each and every portion of critical data. As
    previously discussed, existing security solutions (Karim, 2016 #86) are no long
    applicable to providing complete security in big IoT data scenarios. Existing
    algorithms are not designed for the dynamic observation of data, and thus, are
    not effectively applied. Legacy data security solutions are specifically designed
    for static data sets, whereas current data requirements are changing dynamically
    (Lafuente, 2015). Thus, deploying these security solutions is difficult for dynamically
    increasing data. In addition, legislative and regulatory issues should be considered
    while signing SLAs. With regard to data generated through IoT, the following security
    problems can emerge [78]: (a) timely updates - difficulty in keeping systems up
    to date, (b) incident management - identifying suspicious traffic patterns among
    legitimate ones and possible failure to capture unidentifiable incidents, (c)
    interoperability - proprietary and vendor-specific procedures will pose difficulties
    in finding hidden or zero day attacks, (d) and protocol convergence - although
    IPv6 is currently compatible with the latest specifications, this protocol has
    yet to be fully deployed. Therefore, the application of security rules over IPv4
    may not be applicable to protecting IPv6. At present, no answer can address these
    challenges and manage the security and privacy of interconnected devices. However,
    the following guidelines can overcome these adversities. (a) First, a true open
    ecosystem with standard APIs is necessary to avoid interoperability and reliability
    problems. (b) Second, devices must be well protected while communicating with
    peers. (c) Third, devices should be hardcoded with the best security practices
    to protect against common security and privacy threats. B. Data Mining Data mining
    methods provide efficient and best-fitting predictive or descriptive solutions
    for big data that can also be generalized for new data [45]. The evolution of
    big IoT data and cloud computing platforms has brought the challenges of data
    exploration and information extraction [79]. However, for the overall big IoT
    data architecture, Figure 5 presents the primary challenges related to processing
    and data mining. FIGURE 5. Big data mining issues in IoT. Show All Exhaustive
    data reads/writes: The high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety qualities
    of big IoT data challenge exploration, integration, heterogeneous communication,
    and extraction processes. The size and heterogeneity of data impose new data mining
    requirements, and diversity in data sources also poses a challenge [80]–[82].
    Furthermore, compared with small data sets, large data sets comprise more abnormalities
    and ambiguities that require additional preprocessing steps, such as cleansing,
    reduction, and transmission [23], [83]. Another issue lies in the extraction of
    exact and knowledgeable information from the large volumes of diverse data. Consequently,
    obtaining accurate information from complex data requires analyzing data properties
    and finding association among different data points. Researchers have introduced
    parallel and sequential programming models and proposed different algorithms to
    minimize query response time while dealing with big data. Moreover, researchers
    have selected existing data mining algorithms in different manners to (a) improve
    single source knowledge discovery, (b) implement data mining methods for multi-source
    platforms, and (c) study and analyze dynamic data mining methods and stream data
    [84]. Hence, parallel k -means algorithm [85] and parallel association rule mining
    methods [65] are introduced. However, the need to devise algorithms remains to
    provide compatibility with the latest parallel architectures. Moreover, synchronization
    issues may occur in parallel computing, while information is exchanged within
    different data mining methods. This bottleneck of data mining methods has become
    an open issue in big IoT data analytics that should be addressed. C. Visualization
    Visualization is an important entity in big data analytics, particularly when
    dealing with IoT systems where data are generated enormously. Furthermore, conducting
    data visualization is difficult because of the large size and high dimension of
    big data. This situation shows underlying trends and a complete picture of parsed
    data. Therefore, big data analytics and visualization should work seamlessly to
    obtain the best results from IoT applications in big data. However, visualization
    in the case of heterogeneous and diverse data (unstructured, structured, and semi-structured)
    is a challenging task. Designing visualization solution that is compatible with
    advanced big data indexing frameworks is a difficult task. Similarly, response
    time is a desirable factor in big IoT data analytics. Consequently, cloud computing
    architectures supported with rich GUI facilities can be deployed to obtain better
    insights into big IoT data trends [86]. Different dimensionality reduction methods
    have been introduced as a result of complex and high-dimensional big IoT data
    [87], [88]. However, these methods are unsuitable for all types of presented data.
    Similarly, when fine-grained dimensions are visualized effectively, the probability
    to identify observable correlations, patterns, and outliners is high [89]. Moreover,
    data should be kept locally to obtain usable information efficiently because of
    power and bandwidth constraints. In addition, visualization software should run
    with the concept of reference locality to achieve efficient outcome in an IoT
    environment. Given that the amount of big IoT data is increasing rapidly, the
    requirement of enormous parallelization is a challenging task in visualization.
    Thus, to decompose a problem into manageable independent tasks to enforce concurrent
    execution of queries is a challenge for parallel visualization algorithms [90].
    At present, most big data visualization tools used for IoT exhibit poor performance
    results in terms of functionality, scalability, and response time. To provide
    effective uncertainty-aware visualization during the visual analytics process,
    avoiding uncertainty imposes a considerable challenge [32]. Furthermore, several
    important issues are addressed [91], such as (a) visual noise - most data set
    objects are closely related to one another, and thus, users may perceive different
    results of the same type; (b) information loss - applying reduction methods to
    visible data sets can cause information loss; (c) large image observation - data
    visualization tools have inherent problems with respect to aspect ratio, devise
    resolution, and physical perception limits; (d) frequently changing image - users
    will not notice rapid data changes in an output; and (e) high performance requirements
    - high performance requirements are imposed because data are generated dynamically
    in an IoT environment. Moreover, methods supported by advanced analytics enable
    interactive graphics on laptops, desktops, or mobile devices, such as smartphones
    and tablets [92]. Real-time analytics is another consideration highlighted in
    IoT architectures. Several guidelines on visualization in big data are presented
    [93], such as (a) data awareness, i.e., appropriate domain expertise, (b) data
    quality - cleaning data using information management or data governance policies,
    (c) meaningful results - data clustering is used to provide high-level abstraction
    such that the visibility of smaller groups of data is possible, and (d) outliers
    should be removed from the data or treated as a separate entity. Reference [94]
    suggested that visualization should adhere to the following guidelines: (a) the
    system should provide special attention to metadata, (b) visualization software
    should be interactive and should require maximum user involvement, and (c) tools
    should be built based on the dynamic nature of the generated data. D. Integration
    Integration refers to having a uniform view of different formats. Data integration
    provides a single view of the data arriving from different sources and combines
    the view of data [95]. Data integration includes all processes involved in collecting
    data from different sources, as well as in storing and providing data with a unified
    view. For each moment, different forms of data are continuously generated by social
    media, IoT, and other communication and telecommunication approaches. The produced
    data can be categorized into three groups: (a) structured data, such as data stored
    in traditional database systems, including tables with rows and columns; (b) semi-structured,
    such as HTML, XML, and Json files; and (c) unstructured data, such as videos,
    audios, and images. Good data offer good information; however, this relationship
    is only achieved through data integration [96]. Integrating diverse data types
    is a complex task in merging different systems or applications [97]. Overlapping
    the same data, increasing performance and scalability, and enabling real-time
    data access are among the challenges associated with data integration that should
    be addressed in the future. Another challenge is to adjust structures in semi-structured
    and unstructured data before integrating and analyzing these types of data [98].
    Information, such as entities and relationships, can be extracted from textual
    data by using available technologies in the eras of text mining, machine learning,
    natural processing, and information extraction. However, new technologies should
    be developed to extract images, videos, and other information from other non-text
    formats of unstructured data [98]. Text mining is expected to be conducted by
    applying several specialized extractors on the same text. Hence, managing and
    integrating different extraction results from a certain data source require other
    techniques [99]. SECTION VII. Conclusion The growth rate of data production has
    increased drastically over the past years with the proliferation of smart and
    sensor devices. The interaction between IoT and big data is currently at a stage
    where processing, transforming, and analyzing large amounts of data at a high
    frequency are necessary. We conducted this survey in the context of big IoT data
    analytics. First, we explored recent analytics solutions. The relationship between
    big data analytics and IoT was also discussed. Moreover, we proposed an architecture
    for big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big data analytics types, methods, and
    technologies for big data mining were presented. Some credible use cases were
    also provided. In addition, we explored the domain by discussing various opportunities
    brought about by data analytics in the IoT paradigm. Several open research challenges
    were discussed as future research directions. Finally, we concluded that existing
    big IoT data analytics solutions remained in their early stages of development.
    In the future, real-time analytics solution that can provide quick insights will
    be required. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    Abstract: Improving farm productivity is essential for increasing farm proﬁtability
    and meeting the

    rapidly growing demand for food that is fuelled by rapid population growth across
    the world. Farm

    productivity can be increased by understanding and forecasting crop performance
    in a variety of

    environmental conditions. Crop recommendation is currently based on data collected
    in ﬁeld-based

    agricultural studies that capture crop performance under a variety of conditions
    (e.g., soil quality and

    environmental conditions). However, crop performance data collection is currently
    slow, as such

    crop studies are often undertaken in remote and distributed locations, and such
    data are typically

    collected manually. Furthermore, the quality of manually collected crop performance
    data is very

    low, because it does not take into account earlier conditions that have not been
    observed by the

    human operators but is essential to ﬁlter out collected data that will lead to
    invalid conclusions

    (e.g., solar radiation readings in the afternoon after even a short rain or overcast
    in the morning

    are invalid, and should not be used in assessing crop performance). Emerging Internet
    of Things

    (IoT) technologies, such as IoT devices (e.g., wireless sensor networks, network-connected
    weather

    stations, cameras, and smart phones) can be used to collate vast amount of environmental
    and crop

    performance data, ranging from time series data from sensors, to spatial data
    from cameras, to human

    observations collected and recorded via mobile smart phone applications. Such
    data can then be

    analysed to ﬁlter out invalid data and compute personalised crop recommendations
    for any speciﬁc

    farm. In this paper, we present the design of SmartFarmNet, an IoT-based platform
    that can automate

    the collection of environmental, soil, fertilisation, and irrigation data; automatically
    correlate such

    data and ﬁlter-out invalid data from the perspective of assessing crop performance;
    and compute

    crop forecasts and personalised crop recommendations for any particular farm.
    SmartFarmNet

    can integrate virtually any IoT device, including commercially available sensors,
    cameras, weather

    stations, etc., and store their data in the cloud for performance analysis and
    recommendations.

    An evaluation of the SmartFarmNet platform and our experiences and lessons learnt
    in developing

    this system concludes the paper. SmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest
    system in the world

    (in terms of the number of sensors attached, crops assessed, and users it supports)
    that provides crop

    performance analysis and recommendations.

    1. Introduction

    Improving farm productivity requires crop performance to be understood and forecasted
    under

    a wide variety of environmental, soil, fertilisation, and irrigation conditions.
    Productivity of a

    farm can be enhanced by determining which crop variety has produced the greatest
    yield under

    similar soil, climate, fertilisation, and irrigation conditions. The same data-driven
    approach to

    crop selection can also address climate change, resource constraints (water, labour,
    and energy

    shortages), and societal concerns around issues such as animal welfare, fertilizers,
    and environment

    that often impact agricultural production [1]. According to the United Nations’
    Food and Agriculture

    Organization [2], food production must increase by 60% by 2050 to be able to feed
    the growing

    population, expected to reach 9 billion. Increased crop productivity is urgently
    needed, and it is the

    cornerstone of any solution for meeting food shortage and farm proﬁtability problems.
    Smart farming

    involves the use of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and in particular,
    the Internet of

    Things (IoT) and related big data analytics to address these challenges via the
    electronic monitoring of

    crops, as well as related environmental, soil, fertilisation, and irrigation conditions.
    Such monitoring

    data can be then be analysed to identify which crops and speciﬁc crop varieties
    can best meet the

    productivity targets of any particular farm around the world. Crop variety identiﬁcation
    involves

    the use of plant phenomics (an area of biology concerned with the measurement
    of phenomes—the

    physical and biochemical traits of organisms—as they change in response to genetic
    mutation and

    environmental inﬂuences [3]). Therefore, smart farming permits the assoication
    of crop data (i.e., crop

    performance, environmental, soil, irrigation, and fertilisation data) and related
    data analysis results

    with speciﬁc crop varieties (i.e., plant genes and phenotypes). The association
    of information will

    revolutionize the way food is produced globally..

    To observe the growth of the crop under varying real-world conditions (e.g., soil
    quality,

    environmental conditions, etc.), typical crop studies involve phenotyping to understand
    the key

    factors (e.g., the pH levels of soil, the rate of Nitrogen depletion) affecting
    growth. Such studies

    are conducted in natural outdoor environmental conditions and locations where
    plants are growing,

    by varying irrigation and the application of fertilizers/additives. Internet of
    Things (IoT) technologies

    can lower the cost and increase the scale of such studies via the collection of
    related time series data

    from sensor networks, spatial data from imaging sensors, and human observations
    recorded via mobile

    smart phone applications [4]. For example, IoT devices can help to capture the
    pH levels of soils

    and the rate of Nitrogen depletion as time-series data, and share it among interested
    researchers and

    growers for further analysis.

    Point solutions for smart farming currently exist , but they can only utilise
    a small number of

    speciﬁc IoT devices (e.g., a speciﬁc model of soil humidity sensor), and provide
    no support for data

    analysis or sharing. Using such existing solutions also requires a signiﬁcant
    effort in order to integrate

    and correlate the data obtained from different IoT devices , e.g., data from a
    fertilizer sprayer on a tractor

    (made by one manufacturer) with the data obtained from soil moisture sensors (made
    by a different

    manufacturer). Existing solutions are not designed around a bring-your-own IoT
    sensor principle that

    will allow the use of new IoT devices without modiﬁcation, and permit such solutions
    to keep up with

    the rapid development of cheaper and better IoT sensors. Furthermore, none of
    the existing solutions

    are designed for comprehensive and scalable analysis, recommendation/visualisation,
    or sharing of

    crop performance data among farmers, growers, biologists, government, and commercial
    organisations

    that support farming operations and produce relevant products.

    In this paper, we present SmartFarmNet, an IoT platform for smart farming applications
    that

    provides the following:

    1.

    Allows a bring-your-own IoT sensor principle , i.e., permits effortless integration
    and use of

    virtually any IoT device, including commercially available sensors, cameras, weather
    stations,

    etc. This reduces sensor installation and maintenance costs, while providing for
    easy upgrade to

    newer and more advanced sensors.

    2.

    Supports scalable data analytics that can continuously process large crop performance
    data.

    Offers do-it-yourself tools that allow plant biologists and farmers/growers to
    analyze and

    visualize plant performance data.

    SmartFarmNet was developed by a multi-disciplinary Australian team that included
    crop

    biologists, computer scientists, growers, and farmers. SmartFarmNet is largest
    system in the world

    (in terms of the number of sensors attached, crops assessed, and users it supports)
    that provides crop

    performance analysis and recommendations. It is also the ﬁrst system to provide
    the features (1)–(3)

    above, which are the main innovations presented in this paper. Moreover, SmartFarmNet
    provides

    tools for fast and scalable data that can cope with the enormous velocity of data
    (Big Data) generated

    from hundreds of thousands of IoT sensors.

    The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we present a smart
    farming use case.

    Section 3 presents the current state-of-the-art, and discusses the challenges
    in developing IoT-based

    solutions for smart farming. Section 4 presents the architecture of the SmartFarmNet
    platform and

    highlights its key features. Section 5 covers the software implementation of the
    platform. Section 6

    presents evaluation results, while Section 7 outlines lessons learned. Section
    8 concludes the paper.

    2. A Use Case and Related Challenges for Smart Farming

    Phenonet [5] is an agricultural phenotyping ﬁeld laboratory, involving a variety
    of crop studies

    that are being conducted using state-of-the-art IoT technologies [6], including
    sensor networks, IP

    cameras, mobile smartphones, and related data analytics. These enable near real-time
    capture of crop

    data for assessing and predicting crop performance (both short-term and long-term)
    for any given

    environmental, soil, fertilisation, and irrigation conditions, including weather
    conditions, plant canopy

    temperature, soil moisture, soil quality and salinity, fertiliser usage, and irrigation.
    Phenonet is helping

    plant biologist and growers achieve the following: (1) identify the inﬂuence of
    different conditions on a

    variety of crops in real-world outdoor farm environments; (2) understand water
    resource consumption

    in order to manage it effectively; (3) study the impact of various fertilizers;
    (4) get real-time data to

    forecast crop performance; and (5) share data and results. To better explain Phenonet,
    we provide

    additional details about sample studies conducted in Phenonet. One of these studies
    aim to evaluate

    the effect of sheep grazing on crop re-growth by looking at root activity, water
    use, rate of crop

    growth, and crop yield. In this study, soil moisture sensors deployed at multiple
    depths and canopy

    temperature sensors are used to track the crop roots’ extraction of water from
    the soil throughout the

    growing season. This information is then used to measure and assess root activity
    and crop growth.

    Figure 1 presents an overview of this Phenonet study that is conducted on a block
    of land that

    is divided into hundreds of plot. A plot is an intersection of a row and a column
    in a block of land

    and hosts a speciﬁc treatment to the crop being studied. For example, each plot
    may host a different

    application of fertilizers or host the application of the same fertilizer at different
    times. This Phenonet

    study requires support for real-time collection and delivery of data to biologists,
    who then share

    their insights with growers and farmers, as well as related scientiﬁc organisations.
    Some of the main

    challenges in supporting such studies and also normal farming activities include
    the following:

    •

    Capturing the large volume of heterogeneous data produced by a variety of IoT
    sensors (and

    possibly manual measurements), and doing this for a large number and variety of
    activities

    involving different studies as well as crops.

    •

    Supporting the integration and use of almost any IoT device, including all commercially
    available

    sensors, camera, weather stations, etc., as this will achieve a bring-your-own
    sensor model of

    operations that will allow farmers, growers, and scientists to take advantage
    of cheaper/more

    capable IoT sensors, as well as individual preferences and budgets.

    •

    Integrating heterogeneous data from such a great variety of IoT devices and also
    historical crop

    performance data produced by past studies (such data and results are typically
    available in CSV

    ﬁles that make it harder to use, analyse, explore, and share).

    •

    Providing crop performance data analysis software and related tools for do-it-yourself
    search,

    analysis and visualisation of collected data across multiple studies.

    3. Related Work and Challenges is Building IoT-Based Platforms for Smart Farming

    Relational database systems (e.g., mysql [7]) have been the historic choice for
    storing data from the

    sensors for later retrieval, analysis, and visualisation. However, the performance
    of these systems can

    be compromised by large streams of time-series data, and they do not address most
    of the challenges

    outlined in the Section 2.

    To meet such challenges vendors such as John Deere [8], IBM [9], and SensorCloud
    [10] currently

    explore or provide proprietary solutions that support speciﬁc sensors. However,
    vendor-speciﬁc

    solutions provide limited or no interoperability with other devices in the IoT
    ecosystem. Vendor lock-in

    is also a serious issue.

    A plethora of IoT middleware platforms has recently appeared in the marketplace.
    Examples

    include UBIDOTS [11], Xively [12], Thing Speak [13] Open.Sen.se [14], and SensorCloud
    [10] and

    more recently, Amazon IoT [15] and IBM IoT [16] platforms. These IoT middleware
    platforms aim to

    simplify the injection of data from all kinds of sources (physical devices, human
    input, online data, etc.)

    using a common Application Programming Interface (API) . All such platforms typically
    provide basic

    functionalities for ﬁltering and aggregating the data, as well as speciﬁcation
    of events based on input

    data. Although the IoT platforms in this category (e.g., those based on IBM (Bluemix)
    and Amazon

    (EC2)) provide tools for data ingestion, storage, and computation via message
    passing interfaces

    utilising message queues and publish/subscribe mechanisms, the beneﬁts of these
    IoT platforms in

    smart agriculture is yet to be determined. In contrast to such lack of track record
    in this area, the

    SmartFarmNet platform we introduce in this paper (as well as its earlier variants
    and components) has

    been deployed across Australia and it has been successfully used in collecting
    and analysing data from

    tens of thousands of sensors deployed in remote ﬁeld locations. Furthermore, the
    outcomes presented

    in this paper are results and experiences gained obtained from four years of real-world
    deployments.

    The category of open source IoT platforms includes the IoTCloud architecture [17]
    project

    that originated from the Community Grids laboratory in Indiana University, USA.
    The IoTCloud

    architecture provides APIs for sensors to publish data to the cloud and for clients
    to subscribe to such

    data. IoTCloud takes advantage of a publish–subscribe architecture to support
    scalable ingestion

    and querying of sensor data. However, it lacks bring-your-own support for IoT
    devices, and does

    not provide fast, scalable analysis of sensor data. Other platforms in this category
    include the Data

    Turbine [18] and Apache Storm [19]. These IoT platforms focus only on the data
    ingestion layer.

    In particular, these middleware systems act as a black box through which applications
    and devices

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1884

    5 of 17

    exchange data.

    The SmartFarmNet platform provides a bring-you-own IoT device integration

    capability that includes virtually any IoT device that may be provided by any
    user (e.g., farmer,

    grower, or scientist). In particular, SmartFarmNet currently provides more than
    30 wrappers for most

    commercial (e.g., libelium [20] and experimental (e.g., arduino [21], tMotes [22],
    etc.) sensor platforms.

    IoT platforms that can utilise IoT devices provided independently by a third party
    must provide

    for sensor discovery [23] (i.e., ability to search sensor metadata). Although
    there has been extensive

    work in providing metadata management for sensory data [24,25], no IoT platform
    currently fully

    supports sensor discovery. For instance, projects such as SensorMap [26] have
    visualised live sensor

    data on a map, allowing users to ﬁnd sensors based on the sensor location. SmartFarmNet
    takes

    advantage of semantic web principles (such as Linked Open Data and Semantic Sensor
    Ontology

    (SSN) [27]) to search for and share sensor information in a way that can be read
    automatically

    by computers.

    Existing IoT-platforms are not designed to support near-real-time data ingestion,
    quick analysis,

    and visualisation of large volumes of sensor data. One of the key features of
    the SmartFarmNet

    platform is in its ability to deal with the high velocity of sensor data (time-series)
    by providing

    solutions for fast and scalable data analytics and retrieval. The do-it-yourself
    principles-driven

    user-interface allows complex data workﬂows to be built, composed, and executed
    without a need for

    programming. SmartFarmNet also provides a web-based virtual laboratory environment
    for biologists,

    farmers, and scientists to manage large volumes of crop sensor data while supporting
    rapid responses

    to queries, real-time user interaction, and the ability to share data from studies
    performed by multiple

    researchers. A comparative analysis of current IoT platforms and the proposed
    SmartFarmNet platform

    is presented in Table 1.

    4. The SmartFarmNet IoT Platform for Smart Farming

    4.1. SmartFarmNet’s Data Model

    The data model used by the SmartFarmNet platform is depicted in Figure 2. A user
    is a logical

    entity representing a project, a research group, or any other entity that owns
    data from a study.

    Experiments are crop studies, and each experiment has only one owner user. Tests
    are comprised

    of a collection of nodes, but each node can belong to multiple crop studies. A
    node can also have a

    location with it, such as latitude and longitude. A node is a group of data streams
    (from virtually any

    IoT device or even virtual sensors, e.g., CSV ﬁles from past studies). A stream
    is a time series data

    from an experiment with a unit of measurement. Metadata can be attached to every
    hierarchical layer

    of the data model. The following policies are enforced by the data model.

    •

    Any user can have zero or more studies.

    •

    Any study can have zero or more nodes.

    •

    Any node can have zero or more streams. Each node can also have latitude, longitude,
    and

    altitude values.

    •

    Any stream is a set of (timestamp, value) pairs. Each stream has one unit of measurement.

    The layout of a typical crop study (referred to as “experiment” in the data model)
    is illustrated

    in Figure 2. Such studies involve a particular area (one or more plots) in a ﬁeld.
    Any farm can be

    divided into plots, and the granularity of the analysis supported by SmartFarmNet
    is currently 9–10

    square meters. The plots are mapped to the node level that represents the sensor
    network platform

    (hosting all related communication and processing capabilities). Physical sensors
    observing a physical

    phenomenon (e.g., gypsum block sensors measuring soil moisture at multiple depths)
    are connected

    to corresponding streams. A measurement of soil moisture at a particular depth
    is mapped to a

    data stream associated with a node. In summary, the data streams map to the physical
    or virtual

    sensors that monitor a phenomenon, while nodes and experiments/studies are used
    for grouping

    streams at different levels. The metadata associated with nodes and streams at
    each level are critical for

    providing contextual information. In Phenonet, metadata at the experiment/study
    level may include

    the year when the study was conducted, the date the crop was sown, a description
    of the objectives

    of the study, and even descriptions about study site (e.g., the soil type). At
    the node level, the most

    important metadata ﬁelds are the plants’ genotype and its relative location within
    the plot (in most

    cases, a row/column notation is used). Treatments applied to individual plants
    can also be appended

    as metadata at the node level. The most relevant metadata at the stream level
    for Phenonet are the

    depth, the sensor type, and the sensor serial number, while sensor information
    such as the date of

    calibration or setting of the sensor can also be critical.

    4.2. Bring-Your-Own Sensors Support via the Semantic Sensor Network Ontology

    Providing bring-your-own sensors support involves the use of Semantic Sensor Network
    (SSN)

    ontology to represent the underlying IoT devices and the data generated by such
    devices. The SSN

    ontology was developed by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Semantic Sensor Networks
    Incubator

    Group [27], and provides a schema that describes sensors, observation, data attributes,
    and other

    related concepts. The SSN ontology is widely used, and has been utilised in a
    signiﬁcant number of

    Semantic Web and IoT projects, including SmartFarmNet. Linked Data is also used
    to relate and bind

    SSN concepts across multiple sensor platforms. The four main principles [28] of
    linked data include:

    (1) using unique Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URIs) to represent each IoT thing;
    (2) providing HTTP

    interfaces to access the URIs (descriptions); (3) offering information related
    to URIs via the Resource

    Description Framework (RDF) [29]; and (4) linking URIs. The linked data approach
    allows sensor

    descriptions and sensor data to be linked with corresponding domain-speciﬁc knowledge.

    The SmartFarmNet ontology (Figure 3) is an extended version of the SSN ontology
    that describes

    the SmartFarmNet data model we presented in Section 4.1. The ontology provides
    the means to map

    the data model to sensor descriptions. For example, a soil moisture sensor X is
    deployed in a plot

    Y, which grows a crop Z. Sensor X and its data are described using the SSN ontology.
    This ontology

    includes the physical and technical nature of the installed sensor network, such
    as what physical

    platform the sensor is on, and location of the sensor. The description of the
    plot Y and crop Z is based

    on the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE) Ultra-Light
    upper

    ontology [30].

    Figure 3. The SmartFarmNet ontology (phen denotes the phenonet ontology namespace,
    dul denotes

    the DOLCE+DnS Ultralite ontology namespace and ssn denotes the SSN namespace).

    The SmartFarmNet Ontology describes the plots, the crops and the corresponding
    treatments

    applied to the crops. For example, consider crops with a particular genotype (e.g.,
    revenue) that

    are sown in plots belonging to a study. This crop is subjected to different treatment
    (e.g., irrigation).

    The sensors deployed in the plots are governed by a geo-location observation system
    either at the

    plot level, or at the level of some sub-feature of the plot (e.g., a layer of
    soil within the plot), or as the

    entire site of the study (e.g., temperature and humidity covering the whole study
    site). The sampling

    feature links the sensors to corresponding plots, and from the plot to the combination
    of genotype,

    treatments, and events (such as sowing dates, etc). Features can be related such
    as a soil layer can

    be from an individual plot or from several plots linked together into a study
    site. The ability to

    connect features means that measurements of larger phenomena (such as the site
    weather) can be

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1884

    8 of 17

    associated to individual plots and plants. The ontology allows data to be mapped
    to the semantics of

    the SmartFarmNet, enabling on-the-ﬂy automatic annotation of sensor data streams.

    4.3. Scalable Data Analysis of Sensor Data in SmartFarmNet

    SmartFarmNet provides near real-time response to queries over time-series data
    streams from

    sensors. Just like in the SensorDB [4] platform we developed earlier, the SmartFarmNet
    platform uses

    an internal data structure called micro summarisation to build a summary of statistical
    features for

    incoming sensor data streams. Furthermore, SmartFarmNet internally uses aggregation
    windows.

    There are several collection windows deﬁned, including 1-min window, 15-min window,
    1-h window,

    1-day window, 1-month window, 1-year window, and a start-of-time window. Each
    aggregation

    window maintains the following information about the data points it holds: the
    number of data points

    in each window, the minimum and maximum values, and the average and standard deviation
    of the

    data points inside the window.

    SmartFarmNet uses a combination of non SQL (NoSQL) and Semantic data stores to
    manage

    user data, sensor data, aggregated data, and caching of commonly used information.
    The storage

    layer behind each aggregation window is allocated based on query access patterns.
    Using this

    approach, we can optimize micro-summary computations for different scenarios.
    For instance, if a

    data item at the 1-h aggregation window is accessed more frequently than the 1-min
    aggregation

    window, SmartFarmNet can be conﬁgured to store and cache data in that collection
    window in faster

    storage, such as in memory storage or a solid state disk drive. The data stream
    processing model of

    SmartFarmNet is presented in Figure 4. The platform provides three levels of data
    storage: (1) Short

    Term Cache; (2) Moving Summaries; and (3) Static Summaries. The summaries computed
    over the

    moving aggregate window are termed “moving summaries”, and are updated with new
    incoming

    data streams. The static summaries are provided for data streams whose data does
    not change rapidly

    over time, hence not requiring frequent re-computation of summaries. Finally,
    the short-term cache

    is used to store raw data in order to improve the response time of raw data requests.
    The resource

    allocation strategy uses the combination of the query and the performance of each
    storage to determine

    where to store incoming data streams. The unique feature of the platform is its
    elasticity. A stateless

    process thread works on the queue (at the left of Figure 4) to process each individual
    sensor data

    stream. Therefore, we can achieve a high degree of distributed and parallel processing
    that can utilise

    available computing resources very efﬁciently. The stream maintains the stream
    identiﬁers that link it

    to the moving micro-summaries of all related streams computed over days, weeks,
    months, and years.

    Figure 4. SmartFarmNet—scalable data analysis of sensor data.

    4.4. SmartFarmNet Architecture

    Figure 5 depicts the architecture of the SmartFarmNet platform.

    SmartFarmNet provides

    support for bring-your-own sensor, i.e., the ability to integrate and describe
    virtually any IoT device,

    including sensors, mobile smart phones, cameras, farming equipment, etc. The data
    generated

    from such IoT devices are initially processed on local SmartFarmNet gateways.
    The SmartFarmNet

    gateways communicate with both the sensors and the SmartFarmNet Platform running
    in the

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1884

    9 of 17

    cloud.

    The SmartFarmNet gateways also allow processing of sensor data closer to the source,

    enabling improved usage of communication bandwidth between remote sites and the
    cloud platform.

    The SmartFarmNet platform on the cloud is responsible for storage and performing
    real-time analysis

    on incoming sensor data streams. It also provides do-it-yourself-driven interfaces
    for user queries,

    and for interactive visualisation and sharing of sensor data and analysis results.
    The distribution

    model used by SmartFarmNet enables sensor data collected in one study to be used
    in other

    studies (e.g., temperature data gathered from a crop study can be re-purposed
    to study the movement

    of locust, based on weather conditions). In the following itemized list we provide
    a description of

    various components of the SmartFarmNet platform speciﬁcally designed and developed
    to address

    the challenges identiﬁed in Section 2.

    SmartFarmNet gateway: This collects, ﬁlters, and collates data streams from virtually
    any IoT

    device. The SmartFarmNet gateway uses the OpenIoT X-GSN component [31] for data
    ingestion.

    The component communicates with sensors using wrappers. A wrapper is an interface
    that allows

    the gateway to pull/push data from/to the underlying IoT device. The SmartFarmNet
    platform

    currently has inbuilt support for data ingestion from more than thirty IoT device
    platforms,

    including Arduino, Netatmo, Libelium WaspMotes, Remote, IP-Cameras (to name a
    few). It also

    provides support for virtual sensors such as CSV ﬁles. The data from the IoT devices
    are

    annotated on-the-ﬂy with metadata describing the IoT device and the data is encoded
    using

    the SmartFarmNet ontology described in Section 4.2. In Section 5, we will introduce
    the sensor

    schema editor that is used to describe all employed sensors via a graphical user
    interface. This

    graphical interface hides the complexities of dealing with ontologies from the
    user, and also

    provides support for the uploading of historical data. The gateway can be deployed
    across

    multiple sensor sites/locations, and data could potentially be aggregated at an
    intermediate

    location (via SmartFarmNet gateways) or in the cloud. The annotated data from
    the IoT devices

    are represented using the resource description framework (RDF) and stored in the
    cloud store.

    A sample RDF stream computed from the description of a sensor is presented in
    the listing below.

    This listing involves a Canopy Temperature sensor deployed in plot 4001, which
    is part of the

    study kirkegaard-and-danish.

    Cloud Store: This enables the storage and management of data streams generated
    by the

    SmartFarmNet gateway. The cloud store uses the linked sensor middleware-light
    (LSM-Light)

    component of OpenIoT [31]. The cloud infrastructure stores all of the relevant
    sensor annotations

    (descriptions and metadata), the ontology, functional data related to user accounts,
    and

    permissions to enforce privacy and security. SmartFarmNet uses a semantic data
    store (a No-SQL

    graph database) to store the sensor data in RDF format. It internally implements
    publish/subscribe

    queues to handle large streams of sensor data stemming from virtual and physical
    sensors. The

    components provide APIs to perform the basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD)
    operations

    over the sensor data, and is responsible for transforming the data generated by
    the IoT devices

    into RDF triples using the SmartFarmNet ontologies.

    •

    Sensor Explorer:

    This responsible for sensor discovery function, a novel feature of the

    SmartFarmNet platform. The detection feature uses ontology matching, allowing
    data collected

    to be re-used/re-purposed (i.e., re-purpose data gathered from one study for another
    study).

    For example, using the SmartFarmNet ontology, a semantic reasoner can discover
    data sources

    (IoT devices) that measure canopy temperature data deployed in plots that have
    had a speciﬁc

    nitrogen fertilizer treatment applied (study property). The discovery process
    provides much more

    features than a simple ﬁltering operation by using semantic matching and reasoning
    methods.

    The sensor explorer uses the Scheduler and Service Delivery and Utility Manager
    of OpenIoT [31]

    for sensor and data discovery.

    5. SmartFarmNet Platform Implementation

    As mentioned before, the SmartFarmNet platform is built on the widely used open
    source platform

    for Internet of Things, namely OpenIoT [31], available for free download [31].
    Table 2 presents the

    implementation details of the platform. The entire platform is deployed in a JBOSS
    [32] application

    container, while the support for real-time scalable data analytics is built independently
    using Redis,

    an in-memory data store.

    5.1. Do-It-Yourself User Interfaces

    5.1.1. Sensor Schema Editor

    SmartFarmNet is designed with the Bring-Your-Own sensor principle and supports
    virtually any

    IoT provided by any vendor. The Sensor Schema Editor (SSE) enables users to describe
    and register

    a sensor with ease and consistency. This process hides the complexities of editing
    OWL ﬁles (used

    to represent ontologies) from the users. The Sensor Schema Editor provides annotations
    to sensors

    and sensor-related data, using the underlying ontology and Linked Data principles.
    The interface

    automates the generation of RDF descriptions for sensor node information submitted
    by the users.

    Internally, the editor performs dynamic extension of the ontology by making the
    newly-added concepts

    readily available via the user interface. Figure 6 presents a screenshot of the
    sensor schema editor used

    to deﬁne a sensor.

    5.1.2. Sensor Data Visualisation

    The SmartFarmNet platform user interface (UI) allows end-users to explore and
    analyse

    agricultural study data with zero-programming efforts. The UI hides the complexities
    of semantics

    and ontological representations from the user by presenting concepts that the
    user is familiar with and

    understands (e.g., plots, studies, sensor device, barcode, etc.), as deﬁned in
    the data model and the

    ontology. The UI is depicted in Figure 7, and has the following features:

    1.

    Resource Discovery: The user interface allows a user to search for sensors based
    on domain-based

    criteria, including genotype, crop treatment, and the barcodes used to identify
    studies, as well

    as sensor-based criteria, such as speciﬁc platform or location dynamically obtained
    from the

    ontology (discovery based on location and genotype i.e. Revenue is presented in
    the left side of

    Figure 7).

    2.

    Query Composition: The provide search interface presents a list of sensors matching
    the discovery

    criteria provided by a user (depicted in the bottom part of Figure 7). The user
    can then compose a

    query targeted to the selected sensors. Internally, this makes a request to the
    Sensor Explorer and

    the real-time statistical analysis components.

    3.

    Service Visualisation: This visualizes the fetched data using a one of the provided
    visualisation

    outputs, such as the time-series graph illustrated in the top part of Figure 7.

    Figure 7. Sensor data discovery and exploration.

    6. SmartFarmNet Evaluation

    An essential design requirement of the SmartFarmNet platform is to be able to
    scale, store, process,

    and several hundreds and thousands of IoT sensors. The volume of data generated
    by the IoT sensor

    is not an issue. However, the velocity at which the data is produced is very high
    and results in

    billions of sensor data points. The objective of this evaluation is to evaluate
    the scalability of the

    SmartFarmNet platform. In particular, we evaluate the proposed real-time statistical
    analysis feature

    of the SmartFarmNet platform used to deliver sub-second query response latency
    while handling

    high-velocity data streams.

    For evaluating the scalability of the platform, we used real data collected from
    a Phenonet

    ﬁeld study called "Kirkegaard and Danish". This study evaluates the effect of
    sheep grazing on crop

    re-growth by looking at root activity, water use, crop growth rate, and crop yield.
    We used soil moisture

    sensors deployed at multiple depths (e.g., from 10 cm to 2 m) below the soil surface.
    These sensors

    provide a high-dimensional view of the extraction of water from the soil by the
    roots throughout the

    crop growing season. This information is then used to obtain an indirect measurement
    of root activity,

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1884

    13 of 17

    which in turn can be used to control crop growth to increase yield and reduce
    fertiliser and water

    usage. The data for the studies was collected in real-time from 50 soil-moisture
    sensors, resulting in

    50 streams of around 10,000 data points each.

    SmartFarmNet platform uses SPARQL—a semantic query language similar to SQL —to
    query the

    sensor data. A sample (partial) SPARQL query is presented below. This query retrieves
    all data from

    sensors that measure soil moisture deﬁned as <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/ssnxlcf/cfproperty#soil_suction_

    aCsaturation>. The FILTER statement of SPARQL is used to restrict the results
    from those sensors that

    are in the plot covered by the Kirkegaard and Danish study. The SPARQL query is
    an example of

    how semantic web concepts used effectively to query not only over the data (soil
    moisture sensor),

    but also the domain knowledge (studies, plots, etc.). The server used to evaluate
    the performance

    of our platform is an Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) infrastructure [34]
    with the following

    hardware conﬁguration: 8GB RAM, 2 vCPU (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2676 v3 @ 2.40GHz).

    }

    6.1. Query Access Performance Latency

    The query access performance latency is a good indicator of the system’s ability
    to support

    a high-velocity data stream while delivering sub-second query response. This is
    achieved by the

    real-time statistical analysis feature that uses the micro summarisation approach
    (presented in

    Section 4.3 ). First, we establish a baseline performance of the platform without
    using the real-time

    statistical analysis feature. We then compare the outcome of the benchmark against
    evaluations

    conducted using the real-time statistical analysis feature. The real-time statistical
    analysis feature

    allows the platform to respond to user queries by looking for pre-computed statistical
    data from the

    various smart summarisation data stores (cache, static, and moving). Depending
    on the frequency

    of the query, the platform makes a decision to move micro summaries from one storage
    to another.

    This feature is currently implemented via a conﬁguration ﬁle. However, in the
    future, we aim to extend

    the platform with a smart caching approach that can make autonomous decisions
    based on query

    patterns. In this evaluation, we used two settings; namely: 1 sensor (contributing
    500,000 data points

    that are combined in a single stream) and 50 parallel sensor streams (each constituting
    a stream of

    10,000 data points). This evaluation setting will impact the performance of the
    system, as different

    data stores are maintained per stream. The IoT devices (sensors) in this evaluation
    produce data every

    5 min. The user query aims to retrieve average soil moisture over a speciﬁc time
    window. The window

    was varied from 1-min to 1-month to observe the response time and validate the
    performance of the

    smart summarisation approach. The outcome of the evaluations is presented in Figures
    8–10.

    Figure 8. Query access latency—single sensor stream.

    Figure 9. Query access latency—multiple sensor stream.

    Figure 10. Query access latency with real-time statistical analysis—multiple sensor
    stream.

    Figures 8 and 9 provide the query response time for the SmartFarmNet platform
    without the

    real-time analysis feature. It is evidentthat the query response time is linear
    and increases as the

    number of sensor data points/data streams increases. Each query operation involved
    fetching a large

    section of data across 50 data streams using semantic matching, i.e., searching
    the semantic cloud

    data store (LSM-Light) for a sensor that produces soil moisture data as opposed
    to a string search

    (e.g., SQL like a keyword). Figure 10 presents the query response time to retrieve
    the sensor data with

    the real-time statistical analysis feature. As can be noticed, the performance
    of SmartFarmNet with

    the real-time analysis is two-fold better than without real-time analytics. By
    taking advantage of the

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1884

    15 of 17

    pre-compute stream summaries that are updated when a new data point arrives or
    when the time

    window changes, SmartFarmNet is capable of providing near real-time query response.
    For complex

    queries (such as data from multiple days), different micro summaries, such as
    hourly, daily, weekly,

    and monthly are used for quick computation. For example, to compute the average
    for the last four

    hours and thirty minutes, the hourly average for 4-h along with the raw data obtained
    for the last

    30-min is used. The results show that the increasing velocity of sensor data streams
    has little or no

    impact on the performance of the system. This is a key feature of the SmartFarmNet
    system, making it

    more scalable than current IoT platforms. This evaluation also demonstrates the
    suitability of semantic

    web technologies for storing, analysing, and visualising internet-scale IoT data.

    6.2. Evaluation of Micro Summary Computation

    SmartFarmNet’s real-time analysis feature depends on maintaining an updated micro
    summary

    for incoming sensor data streams. In order to estimate the performance of this
    process, we calculated

    the computation time to manage and sustain the data structure that keeps track
    of stream summaries

    for the 500,000 sensor data points (from 50 sensors) used in the evaluation. The
    computational process

    to maintain the data structure is complex, as it requires updating of the stream
    summaries across two

    dimensions (namely, each time-window and each stream) continuously. In this evaluation,
    we aim

    to establish the maximum time required for summary computation using existing
    data. Hence, in

    this evaluation, we assess the SmartFarmNet platform on the task of generating
    all summaries for

    the 500,000 data points from 50 sensor streams. Particularly in this assessment,
    we calculate the

    total time required to compute summaries for different window sizes. We used the
    same hardware

    conﬁguration and sensor sensing frequency as in the previous evaluation. Table
    3 presents the

    outcome of this assessment. As indicated by the results, the maximum time to compute
    the summary

    is 25 s (for computing monthly summaries). However, in reality, the summaries
    are calculated

    incrementally (i.e., as new data is available in the platform, the summaries are
    updated). This result

    indicates the maximum time it could take to recompute the summary in case of system
    failure. As

    presented in Section 5.1.1, the raw data from each sensor stream is always persisted
    to storage, hence

    reducing the chance of data loss.

    7. Lessons Learnt

    To a great extent, the platform design addressed the unique challenges in building
    commercial

    scale IoT systems, identiﬁed in Section 3. Below is a summary of our experience
    and lessons learnt

    from building a system for smart farming.

    Support for virtually any IoT device:

    The key challenge that we faced in developing the

    SmartFarmNet platform was managing the plethora of Internet of Things devices,
    ranging from

    wireless sensor networks to mobile smart phones to cameras, etc. Our solution
    was to focus on

    developing common interfaces (API) and consistent representation of sensors and
    their data using

    semantic web technologies and thus moving away from the traditional packaged hardware/software

    solutions. By using a consistent way of representing data and providing different
    means to ingest

    data into the system (from API to wrappers built in Java, Python, R, etc.), we
    were able to interoperate

    between IoT hardware silos.

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1884

    16 of 17

    Provide rapid analysis of data in real-time: One fundamental challenge that underpinned
    most IoT

    platforms was in their ability to perform fast analysis of data over a large number
    of sensor data

    streams. By employing real-time statistical data analysis, the SmartFarmNet platform
    was able to

    achieve this objective. The platform incorporates a scalable methodology, delivering
    near real-time

    query response time as compared to traditional SQL-based systems [4].

    Integration with Semantic Web: By using the semantic web technologies such as
    ontologies and

    linked open data, we were able to 1) use currently available semantic web standards,
    allowing the

    system to exchange data with other IoT services in the internet; and 2) enforce
    standards in IoT

    application development that is currently not prevalent in most existing solutions.
    Using the semantic

    web technologies also enabled the platform to be easily extended to new domains,
    such as aquaculture,

    cotton growing, etc. In certain cases, SmartFarmNet was also used as a diagnostic
    tool to understand

    the performance of the underlying sensor network and detect failures using a pre-computed
    error

    estimate for each sensor.

    Do-it-yourself approach for visualisation and analysis of data:

    The design objective of

    SmartFarmNet was to empower its users by providing standard tools combined with
    a ﬂexible

    and powerful API. By employing a do-it-yourself approach, SmartFarmNet has reached
    a wider set of

    users and enabled them to collect crop performance data with any sensor(s). The
    ability for a farmer to

    explore and analyse crop growth data using simple selection based on familiar
    concepts such as crop

    phenotype, treatment, etc., was very useful in breaking many barriers to the SmartFarmNet
    uptake.

    8. Conclusions

    In this paper, we presented SmartFarmNet, a pioneering effort in building a scalable
    sensor

    data acquisition, analysis, and visualisation platform for smart farming applications,
    based on the

    Internet of Things. We presented the architectural design of the platform that
    aims to support virtually

    any IoT devices, allow rapid ingestion and visualisation of IoT data using zero-programming
    effort

    (do-it-yourself principles), and provide a virtual laboratory environment for
    visualisation and sharing

    of study data. The proposed SmartFarmNet uses a unique and novel real-time statistical
    analysis

    approach that enables near real-time responses to user queries (validating the
    platform’s ability to

    scale in order to handle high-velocity data streams). Through evaluation using
    actual farming data,

    we validated the elasticity and scalability of the platform.

    and continuous monitoring of lakes and inland seas is available since 1993 thanks
    to the satellite altimetry missions (Topex–Poseidon, GFO, ERS-2, Jason-1, Jason-2
    and Envisat). Global data processing of these satellites provides temporal and
    spatial time series of lakes surface height with a decimetre precision on the
    whole Earth. The response of water level to regional hydrology is particularly
    marked for lakes and inland seas in semi-arid regions. A lake data centre is under
    development at by LEGOS (Laboratoire d’Etude en Géophysique et Océanographie Spatiale)
    in Toulouse, in coordination with the HYDROLARE project (Headed by SHI: State
    Hydrological Institute of the Russian Academy of Science). It already provides
    level variations for about 150 lakes and reservoirs, freely available on the web
    site (HYDROWEB: http://www.LEGOS.obs-mip.fr/soa/hydrologie/HYDROWEB), and surface-volume
    variations of about 50 big lakes are also calculated through a combination of
    various satellite images (Modis, Asar, Landsat, Cbers) and radar altimetry. The
    final objective is to achieve in 2011 a fully operating data centre based on remote
    sensing technique and controlled by the in situ infrastructure for the Global
    Terrestrial Network for Lakes (GTN-L) under the supervision of WMO (World Meteorological
    Organization) and GCOS (Global Climate Observing System). Previous article in

    climate variable 1. Introduction The knowledge of the lake water storage variations
    in time over a long period is fundamental for understanding the impact of climate
    change and human activities on the terrestrial water resources. Variations in
    air temperature and precipitation have impact on the water balance of a lake,
    and in an extreme case a lake can entirely disappear. There are two main types
    of lakes: open lakes with outflow draining rivers, and in opposite, closed lakes
    with no outflow. In any cases they are very sensitive to climate change. In some
    regions highly ephemeral lakes provide information on the events like severe drought
    or inundation. Closed basin lakes are sensitive to changes in regional water balance.
    Therefore a Near Real Time (NRT1) monitoring of this type of lakes is essential
    in the frame of such extreme events. For small lakes of this class, the sensitivity
    to a small change in inputs is proportionally higher, principally in terms of
    their level variations. In a given region covered with several lakes, if the records
    of their level variations are long enough, they could reveal recurrence of trends
    in a very reliable and accurate manner. In this way lakes can be considered as
    an excellent proxy for climate change. For example the Andean chain in South America
    is covered with hundreds of lakes. They are located in region, which is under
    the influence of several climatic forcing: Southern Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific
    Decadal Oscillation, El Nino, Glacier melting, etc. (Garreaud and Battisti, 1999,
    Garreaud and Aceituno, 2001, Zola and Bengtsson, 2006). From North to South, over
    a distance of more than 4000 km, lakes are distributed in the Semi Arid plateau
    region (Peru-Bolivia) which receives extremely small rainfall and suffers from
    intensive evaporation, and in the boreal region (Patagonia) where inter-annual
    fluctuations of precipitation are high, and water release from glacier thawing
    has increased last century. Studying of these lakes in a continental framework
    would be therefore very useful for a better understanding of climate change impact
    on surface water resources, in particular for the big Andean cities fed in summer
    by the melt of water outpouring from the glaciers stocking the winter snowfalls
    and rainfalls. As illustration, for South America, the IPCC (International Panel
    for Climate Change) scenarios predict an increase of temperature going from 1
    to 6 °C, and an increase of precipitation anomalies by about 20% before the end
    of the XXIth century (Bates et al., 2008). But the geographical distribution of
    these anomalies is not homogeneous: Most GCM (Global Climate Model) projections
    indicate larger (positive or negative) rainfall anomalies for the tropical region,
    and smaller for the extra-tropical part of South America. This will have an impact
    on the runoff of the rivers that feed the South American lakes. Another region
    with dense lakes coverage is the East African rift. Understanding of the climate
    variability in Africa, and therefore the tropical variability is one of the key
    goals for the climate research. Also African lakes themselves modify greatly local
    climate (Nicholson and Yin, 2002). Level records analysis of the Great East African
    Lakes such as Victoria, Tanganyika, and Nyassa-Malawi, and the regional climatic
    variability show synchronicity, which can be explained by a large-scale linkage
    (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1996). Several studies have investigated the effect of
    ENSO (Mistry and Conway, 2003) but also of the Indian Ocean Dipole (Richard, 1994),
    which is partly responsible for driving climate variability over eastern Africa
    (Marchant et al., 2007). Global warming impact on lakes has ecological consequences
    that are not precisely predictable. For example, warming of the lake Tanganyka
    has lead to a reduction in photosynthesis productivity, following by drastic decrease
    in fish population with obvious societal consequences. In another region, the
    general reduction of water level of the Great Lakes of North America has several
    societal and environmental consequences: pollution on the rise in coastal areas,
    damage in transportation system, tourism, recreational, fishery and hydroelectricity
    industries. Finally, large open lakes can themselves affect local climate through
    evaporation and albedo effects. Hence it is essential to build up global database
    on lakes and reservoirs worldwide providing information about level, surface and
    volume variations, ice cover duration and ice cover thickness, as well as surface
    water temperature variations. The availability of these datasets in NRT mode would
    also be beneficial worldwide, as it would increase the quantity and quality of
    information on water management, regional network enhancement, model assimilation,
    climate change’s impact on the lake system and surrounding human activities, etc.
    Yet, the existing gauge networks on a regional and a global scale are declining
    and observations are often nonexistent, particularly in developing countries.
    Long term change and inter-annual variability of water storage are also often
    lacking. When existing, data are neither harmonised nor expressed in the same
    reference frame. Remote sensing hence could offer an opportunity to improve this
    situation. The main purpose of this article is to present the potentiality of
    remote sensing techniques, to fulfil the requirement of the lake data centre development
    in addition to the compilation of the in situ historical and current data. For
    this an initiative was taken in 2009 to setup such a data centre under the GCOS
    auspices with two main component, one, the HYDROLARE centre hosted by SHI, and
    two, a web portal under construction, SOLS (Service d’Observation des Lacs par
    Satellite: French acronym) hosted by LEGOS. Section 2 presents the different techniques
    that allow producing the ECVs (Essential Climate Variables) for lakes. Section
    3 discusses the international institutional context and the SOLS component of
    the HYDROLARE data centre. Section 4 shows the prototype of the future web portal
    of SOLS. Conclusions are given in Section 5. 2. Remote sensing techniques and
    lakes survey 2.1. Satellite imagery as a tool for lakes surface monitoring Satellite
    imagery is basically used to classify the Earth surface for several purposes:
    land use, ecology, sustainable development, agriculture, water management, farming
    development, urbanisation, fire monitoring, etc. Observations of the solar reflected
    energy at different frequencies, usually from visible to IR, allow discrimination
    between different types of land use. Several satellites carry instruments providing
    data that can be thus classified, with various spatial resolutions: usually from
    very high resolution of few decimetres for military applications, to kilometre
    resolution for global monitoring of the Earth. Recent scientific literature is
    full of articles describing methodologies using remote sensing (optical and radar)
    for water extent monitoring, mainly with purpose of studying floodplains and wetlands
    (Töyrä et al., 2001, Töyrä and Pietroniro, 2005, Frappart et al., 2005a, Frappart
    et al., 2005b, Henry et al., 2003, Peng et al., 2005, Sakamoto et al., 2007).
    Recently NASA has put on the Internet a complete set of high resolution landsat
    imagery covering the Earth over the last 20 years: http://edcsns17.cr.usgs.gov/EarthExplorer.
    The MODIS full database is also freely available on the web portal of NASA with
    regular up-to-date releases: http://edcimswww.cd.usgs.gov/pub/imswelcome/. The
    Brasilian space Agency (INPE) has done the same for South America with images
    from Landsat and CBERS-2 satellites, with spatial resolution of few metres: http://www.inpe.br/ingles/index.php.
    As for the European Space Agency it provides access to a database of the ASAR
    imagery from Envisat satellite: http://www.eopi.esa.int/esa/esa. In the range
    of decametres to hectometres these data can be successfully used to detect water
    presence on the Earth, and if series of imagery over a specific lake are collected
    over a long period of time one can estimate the water surface at different level
    of those lakes, from low to high level stages. We hence use the different sources
    of satellite imagery to calculate surface variations of the GTN-L lakes. It is
    worth noting that once pairs of both level and surface are available for a given
    lake ranging from the driest to wettest situations, rating curves can be established,
    and in case one of the two parameters is missing, it can be deduced from the rating
    curve in order to fill the gap in the series. All of these sources of data made
    available recently by space agencies will therefore allow us to reach one of the
    ECVs requested by GCOS, which are the lakes surface variations in time. 2.2. Lakes
    water height inferred from radar altimetry Despite some limitations, altimetry
    is a technique that has a proven potential for hydrology science since the data
    are freely available worldwide, and it is the only source of information for most
    lakes in remote areas. Water level measurement by satellite altimetry has been
    developed and optimised for open oceans. Several satellite altimetry missions
    were launched since the late 1980s: GEOSAT (1986–1988), ERS-1 (1991–1996), Topex/Poseidon
    (1992–2005), ERS-2 (1995–), GFO (2000–2008), Jason-1 (2001–) Jason-2 (2008–) and
    ENVISAT (2002–). ERS-1, ERS-2 and ENVISAT have a 35-day temporal resolution (duration
    of the orbital cycle) and 70 km inter-track spacing at the equator. Topex/Poseidon,
    Jason-1 and Jason-2 have a 10-day orbital cycle and 350 km equatorial inter-track
    spacing. GEOSAT and GFO have a 17-day orbital cycle and 170 km equatorial inter-track
    spacing. The combined global altimetry data set has more than two-decade-long
    history and is expected to be continuously updated in the coming decade with missions
    such as Altika, Jason-3, Cryosat-11, Sentinel-3 and SWOT. The technique is now
    applied to obtain water levels of inland seas, lakes, rivers, floodplains and
    wetlands (Aladin et al., 2005, Crétaux et al., 2005). Owing to the efforts of
    the scientific community, altimetry for continental water bodies has grown up
    and acquired a relative autonomy with respect to the altimetry for oceanography.
    Indeed, altimetry for continental water bodies has specific requirements, different
    from those for the oceanic domains. These differences include range estimates
    by algorithms tuned for echoes different from the ocean paradigm (Frappart et
    al., 2006), altitude-dependent dry tropospheric corrections wet tropospheric corrections
    from global meteorological models to replace the radiometer deficiency in the
    land environment (Cretaux et al., 2009), and use of high frequency (10 Hz, 18
    Hz or 20 Hz depending on the mission) sample values and coordinates instead of
    1 Hz averages. Over the past 5 years the LEGOS has developed a web database (HYDROWEB:
    http://www.LEGOS.obs-mip.fr/soa/hydrologie/HYDROWEB) containing time series over
    water levels of large rivers, lakes and wetlands on a global scale.2 Due to technical
    problems on the satellite, GEOSAT data are not suitable to estimate water height
    over continental water, and for ERS-1 and 2, the GDRs (Geophysical Data Records)
    provided by ESA are limited to ocean surface. Moreover the performances of Jason-1
    and GFO satellites over narrow inland water are also poor, which has limited the
    use of these satellites to only big lakes where it has provided accurate lake
    height variations (see Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b). Therefore the lake levels are based
    on the merged Topex/Poseidon, Jason-1 and 2, ENVISAT and GFO data. Almost 150
    lakes and reservoirs monthly level variations deduced from multi-satellite altimetry
    measurements are freely provided. (Fig. 1a, Fig. 1b). Potentially the number of
    lakes monitored could be significantly increased. Download : Download high-res

    Operating at dual frequencies 13.6 GHz (Ku Band: Jason T/P) and 5.3 GHz (C Band)
    or 13.6 GHz and 3.2 GHz (S Band: Envisat), each altimeter emits a series of microwave
    pulses towards the nadir direction that are examined in the time domain. By noting
    the two-way time delay between pulse emission and echo reception, the surface
    height is determined by the difference of the satellite orbit and the altimeter
    range measurement. Depending on the size of the lake, it is necessary to correct
    for the slope of the geoid (or equivalently, the mean lake level) which is represented
    by a mean lake surface. The EGM2008 geoid is used as a priori but does not fit
    correctly short wavelength variations over a lake surface hence must be corrected.
    It is done by averaging the altimetry derived height levels from the whole cycles
    along each track. The water levels are further referred to this ‘mean lake level’.
    If different satellites cover the same lake, the lake level is computed in a 3-step
    process. Each satellite data are processed independently. Potential radar instrument
    biases between different satellites and geoid differences are removed using Topex/Poseidon
    data as reference. Then lake levels from the different satellites are merged on
    a monthly basis. We generally observe an increased precision of lake levels when
    multi-satellite processing is applied. Hydrology is a growing field of application
    for satellite altimetry. However, very few studies have been dedicated up to now
    for checking the quality of the altimetry data over the continental waters. A
    lake database will be a unique opportunity for Calibration/Validation activities
    over the continental waters. Comparisons of altimetry results with gauge data
    for the Great Lakes, for example, are accurate to ∼3–5 cm rms (Shum et al., 2003,
    Crétaux et al., in press, Fig. 2c, Fig. 2d) For the Lake Victoria, comparison
    between Jason-1 inferred water level variations and in situ Gauges records, from
    September 2004 to March 2006 has given an RMS of differences of 2.6 cm and a correlation
    of both time series of 0.99 (Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b). For such a big lake, the altimetry
    clearly provides very accurate level data in a continuous manner (Fig. 2a, Fig.
    2b, Fig. 2c, Fig. 2d, Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (86KB) Download

    Erie) the accuracy is better than 10 cm, the intermediate (Kariba, Mar de Chiquita,
    and Titicaca) the accuracy is at the decimetre level, while for some small water
    bodies, as Lake Powel it is closer to 1 m, particularly due to the fact that this
    lake is long but very thin. The Lake Issykkul, which is intermediate lake in size,
    presents surprisingly very accurate results. Lake name Country Size of the lake

    accurate for smaller lakes the derived level variations are generally an order
    of magnitude higher than the total error budget (Crétaux and Birkett, 2006). An
    ongoing research is examining the trade off between minimum target size observable
    and acceptable height accuracy for the various hydrological applications. 2.3.
    Lake ice monitoring from remote sensing data Many boreal continental water bodies
    such as lakes or enclosed seas have seasonal ice cover. Ice dramatically affects
    the energy exchange between water and atmosphere, as well as various hydro physical
    and hydro biological processes (Kozhova and Izmest’eva, 1998). The presence of
    ice and its transparency affects the bloom of diatoms and primary productivity
    (Mackay et al., 2003). In spring, as soon as enough light can penetrate the ice,
    development of phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthos starts under the ice cover.
    Parameters such as timing of ice formation and break-up, ice cover extent and
    thickness, are good indicators of regional and large-scale climate changes and
    are widely used for various climatic studies, relating ice conditions with global
    climatic variability (Livingstone, 1999). Ice dynamics influences transport and
    navigation, fisheries and other industrial activities. Temporal and spatial variability
    of ice processes in seas and lakes is influenced not only by meteorological conditions
    (mainly by thermal regime), but also by wind and currents, bottom morphology and
    other factors (Wüest et al., 2005). Studies and monitoring of ice cover conditions
    are thus providing valuable information for climate research, maritime safety
    and sustainable environmental management (Mackay et al., 2005). The studies of
    ice and snow cover of continental water bodies can benefit from the synergy of
    more than 15 years-long simultaneous active (radar altimeter) and passive (radiometer)
    observations from radar altimetry satellites complemented by SSM/I passive microwave
    data to improve spatial and temporal coverage. An ice discrimination approach
    based on a combined use of the data from the four altimetry missions and SSM/I
    was developed and validated (Kouraev et al., 2008). Although not included initially
    by GCOS in the ECVs for lakes, the SOLS/HYDROLARE data centre will include lake
    ice parameters for boreal lakes inferred from remote sensing data (radar altimetry
    and SSM/I) but also from in situ measurements when available. Fig. 4 shows the
    product that may be delivered through SOLS/HYDROLARE on this topic. 3. SOLS/HYDROLARE
    data centre 3.1. Institutional context Over the last decade several countries
    joined in an international treaty, UNFCC (United Framework Convention on Climate
    Change) to investigate the issue of the global warming reduction. An Implementation
    Plan has been developed by the GCOS endorsed by UNFCCC, to elaborate appropriate
    policies on climate change. To face these challenges, UNFCCC emphasises the crucial
    need to setup a global system capable of acquiring the earth observations required
    for these different components: terrestrial, atmospheric, oceanic. The Global
    Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) and its various technical panels are in charge
    of the development of the required observing strategy. One of the main goals is
    to provide systematic, continuous, global, harmonised and reliable observations.
    GCOS has emphasised in its successive reports the difficulties encountered with
    respect to these requirements in the terrestrial domain, which remains the least
    well-developed component of the climate observing system. The Terrestrial Observing
    Panel for Climate (TOPC) is a joint panel of GTOS and GCOS. Its main objective
    is to define and assess the availability of the ECVs in order to improve the knowledge
    of the terrestrial component of the climate system, the causes and impact of its
    changes. The GCOS implementation plan identified 13 terrestrial ECVs including
    lake levels (T04) for which it has proposed actions towards the development and
    operation of an international lake and reservoirs data centre. Lake levels are
    currently measured by numerous organisations worldwide. Despite the clear and
    long established requirement for such a centre, it does not exist yet and, at
    present, only two global databases exist for lakes (from International Lake Environment
    Committee: ILEC) and reservoirs (from International Commission Of Large Dams:
    ICOLD) that maintain a database with a limited set of information (lake name,
    morphometry, average level depth and surface, etc.). Nothing about water level
    dynamic and storage is provided. 3.2. SOLS/HYDROLARE data centre However in 2008
    The WMO has signed an agreement with the SHI to establish the International Data
    Centre on Hydrology of Lakes and Reservoirs (HYDROLARE), hosted by the SHI, in
    support of the GCOS implementation plan. The objective of the Centre is to establish,
    develop and regularly update an international database on hydrological regime
    of lakes and reservoirs. One main requirement of GTOS is to develop “basic processing
    and presentation tools for lakes and reservoirs data for distribution to stakeholders”,
    to conduct “analysis and assessment of spatial and temporal tendencies of hydrological
    elements of lakes and reservoirs” and also to “establish agreed methodologies
    and standards” (Biennal report 2008 of the GTOS3). The objective is to bring together
    observations (mostly lacking for lakes and reservoirs), prediction, and decision-support
    systems and establish links to climate and other types of data. A list of products
    for the T04 ECVs is proposed for large open lakes, highly ephemeral lakes and
    closed basin lakes in the frame of the GCOS implementation plan: Products T1.1:
    maps of the lakes on the GTN-L: Grids of georef maps of 250 m spatial resolution
    on monthly basis for about 100 lakes with a requested accuracy of 5%. Products
    T1.2: level of all the lakes on the GTN-L list: The requested accuracy is 10 cm
    on a weekly/monthly basis, in the form of time series based on satellite radar
    altimetry and in situ gauges. Products T1.3: surface temperature of all the lakes
    on the GTN-L list: Daily temperature with accuracy of 0.2° and a stability of
    0.1° with 1 km spatial resolution. The HYDROLARE data centre seeks to provide
    the product T1.2 and T1.3 from an in situ database for lakes having permanent
    stations in terms of historical observation, and current records regularly updated.
    Last year CNES developed a prototype for a data centre for lakes and reservoirs
    exclusively based on Remote sensing data: satellite radar altimetry and satellite
    imagery: SOLS. CNES is involved in the Committee on Earth Observing Satellite
    (CEOS) in charge of the international civil space missions’ coordination in Earth
    observation. As body representing users, GCOS meets CEOS to ensure “continuity
    of satellite measurements, systematic data generation, safeguarding of the records,
    data access and international coordination addressing future measurements needs”
    (Biennal report 2008 of the GTOS). Under this framework, one of the CNES contributions
    (under the responsibility of the LEGOS) will be the participation in HYDROLARE
    in cooperation with SHI. This will be done through the extension of the HYDROWEB
    database to the GTN-L lakes and by adding information from the satellite imagery
    to determine surface variations in time for each of the selected lakes. Satellite
    radar altimetry provides level variations in time for a given lake. Satellite
    images collected at different dates from low to high water stage will allow determining
    a surface variation of each lake in the database (see Section 4.1). It is also
    planned to apply the methodology developed by LEGOS for large seasonally-frozen
    lakes and enclosed seas and to derive from this approach time series of specific
    dates of ice events (the first appearance of ice, the formation of stable ice
    cover, the first appearance of open water and the complete disappearance of ice)
    for each water body or its sub-region. Currently, HYDROWEB is updated every year
    for lake products (water level variations). The SOLS project will manage two complementary
    data sets: • A reliable, long-term series based on the GDR data (Geophysical Data
    Record), computed using the best quality orbit, but available only 5–6 weeks after
    data acquisition) currently used by HYDROWEB. • An intermediate-quality but rapidly
    available time-series based on the IGDR dataset (the interim GDR, based on the
    preliminary computation); typically, data can be delivered in ca. 3 days after
    acquisition. This two-mode database can then be used to tackle both the long-term
    trend analysis and the NRT applications that require a high reactivity of the
    decision makers. Furthermore, the automation of data collection and time-series
    calculation procedures make the interactive download of the products possible.
    As for HYDROWEB, the SOLS/HYDROLARE data policy along with the ancillary data
    (e.g. lake images from remote-sensing images) bundled with the on-line data will
    be made available. Open – free of charge access to ECVs for the GTN-L lakes will
    be given on the SOLS/HYDROLARE. Based on this principle, lake level and surface
    variations have already been calculated for almost 20 lakes and reservoirs. They
    will constitute the basic input for the prototype of a lake data centre, which
    is described in this manuscript. In the following pages we describe an overview
    of the future products for two selected lakes (Mar de Chiquita and Baikal) that
    will be delivered through the SOLS project. 4. Examples of the SOLS/HYDROLARE
    ongoing web pages In the following two paragraphs we show what will be the future
    web pages of HYDROLARE data centre for ECVs inferred from the remote sensing data.
    The purpose of this section is not only to demonstrate the capacity of the remote
    sensing techniques to produce suitable information in the field of hydrology,
    but also to introduce the data centre to users. For details on the radar altimetry
    applications on lake monitoring, see Birkett, 1995, Birkett, 2000, Mercier et
    al., 2002, Coe and Birkett, 2005, Crétaux et al., 2005, Crétaux and Birkett, 2006,
    Kouraev et al., 2007, Kouraev et al., 2008, Medina et al., 2008, Swenson and Wahr,
    2009, Becker et al., 2010. 4.1. Mar de Chiquita Mar de Chiquita is the largest
    closed saline lake in South America, located in the central plain of Argentina.
    This lake is a remarkable target to study current and past environmental changes
    in a saline lacustrine basin as its water storage variability is purely natural
    and well documented. It is a shallow lake with maximum depth of 10 m. Given the
    flatness of the surrounding ground, it exhibits a highly variable extent with
    a level range from 5000 km2 for the low level of the dry period to 6500 km2 at
    high stages during the wet season. The daily in situ levels are available and
    can be compared to the remote sensing data, making this lake a possible site for
    continuous – although delayed – check of the altimetry products. The large variations
    of the surface extent can be monitored with multi-spectral medium resolution sensors
    like the Modis/Terra instrument. It can also be compared with an extent determined
    using High Resolution image (Landsat, CBERS: Fig. 3). Finally, a precise hypsometric
    function can be calculated and used to compute continuous variations of the level,
    surface and hence volume for this lake. The web page of the future SOLS/HYDROLARE
    database will include lakes as shown in Fig. 3, three types of variables for each:
    monthly level variations from the in situ gauges and radar altimetry data, the
    hypsometry curves parameters, and monthly surface variations. The re-processed
    images at a different epoch from low to high stage will also be available directly
    from the data centre. Download : Download high-res image (159KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Mar de Chiquita future web page. For some lakes the relation
    dh/dS (hypsometry) is not linear. This explains why the time series of level and
    surface variations have different slopes. 4.2. Lake Baikal There is an example
    of the products to be delivered on the SOLS/HYDROLARE for the lake ice phenology.
    The Lake Baikal, located in Siberia, is completely frozen every year (from late
    December to May) due to continental climate conditions with long and cold winter.
    From the methodology described in Kouraev et al. (2008), three parameters can
    be derived from remote sensing data: time series of ice formation, break-up and
    duration from year to year, starting from 1992 when the T/P satellite was launched.
    Fig. 4 shows the time series of these parameters for the c. This will be extended
    to all lakes in the northern hemisphere that are under similar climatic conditions
    (lakes of Siberia, Aral Sea and Caspian Sea, Ladoga, Onega, and all lakes in Canada).
    We will update the database for these products (plots as in Fig. 4 and ASCII files
    with the corresponding data) every year after winter time. As for many continental
    water bodies, the observations of ice regime for the Lake Baikal started in the
    end of the 19th–to beginning of the 20th century at coastal stations. Later on,
    mainly between 1940s and 1970s, field trips and aerial surveys made it possible
    to significantly extend the research from a point of observation to lake wide
    spatial scale. On the SOLS/HYROLARE, both the remote sensing data (radar altimetry
    and SSM/I) and these in situ data will be supplied to users as shown on Fig. 4.

    Fig. 4. Time series of historical and satellite-derived observations of (a) ice
    formation (days since 31 December), (b) ice break-up (days since 31 December)
    and (c) fast ice duration (days). Southern Baikal: thick grey line – NSIDC/ LIN
    RAS, data for Listvyanka, thick black line – satellite-derived estimates for region
    near Listvyanka. Northern Baikal: thin black line – NSIDC data for Nizhneangarsk,
    satellite-derived estimates are for the whole Northern Baikal (NB, thick line)
    and for sub-region near Nizhneangarsk (NA, thin line). Note that all vertical
    scales are identical. Straight lines indicate positive and negative tendencies
    discussed in the text – they are not statistically significant and do not represent
    calculated trend lines, but merely serve as a visual aid. The future users of
    SOLS/HYDROLARE will have access to both figures like these one and the associated
    historical and remote sensing data. 5. Conclusion For the next few decades, there
    will be a need to a continuous and automatic survey of lakes worldwide as addressed
    by UNFCCC. In the frame of the GCOS implementation plan, few ECVs were identified,
    among them, the water level and surface variations for a group of 100 lakes located
    throughout all continents. Some of them are already operationally monitored by
    national agencies (Russia, United States or Canada). Others are not equipped with
    the in situ gauges yet, or when they are, for different reasons the data are not
    available. Those two ECVs when they measured allow estimating the water storage
    variation which depends on many factors: climate change forcing and anthropogenic
    stress in the lake basin watershed (through irrigation, dam construction, water
    consumption, etc.) Over the last 10–15 years, new satellites techniques have demonstrated
    their capabilities to fulfil the GCOS requirements. Satellite radar altimetry
    can provide lakes level variations for hundreds of lakes (they just need to be
    under the track of the satellite) with an accuracy ranging from centimetres to
    decimetres depending on their size, and also in a lesser extent on their location
    (mountain lakes for examples are more difficult to track). To be able to calculate
    a lake’s water surface variation, one needs complementary information, which usually
    is quite impossible to derive from ground measurements Lately, national space
    agencies such as NASA, ESA and INPE have setup free public web data bases that
    provide imagery of satellites instruments like Landsat or CBERS optical and IR
    sensors, Terra/MODIS, SRTM or Envisat/ASAR. They all have different spatial and
    temporal resolution, but depending on the size and on the magnitude of water surface
    variability of each target, a large panel of instruments can now provide surface
    variations of hundreds of lakes worldwide. With current progress in information
    technology, the processing power and storage capacities of research laboratories
    are sufficient to cope with data volumes, which were manageable only by large
    data centre 10 years ago. Leveraging this processing power with knowledge sharing
    made possible with an open source software, a pre-operational lake database can
    be created with a modest effort, and act as a proof-of-concept to build up the
    dynamics necessary to create a next-generation international fully operational
    database and making possible the rapid distribution of the key ECVs and metadata
    with the NRT updating, cross calibrated with in situ measurements and dedicated
    field campaigns. An agreement was signed in 2008 between the SHI and WMO to develop
    such a lake data centre, called HYDROLARE, which will collect and distribute in
    situ lake level variations, surface temperatures and metadata. The remote sensing
    techniques that are mature enough to complete the requested information (lake
    level, surface and volume variations, lake ice regime) will be under the responsibility
    of LEGOS, in coordination with SHI. In the last 6 years LEGOS has developed a
    lake and river database, with water level variations for a group of 150 lakes
    and reservoirs fully derived from current satellite altimetry. Algorithms of radar
    and optical satellite imagery processing were developed by LEGOS in order to complete
    this database with information on lake’s surface and volume variations that will
    be added to the database. It will result in an international lake data centre,
    in cooperation between SHI and LEGOS, under the auspices of WMO. Acknowledgements

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    The participation of the general public in the research design, data collection
    and

    interpretation process together with scientists is often referred to as citizen
    science.

    While citizen science itself has existed since the start of scientiﬁc practice,
    developments

    in sensing technology, data processing and visualization, and communication of
    ideas

    and results, are creating a wide range of new opportunities for public participation
    in

    scientiﬁc research. This paper reviews the state of citizen science in a hydrological
    context

    and explores the potential of citizen science to complement more traditional ways
    of

    scientiﬁc data collection and knowledge generation for hydrological sciences and
    water

    resources management. Although hydrological data collection often involves advanced

    technology, the advent of robust, cheap, and low-maintenance sensing equipment

    provides unprecedented opportunities for data collection in a citizen science
    context.

    These data have a signiﬁcant potential to create new hydrological knowledge, especially

    in relation to the characterization of process heterogeneity, remote regions,
    and human

    impacts on the water cycle. However, the nature and quality of data collected
    in citizen

    science experiments is potentially very different from those of traditional monitoring

    networks. This poses challenges in terms of their processing, interpretation,
    and use,

    especially with regard to assimilation of traditional knowledge, the quantiﬁcation
    of

    uncertainties, and their role in decision support. It also requires care in designing
    citizen

    science projects such that the generated data complement optimally other available

    knowledge. Lastly, using 4 case studies from remote mountain regions we reﬂect
    on the

    challenges and opportunities in the integration of hydrologically-oriented citizen
    science

    in water resources management, the role of scientiﬁc knowledge in the decision-making

    process, and the potential contestation to established community institutions
    posed by

    co-generation of new knowledge.

    Keywords: citizen science, hydrological sensing, co-generation of knowledge, water
    resources management,

    poly-centric governance

    1. INTRODUCTION

    Citizen science refers to the participation of the general pub-

    lic (i.e., non-scientists) in the generation of new scientiﬁc

    knowledge. A large variety of approaches exist, ranging from

    community-based data collection, to soliciting contributions,

    to carrying out various scientiﬁc tasks with the help of large

    groups of people through use of the internet (i.e., crowd-sourcing,

    Dickinson et al., 2012).

    New developments in sensing technology (e.g., Hart and

    Martinez, 2006), data processing and analysis, and knowledge

    EARTH SCIENCE

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    communication are opening new pathways for citizen science.

    Inexpensive yet robust sensors now can allow amateurs to collect

    large volumes of data and document them with appropriate meta-

    data such as location and time. Information and communication

    technologies (ICT) facilitate the ﬂow of data and knowledge, both

    for uploading collected data to centralized databases, and for

    querying datasets using rich and tailor-made interfaces. Lastly,

    communication technologies such as cellular networks and the

    internet also can allow for a much more dynamic and interactive

    approach to the formulation of hypotheses, research design, data

    analysis, and knowledge generation.

    The provision of water resources is one of the most fundamen-

    tal ecosystem services for humanity. Hydrological science under-

    pins most decision-making on water resources and is the basis

    for assessing risks related to water such as ﬂoods and droughts.

    But despite its critical societal relevance, this area of science is

    characterized by an acute scarcity of data in both the spatial and

    temporal domains (e.g., Hannah et al., 2011), which contrasts sig-

    niﬁcantly with the heterogeneity and complexity of actual water

    management and governing processes. As such, it is pertinent to

    reﬂect upon the potential role that citizen science could play in

    the generation of new knowledge in relation to the water cycle

    and related ecosystem services, and the use of citizen science in

    decision-making.

    This paper therefore aims to provide a critical review of the

    available literature on citizen science in a context of hydrology,

    water resources, and wider ecosystem services management, and

    to seek and develop a new perspective on the major challenges

    and opportunities that may lie ahead. Section 2 explores the phi-

    losophy and motivations behind the citizen science approach.

    Section 3 reviews existing citizen science applications in hydrol-

    ogy and water resources sciences. This is followed by an overview

    of some of the major challenges and opportunities for citizen

    science for ecosystem services management and sustainable devel-

    opment (Section 4). Lastly, in Section 5, we illustrate the discussed

    concepts by means of four case studies from remote mountain

    regions in Peru, Ethiopia, Nepal, and Kyrgyzstan, with different

    levels of citizen science activities and interests. In these regions,

    environmental pressures on ecosystem services are particularly

    acute and a lack of information on physical processes hinders

    the generation of relevant knowledge for adaptation. As a result,

    there may be a strong potential for citizen science to complement

    classic scientiﬁc knowledge generation and bring beneﬁt to local

    stakeholders.

    2. THE CONCEPT OF CITIZEN SCIENCE

    2.1. DEFINITIONS

    Citizen science is not an entirely new concept, but it is becom-

    ing increasingly popular in natural science research (Silvertown,

    2009). In broader terms, public involvement in science has

    also been referred to as civic science (Irwin, 1995; Kruger and

    Shannon, 2000), community science (Carr, 2004), and more

    recently, public participation in scientiﬁc research (Bonney et al.,

    2009; Shirk et al., 2012). The philosophy is also afﬁliated to

    concepts such as community-based monitoring (Whitelaw et al.,

    2003; Fry, 2011), community-based management (Keough and

    Blahna, 2006), and crowd-sourced data collection (Lowry and

    Fienen, 2013). What separates citizen science from less collabora-

    tive forms of public participation in scientiﬁc research is the ele-

    ment of an “active” engagement (Wiggins and Crowston, 2011, p.

    1); it is an approach whereby non-scientists are actively involved,

    to differing degrees, in the generation of new scientiﬁc knowledge,

    from which they also actively stand to beneﬁt either intrinsically

    (e.g., increased scientiﬁc literacy) or extrinsically (e.g., increased

    social capital).

    Citizen participation in science is a cross-cutting concept that

    has emerged from and across many disciplines. As a method-

    ology, it has been promoted for interdisciplinary research as it

    automatically fosters collective reﬂection (Wechsler, 2014). In

    the social development context, public participation as a strat-

    egy for achieving good governance and human rights has been

    embedded into mainstream discourse for decades (Gaventa and

    Barrett, 2012). Political economists also promote democratiza-

    tion of information to encourage debates and improve policy-

    making (Ostrom, 1990; Macknick and Enders, 2012). Recent

    developments in information science (e.g., remote-sensing, open-

    source software tools, cloud computing) have been central to

    the emergence of citizen science in ecology and biogeography

    (Silvertown, 2009; Dickinson et al., 2012), where citizen science is

    also prominently applied [e.g., Fernandez-Gimenez and Ballard,

    2008; Danielsen et al., 2009; Blossom, 2012; Stevens et al., 2013;

    Open Air Laboratories (OPAL), 2014; Paul et al., 2014]. In hydrol-

    ogy, the adoption has been relatively limited but is rapidly gaining

    momentum (see Section 3).

    2.2. MOTIVATION FOR ENGAGING IN CITIZEN SCIENCE

    Citizen science scholarship highlights the importance of citizen

    science in facilitating a better representation of local experiences

    and priorities. A strong motivation for the citizens i.e., the vol-

    unteers therefore is the scope that citizen science can offer for

    them to be part of the scientiﬁc process, and ultimately have a

    much broader role in decision making as part of a bottom-up,

    participatory process.

    This debate on citizen science is a long standing one, and

    its roots can be traced back to the growing mistrust of citizens

    about positivist science, especially in the aftermath of catastrophic

    failures of risk regulation (Freudenburg, 2003). For example, in

    the 1970s at Love Canal, at Three Mile Island, and at Wolburn,

    Massachusetts (to name a few prominent cases) citizens con-

    ducted their own “science” assessments to better understand the

    risks associated with their own exposure to toxics, in response to

    the discovery of toxic waste presence (Levine, 1982; Brown and

    Mikkelsen, 1990). Through a process that Brown (1992) coined as

    “popular epidemiology,” they exercised their own political power

    in science communication, and used their own scientiﬁc assess-

    ments to challenge expert opinion. An important outcome of this

    was that citizens involved in these assessments were able to assert

    their authority as knowledge brokers and to become more cen-

    trally involved in the planning of decisions that concerned the

    area where they lived and worked. The appropriate technology

    movement and approaches to participatory technology devel-

    opment that became popular in the 1970s also reached similar

    conclusions, highlighting the importance of citizens in the choice,

    design and delivery of technological development.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    Citizen science often emerges at the interface of political

    activism and volunteering. While on the outward they may

    come off as a hobby, motivational aspects are often complex.

    Volunteers’ involvement may be self-initiated as driven by an

    environmental concern, as well as scientiﬁc curiosity and a sense

    of fulﬁllment for being part of ﬁnding answers (Cohn, 2008).

    On the other hand, members of a community whose livelihood

    depends on their local environment (e.g., subsistence farmers in

    developing countries) may also seek scientiﬁc knowledge to form

    a better understanding of their environment, and further use this

    to gain political leverage in their community (Overdevest and

    Orr, 2004).

    Another strong motivational aspect of citizen science, but

    perhaps currently more from the professional scientists’ point

    of view, is about showcasing diversity, such as in terms of the

    ecologies as well as practices that people depend upon to sus-

    tain their livelihoods. In mountainous socio-ecological systems,

    which form the basis of the case study examples represented later

    in this article, the diversity of interactions between social and

    ecological changes vary signiﬁcantly not only across regions but

    also across communities. The case of Kyrgyzstan (Section 5.4)

    shows for example how communities are trying to adapt to,

    as well as comprehend, the change brought about in the after-

    math of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the particular

    economic and social restructuring process that subsequently fol-

    lowed. In the Nepalese context (Section 5.3), we see increas-

    ing interest by the citizens themselves to understand better the

    complexity of their own environments. In the light of this, it

    requires advocating that a stronger citizen involvement in infor-

    mation sharing and collection may ultimately lead to greater

    preparedness against abrupt change, and can potentially pro-

    vide an additional buffer for dealing with those shocks and

    stresses that are likely to be brought about as climate change

    and variability becomes exacerbated. Living with uncertainty

    and change therefore also presents new opportunities for citi-

    zens to become key actors in knowledge co-generation processes,

    actively contributing toward comprehending “fuzzy” science are-

    nas (i.e., climate change and hydrology) that are at present not

    just scientiﬁcally contestable, but at least to some extent unknown

    (Stirling et al., 2007).

    On the other hand, professional scientists and donors are

    also driven by a number of motives. Apart from purely scien-

    tiﬁc interest in the data collected and self-advancement, they

    may also be humanistic-altruistically motivated, for example in

    scientiﬁc outreach and education, promoting conservation, and

    improving societal conditions (Macknick and Enders, 2012).

    However, in spite of any goodwill on the side of the profession-

    als, volunteer motivations are highly dynamic, changing over time

    even if collective project goals remain constant (Rotman et al.,

    2012). Therefore, Rotman et al. (2012) suggests that particu-

    lar attention should be paid to ﬁrst contact between a citizen

    and the professionals, and also in the ﬁnal stage when volun-

    teers decide whether they will contribute to other initiatives.

    Interview studies in USA, Costa Rica and India found that moti-

    vations not only changed with time, but were also inﬂuenced

    by complex cultural and institutional settings. Speciﬁcally, Costa

    Rican projects beneﬁted from a national culture of environmental

    awareness and social responsibility, together with shallow hier-

    archical structures that encouraged regular mentoring and the

    building of trust between scientists and citizens (Rotman et al.,

    2014a). For citizen science projects to achieve sustained volun-

    teer participation, communication pathways between scientists,

    citizen scientists and non-participating community members

    need to be carefully considered. Attention needs to be paid to

    the clarity of training and the delivery of feedback throughout

    the project (Rotman et al., 2014a). If volunteers feel patron-

    ized or perceive that they are undervalued by professionals, the

    projects are likely to suffer from high attrition rates. This is

    likely to be of particular signiﬁcance in cultures where science

    and society are clearly demarcated (e.g., India, Rotman et al.,

    2014b).

    Research into collective intelligence suggests that bringing

    people together from diverse backgrounds promotes innovative

    thinking (Woolley et al., 2010). Furthermore, there is an oppor-

    tunity in the design of citizen science projects by means of

    citizen involvement to affect outcomes (Shirk et al., 2012) e.g.,

    the type of knowledge generated and the beneﬁts to be gained

    from it. Involvement of volunteers from multiple segments of a

    community can result in an improved relationship between dif-

    ferent institutional actors (Ridder and Pahl-Wostl, 2005), and

    this improves the prospects of future joint actions (e.g., con-

    tinued monitoring, planning and implementation of adaptation

    programs). However, the opposite outcome is equally probable—

    conﬂicts may arise from failures in communication or goals (a

    case in point is the Ethiopian case described in Section 5.2).

    Indeed, citizen science questions the classical divide between “sci-

    ence” as the knowledge producing process, and the “users of that

    knowledge,” such as communities who might want to partici-

    pate in “science” for educational purposes or to inform their

    actions/arguments with “true knowledge.” Instead, citizen sci-

    ence suggests a process of co-generation of knowledge, with a

    possible decentering of the central and key role of the scientiﬁc

    process in the knowledge production process. The complexity of

    social-ecological systems, their degree of inherent uncertainty and

    partially unpredictable interactions, may require a more interac-

    tive view on knowledge encounters and joint knowledge produc-

    tion in particular, in view of the creation of a sufﬁciently shared

    knowledge base to motivate adequately coordinated and coher-

    ent social action in poly-centric governance of ecosystem services

    (i.e., an evolving, emergent outcome of interactions between mul-

    tiple sources of governance in state, market or civic realms and

    at different scales of action, Ostrom and Cox, 2010). We begin

    to see traces of this polycentricity and the centrality of knowl-

    edge in ensuring its sustenance when we explore the intricate

    knowledge sharing mechanisms that have begun to form ties

    between upstream and downstream water user communities in

    the Peruvian case (Section 5.1). But inevitably this brings in inter-

    ests and power in terms of whose reality will prevail to support

    actions.

    2.3. LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT

    The broad range of citizen science activities yields different classi-

    ﬁcations or spectrum of models. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology

    initially proposed a continuum of research models, based on

    www.frontiersin.org

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 3

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    the extent of citizen-scientist collaboration across each stage

    of the scientiﬁc process. This included the scientiﬁc consulting

    research model, participatory action model, and representing

    the most inclusive approach, the adaptive citizen science model

    which adopts a central platform for an interactive feedback

    mechanism (Cooper et al., 2007). Bonney et al. (2009) later pro-

    posed three models: contributory, collaborative, and co-created

    projects. Shirk et al. (2012) sub-divides projects even further with

    additional contractual and collegial models at either end of the

    public involvement spectrum. There is a high parallelism to the

    Extreme Citizen Science (ExCiteS) framework, which separates

    them into crowd-sourcing, distributed intelligence, participatory

    science, and extreme citizen science (Seymour and Regalado,

    2014). Such schemes may be drawing inspiration from the debate

    about participation in development, e.g., Pretty’s (1995) typol-

    ogy of participation: with control over the process running from

    full external control to dialogue and full internal control. From

    a monitoring perspective, Danielsen et al. (2009) identiﬁed ﬁve

    types of protocols based on the relative involvement of citizens

    and scientists in design, data collection, interpretation and utiliza-

    tion. Wiggins and Crowston (2011) developed ﬁve (i.e., Action,

    Conservation, Investigation, Virtual and Education) citizen sci-

    ence typologies by focusing more on the organizational and

    macrostructural elements of project design and implementation.

    In all, the different models essentially describe the same contin-

    uum of engagement as well as the beneﬁt obtained by the public

    volunteers from the scientiﬁc research. There is more emphasis

    on building social capital (by training) and local adaptive capac-

    ity at the extreme end of this spectrum where the objective of

    public engagement is to improve transparency and accountabil-

    ity, and to encourage discourse, learning, and collective action

    between multiple stakeholders (da Silva Wells et al., 2013). This is

    complementary to the tendency now to move away from merely

    capitalizing on volunteers as a low-cost workforce but to involve

    them in the intellectual aspects of the science (Lakshminarayanan,

    2007; Conrad and Hilchey, 2010).

    3. CITIZEN SCIENCE IN HYDROLOGY AND WATER

    RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

    Given the advanced technology needed for monitoring many

    aspects of the water cycle, hydrology is not an evident sci-

    entiﬁc discipline for the application of citizen science. But

    the development of more robust, cheaper and lower mainte-

    nance sensing equipment creates new opportunities for data

    collection in a citizen science context. At the same time, the

    importance of water resources for human development, and

    the threats that emerge from environmental change, fresh-

    water contamination, population growth and other stressors

    (Milly et al., 2008; Hipsey and Arheimer, 2014; IPCC, 2014)

    highlight the need for novel approaches to both the gener-

    ation of new knowledge about the water cycle, as well as

    new insights as to how this knowledge can be used in water

    resources management that supports sustainable development.

    The next sections review existing citizen science applications and

    opportunities brought by new technology in hydrology, before

    exploring their relevance for water resources management in

    Section 4.

    3.1. LITERATURE REVIEW

    Table 1 summarizes our review of documented citizen science

    projects in hydrology and water resources. From this list, we draw

    several inferences. Firstly, the scope is rather limited to water

    quality monitoring, possibly due to the relative ease of conduct-

    ing measurements of water quality parameters and therefore also

    coordinating these activities at large scale that include training

    and distribution/sale of measurement kits. Secondly, there is a

    clear geographic bias, with activities primarily occurring in devel-

    oped countries. There are more than 1800 programs in the United

    States alone (Volunteer Water Quality Monitoring, 2014). These

    observations are not inconsistent with citizen science applications

    which are more advanced in other ﬁelds such as ecology and bio-

    geography. Thirdly, in all the reviewed cases except one, the level

    of involvement by non-scientists are limited to data gathering.

    This clearly represents only a small subset of the levels of engage-

    ment reviewed in Section 2.3. As a result, the full potential for

    problem-identiﬁcation, data co-creation, and a joint analysis and

    co-generation of actionable knowledge (fully explored in Section

    4) is not realized.

    3.2. PROBLEM DEFINITION, PROJECT DESIGN, AND EXPERIMENTAL

    SCIENCE

    One explanation for the limited depth of engagement by non-

    scientists as revealed in Section 3.1 may be the geographical

    bias toward wealthy regions, instead of in areas where socio-

    ecological problems have more serious consequences (Halkay, M.,

    2011). Indeed, especially in cases that aim for sustainable devel-

    opment and poverty alleviation, such as those presented further

    in this paper, there is a clear need for a more bottom-up, inclu-

    sive approach to the identiﬁcation of most pressing concerns for

    action, problem deﬁnition and project design (Srinivasan et al.,

    2013). The social objective of citizen science projects in wealthy

    regions more often is to increase awareness and scientiﬁc literacy,

    as opposed to developing regions where the goals are more related

    to enhancement of community well-being such as poverty allevi-

    ation (Gura, 2013). Such deﬁnition of objectives and priorities

    necessarily results from political and social processes of con-

    structing management narratives within speciﬁc frameworks or

    “epistemic communities,” consisting of “experts sharing a belief

    in a common set of cause-and-effect relationships as well as com-

    mon values to which policies governing these relationships will

    be applied” (Haas, 1989, p. 384). These processes in their turn will

    have an impact on data collection and knowledge generation, e.g.,

    the variables that will be monitored and the points of data collec-

    tion. As a result, it is important that the citizen science process

    takes explicitly into account these multi-stakeholder processes of

    constructing the problems and frameworks, rather than a belief

    in an “objective” or “neutral” scientist-initiated approach. The

    application of citizen science in a water resources management

    context is clearly in its infancy in this regard, and in need of the

    adaptation of existing and the development of new frameworks to

    move from a technocratic-expert view on decision-making sup-

    port toward a joint creation-knowledge exchange model. This is

    further discussed in Section 4.1.

    A second potential reason for the hitherto limited uptake

    of citizen science in water related sciences is the difﬁculty of

    conducting experiments. In experimental science, system vari-

    ables are manipulated and the resulting outcome is observed

    to improve the understanding of processes and cause - effect

    relations. Such experiments are promising in a citizen science

    context given the direct link between cause and effect and thus

    their potential educational value. However, in hydrology and

    water resources controlled experiments are difﬁcult and often

    risky to set up, not only because of the large variety of uncon-

    trolled boundary conditions (e.g., land use change, climate con-

    ditions), but also because of the potentially wide-ranging and

    irreversible effects of perturbations to the water cycle. Yet exam-

    ples exist. Section 5.2 discusses the implementation and success of

    a small-scale experimental approach to assess the effectiveness of

    restoration strategies in the Ethiopian uplands. In the Peruvian

    case (Section 5.1), such a controlled approach is not possible,

    and therefore a comparative analysis of land-cover types is used

    as a proxy (sometimes also known as a “trading-space-for-time

    approach” Singh et al., 2011). However, in other cases simulation

    experiments will be the only alternative to experiments (Beven

    et al., 2012, Section 3.5)

    3.3. MONITORING, DATA COLLECTION

    Hydrological data collection typically relies on technologically

    complex and expensive measurements. Additionally, because of

    the large temporal variability of the water cycle, hydrological data

    analysis requires repeated measurements such as long time series

    of hydrological states and ﬂuxes (e.g., precipitation, discharge).

    Classic hydrometric practice has often been conﬁned to the pro-

    fessional environment and tailored to the speciﬁc needs of ofﬁcial

    monitoring networks (Herschy, 2009). This contrasts with a cit-

    izen science approach to data collection, which may require the

    compromise of data quality due to the use of different equipment,

    less frequent sampling, and less trained workforce, and which

    may be ephemeral in nature (Cohn, 2008; Devictor et al., 2010).

    The design of the monitoring may need to be technically sim-

    pliﬁed, and the procedure uniﬁed, so consistent samples can be

    generated; additionally, inferences need to be made from a larger

    volume of potentially lower quality data, which requires a differ-

    ent approach to data analysis (Cohn, 2008). At the same time,

    new technological developments also provide new opportunities

    for citizen science based monitoring (Table 2).

    3.3.1. Precipitation

    The simple design and affordability of rain gauges makes them

    particularly suited for application outside the traditional mon-

    itoring environment. Electronic sensors such as tipping bucket

    switches allow for convenient automatization. Yet, rain gauge

    measurements are very sensitive to the local aerodynamic con-

    ditions (World Meteorological Organization, 1994), and non-

    standard locations or varying local conditions (e.g., undergrowth,

    vegetation blockage), thus affecting the quality and interpretabil-

    ity of measurements. Hence, in a citizen science context, it will be

    crucial to document properly the local setting of the rain gauge

    and to apply and/or develop robust quality control protocols. New

    sensor technologies have the potential to make precipitation mea-

    surements more affordable and less prone to errors. For instance,

    disdrometers are increasingly used in precipitation monitoring,

    and are both cheap and robust in their measurements (e.g.,

    Löfﬂer-Mang and Joss, 2000). Other, more experimental methods

    for precipitation measurements, such as cellular communication

    interference (Overeem et al., 2013), are under development and

    may eventually provide new possibilities for citizen involvement.

    3.3.2. Streamﬂow

    Streamﬂow measurements are complex by nature, because most

    methods are based on indirect measurements such as ﬂow veloc-

    ity, cross sectional area and/or river stage, which are subsequently

    converted into volumetric ﬂux (Herschy, 2009). Traditional water

    level monitoring is complex and requires extensive maintenance,

    and is further complicated by property laws, regulations and

    other legal issues. Nevertheless, cases of successful measurement

    of river level and ﬂow in a citizen science context exist, such as

    the Peruvian case (Section 5.1). At the same time, new meth-

    ods are emerging that are more compatible with citizen science

    approaches. For example, camera-based water level measure-

    ments have been shown to have a good relative agreement (within

    16%) with a traditional installation (Royem et al., 2012). These

    can be further improved by combination with emerging remote

    sensing methods, such as high-resolution digital elevation and

    surements (e.g., Alsdorf et al., 2007; Smith and Pavelsky, 2008;

    Sampson et al., 2012).

    3.3.3. Water quality

    Citizen participation in water quality monitoring is often lim-

    ited to the collection of data in the form of water samples, basic

    hydrochemical parameters, or other indicators (e.g., macroinver-

    tebrates) because of the specialized knowledge and/or equipment

    needed for more advanced analysis (Overdevest and Orr, 2004).

    Benchmarking studies of the accuracy of the data collected by

    citizen scientists have reported differing outcomes (Au et al.,

    2000; Nicholson et al., 2002; Canﬁeld et al., 2002; Shelton, 2013).

    Nevertheless, new sensing technologies open up perspectives for a

    wider range of data collection. Aquatic sensors increasingly incor-

    porate water quality related measurements such as temperature,

    dissolved oxygen, turbidity, conductivity/salinity, pressure, redox

    potential, and pH, so there is already opportunities to automate

    the data collection for continuous sampling. An example of this

    under development is the WaterBot system that includes a Sensor

    that continuously measures temperature conductivity, a Gateway

    that relays this information using wiﬁ to a central data server,

    and a Wiewer that enables real-time observation (CREATE Lab,

    Carnergie Mellon University, 2014).

    3.3.4. Soil moisture

    Soil moisture measurements are increasingly automated, e.g.,

    by using time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors and related

    technology. Automated measurements are typically still less accu-

    rate for estimating actual volumes, and may suffer from speciﬁc

    technical limitations related to the range of soil conditions for

    which the sensor is useful operationally, such as variable appar-

    ent permittivity, and frozen soils. Yet, the measurements can

    be useful to capture moisture ﬂuctuations in the ground after

    precipitation events. The increasing affordability and robustness

    of the technology also allows for a broadening array of temporary

    and continuous uses, especially in an agricultural context, e.g.,

    irrigation.

    3.3.5. Vegetation dynamics

    In a hydrological context, vegetation dynamics are important for

    their impact on the distribution of hydrological ﬂuxes includ-

    ing interception of precipitation, canopy evaporation and surface

    runoff generation. Some of these ﬂuxes can be measured with

    above mentioned technologies such as rain gauges and soil mois-

    ture sensors. But the spatial interpolation of these processes, for

    instance in hydrological models, still relies on a limited num-

    ber of highly generalized vegetation parameterization (e.g., Clark

    et al., 2011). While remotely sensed methods for vegetation char-

    acterization are improving rapidly, there remains a need for ﬁeld

    veriﬁcation of vegetation types, spatiotemporal dynamics of veg-

    etation change, and aspects of ecosystem system stability, which

    cannot be observed through remote sensing. The use of acces-

    sible technologies such as geotagged photography may provide

    opportunities for stronger involvement of non-experts in data

    generation and local evaluation of remotely sensed products. Such

    data may even be sourced from public repositories of photographs

    if adequate metadata (e.g., location, time) are available.

    3.3.6. Water use

    While the abovementioned methods focus on the measurement

    of ﬂuxes that determine water availability, sustainable water

    resources management is often as much hindered by a lack of

    a proper characterization of water demand. Therefore, quantiﬁ-

    cation of abstraction volumes and other types of water use may

    play a crucial role in the optimization of water resource man-

    agement. Technology exists for the direct (e.g., water meters) or

    indirect (e.g., canal level) measurement of such ﬂuxes. The advent

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    of smart sensors allows for such measurements to be distributed

    and integrated in more complex analysis systems. However, con-

    ﬂicts, misuse, and data tampering may emerge if the role of water

    use data for example, in water allocation, becomes too direct.

    3.4. DATA TRANSMISSION AND PROCESSING

    Most hydrological measurements have a low temporal frequency

    (e.g., hourly rainfall, daily streamﬂow measurement) which facil-

    itates automatic transmission using internet or mobile phone

    connections. Even in remote regions such as mountains, mobile

    phone coverage is increasingly common. For instance, statis-

    tics of the (International Telecommunication Union, 2014) show

    that mobile phone penetration in countries such as the Kyrgyz

    Republic amounts to 92%. Even when mobile phone networks

    are not equipped for internet access, data transmission via daily

    text messages is a viable option. Telephone coverage in Nepal, a

    less developed country with extreme topographical variations, has

    crossed 70% of the population covering the whole country, out of

    which around 11% have access to internet. But low education lev-

    els and unavailability of data transmission in local language have

    limited its use in rural areas.

    As sensors become increasingly automated and easy-to-use,

    standards are emerging for interfaces that plug into a variety of

    devices such as mobile phones and home networks. Web-based

    services make it easy to connect devices and products with appli-

    cations to provide real-time control and data storage (Williams

    et al., 2011; Vitolo et al., in press). Data exchange standards such

    as the OGC Sensor Observation Service (e.g., Williams et al.,

    2011) and related assimilation methods facilitate the integration

    of data from citizen science with other data sources and process

    them in near-real time.

    Data robustness can be evaluated by comparing across sam-

    ples (Cohn, 2008), and it is possible for this quality-assurance

    procedure to be fully integrated in the real-time data collection.

    For explicit treatment of uncertainties, benchmarking studies of

    citizen science against conventional technologies/strategies could

    be completed before data collection commences, and examples of

    these are as discussed above in Section 3.3.

    Assimilation of uncertain data in hydrological simulation

    models is a well developed and active research ﬁeld (Beven, 2009).

    Yet, hydrological models still typically require speciﬁc, high-

    quality and long-term time series for calibration and validation,

    which may not be compatible with the distributed, temporary,

    and potentially lower-quality nature of citizen-science generated

    data. The integration of citizen science data with traditional data

    sources through interpolation or other merging techniques to cre-

    ate combined datasets may be one approach to solve this issue.

    For instance, methods to merge rain gauge data with satellite

    imagery to generate gridded precipitation products are well devel-

    oped (e.g., Shefﬁeld et al., 2006) and may highlight the value of

    short duration ground based measurements to locally calibrate

    large scale products.

    As for the calibration of hydrological models, Seibert and

    Beven (2009), among others, highlight the value of short-

    duration discharge time series for the calibration of hydrological

    models. Distributed measurements, even of short duration, may

    also be particularly useful for regionalization of hydrological

    models (Vandewiele and Elias, 1995; Parajka et al., 2005; Buytaert

    and Beven, 2009). Lastly, multi-objective calibration methods can

    address the issue of heterogeneous data availability of river basin

    modeling (e.g., Vaché et al., 2004; Parajka et al., 2007).

    For hydrological models to be incorporated in decision sup-

    port systems, modeling systems will need to represent the

    decision-making processes. Common methods include multi-

    agent system modeling, agent based modeling, and coupled

    human-environment system modeling (Gunkel, 2005; Srinivasan

    et al., 2013), among many others (e.g., Harrison et al., 2007;

    Matrosov et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). One particular value

    of this modeling approach for participatory data collection is

    in the integration of uncertainties, the treatment of incomplete

    data (Uusitalo, 2007), and the continuous updating of the model

    parameters with the incoming stream of data (Castelletti and

    Soncini-Sessa, 2007a).

    3.5. COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS, SCENARIO BUILDING, AND

    PARTICIPATORY MODELING

    Citizen science participation in data collection is probably the

    more straightforward type of engagement. A more fundamen-

    tal way to enhance citizens’ participation to the science pro-

    duction process is through joint analysis of the obtained data,

    which requires platforms for visualization and communication

    of results, joint scenario and hypothesis formulation, as well as

    data processing and hypothesis testing. Many relevant concepts

    and technologies have recently been developed in the context

    of science-supported decision support mechanisms (e.g., Olsson

    and Andersson, 2007; McIntosh et al., 2011).

    Visualization and communication ensures that scientiﬁc con-

    tent is comprehensible for the layperson, so that citizen scientists

    can directly gain from participation, which will also incentivise

    them for further engagement. This process is facilitated by the

    increasing availability of web-based technologies, which allow for

    rich, easy to update graphics potentially embedded in tailored

    applications and user experiences intended for a non-technical

    audience (so-called infographics, Spiegelhalter et al., 2011). Such

    systems improve communication outside the scientiﬁc discipline.

    Their interactive nature allows for feedback, commenting and

    rebuttal. The most immersive and interactive of such applications

    are sometimes referred to as Environmental Virtual Observatories

    (Beven et al., 2012; Buytaert et al., 2012), referring to the com-

    bined use of observed and virtually enhanced environmental data.

    But given the potentially very different nature and quality of

    citizen-science generated data, novel methods for data quality

    control, assimilation, and simulation will need to be developed.

    A major challenge in such applications is the communication

    of indirect observations and modeling results (e.g., interpolation

    and simulations), including their assumptions and uncertainties

    (Olsson and Andersson, 2007; Beven et al., 2012).

    Such virtual platforms also often provide a convenient and

    engaging platform for facilitating scenario building and hypoth-

    esis formulation, for instance as a graphical support for classic

    participatory scenario building (Andersson et al., 2008; Faysse

    et al., 2012). More advanced virtual approaches to scenario build-

    ing are simulation games (Le Bars and Grusse, 2008). An example

    of such approach is the Spatial Information Exploration and

    Visualization Environment (SIEVE, O’Connor et al., 2005), which

    employs a gaming engine for 3D visualization of geospatial data,

    which can be both raw (e.g., digital terrain) and modeling output.

    Their work focused on the visual communication, for example,

    by introducing a switch option between environments that are

    tailored toward experts vs. non-expert (“multiskilled environ-

    ment”). This approach assumes that a layperson connects better

    to the information that is visualized using textures (“realistic”)

    instead of symbols (“abstract”). Additionally, the environment

    allows for multi-way interaction via a chat window. This again

    enables joint-testing of new hypothesis (i.e., co-creation of new

    knowledge), even if the modeling is done ofﬂine by the only by

    the expert, who returns to report the outcomes of the experiment.

    A similar early experiment utilized the virtual environment

    of the local landscape projected in 3D on a large screen for an

    immersive experience (Stock and Bishop, 2005). Here, a group

    of people in the same physical location interact with this vir-

    tual environment using a handheld computer device, voting on

    different scenarios and varying degrees of land use changes that

    are more aligned with their local experience. The impact on

    water volumes and quality as associated with each land cover

    change as modeled by simple GIS-based models is also displayed.

    This system allows the simultaneous incorporation of traditional

    knowledge from multiple non-scientists and is a useful method

    to ﬁnding a point of agreement between the experts and non-

    experts in terms of the most relevant hypotheses (in the form of

    scenarios) to test.

    Yet, the most immersive collaboration between scientists and

    non-scientists is through joint data analysis aiming at hypothesis

    testing and knowledge generation. The most common approach

    to this is the use of participatory modeling (Castelletti and

    Soncini-Sessa, 2007b; Olsson and Andersson, 2007). In this pro-

    cess, actors from different backgrounds jointly construct a model

    of the system under study. The purpose of this process is often

    direct decision-making, but may extend to social learning (Hare,

    2011). In the latter case, models are used to facilitate sharing

    perspectives and to clarify arguments.

    Bayesian belief networks are often suggested as tools for

    participatory modeling, e.g., in the groundwater application of

    Henriksen et al. (2012). In this modeling approach, a system

    network is constructed that link various biophysical processes

    to environmental outcomes, and various decision scenarios can

    be explored to predict impact to the outcomes. Advantages of

    Bayesian networks include their conceptual simplicity, graphi-

    cal support, friendly semantics, and possibility for interaction

    among different actors (Castelletti and Soncini-Sessa, 2007a;

    Henriksen et al., 2007). The development of a Bayesian net-

    work representation of the system under study, either ofﬂine

    or online, may help in structuring the thinking process, iden-

    tifying causal relations, integrating different knowledge bases,

    and making assumptions and limitations of datasets and models

    more transparent (Henriksen et al., 2007; Olsson and Andersson,

    2007). Nevertheless, setting up successful participatory moni-

    toring activities requires not only strong buy-in from relevant

    stakeholders, the process itself is time-consuming and relies upon

    a high level of leadership and interpersonal skills (Henriksen et al.,

    2007).

    4. NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE USE

    OF CITIZEN SCIENCE IN SUSTAINABLE WATER

    RESOURCES MANAGEMENT

    If citizen science aims to be effective in producing positive effects

    on the governance of natural resources such as water, it needs

    to relate to the myriad of actors whose actions interact with

    the hydrological processes and who play a role in the explicit

    or implicit governance of the resources. Since the governance of

    natural resources in general, and water in particular, is inher-

    ently multi-scalar and polycentric (Ostrom and Cox, 2010), we

    cannot sufﬁce with a too simple technocratic model, where the

    “objective” expert-scientist (making use of citizens to co-generate

    data for the scientiﬁc models) provides the “real knowledge” to

    users-decision-makers. The relationships between “knowledge,”

    “scientiﬁc knowledge,” “decision-making,” and “actions” should

    be conceptualized differently, and more in line with ideas of

    polycentric, multi-scalar governance in complex social-ecological

    system (Ostrom and Cox, 2010).

    The concept of citizen science with the term “citizen” and

    its political connotations, suggests a political—as opposed to

    a technical-neutral—dimension, and it requires a decentering

    and different articulation of the scientiﬁc knowledge process

    within the broader social process of co-creation of sufﬁciently

    shared “actionable knowledge” that becomes the basis of changed

    “actions” within the management of resources. It is crucial to

    think about this process in terms of “knowledge encounters,” or

    even “battleﬁelds of knowledge,” where different bodies of knowl-

    edge and meaning, are vying with each other to make sense of

    complex reality, and strive to occupy a prominent place in the

    multi-scalar, poly-centric decision-making about the actions that

    affect livelihoods (also to be understood beyond a mere mate-

    rial content as sense-making for a “life one has reason to value”)

    and the use of the resources such as water about which sci-

    ence makes a knowledge contribution in interaction with the

    stakeholders. Of course, different from certain scientists, peo-

    ple are not hydrologists; they are not only interested in water,

    even when it might be of crucial importance to them. This also

    implies that the ideas and institutions that, respectively, inspire

    and guide the actions of people are usually not specialized, nor

    focused on particular issues. The inevitably reductionist approach

    of most scientiﬁc analysis, however, requires a focus on particular

    resources, and therefore also tends to look for, or contributes to

    the creation of specialized institutions for the governance of that

    particular resource. In practice, much of the relevant actions of

    citizens are however not inspired and determined by such specif-

    ically crafted institutions, but rather the outcome of a process

    of “bricolage” (Cleaver, 2002), an interactive encounter of exist-

    ing (multi-purpose) institutions (i.e., contributing to make sense

    of the life of people and not just of water or another ecosys-

    tem service) in which sensible ideas, rules and practices can

    -interactively- become incorporated in the received wisdom of

    existing societies (Hall et al., 2014).

    4.1. TOWARD A MODEL FOR JOINT KNOWLEDGE CREATION AND

    EXCHANGE

    The space for most productive collaboration is where citizens’

    and scientists’ questions overlap and where the mutual beneﬁt of

    www.frontiersin.org

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 9

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    actors can be optimized. Citizen’s questions can be quite different

    from those of professional scientists. Even in such conditions, citi-

    zen science projects may be successful if mutual beneﬁts outweigh

    the compromise of adjusting research questions to the interests

    of the other parties. From a professional scientist perspective,

    immediate beneﬁts will often consist of help with data collection

    and analysis with the aim of creating general knowledge, while

    for the involved citizens, immediate beneﬁts may result from the

    relevance of the gathered data for local issues.

    However, as argued above, citizen science may open perspec-

    tives for a more fundamental model of mutual beneﬁt, which

    relies on joint knowledge creation and exchange. Especially in

    the context of ecosystem services management, multiple forms

    of local or situated knowledge exist within rural communi-

    ties. These include traditional knowledge, i.e., intergenerational

    understanding of ecosystems and beliefs that condition ecosys-

    tem services (Berkes, 1993), as well as more recent situated

    understandings of ecosystem services and associated management

    practices (Robertson and McGee, 2003) and personal insights

    derived from individual experience (Fazey et al., 2006). Such

    local knowledge contrasts with more formalized scientiﬁc knowl-

    edge on ecosystem services, often generated by external agencies

    (including extension agencies, rural experts and researchers) and

    based on hypothesis building and testing. Connecting these dif-

    ferent forms of knowledge goes beyond the recording of data

    and requires sustained interaction between citizens and scientists

    such that scientiﬁc and local knowledge systems can enrich each

    other.

    Research on ecosystem services management conﬁrms the

    beneﬁts of knowledge exchange and knowledge co-generation,

    both within remote rural communities and between commu-

    nities and external agencies (Cundill and Fabricius, 2009).

    These include the production of hybrid (local/science), user-

    oriented knowledge, potentially enabling more efﬁcient and effec-

    tive resource use in remote rural areas (Berkes, 2009); greater

    community involvement within marginalized groups, leading

    to enhanced social capital (Cundill and Fabricius, 2010) and

    resilience (Lebel et al., 2010); and improved trust and reci-

    procity between external agencies and rural communities (Jodha,

    2005). Overall, several potential beneﬁts emerge from establish-

    ing forms of knowledge co-generation. The most direct outcome

    may be a better management and beneﬁt extraction from ecosys-

    tem services. Secondly, new knowledge can improve access of

    marginalized and excluded groups to ecosystem services. Lastly,

    the process of co-generating knowledge affords greater participa-

    tion by marginalized groups in the development of community-

    wide strategies and plans to access ecosystem services.

    The potential of citizen science to achieve such objective is

    strongly related to the nature of social action and governance of

    natural resources. The real world governance of natural resources

    is an evolving, emergent outcome of interactions between multi-

    ple sources of governance in state, market or civic realms and at

    different scales of action (Ostrom and Cox, 2010). Policy-oriented

    scientiﬁc activity in general, and the citizen science mode in par-

    ticular, cannot escape and will therefore need to engage actively

    in these interaction, which generate actionable knowledge in and

    for multiple arenas.

    Citizen science that aims to promote democratic inclusion of

    poorer groups in society can select problems that are primor-

    dially raised and framed by the concerns of these priority groups.

    Scientiﬁc knowledge (and scientiﬁc activity) about these prob-

    lems can then not only increase evidence-based understanding

    of these particular concerns, but also contribute to enhanced

    legitimacy of these issues within the local political arenas and con-

    tribute to balancing unequal power relations without being too

    optimistic or naïve about the possibilities to achieve substantial

    results. The link of the participative scientiﬁc activity with crit-

    ical concerns and explicit or implicit struggles in local political

    arenas will be an important source of motivation for local peo-

    ple to participate in the scientiﬁc knowledge generation process.

    We elaborate on some of the preconditions for this process in the

    following sections.

    4.2. LEGITIMACY OF THE GENERATED KNOWLEDGE

    If citizen science generated knowledge is to be used to sup-

    port decision-making, it is important to ensure that there is a

    strong foundation of trust and legitimacy among the involved

    actors, and to be attentive toward how those become effectively

    ascribed to different bodies of knowledge. This also implies a need

    to focus explicitly on discursive struggles within local decision-

    making arenas, as the construction of evidence-based “expert

    knowledge” can quickly become decontextualized inputs for the

    generation of certain policies and institutional logics molded by

    local power geographies (e.g., Büscher, 2012). Often in water

    resources related bureaucracies of the developing world (i.e.,

    where decision-making around hydrology, water resource man-

    agement and technology development tends to take place almost

    exclusively by scientists), it may be difﬁcult for citizen science

    accounts to feed into decision-making – that is, even when that

    knowledge is being collected through an institutionalized process

    (Birkenholtz, 2008; Mollinga, 2009). This is partly because it may

    not adhere to the same evaluation and validation criteria that

    scientiﬁc hydrological knowledge needs to adhere to or because

    of misalignment and contestation between what citizen knowl-

    edge is proposing and what is being proposed by the scientiﬁc

    knowledge in question (Fischer, 1993; Dunn et al., 2008).

    This apparent tension between classic scientiﬁc knowledge and

    citizen science highlights that questions around how knowledge

    is created and represented within a socio-institutional context

    are at least as important as the design and practice of collecting

    citizen-based evidence in the ﬁrst place. This issue of knowl-

    edge representation and legitimacy can be complex, for example,

    when citizen accounts rest primarily on tacit or experience-based

    accounts of context speciﬁc concerns. While this paper is focused

    more on the useful inputs of citizen science in hydrology, as

    opposed to processes of contestation and legitimacy per se, we

    recognize that in addition to questions about the characteristics

    of the citizen knowledge itself, we also have to ask how we can

    ensure that this kind of knowledge is likely to feed into demo-

    cratic institutional structures and has an equally meaningful and

    durable impact on deliberative decision-making processes, given

    that we also recognize that knowledge is political. In low-income

    countries where citizen based information may open opportu-

    nities for achieving a range of ecosystem service safeguards and

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    poverty alleviation outcomes, raising this question is particularly

    pertinent (Daw et al., 2011).

    4.3. IMPROVING CITIZEN ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING

    Citizen science’s democratic nature may promote a more equi-

    table form of decision-making by giving citizens more infor-

    mation about natural resources and allowing for meaningful

    contributions to discussions and policy-making (Bulkeley and

    Mol, 2003). The use of collective intelligence to refashion more

    traditional scientiﬁc practices can push the boundaries for under-

    standing and inventiveness using the ideas from a larger set of

    people, thus promoting inclusiveness (Seymour and Regalado,

    2014). However, in practice, inclusion may still be biased as vol-

    unteers in citizen science projects tend to be people who are

    interested in and committed to closer engagement with speciﬁc

    projects, or forms of scientiﬁc enquiry (Cohn, 2008). It may also

    appear that the outcome of participatory workshops, for exam-

    ple, are democratic, consensual conclusions by all participants,

    whereas in practice they often mainly represent the dominant

    mainstream views that are allowed to surface into the public

    arenas, thus transforming “participation” into a tyranny of the

    dominant and the mainstream. Similarly, although new technolo-

    gies can attract a large sector of the society, the exclusion of the

    remaining sector who are averse to them or lack the competency

    to learn them is not fully preventable (Newman et al., 2012).

    Thus, a signiﬁcant amount of outreach efforts is required to reach

    out to the segments of society for whom the project can have the

    most life-affecting outcomes.

    Furthermore, in a context of sustainable development, almost

    by deﬁnition (Bastiaensen et al., 2005), the poorer people will

    have difﬁculty to voice their concerns and even more to articu-

    late them to (scientiﬁc) outsiders. So more often than otherwise,

    we therefore expect that participative citizen science will address

    more mainstream concerns of the local majority, or even of small

    dominant local elites. But in view of the post-research application

    of scientiﬁc ﬁndings, this usually has the advantage to facilitate

    rallying more and more relevant local support to implement rec-

    ommendations through social action, while evidently risking to

    bypass critical concerns of disadvantaged groups and even to con-

    tribute to the deepening of their dispossession and exclusion. This

    constitutes a tricky, but often unavoidable dilemma in the imple-

    mentation of citizen science, and requires a careful analysis of

    the social interface between the citizen science practices and the

    learning and struggle in local political arenas. By no means, how-

    ever, does this dilemma reduce the potential contribution that

    science and citizen science can make to local bricolage toward

    better governance.

    4.4. FEEDBACK LOOPS IN THE UPTAKE OF CITIZEN SCIENCE BASED

    KNOWLEDGE IN DECISION-MAKING

    Being locally relevant and legitimate is a precondition for citizen

    science-based knowledge to be useful for decision-making. But

    to ensure knowledge uptake, the link between citizen science and

    decision-making needs to be clear and transparent. This link can

    be understood in terms of feedback loops at different levels, and is

    probably most promising when it is multi-functional across these

    different levels. At the individual level, an immediate feedback

    loop depends on the relevance and usefulness of the informa-

    tion collected by the citizen scientist for his or her individual

    decision-making. This depends also on technical possibilities or

    design features such that the individual citizen scientist can actu-

    ally read out, understand and record the information rather than

    just passing on unaccessible or unintelligible bits. Another feed-

    back loop is possible at the level of collective decision-making, be

    that national, regional or local, e.g., when a water user association

    relies on information collected by one or some of its members to

    take decisions about the distribution of irrigation water. Lastly, yet

    another feedback loop is possible when scientists are involved in a

    process of knowledge co-generation, where they combine locally

    collected data by citizen scientists with other existing datasets to

    add value to that information, and make the results accessible for

    individual and collective decision-making arenas.

    4.5. FOSTERING LONG-TERM CITIZEN INVOLVEMENT

    Involving citizens from the start has the potential to enhance

    the prospects that the knowledge generated will be locally rel-

    evant of its long-term sustainability, especially if the setup is

    interweaved within existing institutional structures and if the

    connection to local societal beneﬁt exists (Danielsen et al., 2005).

    An ideal outcome would be that the most underprivileged sec-

    tions of the community have a sense of ownership over the

    system being collaboratively set up and can attune it toward

    answering questions that concerns them. For this to be real-

    ized in practice however, each knowledge and valuation system

    would need to be understood as legitimate in its own right, even

    when citizen- and science-based knowledges are pursued sepa-

    rately (Tengö et al., 2014). In pluralizing knowledge systems for

    water resource management, one must also remain attentive to

    the power relationships which inﬂuence cooperation and learning

    between disparate knowledge systems (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2007).

    Toward this end, it is fundamental to acknowledge that there will

    always be power issues when connecting different branches of sci-

    ence with citizen-derived knowledge (Agrawal and Gibson, 1999;

    Keeley and Scoones, 2000; Karpouzoglou and Zimmer, 2011).

    Thus, despite existing opportunities in hydrology for identifying

    areas of complementarity between different knowledge systems,

    it is essential to remain attentive to the fact that there are always

    aspects of each knowledge system that cannot be fully trans-

    lated into each other, partly because of the different approaches

    that exist (within disciplines and across different knowledge sys-

    tems) to generate, validate or award legitimacy to knowledge

    (Schweizer, 1998; Martinez-Alier, 2014).

    A different kind of institutional support is necessary to fos-

    ter the kind of dialogue across different knowledge perspectives.

    This may imply, for instance, that research funding includes sup-

    port for the development of strong interpersonal connections in

    more open knowledge arenas (Cornell et al., 2013). Without these

    connections any efforts to address the important perspectives of

    citizens are likely to appear piecemeal or biased by the established

    scientiﬁc disciplines and “epistemic communities,” and institu-

    tional norms toward the validation of knowledge in research

    programmes.

    In practice however, a more pragmatic approach may be

    needed. For instance, experience from the Tana Lake case study

    www.frontiersin.org

    October 2014 | Volume 2 | Article 26 | 11

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    (Section 5.2) learns that unlike citizen science in developed coun-

    tries where volunteering is a pastime activity, in developing coun-

    tries, the citizen observers very often derive their income from

    their engagement. The concept of volunteering and sending data

    to a central point is not very well established, and it may be

    necessary to employ people at local wages, to incentivise partic-

    ipants while the value of their participation in and the outcome

    of the monitoring activity are still uncertain to them. However,

    one must be aware of the danger of “motivation crowding-out,”

    i.e., the fact that monetary or in-kind payments (i.e., extrin-

    sic motivation) for “socially-expected behavior” can crowd out

    more intrinsic behavior (originally treated in more psychology-

    related and economics literature; e.g., Frey, 1997) and future

    social motivations.

    5. CASE STUDIES

    In this last section, we present 4 geographically dispersed case

    studies with either active citizen science initiatives or local inter-

    est in setting up such activities. They serve as an illustration

    to the viability and relevance of the concepts reviewed above.

    The cases are located in remote mountain environments, which

    are typically environments that combine fragile and understud-

    ied natural systems with accelerated environmental change and

    vulnerable populations that are strongly reliant on ecosystem

    services. In such a context, it is pertinent to investigate the

    potential of more inclusive methods to generate knowledge on

    improved uses of ecosystem services that supports sustainable

    development and improves human well-being. The discussion

    focuses particularly on:

    • The motivation and level of engagement by the non-scientists,

    • The type of data monitored, and potential for participatory

    modeling and knowledge exchange,

    • The legitimacy of the generated knowledge,

    • The sustainability of the citizen science activity,

    • Potential uptake in decision making/resource governance.

    5.1. PERUVIAN ANDES

    Andean water resources are extremely variable in time and space.

    This is most notable on the Paciﬁc side of the Peruvian Andes,

    where annual rainfall varies from virtually no precipitation at

    sea level around the city of Piura (except for El Niño years),

    to 1500 mm at 3500 m altitude (Figure 1). Humid air masses

    originating from the Amazonian region pass the Huancabamba

    depression and penetrate a few tens of kilometers into the basins

    of the Chira and Piura rivers on the Paciﬁc slopes of the Andes.

    The water that drains to the Paciﬁc side of the Andes through

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    this mechanism is of vital importance to small-scale as well as

    industrial-scale agriculture in the desert plains in several thou-

    sands hectares irrigation schemes such as San Lorenzo, Alto

    Piura and Bajo Piura. A new project of diverting a tributary of

    the Amazon, the Huancabamba river, through a trans-Andean

    tunnel, toward new desert lands, is currently under construction.

    Despite the economical importance of these irrigated lands

    and the crucial dependence on highland hydrology, attention for

    highland conservation was marginal until recently and knowledge

    of the highlands hydrology, including basic parameters such as

    rainfall input is very limited. However, in the Quiroz river sub-

    catchment, local stakeholders have now established a common

    platform to discuss beneﬁt sharing mechanisms in the catch-

    ment. These stakeholders include upstream subsistence farmers,

    downstream agrobusinesses and smaller farmers depending on

    irrigated agriculture in the desert, water authorities, and regional

    environmental authorities. This platform is in urgent need of rele-

    vant information that can feed into discussions and negotiations.

    Key information needs are current surface water availability and

    its spatiotemporal variability, as well as the potential impact of

    changing land uses in the upper catchment. The case is one of sev-

    eral that are accompanied by the “Incubator of Mechanisms for

    Retribution for Ecosystem Services,” an initiative of the Ministry

    of Environment of Peru.

    As a result of these drivers, the highlands of Piura have

    pioneered in citizen science-based hydrological monitoring led

    by a regional NGO (Consortium for Sustainable Development

    of the Andean Ecoregion, CONDESAN). The initiative for

    Hydrological Monitoring of Andean Ecosystems (iMHEA in

    Spanish, CONDESAN, 2014), was established in 2009 (Célleri

    et al., 2010). The network focuses on pairwise catchment

    monitoring to identify the hydrological impacts of land-use

    change, and the beneﬁts of restoration activities. At present,

    it consists of 20 catchments in the tropical Andes (Venezuela

    to Bolivia), including 5 catchments in the Piura highlands

    (Figure 2). Monitored variables are rainfall and streamﬂow,

    in some sites complemented with meteorological variables to

    of the iMHEA monitoring network in the Peruvian Andes.

    calculate reference evapotranspiration. Field monitoring is per-

    formed by non-specialist/non-researcher staff, but regular capac-

    ity strengthening events are organized by a coordinating NGO

    with support from regional and international scientists. In the

    case of the Rio Quiroz catchment, the monitoring is operated

    by an NGO, which acts as facilitator for the discussion platform,

    in close collaboration with the upland municipalities that are

    interested in quantifying the water they are “offering.”

    The case is a clear example of a bottom-up initiative emerg-

    ing from a local awareness about the need for better information

    on ecosystem services, and facilitated by the availability of cheap

    and robust technology (electronic rain gauges and water level

    sensors). As such, it has obvious potential to inﬂuence negotia-

    tion processes and decision-making in the catchment. This con-

    trasts with information that originates in the standard national

    hydrometeorological network operated by the national hydrome-

    teorological ofﬁce (SENAMHI), which does not reach the remote

    upland areas that are key for water supply, but is also not focused

    on the speciﬁcity of the water yield and regulation of speciﬁc

    ecosystems and land use regimes. Additionally, local actors ﬁnd

    difﬁcult to access and expensive.

    While the long-term sustainability of the initiative is difﬁcult

    to assess given its short time span, the local buy-in provides it

    with a stronger legacy compared to traditional, external sources

    of information. Identiﬁed bottlenecks toward increased uptake of

    the generated information include the need for data processing,

    quality control, visualization and the development of modeling

    systems for scenario analysis and prediction.

    5.2. LAKE TANA BASIN, ETHIOPIA

    Livelihood security in the rural area around Lake Tana, Ethiopia

    is strongly dependent on local ecosystem services generated from

    the land and the land cover. Rapid population increase has led

    to rapid land use and land cover change (Moges et al., 2014),

    and current management of the land providing ecosystem ser-

    vices such as food, feed, and fuel for the current generation is

    unsustainable. The increase in cultivated land, combined with

    traditional practices such as plowing land continuously and along

    the slopes, causes land degradation including hardpan forma-

    tion and a decreasing soil depth. The degrading resources in turn

    hamper the ability of the land to provide further essential ecosys-

    tem services such as groundwater recharge and carbon ﬁxation.

    To minimize such degradation, and to maintain the produc-

    tive capacity of the land, various natural resources management

    options have been developed by the central government and

    implemented locally under governmental directive. These prac-

    tices are usually ineffective in increasing short term and long term

    beneﬁts, and in some cases these practices accelerated the decrease

    in poverty alleviating ecosystem services.

    A main problem is the disconnect between the governmental

    or donor recommended practices and what farmers are will-

    ing to maintain voluntarily without governmental interventions.

    For instance, government agencies recommend the installation of

    60 cm deep and 30–40 cm wide swales on the contour to intercept

    excess rainfall and to allow it inﬁltrate into the subsoil. In contrast,

    the indigenous soil conservation practice is to plow small 10–

    15 cm furrows just off the contour to transport the excess rainfall,

    which ponds temporarily over slowly permeable layer. This mini-

    mizes erosion by preventing long rills going down the slope. This

    dichotomy in practices, and the resulting lack of local buy-in,

    often results in poorly implemented land-management practices

    that increase erosion and land degradation (Mitiku et al., 2006)

    despite the fact that upland and gully erosion in the watersheds

    are well understood (Tebebu et al., 2010). Another large source of

    erosion are gullies that form in the periodically saturated lower

    lands. Rehabilitation of these gullies has not been very successful

    in the past, mainly because there is little experience and farmers

    have not been involved.

    Nevertheless, a citizen science experiment in the upper Birr

    catchment has shown promise in addressing this issue that fails to

    be addressed at a governmental level (Ayele et al., 2014, Figure 3).

    The study initiated local collaboration, by ﬁrst discussing with

    the religious leaders and local respected elders, and later with

    local village farmers about some ideas for restoring gullies. The

    religious leaders, local elders and farmers were originally skep-

    tical and hesitant, as they believed these gullies were created by

    God as a punishment for their wrongdoings. Only after they

    were shown photos of other rehabilitated gullies and two farmers

    were brought to visit a rehabilitated gully, that an agreement was

    reached for them to start a trial on one location. Twenty farmers

    of the community and surrounding farmers agreed to contribute

    labor and wood to fence for the protection of the gully and share

    equally the produced grass at the end of the rainy season. They

    also set a ﬁnancial punishment for anyone who allowed their

    animal into the enclosed gully. Following this agreement, a meet-

    ing was organized with the local community, religious leaders,

    administrators, extension workers, and the village expert to share

    responsibilities. Nevertheless, the process was not always smooth.

    Grass grew well in the gully after closure during the rainy season,

    but then a conﬂict emerged when the 20 farmers whose land sur-

    rounded the gully refused to share the resulting beneﬁts, i.e., the

    grass produced on the protected area. The conﬂict was resolved

    by the elders in the village by having the 20 farmers apologize and

    FIGURE 3 | Discussing ecosystem degradation resulting from farmers

    whose land surrounding the rehabilitated gully being unwilling to

    share the grass in the Tana Lake Region, Ethiopia.

    sign a promissory note to contribute labor and wood in the next

    program to rehabilitate on the second village’s gully (Figure 3).

    Clearly the success of this program was due to capitalizing on

    the informal decision process. Although the formal decision mak-

    ing process is strongly centralized following the decision from

    regional and federal administrators, an informal decision mak-

    ing process exists in parallel, and is centered around the the elders

    and clergymen whose authority is very well respected. Therefore,

    any new knowledge generated within the community, particularly

    with the key community representatives such as local elders and

    religious leaders, can be easily received if channeled by/through

    these ﬁgures. One could also argue that the farmers’ willingness

    to participate is the conviction, due to the trust in their elders,

    that there is something for them to gain.

    A key element in this process is the reconciliation of views

    rather than falsication of a particular view. Gully creation is the

    result of a combination of human activities and natural causes

    such as soil instabilities (i.e., external factors). Elders explain the

    external factors from a religious perspective but both perspec-

    tives acknowledge that part of the erosive process is inevitable,

    yet that impacts should be minimized. To achieve this, the reli-

    gious leaders preached to the community on Sunday that God

    sends a messenger (the researcher) to give a solution. As a result,

    they requested the community to give help to the researcher for

    rehabilitating gully.

    The case illustrates that a collaborative engagement in a citizen

    science experiment is achievable in the context of an Ethiopian

    farmers community, and how citizen-science generated results

    can have on dynamics of ecosystem management and beneﬁt.

    Tailoring the design to local decision-making processes improved

    the relevance and legitimacy of the results, and thus their assimi-

    lation. At the same time, it shows the potential risks and pitfalls of

    altering local balances of resource use. Lastly, despite the straight-

    forward experimental design, the use of educational material such

    as photos helped in setting up the experiment and creating local

    buy-in.

    5.3. UPPER KALIGANDAKI BASIN, NEPAL

    The Upper Kaligandaki basin is located in the Mustang district

    of the Trans-Himalayan region of Nepal, bordering the Tibet

    Autonomous Region of China to the northeast. The Mustang

    district has a population of around 15,600 inhabitants, and a lit-

    eracy rate of 57%. It is the the driest region of Nepal, with an

    annual precipitation under 200 mm/year. The local communities

    are mostly agro-pastoralists, cultivating barley, wheat, potato and

    buckwheat in isolated areas close to the river, and raising yak,

    sheep, and goat.

    Traditionally, water resources were exclusively used for irrigat-

    ing croplands (through canals) and managed by cooperative man-

    agement practices among local communities (Messerschmidt,

    1986). More recently, there are competing demands from

    domestic use, hydropower generation and cultural signiﬁcance

    (National Trust for Nature Conservation, 2008). Furthermore,

    there is an increasing water stress due to changes in snow-

    fall and rainfall. The available water resource became highly

    contested resource among individuals, communities and social

    groups (National Trust for Nature Conservation, 2008). To adapt

    with the changing environment, they have developed sophis-

    ticated methods of crop cultivation and water harvesting that

    allows them to cope and sustain their livelihoods (often with little

    or limited government inﬂuence, Chapagain and Bhusal, 2013).

    For example,

    two adjacent

    communities,

    Phalyak and

    Dhakarjong, used to share a common stream by dividing total

    ﬂow into parts, using a wooden trunk with equal opening spaces

    placed in the stream bed (Figure 4). This was in practice for

    several decades but also created disputes and misunderstandings

    among communities. According to a senior community member

    (aged 88 years), the problems were: (i) small debris often blocked

    or altered the ﬂow at respective openings, (ii) some community

    members deliberately changed the water ﬂow manually to get

    more water into their side, and (iii) the wooden structures were

    usually difﬁcult to ﬁx at the stream bed and continued washed

    away by occasional ﬂash ﬂoods. This pushed local people to ﬁnd a

    better sharing mechanism, and the stream is now diverted in days

    turn—3 days for Phalyak and 2 days for Dhakarjong. This sharing

    practice seems more sustainable as it is operating smoothly.

    Despite a high level of creativity in their response to change,

    there remain concerns being voiced by farmers about the direc-

    tion of future trajectories of change. The ﬁrst phase of research

    in Mustang has explored for example aspects of farmer per-

    ceived climate change. In this context, farmers have referred to

    signiﬁcant changes in local hydrological processes including dis-

    appearances of small lakes and water reservoirs, as well as changes

    in glacier composition. Farmers further recognize the long term

    implications of changing climate dynamics for their livelihoods

    and potential risks that these may present for their agricultural

    based economies. Perhaps because of this we perceive great inter-

    est by the farmers themselves to work together with natural and

    social scientists to develop a better sense of their surrounding and

    and the impact of emerging socio-economic and environmental

    drivers upon their livelihoods. There are indications that this can

    only work as a two-way dialogue and knowledge co-generation

    process between scientists and local communities. Insights into

    local experiences can furthermore facilitate the formulation of

    a more contextually speciﬁc understanding of change on the

    basis of a more balanced representation of citizen and expert

    knowledge.

    In recognition of the data scarcity and high uncertainties, there

    is evidence of policy making acknowledging the fact that new

    understanding and potential solutions can be achieved through

    wider public participation. One example is the involvement of

    volunteers in the collection of hydrological and meteorological

    data since the establishment of hydrological and meteorological

    services in Nepal. Although the volunteers receive a monthly wage

    from the Nepalese Hydrology and Meteorology Ofﬁce, it is very

    small (the price of a cup of tea) and do not form a part of income

    contribution.

    Little is known about the precise mechanisms that motivate

    volunteers to contribute to data collection, though it is clear

    that complex range of factors are involved. This may include for

    example a sense of national pride, since these volunteers per-

    ceive that they are helping the Nepalese meteorological authorities

    to collect basic data. Recently, the successful implementation of

    community-based ﬂood warning system on the West Rapti, Babai,

    and Karnali Rivers in Nepal has also demonstrated that there is an

    ample scope of saving lives and properties in an inexpensive man-

    ner if the government organizations work with non-government

    organizations, and communities (Practical Action, 2008/2009).

    Thus, citizen science approaches (or people’s participation) in

    water resources monitoring/management could become a useful

    alternative to address many challenging issues for water resource

    management practices in a high mountainous region of Nepal.

    5.4. NARYN REGION, KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

    The Naryn region in Kyrgyzstan covers a remote mountainous

    watershed in the Central Tien Shan range in Central Asia. While

    for many centuries this area was inhabited mainly by Kyrgyz

    herders following traditional resource use patterns, in the Soviet

    era collectivized state farms were established. As these farms were

    specialized in livestock production, all arable land was used for the

    production of fodder crops to feed a variety of livestock, mainly

    sheep, goats, and cattle. Within the collective farms, specialized

    employees were given instruction by educated pasture, cropland

    and water management specialists from academic institutions,

    and supported with well-equipped infrastructure to monitor cli-

    mate, river runoff and pasture land conditions. However, despite

    training and equipment, since the 1980s Soviet scientists reported

    increasing pasture degradation attributed mainly to overuse of the

    natural resources (Kerven et al., 2012).

    As aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan

    faced another restructuring process, with consequent major polit-

    ical and societal upheavals. Moving from a planned economy to a

    market-based economy through the 1990s, privatization and land

    reforms led to a signiﬁcant redistribution of assets such as crop-

    land, livestock and state farm equipment. Simultaneously there

    was a drastic increase in poverty following independence due

    to economic factors and changes in livelihoods (United Nation

    Development Programme, 2011/2012). Additionally, the majority

    of families became very dependent on subsistence farming, with

    livestock as the primary source of household income. This major

    socio-economic transition was accompanied by deterioration of

    the transport and irrigation networks and the environmental

    monitoring infrastructure, matched also by inadequate collabora-

    tion and data-sharing among institutions involved henceforth in

    more localized (decentralized) decision-making. This trend has

    continued to the present, however the patterns and drivers of

    degradation have changed over time. Ongoing climate change is

    Citizen science for hydrology

    further exacerbating the above challenges and is impacting nat-

    ural resources, leading to higher frequencies of natural disaster

    occurrence.

    From a perspective of water availability and management,

    the main challenges in Naryn include limited public investment,

    high inter-sectoral competition (e.g., hydropower vs. irrigation),

    scarcity due to shortage and waste, and increasing occurrence

    of upstream/downstream tensions. Regarding water shortage and

    related resource management, a dual strategic response is gen-

    erally adopted: increasing irrigation water availability with con-

    struction and rehabilitation of infrastructure, and strengthening

    and improving water governance institutions. Current develop-

    ment projects in the region mostly address the organization of

    water administration including the promotion and institutional

    development of water users associations (WUAs), improvement

    of water allocation mechanisms among farmers and between vil-

    lage WUAs, and the promotion of technical improvements for

    more efﬁcient water use.

    At present there is little opportunity or local capacity in

    rural areas of Naryn to monitor water resources. However, a

    participatory citizen science approach is promising for such a

    data scarce region – and could be used proﬁtably not only to

    ﬁll data and information gaps, but also to work collaboratively

    with pastoral communities to generate relevant management-

    oriented knowledge. The use of citizen science can help provide

    a mobilizing and empowering effect within the community if

    appropriate motivational factors are clearly identiﬁed. Through

    development of long-term partnerships and joint elaboration of

    key research questions or problems to address, both scientists

    and community members may value such collaborative work and

    together develop participatory processes to monitor water ﬂow

    and collect relevant environmental data, and to collaborate in

    data processing, analysis, knowledge generation, and transparent

    monitoring. Local motivation for participation in joint work is

    likely to include both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including

    both personal development and curiosity as well as an anticipa-

    tion of future economic advantages. Finding an inclusive research

    approach that reconciles traditional (“pre-Soviet”) and modern

    knowledge types presumably will be another signiﬁcant factor

    for the acceptance and successful application of citizen science in

    the top-down, “expert”-oriented decision-making legacy that still

    remains in Kyrgyzstan. Furthermore, the effective application of

    citizen science for knowledge generation is likely to depend on

    identifying and working alongside unique innovative individuals

    who are willing to consider and trial new collaborative manage-

    ment approaches. From a technical perspective, a variety of new

    mobile tools and instruments, e.g., for canal runoff measurements

    or precipitation monitoring, are now available at low cost and

    can easily be used even by inexperienced community partners or

    students from nearby colleges.

    There are, however, some challenges to the uptake of cit-

    izen science as a community-endorsed concept. Of particular

    importance is the persistence of a “Soviet mindset.” While citi-

    zen science has a potential to overcome entrenched legacies by

    empowering communities to engage in the creation and pro-

    duction of “their own” relevant knowledge, this participatory

    approach to science faces challenges due to many people in

    transitional post-Soviet contexts still tending to rely on external

    expertise rather than developing their own capacity. Some ben-

    eﬁciaries of the current social status quo – often former (Soviet

    era) elites – may also have an interest in preserving their sta-

    tus and privileges. Yet in the democratizing Republic there is

    generally a sustained growth of local people’s involvement in

    governing processes, even though sometimes there remain (or

    are increases in) asymmetric power relations that complicate the

    development of strong civil institutions and consensual decision

    making. Additionally, as a result of recent changes in national

    pasture legislation, there is a potential for increased village-level

    engagement in the development of pasture management plans.

    Individual herders thus have increasing opportunity to make their

    own natural resource management decisions, as well as to be rep-

    resented on village pasture management committees. Thus, in

    the context of recent socio-political development in the Kyrgyz

    Republic, despite some continuing legacy of Soviet times, there

    are clear opportunities for the emergence of citizen partnerships.

    As part of a UK-funded Ecosystem Services for Poverty

    Alleviation (ESPA) project, community meetings have now taken

    place over several months along with the collection of baseline

    information (e.g., regional maps, demographic datasets) for the

    research team to better understand the social-ecological system

    in Naryn. Through this process, several ecosystem services have

    been identiﬁed including the provision of grassland forage, fod-

    der, livestock products such as milk and wool, water for irrigation,

    water ﬂow regulation, soil erosion control, biodiversity and car-

    bon sequestration. All these ecosystem services beneﬁt or impact

    directly on pastoral livelihoods, and nearly all are related to the

    water cycle. From this perspective, the project team deems it to

    be a sensible hypothesis that the legitimacy of local knowledge

    will be increasingly recognized and its uptake into local decision-

    making will increase during the process of production of new

    local knowledge about water and related environmental variables

    with engaged community members. The process of identifying

    topics of common interest and speciﬁc questions deemed to be

    of local signiﬁcance is on-going.

    6. CONCLUSIONS AND CHALLENGES

    Despite being an intrinsic part of the scientiﬁc discovery and

    knowledge generation process, the concept and potential of cit-

    izen science in itself only recently received increasing scientiﬁc

    attention. New technological developments are supporting novel

    and more efﬁcient methods for data collection and process-

    ing, visualization and communication. These opportunities make

    reﬂecting upon the challenges and opportunities of citizen sci-

    ence, especially in a context of managing natural resources and

    leveraging them for human well-being, timely and relevant. This

    is particularly the case for water resources, which is often one

    of the most fundamental ecosystem services and a signiﬁcant

    bottleneck for sustainable development and poverty alleviation.

    Our review of technologies reveals a large potential for increasing

    involvement of citizens in data collection because of the availabil-

    ity of inexpensive, robust and highly automated sensors, and the

    possibility to combine them with powerful environmental models

    to create rich and interactive visualization methods. But in order

    to leverage citizen science for water resources management and

    Buytaert et al.

    Citizen science for hydrology

    poverty alleviation, we identify the following major research and

    implementation challenges.

    • Scientists’ perceptions: Although met with enthusiasm in some

    quarters, citizen science is still seen as a rather vague term in

    much of the scientiﬁc community. If value and validity of citi-

    zen science continues to be poorly communicated, such ambi-

    guity has the potential to damage the reputation of researchers,

    and ultimately, discourage innovation. We suggest that, whilst

    it is important to remain optimistic about the potential of citi-

    zen science, limitations need to be reﬂected by setting realistic

    goals that minimize disappointment if projects fail to deliver

    (Riesch and Potter, 2014).

    • Problem deﬁnition: Given the multi-level nature of decision-

    making and conﬂicting interests of managing scarce natural

    resources, there is a need to understand better how resource

    management issues can be deﬁned in a transparent and deliber-

    ative process that favors the inclusion of traditionally marginal-

    ized and resource-poor actors. Even participatory approaches

    have a tendency to introduce bias in the participation process,

    which can only to some extent be used to alleviate (and, if not

    applied properly, may reinforce) this bias.

    • Resource intensity: Despite the potential to distribute the

    effort among multiple actors, citizen science is human-resource

    intense, especially in the need for coordination among actors

    and the need for adequate training and education, and main-

    taining an acceptable level of participation in the project (Gura,

    2013).

    • Technology: While evolving quickly, the technology underpin-

    ning citizen science requires further scientiﬁc effort. Ensuring

    that technological applications are affordable, user friendly,

    reliable, compatible, and versatile will be vital for their uptake

    (Silvertown, 2009; Royem et al., 2012, among others). However,

    the selection of technology, if effective, would contribute to an

    empowerment of local communities to take charge and deliver

    for themselves some solutions to particular needs (Newman

    et al., 2010).

    • Communication and exchange of knowledge: Citizen science

    results need to be presented in a way that little to no tech-

    nical knowledge should be required to enable interpretation

    (Royem et al., 2012). A further consideration is that sharing

    data and opening up to a larger scientiﬁc audience of their

    local environment may cause some apprehension (Seymour

    and Regalado, 2014). Furthermore, communication of results

    needs to be done carefully to avoid making impressions that

    can potentially become a permanent misunderstanding.

    • Legitimacy and polycentric governance: Governance of natu-

    ral resources in general, and water in particular, is inherently

    multi-scalar and poly-centric (Ostrom and Cox, 2010). The

    citizen science concept clearly shows the deﬁciencies of the

    technocratic model of knowledge generation. Therefore, it is

    a useful environment to explore the political—as opposed to a

    technical-neutral—dimension. This requires a decentering and

    different articulation of the scientiﬁc knowledge process within

    the broader social process of co-creation of sufﬁciently shared

    actionable knowledge that becomes the basis of changed actions

    within the management of resources.

    plays a vital role in the economic growth of any country. With the increase of
    population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it
    becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population.
    Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative
    tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism
    that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the
    machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with
    IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next
    agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of
    ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction
    of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction,
    disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision
    are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order
    to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated
    for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing
    eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by
    collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and
    intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour
    to a great extent. This article demonstrates how knowledge-based agriculture can
    improve the sustainable productivity and quality of the product. A graphical abstract

    I. Introduction The population of the world will increase to 9.1 billion approximately
    thirty-four percent as of today by the end of 2050. Food requirement will increase
    by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization, land availability for agriculture
    will decrease drastically in the coming years. India will be the most populated
    country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging the domestic food production.
    The main reason for reduced food production is the lack of planning, unpredictable
    weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation techniques and livestock
    mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced a drastic change
    in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature of the earth
    has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic conditions. Frequent
    droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor farmers. According
    to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse climatic conditions,
    reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture [1], [2] is one of
    the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world [3]. Precision agriculture
    also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled data-driven sustainable
    farm management system. It is basically the adoption of modern information technologies,
    software tools, and smart embedded devices for decision support in agriculture
    [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture and the green revolution are
    the two key components of the first and second agriculture revolution. Precision
    farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution [5]. FIGURE 1.
    Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology in 1990
    for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning system
    (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce the
    production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture
    has been discussed. Performance comparison for various ML, DL algorithms in precision
    farming has been carried out based on the state-of-art literature. Assessment
    of artificial intelligence techniques in precision agriculture is outlined along
    with its statistical and performance analysis. Comparison of performance parameters
    of sensors used in IoT applications in precision agriculture is presented. Integration
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) with IoT and artificial intelligence in precision
    agriculture is discussed. Challenges and future trends of artificial intelligence
    in precision farming are briefly outlined. Table 1 highlights the major differences
    of this review article with other articles published in this field. The paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the impact of artificial intelligence
    (AI) and IoT in the field of agriculture. Section 3 briefly elucidate ML algorithms.

    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: With the recent advancement of the Internet
    of Things (IoT), it is now possible to process a large number of sensor data streams
    using different large-scale IoT platforms. These IoT frameworks are used to collect,
    process and analyse data streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart
    solutions designed to provide decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are
    mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on
    specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry,
    a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather
    conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain,
    while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept
    of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT,
    a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports
    reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT
    can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic
    processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications.
    Agri-IoT supports large-scale data analytics and event detection, ensuring seamless
    interoperability among sensors, services, processes, operations, farmers and other
    relevant actors, including online information sources and linked open datasets
    and streams available on the Web. Published in: 2016 IEEE 3rd World Forum on Internet

    IEEE Conference Location: Reston, VA, USA SECTION I. Introduction The development
    of highly accurate embedded sensors measuring the environmental context inside
    farms has led to the enablement of precision agriculture [1], for improving productivity
    and increasing yields and profitability, reducing the environmental footprint,
    by techniques such as more efficient irrigation, targeted, more precise use of
    fertilizers and pesticides for crops, as well as food and antibiotics for animals.
    Precision agriculture enables the vision of smart farming, which is about real-time
    data gathering, processing and analysis, as well as automation technologies on
    the farming procedures, allowing improvement of the overall farming operations
    and management, and more informed decision-making by the farmers. Farming is highly
    unpredictable, due to its large dependency on weather and environmental conditions
    (e.g. rain, temperature, humidity, hail), unpredictable events (e.g. animal diseases,
    pests), as well as price volatility in agricultural markets. This implies the
    need for large-scale agriculture-related frameworks that harness sensor/automation
    technologies and data analytics, in order to help the farmers become informed
    about their farms'' conditions and risks early enough, in order to take proper
    counter-measures and protect their crops/livestock and overall production. The
    Internet of Things (IoT) [2] is a perfect match for smart farming due to its highly
    interoperable, scalable, pervasive and open nature. Realizing this enormous potential
    of IoT technologies for smart farming, IoT is now gaining momentum in the agricultural
    sector. For example, nowadays it is mandatory for all Australian farmers to affix
    passive RFID ear tags to their cattle and to report movements between farms to
    an online national database [3]. The IoT-based environment is a leap forward for
    the smart farming and has a great potential to revolutionize the traditional farming
    techniques. This can be achieved through IoT frameworks targeting smart farming,
    as such frameworks have been successfully applied in other, relevant domains such
    as smart cities, healthcare and smart homes [4]–[8], bringing seamless connectivity
    and advanced interoperability - by means of open standards (e.g. 6LoWPAN, ZigBee,
    CoAP, ISOBUS, SigFox, REST, MQTT, XMPP) and semantics (e.g. RDF, OWL, SWE, SensorML)
    - among actors, components, devices, processes and platforms. IoT frameworks for
    smart farming can bring various benefits, including reducing the risk of vendor
    lock-in, adopting machinery and sensing/automation systems from different companies,
    as these could become easily interoperable in the overall farm''s smart system,
    easier data exchange among different, heterogeneous components, increased automation
    with less effort by employing internet standards etc. Being motivated by the above
    benefits and potential of IoT applied in smart farming, considering the non-existence
    of complete, reliable, well-established and bulletproof solutions and frameworks
    yet in this area, we propose Agri-IoT as a highly customizable online platform
    for IoT-based innovative data analytic solutions, enabling large-scale data processing,
    analysis and automatic reasoning based on real-time streams of data coming from
    a variety of sources, such as sensory systems, surveillance cameras, hyperspectral
    images from drones [9], online weather forecasting services, social media streams
    for fast identification of events (e.g. hazards, earthquakes, floods), information,
    warning and alerts from governmental organizations, such as the Ministry of Agriculture
    etc. Agri-IoT has the capabilities of combining and analyzing data streams such
    as the aforementioned ones, helping the farmers in more informed decision-making
    in near real-time and fast reaction to changes and unpredictable events. For example,
    combining sensory data about soil fertility (see Section IV-B), together with
    web services for weather forecasting, then better decisions could be made about
    more precise irrigation and fertilization of the crops. In this paper, we explain
    the operation of Agri-IoT (Section III), evaluating its performance by means of
    two demanding smart farming scenarios (Section IV), discussing how IoT frameworks
    could offer new possibilities in the farming industry (Section V). SECTION II.
    Related Work Since IoT frameworks and platforms are still inexistent or immature
    for agriculture, related work involves IoT frameworks in relevant domains, especially
    smart cities. We consider mostly smart city-based IoT frameworks (and not frameworks
    in other domains such as healthcare, smart homes, sports, participatory sensing
    etc.), because the requirements of smart farming are similar to those of urban
    environments: scalability, support of heterogeneous data streams, multiple actors/users,
    real-time analysis and reasoning, decision support and realworld services from
    embedded sensors. Regarding IoT frameworks in the farming sector, the work in
    [10] proposes an architecture of a management information system for intelligent
    agriculture, based on IoT. Although this paper describes an information system
    for smart farming, it does not provide details on integrating with IoT. In order
    to design a truly interoperable IoT-based smart farming ecosystem, semantics of
    information and ontologies describing the relationship between data is required.
    Towards this goal, Taylor et al. [3] use semantic web technologies to define alert
    conditions in the farm, and to publish data in a stream management system. The
    Global Sensor Network (GSN) [11] middleware is employed, while summaries of sensor
    data are translated to RDF, based on the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology
    [12]. The aforementioned works, although promising, are still immature and mostly
    abstract. Focusing on smart cities, we can identify more complete, powerful and
    scalable frameworks, providing better performance and scalability. Such frameworks
    include the ODAA platform [4], providing open data access to IoT data collected
    from the City of Aarhus, and Spitfire [5], which uses semantic technologies to
    provide a uniform way to search, interpret and transform sensory data. IBM Star
    City [6] supports real-time IoT data analytics for event detection pertaining
    to the traffic domain while CityPulse [7] combines a service-oriented approach
    and complex event processing for on-demand discovery and integration of urban
    data streams. Moreover, OpenIoT [13] and IoT-A [14] are software platforms for
    discovering and semantically annotating sensory data streams, and PLAY [8] provides
    an event-driven middleware able to process complex event detection in large heterogeneous
    systems. Although the aforementioned frameworks do provide numerous features and
    services for semantic-based sensory data processing and analysis, they are dedicated
    for urban environments, designed for city-specific event and notification patterns,
    device and service discovery, fault tolerance and reusability. Finally, it is
    worth mentioning the FIWARE platform [15], which provides a powerful set of APIs
    that ease development of smart applications in multiple vertical sectors. Fig.
    1. The Agri-IoT ecosystem layered architecture. Show All Our work is one of the
    first efforts related to effectively bringing the IoT in the agricultural sector,
    in the same direction as [3], [10], considering advancements in smart city frameworks
    [7], [13]–[17], by reusing some of their well-defined software components, proposing
    Agri-IoT as a complete, interoperable, flexible and adaptable, large-scale data
    analytics framework for smart farming based on IoT standards and semantic web
    technologies. SECTION III. Agri-IoT Framework The Agri-IoT data analytics platform
    is illustrated in Figure 1. It is composed of multiple layers, both lower level
    (device, communication planes), intermediate layers (data, data analytics) and
    higher layers (application, end user planes). At each layer, various software
    components perform specific operations, related to data acquisition, modeling,
    analysis or visualization. Since well-defined relevant software components already
    exist, developed in IoT and smart city-related projects [7], [13]–[15], [18]–[21],
    we have focused on reusing those components, instead of re-inventing the wheel,
    according to the particular needs of smart farming, to cover most if not all of
    the smart farming requirements and scenarios as described in introduction. Each
    software component acts as a single entity, with its own open API, which allows
    to provide a flexible distributed architecture, where applications can integrate
    components from different layers based on their specific needs. In this way, components
    become plug and play and can be selectively used according to particular agricultural
    applications'' requirements. Thus, based on the proposed ecosystem depicted in
    Figure 1, we have selected and combined various software components, appropriate
    for the domain of smart agriculture, which constitute the Agri-IoT framework,
    presented in Figure 2. Agri-IoT can integrate, manipulate and process a huge variety
    of cross-domain streaming data sources in a flexible and extensible way, using
    standardized methods for data acquisition following IoT principles, employing
    semantics. A. Main Components The main components of the Agri-IoT framework are
    described below. Fig. 2. Agri-IoT architecture. Show All a) Data Wrapper (source:
    CityPulse) offers a generic way to describe characteristics of sensors using sensory
    metadata, containing general information about the data stream. A semantic annotation
    module enables to annotate the parsed sensory data (see Section III-B). b) Device
    Manager (source: FIWARE IoT Back-end) automatically manages IoT devices, removing
    the need for human operators, providing the necessary tools for autonomic management
    processes to enforce decisions at a later stage. Manages device identity and authorization,
    considers reliability of data streams (e.g. real-time checking if values fall
    into specific limits) and fault recovery. c) Discovery Module (source: FIWARE
    IoT Edge) ensures scalable registration and discovery of IoT devices and services
    in real-time, in a plug and play way. These devices can be either located at the
    same physical space (e.g. inside the farm) or remotely, accessed through the internet/web.
    d) Data Aggregation (source: IoT-A) deals with large volumes of data using time
    series analysis and data compression techniques to reduce the size of raw sensory
    observations delivered by the data wrappers. e) Data Federation (source: CityPulse)
    answers users'' queries, e.g. the amount of fertilizer needed to apply over some
    area. This component first finds relevant streams according to the requirements
    specified in the request. Then, it translates users'' requests into RDF Stream
    Processing (RSP) queries and evaluates the queries to obtain results. As IoT-based
    smart farming involves fast changing data from real-world sensors and online services,
    as well as real-time processing and analytics based on semantics, we argue that
    RSP is an appropriate technology to be employed. RDF-based reasoning is supported
    through CSPARQL [22] and CQELS [23], which are RDF query languages managing continuous
    data streams. f) Event Detection (source: CityPulse) provides tools for processing
    annotated and aggregated data streams to obtain farm events, such as need for
    irrigation, sick animals or pest identification in crops. g) Real-Time Adaptive
    Reasoning (source: CityPulse) takes into account farmer''s preferences and dynamic
    contextual farm-related information (represented by real-time events), in order
    to provide optimal decision support in real-time. Provides reliable, accurate
    and fast decision support to the farmer, based on farm''s conditions as measured
    by the smart sensing technology available. h) External Agent (source: Agri-IoT
    in-house developed) addresses interoperability, device heterogeneity, data handling
    and protocol adaptation. Plays an important role for virtualising objects, services,
    methods and processes, considering user''s identity and authorization. i) Dashboard
    (source: ThingSpeak, freeboard) provides immediate and intuitive visual access
    to the results of processing and analysis of data and events. j) Mobile Apps (source:
    MapYourMeal, FoodLoop) are built on top of the other components, similarly to
    the dashboard, and use their APIs to offer various services to their mobile users,
    either to the farmers for real-time information and fast decision making, or to
    the consumers and transport agents at the sales points for more transparency.
    k) Knowledge Base (source: OpenIoT) provides service metadata for sensor/data
    stream discovery. B. Semantic Annotation To semantically annotate data streams,
    Agri-IoT uses lightweight information models developed on top of well-known models,
    such as the SSN [12] and OWL-S [24] ontologies. Based on these, we describe streams
    coming from sensors deployed inside the farm using the Stream Annotation Ontology1
    and events detected relating to the farm using the Complex Event Ontology2. Related
    to agriculture, AGROVOC [25] and the Agricultural Ontology Service (AOS) [26]
    are popular vocabularies and ontologies. AgOnt [27] is another ontology targeting
    farming, built from agriculture terminologies and lifecycles including seeds,
    grains, transportation, storage and consumption. Through the aforementioned ontologies
    (using AgOnt for the agricultural domain), we semantically describe the sensors''
    real-time data streams, their metadata, the agricultural products they are referring
    to, and possible events occurring at the farm. When the real-time data streams
    are semantically annotated, we can use RDF Stream Processing (RSP) techniques
    (e.g. CSPARQL [22] and CQELS [23]) to easily process heterogeneous data streams.
    Using RSP, one can use SPARQL-like query languages to evaluate query patterns
    over static/dynamic knowledge, facilitating on-demand stream discovery (see Section
    IV-B). Figure 3 shows abstractly the Agri-IoT information model, combining the
    aforementioned ontologies together. SECTION IV. Evaluation To evaluate Agri-IoT,
    we focused on the feasibility of using RSP in agricultural applications. This
    is the most demanding operation on the framework, towards the goal of real-time
    processing, analysis and event identification (see components Data federation
    and Event detection in Section III-A). We used a machine running Debian GNU/Linux
    6.0.10, with 8-cores of 2.13 GHz processor and 64 GB RAM. Two realistic scenarios
    were considered, using CityBench [28] to evaluate the queries'' performance. We
    note that the real potential of IoT is revealed when sensing-based data sources
    become combined with relevant online services, such as weather forecasting, news
    feeds etc. The following scenarios do not involve online services though, as the
    focus is mostly on performance and scalability of the framework in terms of managing
    and analyzing large numbers of data streams coming from any source. Fig. 3. Agri-IoT
    information model. Show All A. Scenario A: Fertility Management of Dairy Cows
    Heat measurement is used in fertility management as an indication of insemination
    timing. Automatic heat detection is a tool to assist producers in better managing
    fertility. In this scenario, we assume the farm has 1,000 cows, each with a wearable
    sensor attached, measuring periodically its heat status, sending the observations
    (annotated with SSN) to a dedicated sensor data stream every second. Listing 1
    shows an example of the semantic annotations for cows and sensors using the Agri-IoT
    information model (see Section III-B). Listing 1. Semantic annotation for a temperature
    sensor attached to a cow Show All Listing 2. Static SPARQL query for relevant
    sensors Show All To monitor cow fertility, farmers need to be notified about the
    heat of cows which are 18 to 30 months old. Listing 2 shows a static SPARQL query
    to find these cows and identify relevant sensor streams. Using the results from
    Listing 2, farmers may deploy dynamic CQELS/CSPARQL queries similar to the query
    shown in Listing 3 to consider in real-time the cows'' fertility potential. To
    evaluate the performance of RSP engines, we deploy different numbers of simultaneous
    queries similar to the one in Listing 3 over CQELS and CSPARQL engines, and observe
    the query latency and memory consumption. Notice that under this experiment setting,
    n queries are deployed over n separate sensor streams. The solid lines in Figures
    4 and 5 show the performance of CQELS and CSPARQL in this scenario using separated
    sensor streams, respectively. Listing 3. CQELS query for temp. monitoring over
    sensor streams Show All The results show that, although CQELS query performance
    has dropped significantly when handling over 700 queries/sensor streams, it is
    in general better at handling multiple queries than CSPARQL, in terms of query
    latency and memory consumption. In our experiment, CSPARQL failed to handle more
    than 500 queries stably, i.e., it may stop producing results when handling a larger
    number of queries. In the experiment above, fertility detection task is actually
    carried out in two steps: a static discovery step to identify relevant streams
    and then a dynamic query step. The use of ontologies improves the interoperability
    for both static and dynamic information. Moreover, by leveraging RSP the static
    discovery process, which is a query on stream metadata, can be integrated within
    the dynamic stream query. Hence, the first step can be skipped and we can evaluate
    the queries directly over a merged sensor stream (i.e. instead of subscribing
    to individual sensor streams, we listen to all sensor updates and merge them into
    a single stream). The merged query is shown in Listing 4, and the latency and
    memory consumption for merged queries are shown as dashed lines in Figures 4 and
    5. Listing 4. Merged CQELS query for temperature monitoring Show All Using a merged
    query reduces system complexity by combining static discovery with dynamic monitoring.
    However, an overhead is introduced by subscribing to all, including irrelevant,
    sensor streams. Moreover, the results in Figure 4 show that CQELS has a much higher
    latency when handling more frequent stream updates for the merged queries, and
    the memory consumption of CQELS is higher for the merged queries when handling
    more than 700 sensors. A possible reason for the decline in performance is the
    synchronization issue of the streaming function in CQELS. On the other hand, CSPARQL
    copes very well with the merged queries. The query latency and memory consumption
    in CSPARQL are almost flat with the increasing number of sensors involved. Fig.
    4. Scenario A: CQELS performance Show All B. Scenario B: Soil Fertility for Crop
    Cultivation Soil fertility is important in order to cultivate vegetables and fruits.
    Soil composition (phosphorus, potassium and magnesium), salinity, and moisture
    levels are indicators for measuring quality and conditions of the soil [29]. Soil
    fertility is an outcome of measuring those parameters3 and it is important in
    order to know when to cultivate, when to irrigate or fertilize as well as how
    to improve the yields. In this scenario, we considered a set of soil sensors measuring
    soil index (for soil composition), salinity and moisture. Let us now assume that
    the farmers are using Agri-IoT to know when it is a good time to cultivate4. The
    query for soil fertility created by Agri-IoT may look like the one shown in Listing
    5. This query is more complicated and expensive than the previous ones, as each
    sensor produces not only one but three different observations each time. As a
    result, more query patterns are required. Also, there are more filters and aggregation
    functions used. This query counts the number of sensors reporting values indicating
    whenever conditions are appropriate for cultivation. If the number is above a
    threshold, e.g., half of the total sensors deployed in the same land (assuming
    a heterogeneous land in edaphological terms), then a notification is delivered
    to the farmers. We deploy queries similar to the one in Listing 5 with different
    number of sensors and different sensor update frequencies and record the query
    latency and memory consumption in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. In this experiment,
    we tested merged queries because of the need of aggregating functions, only showing
    results for CSPARQL, since CQELS was not able to stably handle queries after 10–20
    minutes involving more than 150 sensors. For the same reason, some lines in Figures
    6 and 7 terminate before others, when the engine becomes unstable. In Scenario
    A, we used a time window of 10 seconds and a sensor update frequency of 1.0 Hz.
    Since each sensor update in this scenario contains three observations, we need
    to slow down the update frequency to 1/3 Hz, if we want to keep same number of
    triples in the time window as the first scenario. Considering the fact that soil
    cultivation activity is much less time-sensitive5 than animal fertility management,
    we tested the query performance with sensor frequency from 0.1 Hz to 0.3 Hz. In
    reality, a much lower frequency is likely to be used, for managing cost in energy,
    network etc. The results in Figures 6 and 7 show that higher sensor frequency
    introduces more latency and likelihood of causing unstable states for the CSPARQL
    engine, without significant effect on memory consumption. Fig. 5. Scenario A:
    CSPARQL performance Show All Listing 5. CQELS query for temp. monitoring over
    sensor streams Show All SECTION V. Discussion Findings indicate that Agri-IoT
    offers satisfactory performance even in demanding scenarios with large numbers
    of simultaneous data streams and sensors, and can be used in medium-to-large farms
    (100–300 sensors deployed at the field) for performing real-time stream processing
    and reasoning, based on IoT and semantic web technologies, helping the farmers
    in decision making and fast reactions to events happening. CQELS has performed
    better in terms of query latency and memory consumption, but CSPARQL is more scalable.
    Some limitations of Agri-IoT include dynamicity, autonomy and full adaptability
    to heterogeneity. On-demand discovery, integration and complex event processing
    could become optimized to provide robust real-time analytic solutions over heterogeneous
    data streams originating from agricultural sensors. As future work, we aim to
    address these limitations, making Agri-IoT flexible and adaptable to every farming
    scenario, with true plug and play support of heterogeneous sensors, information
    and solutions. We plan to fully involve semantic web technologies for data integration,
    stream processing and reasoning, including mechanisms of complex event service
    discovery/reusability. We will work on improving RSP performance for concurrent
    queries, high stream rates and large triple window sizes (e.g. by realizing a
    distributed RSP engine), using the experimental results of this paper as baseline.
    Finally, we will focus on improving existing agricultural ontologies and semantic
    models [25]–[27], developing a complete knowledge representation framework in
    the form of linked data for IoT streams, enabling linking of multiple streams
    (e.g. sensors, social networking feeds, weather forecasting etc.), associating
    their descriptions to the domain knowledge. Fig. 6. Scenario B: CSPARQL latency
    Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper, we have described Agri-IoT, an
    IoT-based framework applying real-time stream processing, analysis and reasoning
    in the domain of agriculture, based on semantic web technologies, facilitating
    more informed and accurate decision making by farmers and event detection. We
    have investigated the introduction of IoT in smart farming and its opportunities,
    through the seamless combination of heterogeneous technologies, as well as the
    semantic integration of information from various sources (sensors, social media,
    connected farms, governmental alerts, regulations etc.), ensuring increase of
    production and productivity, better products'' quality, protection of the environment,
    less use of resources (e.g. water, fertilizers), faster reaction to unpredictable
    events and more transparency to the consumer. Agri-IoT achieves this by offering
    interoperability between sensors, processes, data streams, farms as entities and
    web-based services, exploiting open data, making use of semantic technologies
    and linked web data. Our evaluation efforts focusing on two realistic and demanding
    farming scenarios indicate the good performance of the proposed framework in medium-to-large
    farms, while our discussion reveals the large opportunities arising in farming
    by introducing open standards and semantics based on IoT. Fig. 7. Scenario B:

    and tables Abstract Nowadays, wireless sensor network (WSN) applications have
    been used in several important areas, such as healthcare, military, critical infrastructure
    monitoring, environment monitoring, and manufacturing. However, due to the limitations
    of WSNs in terms of memory, energy, computation, communication, and scalability,
    efficient management of the large number of WSNs data in these areas is an important
    issue to deal with. There is a need for a powerful and scalable high-performance
    computing and massive storage infrastructure for real-time processing and storing
    of the WSN data as well as analysis (online and offline) of the processed information
    under context using inherently complex models to extract events of interest. In
    this scenario, cloud computing is becoming a promising technology to provide a
    flexible stack of massive computing, storage, and software services in a scalable
    and virtualized manner at low cost. Therefore, in recent years, Sensor-Cloud infrastructure
    is becoming popular that can provide an open, flexible, and reconfigurable platform
    for several monitoring and controlling applications. In this paper, we present
    a comprehensive study of representative works on Sensor-Cloud infrastructure,
    which will provide general readers an overview of the Sensor-Cloud platform including
    its definition, architecture, and applications. The research challenges, existing
    solutions, and approaches as well as future research directions are also discussed
    in this paper. 1. Introduction The advancement and application of wireless sensor
    networks become an invincible trend into the various industrial, environmental,
    and commercial fields. A typical sensor network may consist of a number of sensor
    nodes acting upon together to monitor a region and fetch data about the surroundings.
    A WSN contains spatially distributed self-regulated sensors that can cooperatively
    monitor the environmental conditions, like sound, temperature, pressure, motion,
    vibration, pollution, and so forth [1, 2]. Each node in a sensor network is loaded
    with a radio transceiver or some other wireless communication device, a small
    microcontroller, and an energy source most often cells/battery. The nodes of sensor
    network have cooperative capabilities, which are usually deployed in a random
    manner. These sensor nodes basically consist of three parts: sensing, processing,
    and communicating [3]. Some of the most common sensor devices deployed in sensor
    network as sensor nodes are camera sensor, accelerometer sensor, thermal sensor,
    microphone sensor, and so forth. Currently, WSNs are being utilized in several
    areas like healthcare, defense such as military target tracking and surveillance
    [4, 5], government and environmental services like natural disaster relief [6],
    hazardous environment exploration, and seismic sensing [7], and so forth. These
    sensors may provide various useful data when they are closely attached to each
    of their respective applications and services directly [8]. However, sensor networks
    have to face many issues and challenges regarding their communications (like short
    communication range, security and privacy, reliability, mobility, etc.) and resources
    (like power considerations, storage capacity, processing capabilities, bandwidth
    availability, etc.). Besides, WSN has its own resource and design constraints.
    Design constraints are application specific and dependent on monitored environment.
    Based on the monitored environment, network size in WSN varies. For monitoring
    a small area, fewer nodes are required to form a network whereas the coverage
    of a very large area requires a huge number of sensor nodes. For monitoring large
    environment, there is limited communication between nodes due to obstructions
    into the environment, which in turn affects the overall network topology (or connectivity)
    [9]. All these limitations on sensor networks would probably impede the service
    performance and quality. In the midst of these issues, the emergence of cloud
    computing is seen as a remedy. Cloud computing has been evolved as the future
    generation''s computing paradigm. The US NIST (National Institute of Standards
    and Technology) defines the concept of Cloud computing as follows: Cloud computing
    is a model for enabling convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool
    of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [5]. Cloud computing allows the systems
    and users to use Platform as a Service (PaaS), for example, Operating Systems
    (OSs), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), for example, storages and servers,
    and Software as a Service (SaaS), for example, application level programs, and
    so forth at a very low cost which are being provided by several cloud providers
    (e.g., example Amazon, Google, and Microsoft) on the basis of pay per use services
    [10]. Cloud computing platform dynamically provisions, configures, and reconfigures
    the servers as and when needed by end users. These servers can be in the form
    of virtual machines or physical machines in the cloud. Cloud computing renders
    the two major trends in IT: (1) efficiency, which is achieved through the highly
    scalable hardware and software resources, and (2) agility, which is achieved through
    parallel batch processing, using computer-intensive business analytics and real-time
    mobile interactive applications that respond to user requirements [11]. The benefits
    of cloud computing are that the end users need not to worry about the exact location
    of servers and switch to their application by connecting to the server on cloud
    and start working without any hassle. Sensor-Cloud infrastructure [12] has been
    evolved and proposed by several IT people in the present days. Sensor-Cloud infrastructure
    is the extended form of cloud computing to manage the sensors which are scattered
    throughout the network (WSN). Due to the increasing demand of sensor network applications
    and their support in cloud computing for a number of services, Sensor-Cloud service
    architecture is introduced as an integration of cloud computing into the WSN to
    innovate a number of other new services. When WSN is integrated with cloud computing
    environment, several shortfalls of WSN like storage capacity of the data collected
    on sensor nodes and processing of these data together would become much easier.
    Since cloud computing provides a vast storage capacity and processing capabilities,
    it enables collecting the huge amount of sensor data by linking the WSN and cloud
    through the gateways on both sides, that is, sensor gateway and cloud gateway.
    Sensor gateway collects information from the sensor nodes of WSN, compresses it,
    and transmits it back to the cloud gateway which in turn decompresses it and stores
    it in the cloud storage server, which is sufficiently large [13]. Sensor-Cloud
    can be used in many real-life applications like environmental monitoring, disaster
    monitoring, telemetric, agriculture, irrigation, healthcare, and so forth. As
    an illustration, we can use the Sensor-Cloud infrastructure for deploying health-related
    applications such as monitoring patients with cardiovascular disease, blood sugar
    followup, sleep activity pattern monitoring, diabetics monitoring, and so forth.
    In traditional approach, the trials of individual''s data like level of blood
    sugar, weight, heart rate, pulse rate, and so forth are reported everyday through
    some telemedicine interface [14]. The patient''s trial information is sent to
    a dedicated server and is stored there for doctors or caregivers to analyze it
    sometime later. This system suffers from a level of adversity when the patient
    randomly moves from its current location, that is, when a patient is “on the go.”
    Thus, a more progressive, rapid, and mobile approach is needed where the recorded
    data from several sensor nodes of a WSN can be processed in pipelined and parallel
    fashion, and thereby to make the system easier to scale and be cost-effective
    in terms of resources available. The pipeline processing of data sets or instructions
    enable the overlapped operations into a conceptual pipe with all the stages of
    pipes processing simultaneously but handling of the sensor data stream is not
    that straight forward and will be dependent on the nature of the algorithm [15].
    The integration of Sensor-Cloud can serve as a remedy in this direction. This
    paper presents a comprehensive survey on Sensor-Cloud. Section 2 of this paper
    provides a brief overview of this concept, including its definition, architecture,
    and its advantage. Section 3 discusses the service life cycle model and layered
    approach of Sensor-Cloud architecture. Section 4 provides the Sensor-Cloud service
    creation and renovation capabilities. Section 5 presents the multiservice provisioning
    on multiple platforms. Section 6 discusses the technical comparison of different
    approaches in sensor-cloud infrastructure. Next, Section 7 presents several issues
    that may arise in Sensor-Cloud and some approaches to address these issues. Finally,
    we summarize and conclude the survey in Section 8. 2. Overview and Related Works
    Sensor-Cloud is a new paradigm for cloud computing that uses the physical sensors
    to accumulate its data and transmit all sensor data into a cloud computing infrastructure.
    Sensor-Cloud handles sensor data efficiently, which is used for many monitoring
    applications. 2.1. What is a Sensor-Cloud? According to IntelliSys, Sensor-Cloud
    can be defined as follows: An infrastructure that allows truly pervasive computation
    using sensors as an interface between physical and cyber worlds, the data-compute
    clusters as the cyber backbone and the internet as the communication medium [16,
    17]. According to MicroStrains''s Sensor-Cloud definition “it is a unique sensor
    data storage, visualization and remote management platform that leverage [sic]
    powerful cloud computing technologies to provide excellent data scalability, rapid
    visualization, and user programmable analysis. It is originally designed to support
    long-term deployments of MicroStrain wireless sensors, Sensor-Cloud now supports
    any web-connected third party device, sensor, or sensor network through a simple
    OpenData API” [18]. A Sensor-Cloud collects and processes information from several
    sensor networks, enables information sharing on big scale, and collaborates with
    the applications on cloud among users. It integrates several networks with a number
    of sensing applications and cloud computing platform by allowing applications
    to be cross-disciplinary that may span over multiple organizations [17]. Sensor-Cloud
    enables users to easily gather, access, process, visualize, analyze, store, share,
    and search for a large number of sensor data from several types of applications
    and by using the computational IT and storage resources of the cloud. In a sensor
    network, the sensors are utilized by their specific application for a special
    purpose, and this application handles both the sensor data and the sensor itself
    such that other applications cannot use this. This makes wastage of valuable sensor
    resources that may be effectively utilized when integrating with other application''s
    infrastructure. To realize this scenario, Sensor-Cloud infrastructure is used
    that enables the sensors to be utilized on an IT infrastructure by virtualizing
    the physical sensor on a cloud computing platform. These virtualized sensors on
    a cloud computing platform are dynamic in nature and hence facilitate automatic
    provisioning of its services as and when required by users [19]. Furthermore,
    users need not to worry about the physical locations of multiple physical sensors
    and the gapping between physical sensors; instead, they can supervise these virtual
    sensors using some standard functions [12]. Within the Sensor-Cloud infrastructure,
    to obtain QoS, the virtual sensors are monitored regularly so users can destroy
    their virtual sensors when they becomes meaningless [20]. A user interface is
    provisioned by this Sensor-Cloud infrastructure for administering, that is, for
    controlling or monitoring the virtual sensors, provisioning and destroying virtual
    sensors, registering and deleting of physical sensors, and for admitting the deleting
    users. For example, in a health monitoring environment, a patient may use a wearable
    computing system (that may include wearable accelerometer sensors, proximity sensors,
    temperature sensors, etc.) like Life Shirt [21] and Smart Shirt [22] or may use
    a handheld device loaded with sensors, and consequently the data captured by the
    sensors may be made accessible to the doctors. But out of these computing systems,
    active continuous monitoring is most demanding, and it involves the patient wearing
    monitoring devices to obtain pervasive coverage without being inputted or intervened
    [23]. However, the diverse monitoring scheme defers in their QoS requirements,
    which are as follows. (1) Patient-Centric Healthcare-QoS refers to monitoring
    delay and reliability of message delivery. (2) Network-Centric Healthcare-QoS
    refers to a number of patients supported and message throughput. (3) Healthcare
    professional-centric Healthcare-QoS refers to cognitive load of healthcare professionals
    and the number of correct medical decisions. Sensor modeling language (SML) [24]
    can be used to represent any physical sensor''s metadata like their type, accuracy,
    their physical location, and so forth. It also uses XML encoding for the measurement
    and description processes of physical sensors. This XML encoding for physical
    sensors enabled these to be implemented across several different hardware, platforms
    (OS), applications, and so forth with relatively less human intervention. To transliterate
    the commands coming from users to virtual sensors and in turn to the commands
    for their pertinent physical sensors, a mapping is done between the physical and
    virtual sensors. 2.2. Architecture of Sensor-Cloud Cloud computing service framework
    delivers the services of shared network through which the users are benefited
    by the services, and they are not concerned with the implementation details of
    the services provided to them. When a user requests, the service instances (e.g.,
    virtual sensors) generated by cloud computing services are automatically provisioned
    to them [12, 19]. Some previous studies on physical sensors focused on routing
    [25], clock synchronization [26], data processing [27], power management [28],
    OS [29], localization [30], and programming [31]. However, few studies concentrate
    on physical sensor management because these physical sensors are bound closely
    to their specific application as well as to its tangible users directly. However,
    users, other than their relevant sensor services, cannot use these physical sensors
    directly when needed. Therefore, these physical sensors should be supervised by
    some special sensor-management schemes. The Sensor-Cloud infrastructure would
    subsidize the sensor system management, which ensures that the data-management
    usability of sensor resources would be fairly improved. There exists no application
    that can make use of every kind of physical sensors at all times; instead, each
    application required pertinent physical sensors for its fulfillment. To realize
    this concept, publish/subscription [32] mechanism is being employed for choosing
    the appropriate physical sensor [33]. In multiple sensor networks, every sensor
    network publishes its sensor data and metadata. The metadata comprises of the
    types, locations, and so forth for the physical sensors. Application either subscribes
    to one or maybe to more sensor networks to retrieve real-time data from the physical
    sensors by allowing each application to opt for the appropriate physical sensors''
    type. The Sensor-Cloud infrastructure procreates virtual sensors from multiple
    physical sensors, which can then be utilized by users. However, prior to availing
    the virtual sensor facility, users should probe first for the physical sensors''
    availability and might also inspect the physical sensors'' faults to maintain
    the data quality emerging from these physical sensors. Also on every sensor node,
    application program senses the application and sends the sensor data back to the
    gateway in the cloud directly through the base station or in multihop manner through
    other nodes [5, 13]. Sensor-Cloud infrastructure provides service instances (virtual
    sensors) automatically to the end users as and when requested, in such a way that
    these virtual sensors are part of their IT resources (like disk storage, CPU,
    memory, etc.) [34]. These service instances and their associated appropriate sensor
    data can be used by the end users via a user interface through the web crawlers
    as described in Figure 1. However, for the service instance generation, the IT
    resources (like CPU, storage devices, etc.), sensor capable devices, and service
    templates (which is used to create virtual sensors) should be prepared first in
    Sensor-Cloud infrastructure. Users make the request for service instances according
    to their needs by selecting an appropriate service template of Sensor-Cloud, which
    will then provide the needed service instances freely and automatically because
    of cloud computing services integration. Once service instances become useless,
    they can then be deleted quickly by users to avoid the utilization charges for
    these resources. Sensor service provider will manage the service templates (ST)
    and it can add or delete the new service template when the required template is
    no longer needed by applications and services [12]. Automation of services played
    a vital role in provisioning of cloud computing services, and automation can cause
    the delivery time of services to be better [19]. Before the emergence of cloud
    computing, services were provided by human influence and the performance metrics
    like efficiency, flexibility, delivery times, and so forth would have experienced
    an adverse effect on the system. However, the cloud computing service model has
    reduced the cost expenses and delivery time and has also improved the efficiency
    and flexibility. Figure 1 Brief overview of Sensor-Cloud architecture. The physical
    sensors are ranked on a basis of their sensor readings as well as on their actual
    distance from an event. The authors of [35] proposed a technique (FIND) to locate
    physical sensors having data faults by assuming a mismatch between the distance
    rank and sensor data rank. However, the study led by FIND aims at the assessment
    of physical sensors faults, and there is a close relation between the virtual
    and physical sensors and hence a virtual sensor will provide incorrect results
    if their relevant physical sensors are faulty. It concludes that the virtual and
    physical sensors cooperate while delivering the sensor data report to its applications,
    and to maintain the best report both the virtual and physical sensors should be
    faultless. Since the cloud computing enables the physical sensors to be virtualized,
    the users of the Sensor-Cloud infrastructure need not to worry about the status
    of their connected physical sensors (i.e., whether a fault free or not). However,
    they should concern only with the status of their virtual sensors provided only
    when the users are not concerned with the accurate results. To achieve accurate
    results, users must be concerned about the status of physical sensors too. In
    a Sensor-Cloud infrastructure, sensors owners are free to register or unregister
    their physical sensors and can join this infrastructure. These IT resources (physical
    sensors, database servers, processors, etc.) and sensor devices are then prepared
    to become operational. After that, templates are created for generating the service
    instances (virtual sensors) and its groups (virtual sensors). Once templates are
    prepared, the virtual sensors are able to share the related and contiguous physical
    sensors to receive quality sensor data. Users then request these virtual sensors
    by choosing the appropriate service templates, use their service instances (virtual
    sensors) after being provisioned, and discharge them when became useless [12].
    2.3. Advantages of Sensor-Cloud Cloud computing is very encouraging solution for
    Sensor-Cloud infrastructure due to several reasons like the agility, reliability,
    portability, real-time, flexibility, and so forth. Structural health and environment-based
    monitoring contains highly sensitive data and applications of these types cannot
    be handled by normal data tools available in terms of data scalability, performance,
    programmability, or accessibility. So a better infrastructure is needed that may
    contain tools to cope with these highly sensitive applications in real time. In
    the following, we describe the several advantages and benefits of Sensor-Cloud
    infrastructure that may be the cause of its glory, and these are as follows. (1)
    Analysis. The integration of huge accumulated sensor data from several sensor
    networks and the cloud computing model make it attractive for various kinds of
    analyses required by users through provisioning of the scalable processing power
    [34]. (2) Scalability. Sensor-Cloud enables the earlier sensor networks to scale
    on very large size because of the large routing architecture of cloud [16]. It
    means that as the need for resources increases, organizations can scale or add
    the extra services from cloud computing vendors without having to invest heavily
    for these additional hardware resources [36]. (3) Collaboration. Sensor-Cloud
    enables the huge sensor data to be shared by different groups of consumers through
    collaboration of various physical sensor networks [16]. It eases the collaboration
    among several users and applications for huge data sharing on the cloud. (4) Visualization.
    Sensor-Cloud platform provide a visualization API to be used for representing
    the diagrams with the stored and retrieved sensor data from several device assets.
    Through the visualization tools, users can predict the possible future trends
    that have to be incurred [37]. (5) Free Provisioning of Increased Data storage
    and Processing Power. It provides free data storage and organizations may put
    their data rather than putting onto private computer systems without hassle. It
    provides enormous processing facility and storage resources to handle data of
    large-scale applications [16, 38]. (6) Dynamic Provisioning of Services. Users
    of Sensor-Cloud can access their relevant information from wherever they want
    and whenever they need rather than being stick to their desks [38]. (7) Multitenancy.
    The number of services from several service providers can be integrated easily
    through cloud and Internet for numerous service innovations to meet user''s demand
    [17]. Sensor-Cloud allows the accessibility to several numbers of data centers
    placed anywhere on the network world [36]. (8) Automation. Automation played a
    vital role in provisioning of Sensor-Cloud computing services. Automation of services
    improved the delivery time to a great extent [19]. (9) Flexibility. Sensor-Cloud
    provides more flexibility to its users than the past computing methods. It provides
    flexibility to use random applications in any number of times and allows sharing
    of sensor resources under flexible usage environment [16]. (10) Agility of Services.
    Sensor-Cloud provides agile services and the users can provision the expensive
    technological infrastructure resources with less cost [37]. The integration of
    wireless sensor networks with cloud allows the high-speed processing of data using
    immense processing capability of cloud. (11) Resource Optimization. Sensor-Cloud
    infrastructure enables the resource optimization by allowing the sharing of resources
    for several number of applications [37]. The integration of sensors with cloud
    enables gradual reduction of resource cost and achieves higher gains of services.
    With Sensor-Cloud, both the small and midsized organizations can benefit from
    an enormous resource infrastructure without having to involve and administer it
    directly [36]. (12) Quick Response Time. The integration of WSN''s with cloud
    provides a very quick response to the user, that is, in real-time due to the large
    routing architecture of cloud [39]. The quick response time of data feeds from
    several sensor networks or devices allows users to make critical decisions in
    near real time. 3. Sensor-Cloud Service Life-Cycle Model and Its Layered Structure
    The service life-cycle model and the layered structure of Sensor-Cloud infrastructures
    are illustrated in the following. 3.1. Service Life Cycle Model of Sensor-Cloud
    Before creating the service instances within Sensor-Cloud infrastructure, preparation
    phase [12] is needed, and this includes the following. (1) Preparing the IT resources
    (processors, storage, disk, memory etc.). (2) Preparing the physical sensor devices.
    (3) Preparing the service templates. Figure 2 depicts the Sensor-Cloud service
    life cycle. The users of the sensors can select the appropriate service template
    and request the required service instances. These service instances are provided
    automatically and freely to the users, which can then be deleted quickly when
    they become useless. From a single service template, multiple numbers of service
    instances can be created. Service provider regulates the service templates and
    can add new service templates as and when required by a different number of users
    [8]. Figure 2 Demonstration of Sensor-Cloud life cycle development phases. 3.2.
    Layered Structure of Sensor-Cloud Figure 3 depicts the layered architecture of
    the Sensor-Cloud platform, which is divided mainly into three layers: (1) user
    and application layers, (2) Sensor-Cloud and virtualization layers, (3) template
    creation and tangible sensors layers [8]. Figure 3 Layered structure of Sensor-Cloud
    model. Layer 1. This layer deals with the users and their relevant applications.
    Several users want to access the valuable sensor data from different OS platforms,
    such as mobile phones OS, Windows OS, or Mac OS for a variety of applications.
    This structure allows users of different platforms to access and utilize the sensor
    data without facing any problem because of the high availability of cloud infrastructure
    and storage. Layer 2. This layer deals with virtualization of the physical sensors
    and resources in the cloud. The virtualization enables the provisioning of cloud-based
    sensor services and other IT resources remotely to the end-user without being
    worried about the sensors exact locations. The virtualized sensors are created
    by using the service templates automatically. Service templates are prepared by
    the service providers as service catalog, and this catalog enables the creation
    of service instances automatically that are accessed by multiple users [8, 19].
    Layer 3. This is the last layer which deals with the service template creation
    and service catalog definition layers in forming catalog menu. Physical sensors
    are located and retrieved from this layer. Since each physical sensor has its
    own control and data collection mechanism, standard mechanisms are defined and
    used to access sensors without concerning the differences among various physical
    sensors [12]. Standard functions are defined to access the virtual sensors by
    the users. In Layer 2, Sensor-Cloud infrastructure translates standard functions
    of virtual sensors into some specific functions for diverse physical sensors in
    Layer 3. Physical sensors are XML encoded that enable the services provided through
    these sensors to be utilized on various platforms without being worried to convert
    them onto several platforms [8]. Sensor-Cloud provides a web-based aggregation
    platform for sensor data that is flexible enough to help in developing user-based
    applications. It allows users quick development and deployment of data processing
    applications and gives programming language flexibility in accordance to their
    needs [18]. 4. Service Creation and Innovation Capabilities Sensors are very limited
    and specific to their applications or services when they are linked to a typical
    sensor network. Therefore, the numbers of organizations that can provide the sensor
    services are very limited. However, when the services of sensors move onto the
    cloud, it is possible to include them to realize a variety of applications [8,
    12]. A number of services can be provided to the users for different applications
    such as health applications, environmental monitoring, industrial tasks (e.g.,
    refining), surveillance, senior residents monitoring, or even the applications
    that monitor the vibration in buildings during an earthquake. In the Sensor-Cloud
    infrastructure, the sensors and service templates are constructed as catalog menu
    service on the cloud, and the requesters can create new sensor services with the
    existing sensors in these service instances. For example, service requester can
    create a sensor service to analyze the impact of earthquake to each floor or room
    of the rehabilitation center or hospital, and at the same time it can also create
    sensor services to support older residents with the same set of sensors (virtualized
    sensors). This service will then help the caregiver to shift the older adults
    one by one into a safe place. Using the identical sensor services for healthcare,
    another service requester can create dissimilar sensor service to track the patient''s
    medicine intake and then to analyze the effectiveness of pills through the use
    of some selected healthcare sensors. Thus, the service requesters can be provided
    with new services using the same set of sensors on cloud service platforms. This
    will reduce the cost for resource usage and could have numerous elastic merits
    to it. In this section, several existing Sensor-Cloud applications are described.
    4.1. Existing Sensor-Cloud Applications There exist a number of services based
    on Sensor-Cloud infrastructure to store and process the sensor-based information.
    Few of them are described briefly as below. 4.1.1. Nimbits Nimbit [40] is a free
    and social service that is used to record and share sensor data on cloud. It is
    a cloud-based data processing service and is an open-source platform for the IoT
    (Internet of Things). We can feed the versatile numeric, text-based, JSON, GPS,
    or XML values by creating a data point in the cloud. The data points can be connected
    to Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) process control, spreadsheets, diagrams, websites,
    and more. Data points can also be configured to generate alerts data-relay to
    social networks and to perform calculations. Nimbits also provide an alert management
    mechanism, data compression mechanism, and data calculation on received sensor
    data by employing some simple mathematical formulas. 4.1.2. Pachube Platform Pachube
    [41] is one of the first online database service providers, which allows us to
    connect sensor data to the web. It is a real-time cloud-based platform for IoT
    with a scalable infrastructure that enables us to configure IoT products and services,
    store, share, and discover real-time energy, environment, and healthcare sensor
    data from devices and buildings around us. Pachube has a very interactive website
    for managing the sensor data and an open easily-accessible API. Pachube system
    provides free usage and has several numbers of interfaces for producing a sensor
    or mobile-based applications for managing the sensor data within a cloud framework
    anytime. 4.1.3. IDigi iDigi [42] is a machine-to-machine (M2M) platform as a service
    PaaS that minimizes the barriers to build scalable, secure, and cost-effective
    solutions, which can bind the enterprise applications and device assets together.
    iDigi eases the connectivity of remote assets devices and provides all the tools
    to manage, store, connect, and move the information across the enterprise irrespective
    of its reache. To simplify the remote device connectivity and integration, it
    uses connector software called iDigi Dia. Regardless of the network location,
    iDigi platform manages communication between remote device assets and enterprise
    applications. 4.1.4. ThingSpeak ThingSpeak [43] is another open source IoT application
    and has an open API to store and retrieve data from device assets or things via
    LAN or using HTTP over the Internet. With this platform, location tracking applications,
    sensor logging applications, and social network of device assets with proper update
    of its status can be created. ThingSpeak allows numeric data processing like averaging,
    time-scaling, rounding, median, summing, and so forth to store and retrieve the
    numeric and alphanumeric data. ThingSpeak application features a JavaScript-based
    charts, read/write API key management, and a time-zone management. Although the
    above services are able to visualize the sensor data and sensor-driven information,
    they are lacking secure access to data and interface availability for linking
    the external or mobile applications for further processing. It means that most
    of these aforementioned projects do not address the issues of data management
    and interoperability issues caused by heterogeneous data resources found in the
    present modern environmental tracking or electronic healthcare systems. But introducing
    these aforementioned works with Cloud computing infrastructure may overcome the
    issues related to heterogeneous data access and data management functionality
    [37]. 4.2. Emerging Sensor-Cloud Applications There are many other applications
    that are emerging based on the Sensor-Cloud infrastructure, which can be summarized
    as follows. 4.2.1. Ubiquitous Healthcare Monitoring Sensor-Clouds can be used
    for health monitoring by using a number of easily available and most often wearable
    sensors like accelerometer sensors, proximity, ambient light and temperature sensors,
    and so forth to collect patient''s health-related data for tracking sleep activity
    pattern, blood sugar, body temperature, and other respiratory conditions [44].
    These wearable sensor devices must have support of BWI (Bluetooth''s wireless
    interface), UWB (Ultra wideband), and so forth interface for streaming of data
    and are connected wirelessly to any smartphone through this interface. These smart
    phone devices pretend to function like a gateway between the remote server and
    sensor through the Internet, maybe GPRS/Wi-Fi, or other sort of gateways. To transform
    this system into services-based structure, web-services-based interfaces are used
    by smart phone device to connect to the server [45]. The system prototype should
    have made to be robust, mobile, and scalable. Robust in the sense means that it
    should recover itself from circumstances, which may lack connectivity issues due
    to power (i.e., battery), failure, or gateway cutoff to patient''s wearable devices
    [46]. Mobile in the sense means that it should be capable of tracking signals
    into heterogeneous environments; that is, it must catch the signals irrespective
    of whether the patient went outside or still resided into the hospital/building.
    It should be scalable so that it could be deployed easily for several users concurrently
    without affecting the performance metrics. Finally, such prototype system should
    be retargetable and extensible in nature. Retargetable refers to the fact that
    it can handle various displays with distinct form factors and screen resolution.
    It means that the same health applications can be displayed to any smartphone
    display like PDA (personal digital assistant) or to a bigger console device in
    a hospital where doctors, helpers, or nurses may track the acquired data or processed
    information from distance. The extensibility aspect requires that if any newer
    sensing devices are introduced into the system for acquiring the patient''s health-based
    information, the system should function efficiently and conveniently without affecting
    backend server of the services [47]. In this platform, context awareness can be
    achieved that can direct us to derive a better level of emergency services to
    the patient [20]. The information regarding recent operational laboratories, missing
    doses of pills, number of handicaps, and other situations would be helpful in
    health monitoring. The system should not adhere to any changes made into the operating
    system or intermediate components of sensing devices and is designed in such a
    way that it would cause minimal disturbance to services provided to existing end
    users of the system [15]. The whole scenario for monitoring the healthcare department
    sensors is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 Sensor-Cloud implementation in healthcare.
    In this scenario, several numbers of sensors pick up the patient data, and these
    accumulated data are uploaded to a server on cloud. If any noise data is found,
    they are filtered using some filtering mechanism on a server. The doctors/health
    employees, nurses, and others can then access the patients'' data on cloud through
    a web service portal after being authenticated/permitted by the patient. 4.2.2.
    Environmental Monitoring for Emergency/Disaster Detection In environmental applications,
    it is possible to detect the earthquake and volcano explosion before its eruption
    by continuously monitoring them through the use of several numbers of different
    sensors like strain, temperature, light, image, sound, acceleration, barometer
    sensors, and so forth through the use of wireless sensor networks [48]. Through
    the Sensor-Cloud infrastructure, the sensor instances engaged in environmental
    monitoring can be used in parallel with several other sensor instances, for example,
    by the healthcare department to avoid any future casualty, or with crop harvesting
    application services to avoid the damage caused by bad weather condition. 4.2.3.
    Telematics Sensor-Clouds can be used for telematics, meant to deploy the long
    distance transmission of our computerized or information to a system in continuum.
    It enables the smooth communication between system and devices without any intervention
    [17]. 4.2.4. Google Health It is a centralization service of Google that provides
    personal health information [49] and serves as cloud health data storages. Google
    users are allowed to monitor their health records by logging into their accounts
    at collaborated cloud health service providers into the Google health system.
    However, in a recent declaration Google has announced the discontinuation of this
    health service. 4.2.5. Microsoft HealthVault This cloud platform is developed
    by Microsoft to store and maintain health and fitness-related information [50].
    HealthVault helps users to store, gather, and share their health relevant information
    and its data can be acquired from several pharmacies, cloud providers, health
    employees, health labs, equipment, and from the users itself. 4.2.6. Agriculture
    and Irrigation Control (Field Server Sensors) Sensor-Cloud can be used in the
    field of agriculture to monitor the crop fields in order to upkeep it. For this,
    a field server is developed that comprises of a camera sensors, air sensor, temperature
    sensor, CO 2 concentration sensor, soil moisture and temperature sensors, and
    so forth. These sensors continuously upload the field data via Wi-Fi access point
    to the field owner to track the health of their crops [51]. This can also be used
    for harvesting. 4.2.7. Earth Observation A sensor grid is developed for data gathering
    from several GPS stations, to process, analyze, manage, and visualize the GPS
    data [52]. This GPS data would then be uploaded onto the cloud for efficient monitoring,
    early warning, and decision-making capability for critical situations like the
    volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, and so forth to the users
    all around the world. 4.2.8. Transportation and Vehicular Traffic Applications
    Sensor-Cloud can be used to provide an efficient, stable, equilibrium, and sustainable
    tracking system. Earlier existing technologies like GPS navigation can only track
    the status and current location of vehicle. On the other hand, when vehicle monitoring
    is implemented using cloud computing, it is possible to incorporate centralized
    web service, GPS and GSM enabled devices, and embedded device with sensors [36],
    which will provide the following benefits: (i) to identify the current name of
    the location, (ii) to predict the time of arrival, (iii) to find status of driver
    via alcohol breath sensor, (iv) to find the total distance covered, (v) to track
    the level of fuel. All the data fetched are stored onto some centralized server
    that will be resided into the cloud. The vehicle owner can access this data on
    cloud via web portal and can retrieve all data on cloud in real time to visualize
    the vehicle information. 4.2.9. Tunnel Monitoring WSN can be used to implement
    the distributed sensing of light levels inside the tunnel and under-bridges to
    provide necessary input information for adapting light functionality. This tunnel
    information can be put onto the cloud and is used to monitor the light intensity
    in real time to avoid the automobile users (drivers) casualty and to save the
    energy spent unnecessarily for lightening throughout the day [53]. 4.2.10. Wildlife
    Monitoring Sensor-Cloud can also be used for tracking the wildlife sanctuaries,
    forests, and so forth to regularly monitor the endangered species in real time.
    5. Multiservice Provisioning on Multiple Platforms Integrating the WSN into heterogeneous
    networks is a typical task. The reason behind this is the absence of standardized
    data exchange functions, which may support the participating subnetworks of heterogeneous
    network. Using XML in sensor networks encourages the interchangeability of different
    types of sensors and systems. The lower part of Figure 5 deals with the XML [24]
    encoded physical sensors. The XML encoding defines some set of rules for these
    physical sensors such that it will be both human readable and machine readable
    with less intervention and will enable these to be implemented on several numbers
    of different platforms. XML enables documents to give physical sensor''s metadata,
    that is, the type of the physical sensors, its specifications, the accuracy or
    intensity of these physical sensors, the exact location, and so forth. But sensor
    nodes have limited storage and power constraints, and conflict may occur while
    using the XML encoding. For this reason, the XML support should be based on efficient
    data binding techniques to preserve the time, space, and energy by minimizing
    the XML overhead [34]. This whole scenario can be depicted by Figure 5. Figure
    5 XML encoded physical sensors into the Sensor-Cloud. The author in [54] has proposed
    to access the sensor information by using the Web Service Description Language
    (WSDL) and structure data, so that the multiple applications may access sensor
    information. But the key issue in using the web services on sensor nodes is energy
    and bandwidth overhead of structured data formats used in the web services [34].
    In heterogeneous sensor networks, integration is a complex task because there
    is an absence of standardized data exchange format between the heterogeneous systems
    and networks. XML has evolved to overcome this insufficiency by providing a standard
    data exchange format between heterogeneous network and systems. Because of the
    limited hardware resources within sensor networks, XML usage was not fully introduced
    earlier. But now XML usage in sensor networks is made applicable by introducing
    the XML template objects in an optimized manner [55]. XML is basically a key feature
    towards the service-oriented sensor networks and a proper medium to support complex
    data management and heterogeneous sensor networks. To enable the applications
    to communicate with each other and to provide remote access to the services offered
    by Sensor-Cloud platform, web services are introduced [37]. Web services mainly
    refers to access the services over Internet connection. It has WSDL (Web Service
    Description Language) definitions, which describe what the web service can do,
    how a web service can be used by client applications, and where the web service
    is located. SOAP messages are used to communicate with web services, and these
    SOAP messages are XML based that are transported over the Internet protocols like
    SMTP, FTP, and HTTP. 6. Comparison of Different Approaches in Sensor-Cloud Infrastructure
    In this section, we first present the advantages and disadvantages of Sensor-Cloud
    infrastructure in terms of agility, reliability, portability, real-time, and flexibility.
    Next, we provide a technical comparison of different messaging approaches and
    algorithms used in several existing research on Sensor-Cloud. Pros of Sensor-Cloud
    Infrastructure: (i) Service requesters or end users can control the service instances
    freely [12]. (ii) End users can inspect the status of their relevant virtual sensors.
    (iii) Service requesters can use the virtual sensors without worrying about the
    implementations detail [12]. (iv) The client/users need not to worry about the
    exact locations and detailed description of their sensors [45]. (v) The service
    instances are automatically provisioned whenever a request is made [19]. (vi)
    The IT resources and sensors are released as and when the required job is over,
    which means that users can delete them when they become nonuseful. (vii) Usage
    of physical sensors can be tracked by the sensor owner. (viii) Sensor data are
    available all the time for a number of various applications until the connection
    is provided [12]. (ix) The Sensor-Cloud architecture provides an extensible, open,
    interoperable, and intelligent sensor network for service provisioning in health
    care [56]. (x) The cost of IT resources and WSN infrastructure is reduced when
    integrating with Internet/Cloud [57]. (xi) End users can also create the sensors
    group dynamically in the form of virtual-sensor groups to innovate the new services
    [12]. Besides these advantages, the Sensor-Cloud infrastructure also has some
    drawbacks and these are as follow. Cons of Sensor-Cloud Infrastructure: (i) The
    IT resources and physical sensors should be prepared prior to operation of the
    Sensor-Cloud infrastructure [8]. (ii) The Sensor-Cloud infrastructure will not
    provide much accurate data as in the case of direct sharing of physical sensors
    data [12]. (iii) Sensor-Cloud infrastructure is vulnerable and more prone to sophisticated
    distributed intrusion attacks like DDOS (distribute denial of service) and XSS
    (cross-site scripting) [58]. (iv) A continuous data connectivity is needed between
    end users and Sensor-Cloud server [15]. Because of continuous processing and wireless
    transmission, power is another factor that has to be dealt with carefully in CSI
    [45]. We now highlight the differences among the existing works on Sensor-Cloud
    in terms of message passing protocols, data caching, QoS routing, processing,
    event matching, and other algorithms, as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Technical comparison
    of different messaging approaches and algorithms being used in several papers
    of Sensor-Cloud. Papers Using traditional SOAP messages Using SPWS messages Using

    Designing Sensor-Cloud Infrastructure in Several Applications There are several
    issues like designing, engineering, reliable connection, continuous data flow,
    power issues, and so forth that need to be handled while proposing Sensor-Cloud
    infrastructure for health care and other different applications [68]. Some of
    the main issues are as follows. 7.1. Design Issues There are several issues while
    designing the system in real scenario like nursing home, health care, hospitals,
    and so forth, which require fault-tolerant and reliable continuous transfer of
    data from sensor devices to the server. For example, in a private health care,
    the patient may be out of coverage area from the smart-phone gateway because of
    patients coming in and out frequently. This scenario would be more prone to connection
    failure between the server and smart phone (or any other display device, like
    PDA) and thus this scenario must be considered while designing such system in
    order to avoid accumulation of errors [15, 69]. 7.2. Storage Issues Some engineering
    issues like storage of data at server side and transferring data from phone to
    server must have to be considered. To tackle this, timestamps are sent with each
    data packet to assist in reconstruction of data on the server side. Most of the
    data processing is done at server end so the system must be designed to avoid
    the bursty processing due to multiple users connected simultaneously to the system.
    The system must be designed to accommodate multiple users to connect at the same
    time [15]. Storage issues can be tackled with the introduction of predictive storage
    concept proposed by the authors in [70]. This concept of storage keeps it easily
    fit to the correlated behavior of the physical environment and builds an architecture
    that focuses the sensor data archival at some remote sensors of Sensor-Cloud infrastructure.
    It also uses predictive caching at proxies. 7.3. Authorization Issues A web-based
    user interface is used for doctors, patients, helpers, care-givers, and so forth
    to inspect and analyze the patients'' health-related results remotely. Therefore,
    the system should offer different authorization roles for different types of users
    and authenticated via this web interface. This will enable the privacy to some
    extent by allowing the care givers to restrict them to the patients that he/she
    will take care of. 7.4. Power (Battery) Issues While using smart phone as a gateway,
    power (battery) is the main issue that has to be taken care of because the continuous
    processing and wireless transmission would drain out the mobile battery within
    few hours or days. Thus, it is important to tackle power issues while connecting
    mobile phone gateway with the Sensor-Cloud infrastructure [45]. 7.5. Event Processing
    and Management Sensor-Cloud has to cope with very complex event processing and
    management issues [16, 17], such as the following. (i) How the events have to
    be synchronized that may come from different sources in different time because
    of delays in network? (ii) How the event processing rules have to be changed without
    affecting the system? (iii) How the messages and events of varying types are supported?
    (iv) How to support the enormous numbers of events and its conditions in an optimal
    way? (v) How can we recognize the context (i.e., spatial, temporal, semantic)
    to its relevant situation detection? 7.6. Service Level Agreement (SLA) Violation
    Consumers dependency on cloud providers for their applications'' computing needs
    (i.e. their processing, storage, and analysis of enormous sensor data) on demand
    may require a specific Quality of Service (QoS) to be maintained. But if cloud
    providers are unable to provide QoS on user''s demand even in the case of processing
    huge sensor data in critical environmental situations, it would result in SLA
    violation and cloud provider must be responsible for that. So, we need a reliable
    dynamic collaboration among cloud providers. But opting for the best combination
    of cloud providers in dynamic collaboration is a big challenge in terms of cost,
    time, and discrepancy between providers and QoS [38]. 7.7. Need for Efficient
    Information Dissemination In Sensor-Cloud an efficient information dissemination
    mechanism is needed that can match the published events or sensor data to appropriate
    user''s applications. But there are some issues like maintaining flexibility in
    providing a powerful subscription schema, which may capture information about
    events, guaranteeing the scalability with respect to a number of subscribers and
    published events or sensor data [38]. Since the data sets and their relevant access
    services are distributed geographically, the allocation of data storage and dissemination
    becomes critical challenges. 7.8. Security and Privacy Support Issues There are
    fewer standards available to ensure the integrity of the data in response to change
    due to authorized transactions. The consumers need to know whether his/her data
    at cloud center is well encrypted or who supervises the encryption/decryption
    keys (i.e., the cloud vendor or customer himself). Private health data may become
    public due to fallacy or inaccuracy; that is, consumer''s privacy may be lost
    into cloud and sensor data or information uploaded into clouds may not be supervised
    correctly by user. The US WellPoint disclosed that 130,000 records of its consumers
    had leaked out and become available publicly over the Internet. So better privacy
    policies are the demand of the time that can offer the services themselves while
    maintaining the privacy [37, 38]. 7.9. Real-Time Multimedia Content Processing
    and Massive Scaling Usage of large amount of multimedia data and information in
    real time and its mining is a big challenge in the integration of heterogeneous
    and massive data sources with cloud. To classify this real-time multimedia information
    and contents such that it may trigger the relevant services and assist the user
    in his current location is also a big challenge to be handled [16]. 7.10. Collective
    Intelligence Harvesting The heterogeneous real-time sensor data feed enhances
    the decision-making capability by using the appropriate data and decision level
    fusion mechanisms. But maximization of intelligence developed from the massively
    collocated information in cloud is still a very big challenge [16]. 7.11. Energy
    Efficiency Issues The basic disadvantages of a WSN and cloud computing are almost
    the same, and energy efficiency of sensor nodes is lost due to the limited storage
    and processing capacity of nodes. The authors of [37] have proposed a system for
    health monitoring using the textile sensors, which work much better and give more
    accurate results. These textile sensors can be easily sewed and are even washable.
    Although the proposed system of textile sensors is performing well in the majority
    of aspects, the battery can last only 24 hours after continuous monitoring and
    data transmitting regarding user''s heartbeat rate, movement, respiratory conditions,
    and so forth. The gathered accumulated data can then be visualized in charts using
    some web applications and the results are received at user end through an alert
    message remotely on user''s smartphone. But in order to extend system independency,
    energy efficiency of such systems (textile sensors and microcontroller based)
    is a primary issue that has to be handled. Data caching mechanism [71] can be
    used to reuse bygone sensor data for applications that are tolerant to time, for
    example, an application related to variant room temperature. If this bygone sensor
    data is used to satisfy the various requests for a common sensor data, the energy
    consumption will be reduced [11]. Still more work is needed to overcome the energy
    consumption. To improve the energy efficiency and memory usage in a Sensor-Cloud
    infrastructure, there should be a middleware which can tackle the adverse situation
    in case of continuous and long-duration monitoring of data. This can be done through
    the gateway that is acting as a middleware and collects the huge sensor data from
    sensor nodes [13]. This middleware should be able to compress the sensor data
    to avoid the transmission load and then transmits it back to the gateway acting
    as a middleware on cloud side which in turn decompresses and stores it there.
    When the transmission overload reduces, the energy consumption of sensor nodes
    improves automatically due to less processing. 7.12. Bandwidth Limitation Bandwidth
    limitation is one of the current big challenges that has to be handled in Sensor-Cloud
    system when the number of sensor devices and their cloud users increases dramatically
    [71]. However, there are a number of optimal and efficient bandwidth allocation
    methods proposed, but to manage the bandwidth allocation with such a gigantic
    infrastructure consisting of huge device assets and cloud users, the task of allocating
    bandwidth to every devices and users becomes very difficult. 7.13. Network Access
    Management There are various numbers of networks to deal with in Sensor-Cloud
    architecture applications. So a proper and efficient access management scheme
    for these networks is needed because this will optimize the bandwidth usage and
    improve link performance [72]. 7.14. Pricing Issues Access to the services of
    Sensor-Cloud involves both the sensor-service provider (SSP) and cloud-service
    provider (CSP). However, both SSPs and CSPs have different customer''s management,
    services management, and modes and methods of payments and pricing. So all this
    together will lead to a number of issues [10] such as (i) how to set the price?
    (ii) how the payment is to be made? (iii) how the price is be distributed among
    different entities? The growing demand for controlling and monitoring the environment
    and its applications results in the growth of a large number of devices while
    the cost of deployment and connecting them to heterogeneous network continues
    to drop. However, the interfaces, protocols, connections, and so forth increase
    at exponential rate, thereby making it difficult and expensive for information
    technology (IT) people to integrate the devices (sensor devices) into the cloud
    world. To eradicate the complexity and cost associated with integrating the sensors
    into cloud or any highly distributed system, the authors of [34] proposed emerging
    and existing standards from both domains, for example, embedded sensor and IT
    domains within a service-oriented sensor architecture (SOSA). The authors in [34]
    extend the service oriented paradigm to a sensor network and use the service oriented
    process parameter (like profiling sensors for web services), which helps in intelligence
    integration into the Internet. This solution when extended to Sensor-Cloud would
    result in high availability and reliability. It was found that the energy consumption
    of sensor nodes reduced drastically when the data exchange is done among sensors
    into a heterogeneous network with gateway through the SPWS (sensor profiles for
    web services) as compared to traditional SOAP messages. It has been observed also
    that the cost of memory usage in sensor nodes remains constant with SPWS whereas
    it is increased with SOAP messages. The entity which is most responsible for the
    cost of Sensor-Cloud service model is the message exchanged among sensors into
    a heterogeneous network environment. Using SPWS, power consumption of sensor nodes
    as well as the memory usages in sensor nodes are reduced drastically. In the Sensor-Cloud
    infrastructure, the cost of communication among sensors is more than the processing
    cost. Hence the reduction in power consumption and memory usage leads to less
    communication cost which also enables an energy efficient model of Sensor-Cloud.
    7.15. Interface Standardization Issues Web interfaces currently provide the interface
    among Sensor-Cloud users (may be smartphone users) and cloud. But web interface
    may cause overhead because the web interfaces are not specifically designed for
    smart phones or mobile devices. Also, there would be compatibility issues for
    web interface among devices and in this case signaling, standard protocol, and
    interface for interacting between Sensor-Cloud users and the cloud would require
    seamless services for implementation. Thus, interoperability would be a big issue
    when the Sensor-Cloud users need to access the services with cloud [10]. 7.16.
    Maintenance Issues In order to keep the end users'' loyalty, the cloud should
    cope with the service failure [73]. For this a regular maintenance is needed and
    redundancy techniques should be implemented to ensure the smooth and continuous
    flow of services. This can be done by backing up the data regularly and by distributing
    their multiple data centers geographically across the world. 7.17. Resource and
    Hardware Compatibility Issues Hardware compatibility as well as software compatibility
    both can be solved in cloud computing environment by allowing the sharing of hardware
    or software resources or services [5], but there may be the case when sensor or
    some other resources being used are lost due to some calamity or severe weather
    condition. To handle these issues, the authors in [70] have proposed PRESTO architecture
    that enables users/clients to view the data in a single logical view which is
    distributed across several sensor proxies and remote sensors. This enables the
    users to view variability at several lossy levels and unreliable remote sensor
    network resources. The PRESTO also supports archival queries on data resources
    that enable the historical data query to prevent any unusual events to better
    understand them for future application scenarios. 8. Conclusion In this paper,
    we surveyed the use of Sensor-Cloud architecture in the context of several applications.
    The Sensor-Cloud architecture enables the sensor data to be categorized, stored,
    and processed in such a way that it becomes cost-effective, timely available,
    and easily accessible. Earlier, most WSN systems which were included to several
    controlling/monitoring schemes were closed in nature, zero, or less interoperability,
    specific application oriented, and nonextensible. However, integrating the existing
    sensors with cloud will enable an open, extensible, scalable, interoperable, and
    easy to use, re-constructible network of sensors for numerous applications. In
    this paper, we have discussed the opportunities of implementing the technology
    to handle more complex situations of a real world through the service innovation
    capability of Sensor-Cloud infrastructure. Acknowledgment The authors extend their

    rights and content Abstract Since January 2008, the U.S. Department of Interior
    / U.S. Geological Survey have been providing free terrain-corrected (Level 1T)
    Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data via the Internet, currently
    for acquisitions with less than 40% cloud cover. With this rich dataset, temporally
    composited, mosaics of the conterminous United States (CONUS) were generated on
    a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis using 6521 ETM+ acquisitions from December
    2007 to November 2008. The composited mosaics are designed to provide consistent
    Landsat data that can be used to derive land cover and geo-physical and bio-physical
    products for detailed regional assessments of land-cover dynamics and to study
    Earth system functioning. The data layers in the composited mosaics are defined
    at 30 m and include top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, TOA brightness temperature,
    TOA normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the date each composited pixel
    was acquired on, per-band radiometric saturation status, cloud mask values, and
    the number of acquisitions considered in the compositing period. Reduced spatial
    resolution browse imagery, and top of atmosphere 30 m reflectance time series
    extracted from the monthly composites, capture the expected land surface phenological
    change, and illustrate the potential of the composited mosaic data for terrestrial
    monitoring at high spatial resolution. The composited mosaics are available in
    501 tiles of 5000 × 5000 30 m pixels in the Albers equal area projection and are
    downloadable at http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php. The research described in this
    paper demonstrates the potential of Landsat data processing to provide a consistent,
    long-term, large-area, data record. Previous article in issue Next article in

    1. Introduction The Landsat satellite series, operated by the U.S. Department
    of Interior / U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat project, with satellite development
    and launches supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),
    represents the longest temporal record of space-based land observations (Williams
    et al., 2006). Until recently the primary limitations to using Landsat data have
    been the cost and availability of data, which have precluded continental to global
    scale Landsat studies (Hansen et al., 2008). In January 2008, NASA and the USGS
    implemented a free Landsat Data Distribution Policy that provides Level 1 terrain
    corrected data for the entire U.S. Landsat archive, over 2.2 million globally
    distributed Landsat acquisitions, at no cost via the Internet. Landsat acquisitions
    with a cloud cover of less than or equal to 40% are processed and made freely
    available as they are acquired, and users may request any other scene in the U.S.
    Landsat archive to be processed and made available via the Internet at no cost.
    Free Landsat data will enable reconstruction of the history of the Earth''s land
    surface back to 1972, with appropriate spatial resolution to enable chronicling
    of both anthropogenic and natural changes (Townshend & Justice, 1988), during
    a time when the human population has doubled and the impacts of climate change
    have become noticeable (Woodcock et al., 2008). The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic
    Mapper Plus (ETM+) is the most recent in a series of Landsat sensors that acquire
    high spatial resolution multi-spectral data over an approximately 183 km × 170
    km extent, defined in a Worldwide Reference System of path (groundtrack parallel)
    and row (latitude parallel) coordinates, with a 16 day revisit capability (Williams
    et al., 2006). Every Landsat overpass of the conterminous United States (CONUS)
    is acquired by the U.S. Landsat Project, providing 22 or 23 acquisitions per year
    per path/row (Ju & Roy, 2008). The Landsat project does not acquire every acquisition
    globally due to ground system processing and archiving constraints (Arvidson et
    al., 2006). Cloud cover reduces the number of Landsat surface observations; for
    example, the annual mean Landsat ETM+ cloud cover for the CONUS and global scenes
    stored in the U.S. Landsat archive is about 40% and 35% respectively (Ju & Roy,
    2008). In addition, in May 2003 the ETM+ scan line corrector (SLC) failed, reducing
    the usable data in each Landsat ETM+ SLC-off scene by 22% (Storey et al., 2005,
    Maxwell et al., 2007). Arguably, the utility of Landsat data for long-term and/or
    large-area monitoring has not been fully assessed; to date, the majority of the
    data in the U.S. Landsat archive have not been used in applications science. A
    number of regional, continental and global Landsat data sets have been generated
    however. Regional mosaics of Landsat imagery are increasingly being developed
    to meet national monitoring and reporting needs across land-use and resource sectors,
    for example, in Canada (Wulder et al., 2002) and the Congo basin (Hansen et al.,
    2008). Large volume Landsat processing was developed by the Landsat Ecosystem
    Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) that processed over 2100 Landsat
    Thematic Mapper and ETM+ acquisitions to provide wall-to-wall surface reflectance
    coverage for North America for the 1990s and 2000s (Masek et al., 2006). More
    recently, a Landsat mosaic of Antarctica was generated from nearly 1100 Landsat
    ETM+ austral summer acquisitions (Bindschadler et al., 2008). At global scale,
    the Global Land Survey decadal Landsat data set provides relatively cloud-free
    acquisitions selected for each path/row from the 1970s, 1990s and 2000s (Tucker
    et al., 2004). These data sets are composed of single date manually selected Landsat
    acquisitions. With the advent of free Landsat data it becomes feasible to apply
    temporal compositing approaches to multi-temporal Landsat acquisitions of the
    same path/row. Compositing procedures are applied independently on a per-pixel
    basis to gridded satellite time series data and provide a practical way to reduce
    cloud and aerosol contamination, fill missing values, and reduce the data volume
    of moderate resolution global near-daily coverage satellite data (Holben, 1986,
    Cihlar et al., 1994). Thus, instead of spatially mosaicing select relatively cloud-free
    Landsat acquisitions together (Zobrist et al., 1983), all the available multi-temporal
    acquisitions may be considered, and at each gridded pixel the acquisition that
    satisfies some compositing criteria selected. In this way, the Global Land Survey
    (GLS) 2005 Landsat ETM+ data set is generated by compositing up to three circa
    2005 low cloud cover acquisitions per path/row (Gutman et al., 2008). Recently,
    Lindquist et al. (2008) examined the suitability of the GLS data sets compared
    to more data intensive Landsat compositing methods (Hansen et al., 2008) and showed
    that over the Congo Basin compositing an increasing number of acquisitions reduced
    the percentage of SLC-off gaps and pixels with a high likelihood of cloud, haze
    or shadow. Similar observations have been observed for compositing moderate and
    coarse spatial resolution satellite data (Holben, 1986, Cihlar et al., 1994, Roy,
    2000). In this paper we describe the generation of Landsat ETM+ composited mosaics
    of the CONUS for December 2007 to November 2008. The composited mosaics are designed
    to provide consistent Landsat data that can be used to derive land cover and geo-physical
    and bio-physical products needed for detailed regional assessments of land-cover
    dynamics and to study Earth system functioning (Gutman et al., 2008, Wulder et
    al., 2008). The composited mosaics are generated on a monthly, seasonal, and annual
    basis to provide data that capture temporal surface variations. The compositing
    approach is designed to preferentially select valid land surface observations
    with minimal cloud, snow, and atmospheric contamination; consequently the composited
    mosaics are not appropriate for Landsat studies of cloud, snow or the atmosphere.
    The processing steps and data products are informed by our MODIS Land processing,
    quality assessment and validation experience (Justice et al., 2002). The processing
    approach is intentionally designed to facilitate automated processing with minimal
    human intervention, including the requirement for composited mosaics to be updated
    regardless of the chronological order of the Landsat acquisition and processing
    dates, and to provide processing in near-real time i.e., updating composited mosaics
    shortly after the Landsat data are acquired. Information on how to obtain the
    composited mosaic products and further research is described. 2. Input web-enabled
    level 1T Landsat ETM+ data The Landsat data made freely available by the U.S.
    Landsat project are sometimes called “web-enabled” data as they are made available
    via the Internet. These data are nominally processed as Level 1 terrain-corrected
    (L1T) data. The L1T data are available in GeoTIFF format in the Universal Transverse
    Mercator (UTM) map projection with World Geodetic System 84 (WGS84) datum which
    is compatible with heritage GLS and Landsat MSS data sets (Tucker et al., 2004).
    The Level 1T processing includes radiometric correction, systematic geometric
    correction, precision correction using ground control chips, and the use of a
    digital elevation model to correct parallax error due to local topographic relief.
    The L1T geolocation error in the CONUS is less than 30 m even in areas with substantial
    terrain relief (Lee et al., 2004). While most web-enabled Landsat data are processed
    as L1T (i.e., precision and terrain-corrected), certain acquisitions do not have
    sufficient ground control or elevation data necessary for precision or terrain
    correction, respectively. In these cases, the best level of correction is applied
    and, over the CONUS, the data are processed to Level 1G systematic (L1G) (WWW1).
    The product file metadata notes if the acquisition was processed to L1T or L1G.
    Landsat acquisitions with cloud cover less than or equal to 40% are processed
    and made freely available as they are acquired, and users may request any other
    scene in the U.S. Landsat archive to be processed and made available at no cost
    via the Internet. Initially, the U.S. Landsat project implemented a 20% cloud
    cover threshold but this was increased to 40% in October 2008 after a processing
    load analysis and in response to requests from the user community including from
    this research project. In, addition, the U.S. Landsat project bulk processed all
    the CONUS ETM+ acquisitions with less than 40% cloud cover acquired from May 2007
    to October 2008 in support of this project. The cloud cover of each ETM+ acquisition
    is estimated operationally by the automatic cloud cover assessment (ACCA) algorithm
    during the archiving process (Irish et al., 2006). Fig. 1 shows the CONUS study
    area, defined by 459 Landsat path/row coordinates, covering about 11,000,000,000
    30 m land pixels. All the web-enabled Landsat ETM+ data acquired over the study
    area for a 12 month period from December 2007 to November 2008 were obtained.
    A total of 6959 acquisitions were copied by dedicated file transfer protocol from
    the U.S Landsat project to computers at the Geographic Information Science Center
    of Excellence, South Dakota State University. Of the 6959 acquisitions, 438 (6.3%)
    were found to be processed as L1G and not as L1T. Fig. 2 shows histograms of the
    ACCA cloud cover percentage for the 6521 L1T (left) and the 438 L1G (right) acquisitions.
    The acquisitions that were processed as L1G have markedly higher cloud cover (mean
    61%) compared to those processed as L1T (mean 18%). This is expected as higher
    cloud cover reduces the number of available ground control chips needed in the
    L1T processing, although a minority of acquisitions processed as L1T also have
    high cloud cover. The locations of acquisitions that had less than 20% ACCA cloud
    cover but that were processed to L1G are illustrated in Fig. 1 (black filled circles).
    For all 105 of these the availability of ground control chips and/or the reliability
    of the ground control matching algorithm was compromised for reasons other than
    cloud cover: 100 acquisitions were of 10 coastal water path/row locations where
    land ground control was less available, another (path 30, row 27) was extensively
    contaminated by snow reducing the availability of ground control, and four were
    at the same location in Kansas (path 30, row 34) where there is extensive center-pivot
    irrigation (Wardlow et al., 2007) that are thought to confuse the matching algorithm.

    Table 1 summarizes the number, ACCA cloud cover, and seasonal distribution of
    acquisitions in the U.S. Landsat project archive. The number of acquisitions in
    the archive is about the same in each season (Table 1, column 2), but because
    of the higher cloud cover in winter and spring, fewer acquisitions were available
    with less than 40% ACCA cloud cover than in summer and autumn (Table 1, column
    3). All the available web-enabled acquisitions processed to L1T were used for
    the research (Table 1, column 4). The 438 acquisitions processed to L1G were discarded
    and only the remaining 6521 acquisitions processed to L1T were used in order to
    maximize the Landsat geolocation and so compositing accuracy (Roy, 2000). A total
    of 734 L1T acquisitions had higher than 40% ACCA cloud cover reflecting high cloud
    cover acquisitions ordered by the user community. The high degree of cloud contamination
    in some of the L1T acquisitions was not considered important however because it
    was expected that cloudy pixels would be removed by the compositing process. Table

    of atmosphere reflectance, brightness temperature, vegetation index, and band
    saturation computation The spectral radiance sensed by each ETM+ detector is stored
    as an 8-bit digital number (Markham et al., 2006). The digital numbers should
    be converted to radiance (units: W m−2 sr− 1 μm− 1), to minimize changes in the
    instrument radiometric calibration, and then converted to top of atmosphere reflectance
    to minimize remote sensing variations introduced by variations in the sun–earth
    distance, the solar geometry, and exoatmospheric solar irradiance arising from
    spectral band differences (Chander et al., 2009). This is particularly important
    for applications that use Landsat data acquired over large areas or long time
    periods. The conversion of the radiance sensed at the Landsat reflective and thermal
    wavelengths to reflectance (unitless) and brightness temperature (units: Kelvin)
    respectively provides data that has physical meaning and, for example, can be
    compared with laboratory and ground based measurements, model outputs, and data
    from other satellite sensors (Masek et al., 2006), and importantly provides data
    that can be used to derive geo-physical and bio-physical products (Justice et
    al., 2002). In this research all the Landsat ETM+ bands were used, except the
    panchromatic band, i.e., the bands used were the 30 m blue (0.45–0.52 μm), green
    (0.53–0.61 μm), red (0.63–0.69 μm), near-infrared (0.78–0.90 μm), and the two
    mid-infrared (1.55–1.75 μm and 2.09–2.35 μm) bands, and the 60 m thermal (10.40–12.50
    μm) low and high gain bands. The L1T 8-bit digital numbers were converted to spectral
    radiance using sensor calibration gain and bias coefficients derived from the
    ETM+ L1T file metadata (Chander et al., 2009). The radiance sensed in the Landsat
    reflective wavelength bands, i.e., the blue, green, red, near-infrared, and the
    two mid-infrared bands, were converted to top of atmosphere reflectance using
    the standard formula as: (1) where ρλ is the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance
    (unitless), Lλ is the TOA spectral radiance (W m− 2 sr− 1 μm− 1), d is the Earth–Sun
    distance (astronomical units), ESUNλ is the mean TOA solar spectral irradiance
    (W m− 2 μm− 1), and θs is solar zenith angle at the center of the Landsat acquisition
    (radians). The quantities ESUNλ and d are tabulated by Chander et al. (2009) and
    θs is calculated from the solar elevation angle stored in the ETM+ L1T file metadata.
    The TOA reflectance computed as [1] is the TOA bi-directional reflectance factor
    and can be greater than 1, for example, due to specular reflectance over snow
    or water under certain solar and viewing geometries (Schaepman-Strub et al., 2006).
    In addition, due to instrument artifacts not accommodated for by the calibration,
    the retrieved TOA reflectance can be negative, for example, over water bodies.
    The 30 m TOA reflectance for each reflective band were stored as signed 16-bit
    integers after being scaled by 10,000, in the same manner as the MODIS surface
    reflectance product (Vermote et al., 2002). The normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) is a commonly used vegetation index, derived as the near-infrared
    minus the red reflectance divided by their sum (Tucker, 1979), and is used in
    maximum NDVI compositing to preferentially select pixels with reduced cloud and
    atmospheric contamination (Holben, 1986). The 30 m TOA NDVI was computed from
    the TOA red and near-infrared Landsat reflectance and stored as signed 16-bit
    integers after being scaled by 10,000, in the same manner as the MODIS NDVI product
    (Huete et al., 2002). The radiance sensed in the Landsat low and high gain thermal
    bands were converted to TOA brightness temperature (i.e., assuming unit surface
    emissivity) using the standard formula as: (2) where T is the 10.40–12.50 μm TOA
    brightness temperature (Kelvin), K1 and K2 are thermal calibration constants set
    as 666.09 (W m− 2 sr− 1 μm− 1) and 1282.71 (Kelvin) respectively (Chander et al.,
    2009), and Lλ is the TOA spectral radiance. This equation is an inverted Planck
    function simplified for the ETM+ sensor considering the thermal band spectral
    responses. For convenience for the subsequent processing, and subsequent product
    use, the two 60 m brightness temperature thermal bands were resampled to 30 m
    to provide the same image spatial dimensions as the 30 m TOA reflectance bands.
    The upper-left 60 m L1T pixels are co-registered at the pixel centers (WWW2).
    Consequently, the even-numbered row and column 30 m pixels fall within the 60
    m pixels and so were assigned the 60 m pixel brightness temperature values. The
    odd-numbered 30 m pixels have centers on the boundaries of two neighboring 60
    m pixels, and their pixel values were systematically obtained from the nearest
    60 m pixel with a smaller row and/or column number. The 30 m low and high gain
    TOA brightness temperature data were stored as signed 16-bit integers with units
    of degrees Celsius by subtracting 273.15 from the brightness temperature and then
    scaling by 100. The Landsat ETM+ calibration coefficients are configured in an
    attempt to globally maximize the range of land surface spectral radiance in each
    spectral band (Markham et al., 2006). However, highly reflective surfaces, such
    as snow and clouds, may over-saturate the reflective wavelength bands, with saturation
    varying spectrally and with the illumination geometry (solar zenith and surface
    slope) (Cahalan et al., 2001, Dowdeswell and Mcintyre, 1986, Bindschadler et al.,
    2008). Similarly, hot surfaces may over-saturate the thermal bands (Flynn & Mouginis-Mark,
    1995), and cold surfaces may under-saturate the high gain thermal band (WWW3).
    Over and under-saturated pixels are designated by digital numbers of 255 and 1
    respectively in the L1T data. As the radiance values of saturated pixels are unreliable,
    a 30 m 8-bit saturation mask was generated, storing bit packed band saturation
    (1) or unsaturated (0) values for the eight Landsat bands used in this study.
    4. Cloud masking It is well established that optically thick clouds preclude optical
    and thermal wavelength remote sensing of the land surface but that automated and
    reliable satellite data cloud detection is not trivial (Kaufman, 1987, Platnick
    et al., 2003). Recognizing that cloud detection errors, both of omission and commission,
    will always occur in large data sets, both the Landsat automatic cloud cover assessment
    (ACCA) algorithm and a classification tree based cloud detection approach were
    implemented. 4.1. Automatic cloud cover assessment (ACCA) cloud detection The
    U.S. Landsat project uses the ACCA algorithm to estimate the cloud content of
    each acquisition (Irish, 2000, Irish et al., 2006). The percentage of pixels that
    are flagged as cloudy are stored as metadata (e.g., Fig. 2). The ACCA takes advantage
    of known spectral properties of clouds, snow, bright soil, vegetation, and water,
    and consists of twenty-six filters/rules applied to five of the ETM+ bands (Irish
    et al., 2006). The primary goal of the algorithm is to quickly produce scene-average
    cloud cover metadata values, that can be used in future acquisition planning (Arvidson
    et al., 2006), and that users may query as part of the Landsat browse and order
    process. The ACCA was not developed to produce a “per-pixel” cloud mask; despite
    this, the ACCA has an estimated 5% error for 98% of the global 2001 ETM+ acquisitions
    archived by the U.S. Landsat project (Irish et al, 2006). A copy of the ACCA code
    was obtained and applied to every Landsat ETM+ acquisition to produce a 30 m per-pixel
    cloud data layer, stored as an unsigned 8-bit integer where 0 = not cloudy, 1
    = cloudy, and 255 = fill value denoting missing data in any of the Landsat bands.
    4.2. Classification tree cloud detection The state of the practice for automated
    satellite land-cover classification is to adopt a supervised classification approach
    where a sample of locations of known land-cover classes (training data) is collected.
    The optical and thermal wavelength values sensed at the locations of the training
    pixels are used to develop statistical classification rules, which are then used
    to map the land-cover class of every pixel. Supervised classification tree approaches
    have been applied to Landsat data to identify cloud contaminated pixels (Hansen
    et al., 2008). Classification trees are hierarchical classifiers that predict
    categorical class membership by recursively partitioning data into more homogeneous
    subsets, referred to as nodes (Breiman et al., 1984). They accommodate abrupt,
    non-monotonic and non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent
    variables, and make no assumptions concerning the statistical distribution of
    the data (Prasad et al., 2006). Bagging tree approaches use a statistical bootstrapping
    methodology, whereby a large number of trees are grown using random subsets of
    the training data, to reduce over-fitting and improve predictive ability (Breiman,
    1996). Conventionally multiple bagged trees are used to independently classify
    the satellite data and the multiple classifications are combined using some voting
    procedure. In this study we developed a single parsimonious tree from multiple
    bagged trees so that only one tree was used to classify the Landsat data, reducing
    the computational overhead. Supervised classification approaches require training
    data. A global database of Landsat Level 1G and corresponding spatially explicit
    cloud masks generated by photo-interpretation of the reflective and thermal bands
    were used. This database was developed to prototype the cloud mask algorithm for
    the future Landsat Data Continuity Mission (Irons & Masek, 2006). The Landsat
    interpreted cloud mask defines each pixel as thick cloud, thin cloud, cloud shadow
    or not cloudy. We reconciled these interpreted cloud states into cloud (i.e.,
    thick and thin cloud) and non-cloud (i.e. cloud shadow and not cloudy states)
    classes. In addition, to avoid mixed pixel cloud edge problems, the cloud labeled
    regions were morphologically eroded by one 30 m pixel and not used (Serra, 1982).
    A 0.5% sample of training pixels was extracted randomly from each Landsat scene,
    where data were present and not including the cloud boundary regions. A total
    of 88 northern hemisphere Landsat scenes acquired in polar (19 acquisitions),
    boreal (22 acquisitions), mid-latitude (24 acquisitions) and sub-tropical latitudinal
    zones (23 acquisitions) were sampled. The Landsat Level 1G data were processed
    to TOA reflectance, brightness temperature and the band saturation flag computed
    as described in Section 3. Only pixels with reflectance greater than 0.0 were
    used. A total of 12,979,302 unsaturated training pixels and 5,374,157 saturated
    training pixels were extracted. After some experimentation it became apparent
    that it was necessary to develop two classification trees; one for saturated training
    data and the other for the unsaturated training data. Saturation occurs in any
    of the reflective ETM+ bands, and also for the high gain thermal wavelength band
    which may over- or under-saturate typically when pixels contain illuminated thick
    cumulonimbus cloud, illuminated snow, or sunglint over water. The saturated TOA
    reflectance and brightness temperature values were unreliable but still provided
    information that could be classified. Consequently, better cloud non-cloud discrimination
    was afforded by classifying the saturated and unsaturated pixels independently.
    For both the saturated and unsaturated classification trees, all the 30 m TOA
    reflective bands were used, except the shortest wavelength blue band which is
    highly sensitive to atmospheric scattering (Ouaidrari & Vermote, 1999). For both
    trees, the low gain thermal band was also used. The high gain thermal band was
    not used because it under-saturated or over-saturated frequently over the wide
    surface brightness temperature range of the CONUS e.g., from winter snow covered
    surfaces to hot summer desert surfaces. The unsaturated classification tree also
    used reflective band simple ratios similar to those used by ACCA. The saturated
    classification tree did not use band ratios as they could not be computed when
    one or both bands in the ratio formulation were saturated. Twenty five bagged
    classification trees were generated, running the Splus tree code on a 64 bit computer,
    each time, 20% of the training data were sampled at random with replacement and
    used to generate a tree. Each tree was used to classify the remaining (“out-of-bag”)
    80% of the training data, deriving a vector of predicted classes for each out-of-bag
    pixel. In this way, each training pixel was classified 25 or fewer times. The
    most frequent predicted class (cloud or non-cloud) for each training pixel was
    derived; and used with the corresponding training data to generate a single final
    tree, i.e. the final tree was generated using approximately 25 × 0.8 × n training
    pixels, where n was either the 12,979,302 unsaturated training pixels or the 5,374,157
    saturated training pixels. To limit over-fitting, all the trees were terminated
    using a deviance threshold, whereby additional splits in the tree had to exceed
    0.02% of the root node deviance or tree growth was terminated. The final unsaturated
    and saturated classification tree was then used to classify every Landsat pixel
    according to its saturation status. The 30 m cloud classification result was stored
    as an unsigned 8-bit integer where 0 = not cloudy, 1 = cloudy, 2 = not cloudy
    but adjacent to a cloudy pixel, 200 = could not be classified because of negative
    reflectance, and 255 = fill value denoting missing data in any of the Landsat
    bands. 5. Reprojection, resampling and tiling The L1T data are defined in the
    UTM projection which is defined in zones, each 6° of longitude in width and centered
    over a meridian of longitude, with ten zones encompassing the CONUS (Snyder, 1993).
    Consequently, after each Landsat ETM+ L1T acquisition was processed (3 Top of
    atmosphere reflectance, brightness temperature, vegetation index, and band saturation
    computation, 4 Cloud masking), the 30 m TOA reflective bands, TOA NDVI, TOA brightness
    temperature bands, band saturation mask, and the two cloud masks were reprojected
    from the L1T UTM coordinates into a single continental map projection. The high
    Landsat L1T data volume restricts provision of multiple product instances in different
    map projections, even though users will inevitably prefer different projections
    (Teillet et al., 2000). The Albers Equal Area projection was selected as it is
    suitable for large areas that are mainly east–west oriented such as the CONUS
    (Snyder, 1993), and was defined with standard parallels 29.5°N, 45.5°N and central
    Meridian 96°W to provide heritage with the USGS EROS National Land Cover Database
    (Homer et al., 2004, Chander et al., 2009a). As there are about 11,000,000,000
    30 m Landsat pixels covering the CONUS study area it is not physically possible
    to store the reprojected Landsat 30 m data in a single file. The largest file
    size achievable is limited by the amount of addressable memory on a user''s personal
    computer, usually conservatively considered to be a 32 bit computer with a maximum
    file size of 2 GB. To ensure manageable file sizes, the 30 m Landsat data were
    reprojected into 501 fixed Albers tiles where each tile was composed of 5000 ×
    5000 30 m Landsat pixels. This tile dimension (number of rows and columns) is
    smaller than the dimensions of individual L1T ETM+ acquisitions. The Landsat ETM+
    pixels were allocated to the Albers coordinate system using the inverse gridding
    approach, sometimes known as the indirect method (Konecny, 1976). In this approach
    the center coordinates of each Albers 30 m pixel are mapped to the nearest pixel
    center in the Landsat data, and the ETM+ processed data for that pixel are allocated
    to the Albers output grid. This processing approach is computationally efficient
    and geometrically is the equivalent of nearest neighbor resampling (Wolfe et al.,
    1998). The General Cartographic Transformation Package (GCTP) developed by the
    USGS and used to develop a number of applications including the MODIS global browse
    imagery (Roy et al., 2002) and the MODIS Reprojection Tool (WWW4) was used to
    transform coordinates between the UTM and Albers map projections. The GCTP is
    computationally expensive. Consequently, a sparse triangulation methodology was
    used where the GCTP was invoked to project Albers 30 m pixels to UTM coordinates
    only at the vertices of triangles, and Albers 30 m pixel locations falling within
    the triangles were projected to UTM coordinates using a simplicial coordinate
    transformation (Saalfeld, 1985). In this approach, any point (px, py) in a triangle
    with vertices (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) can be represented by three simplicial
    coordinates (s1, s2, s3) defined as: (3) where: Given a point (px,py) defined
    in Albers coordinates the corresponding location in UTM coordinates is: (4) where
    (x1′, y1′), (x2′, y2′), (x3′, y3′) are the coordinates of the triangle vertices
    in UTM calculated by projecting the corresponding Albers triangle vertices (x1,
    y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) using the GCTP. A regular lattice of triangles was defined
    by bisecting squares with side lengths of 450 m (i.e., fifteen 30 m pixels) defined
    from the northwest origin of the Albers coordinate system so there in each square
    there were two triangles with different topologies. This approach is computationally
    efficient as the GCTP is only called for each triangle vertex and the coefficients
    a, b, c and t are computed only once for each triangle. The maximum coordinate
    difference between the simplical interpolation and GCTP projected coordinates,
    occurs at the triangle centers, and for the CONUS study area is less than 1 cm
    east–west and north–south. 6. Compositing and composited mosaic format Compositing
    was developed originally to reduce residual cloud and aerosol contamination in
    AVHRR time series to produce representative n-day data sets (Holben, 1986). Compositing
    procedures either select from colocated pixels in different orbits of geometrically
    registered data the pixel that best satisfies some compositing criteria, or combine
    the different pixel values together. Compositing criteria have included the maximum
    NDVI, maximum brightness temperature, maximum apparent surface temperature, maximum
    difference in red and near-infrared reflectance, minimum scan angle, and combinations
    of these (Roy, 2000). Ideally, the criteria should select from the time series
    only near-nadir observations that have reduced cloud and atmospheric contamination.
    Composites generated from wide field of view satellite data, such as AVHRR or
    MODIS, often contain significant bi-directional reflectance effects caused by
    angular sensing and illumination variations combined with the anisotropy of reflectance
    of most natural surfaces and the atmosphere (Gao et al., 2002, Roy et al., 2006).
    Compositing algorithms that model the bi-directional reflectance have been developed
    to compensate for this problem and combine all valid observations to estimate
    the reflectance at nadir view zenith for some consistent solar zenith angle (Roujean
    et al., 1992, Schaaf et al., 2002). This approach does not provide a solution
    for compositing thermal wavelength satellite data, and is not appropriate for
    application to Landsat data as the comparatively infrequent 16 day Landsat repeat
    cycle and the narrow 15º Landsat sensor field of view do not provide a sufficient
    number or angular sampling of the surface to invert bi-directional reflectance
    models (Danaher et al., 2001, Roy et al., 2008). Consequently, in this research,
    compositing based on the selection of a “best” pixel over the compositing period
    was implemented. Composited mosaics of the CONUS were generated on a monthly,
    seasonal and annual basis for December 2007 to November 2008. The compositing
    criteria were focused on selecting valid surface observations with minimal cloud,
    snow and atmospheric contamination. Initially, a simple selection over the compositing
    period of interest (month, season, year) of pixels that were not missing due to
    temporal Landsat acquisition gaps or SLC-off gaps, and that were not flagged as
    cloudy by the ACCA or classification tree cloud masking algorithms was attempted.
    This did not provide visually coherent composites, due to the incidence of saturated
    pixels, pixels that were contaminated by atmospheric aerosols, pixels that contained
    sub-pixel cloud and cloud edges, and the unresolved problem of how to select from
    several observations of the same pixel that were not missing and not flagged as
    cloudy. Consequently, the compositing approach was refined and incorporated the
    heritage maximum NDVI and maximum brightness temperature compositing criteria
    as clouds, snow and aerosols typically depress NDVI and brightness temperature
    over land surfaces (Holben, 1986, Cihlar et al., 1994, Roy, 1997). The maximum
    NDVI compositing criterion was selected as the primary compositing criterion,
    rather than the maximum brightness temperature criterion, because among cloud-free
    observations it preferentially selects vegetated observations and arguably the
    majority of terrestrial Landsat applications are concerned with vegetation. We
    observed however that for certain low vegetation covers, including certain dark
    and bright soils, water and snow, that the top of atmosphere (TOA) NDVI of a cloud
    could be higher than the TOA NDVI of the cloud-free surface. The sensitivity of
    NDVI to the brightness of soil beneath vegetation canopies (Huete, 1988) and to
    atmospheric effects (Liu & Huete, 1995) is well established. Consequently, a pixel
    was considered as “unvegetated” if NDVI < 0.09 AND 2.09–2.35 μm TOA reflectance
    < 0.048. These two thresholds were derived empirically. When there were “unvegetated”
    pixels the maximum brightness temperature compositing criterion was used, as cloud
    brightness temperatures tended to be lower than the cloud-free brightness temperature.
    The low gain 10.40–12.50 μm TOA brightness temperature was used as it has a wider
    range than the high gain TOA brightness temperature and does not saturate (Chander
    et al., 2009). For compositing purposes only, a pixel was considered saturated
    if either the red or near-infrared TOA reflectance was saturated as the NDVI is
    unreliable when one or both of these bands are saturated. The ACCA and classification
    tree cloud masks were used to complement the maximum NDVI and maximum brightness
    temperature criteria and to provide a more reliable differentiation between clouds
    and the land surface. These two cloud masks did not always agree, but it was not
    possible to quantitatively evaluate their relative omission and commission errors
    as a function of different clouds and background reflectance and brightness temperature.
    Consequently, a pixel was considered as cloudy if both the ACCA and the Classification
    Tree algorithms detected it as cloud, as uncertain cloud if only one algorithm
    detected it as cloud, or as non-cloudy if both algorithms detected it as non-cloud.
    Table 2 summaries the compositing logic; each row reflects a comparison of two
    acquisitions of the same pixel. If the criterion in a row is not met then the
    criterion in the row beneath is used and this process is repeated until the last
    row. This implementation enables the composites to be updated on a per-pixel basis
    shortly after the input ETM+ data are processed and regardless of the chronological
    processing order. For example, after 16 days the same Albers pixel location may
    be sensed again, and the compositing criteria are used to decide if the more recent
    ETM+ pixel data should be allocated to overwrite the previous data. For each composited
    Albers pixel, the 30 m TOA reflective bands, TOA NDVI, TOA brightness temperature
    bands, band saturation mask, and the two cloud masks are stored. In addition,
    the day of the year that the selected pixel was acquired on, and the number of
    different valid acquisitions considered at that pixel over the compositing period,
    are stored. Table 2. Compositing criteria used to compare two acquisitions of
    a pixel, the criteria are considered in decreasing priority until a selection
    is made (see text for further details). Priority Compositing criteria 1 If either

    and annual composited mosaics. These data are stored in Hierarchical Data Format
    (HDF). HDF is a data file format designed by the National Center for Supercomputing
    Applications to assist users in the storage and manipulation of scientific data
    across diverse operating systems and machines. For example, it is used to store
    the standard MODIS Land products (Justice et al., 2002). Each composited mosaic
    pixel has 14 bands (termed HDF science data sets) storing the information described
    in Table 3 and in the text above. The different HDF science data sets are stored
    with appropriate data types, and HDF internal compression, to reduce the file
    size. A 5000 × 5000 tile is typically 240 MB and the total size of the 501 tiles
    defining a monthly, seasonal or annual composited mosaic is about 110 GB. Table

    generated from the composited mosaics to enable synoptic product evaluation with
    reduced data volume (Roy et al., 2002), and with the expectation that the browse
    imagery could be used for Internet data ordering. CONUS browse images were generated
    in the JPEG format with fixed contrast stretching and color look-up tables to
    enable consistent temporal comparison. The browse images were generated using
    the median pixel values falling in a given window size (Boschetti et al., 2008)
    defined with dimensions set as an integer multiple of the 30 m Albers pixels.
    For example, a 17 × 17 30 m pixel window size produces a browse with approximately
    500 m resolution. Browses were generated from the monthly, seasonal and annual
    composites using the same window size. Single band browses of a science data set
    of interest (Table 3) were generated using the median value of the pixel values
    falling in a given window. In addition, true color reflectance browses were generated
    from the TOA red, green, and blue reflectance data, selecting within each window
    the pixel with the median red reflectance and the corresponding blue and green
    reflectance values for that pixel. In this way, the reflectance for the same pixel
    is obtained which produces a more coherent true color reflectance browse than
    selecting the median reflectance values for each wavelength independently. The
    red reflectance was used as the “master” since it is less sensitive to atmospheric
    contamination than shorter wavelength blue and green reflectance (Ouaidrari &
    Vermote, 1999). In the results shown in the next section browse images were computed
    ignoring pixels flagged as cloud. 8. Results and preliminary assessment 8.1. Cloud
    It is difficult to definitively validate cloud detection algorithms (Irish et
    al., 2006, Platnick et al., 2003). Consequently, the ACCA and Classification Tree
    cloud masks were compared statistically and also by visual inspection. The Classification
    Tree cloud mask was generated using unsaturated and saturated ETM+ L1T data; 12,979,302
    unsaturated training pixels were used to generate a single tree defined by 1595
    nodes that explained 98% of the tree variance, and 5,374,157 saturated training
    pixels generated a tree of 188 nodes that explained 99.9% of the tree variance.
    Despite these high levels of explanation, it is recognized that supervised classification
    approaches are only as good as the quality of the training data and the degree
    to which the training data are representative. Although every attempt was made
    to use a large well distributed high quality training data set (Section 4.2) the
    suitability of the training data used to develop the saturated and unsaturated
    classification trees is unknown, especially considering the diverse and temporally
    variable landscapes and clouds of the CONUS. Fig. 3 shows scatterplots of the
    percentage of each Landsat L1T acquisition flagged as cloudy by the classification
    tree and by ACCA. Each point corresponds to the cloud percentage derived by counting
    the number of cloud labeled 30 m pixels in the L1T acquisition divided by the
    number of non-missing 30 m pixels. The figure illustrates scatterplots for the
    548 and 654 L1T CONUS acquisitions sensed in January 2008 (left) and July 2008
    (right) respectively. Simple linear regression lines are shown superimposed; the
    two cloud masks at this reporting scale have better correspondence in July (R2
    = 0.88) than in January (R2 = 0.66). For both January and July the classification
    tree underestimates the CONUS cloud cover relative to ACCA (regression line slopes
    of 0.73 and 0.90 respectively). It is established that ACCA may misclassify snow
    as cloud, particularly under low solar illumination (Irish et al., 2006), and
    this may explain the poorer correspondence between the cloud masks in January
    (Fig. 4, left) when a substantial proportion of the CONUS is snow covered and
    when the Landsat solar zenith angles are higher than in summer. Download : Download

    − 101.8852°, latitude 47.4056°). Scatterplots of the sort illustrated in Fig.
    3 may be misleading in that similar cloud proportions may be reported by both
    algorithms but with the clouds mapped at different locations within the Landsat
    L1T acquisition. As a confidence check, Fig. 4 shows three 450 × 600 30 m spatial
    subsets of L1T January 2008 acquisitions. The left column illustrates the 30 m
    true color TOA reflectance and the middle and right columns show the ACCA and
    Classification Tree cloud classification results respectively. These three subsets
    were extracted from scenes with cloud cover percentages highlighted by the large
    black dots in Fig. 3 (left). The top row of Fig. 4 shows a subset of an acquisition
    in which the ACCA and the Classification Tree cloud cover agree at the scene level
    (12%). The middle and bottom rows of Fig. 4 illustrate subsets where the ACCA
    and Classification Tree scene level cloud cover percentages are the most different
    among all the January acquisitions. The top row of Fig. 4 illustrates a subset
    in Alabama acquired January 13th 2008 with no apparent snow cover. Locally, both
    cloud masks capture the general pattern of cloud evident in the TOA true color
    reflectance and it is not possible to state which cloud mask is performing better.
    The middle row illustrates a subset in California acquired January 7th 2008 with
    isolated thick clouds and with thin clouds which completely obscure the land surface.
    The ACCA detected the thick clouds but failed to detect the thin cloud, while
    the Classification Tree more correctly labeled the majority of the scene as cloud.
    The bottom row illustrates a subset acquired over a snow-covered landscape in
    North Dakota acquired January 24th 2008. The ACCA misclassified the snow as cloud
    while the Classification Tree cloud mask did not. Despite this evidence that the
    Classification Tree may be more reliable than the ACCA, we combined both cloud
    masks in the compositing procedure to provide a conservative cloud assessment
    used by the compositing procedure (Section 6). 8.2. Monthly, season and annual
    composited mosaics Monthly, seasonal and annual composites were generated from
    the 6521 L1T acquisitions processed in the manner described in the previous sections.
    The standard seasonal definition adopted by the climate modeling community is
    used where winter is defined by the months: December, January and February (Ju
    & Roy, 2008). Fig. 5 illustrates for the CONUS study area, the median temporal
    frequency of Landsat L1T acquisitions in 17 × 17 30 m pixel bins (i.e. ~ 500 m)
    over the 12 month study period. The majority of the CONUS path/row locations have
    10 or more acquisitions processed to L1T over the year; however, in cloudy regions
    including the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Lakes, less acquisitions are available;
    conversely, in the arid, less cloudy, southwest up to 55 acquisitions are available.
    These patterns have been observed previously (Ju & Roy, 2008). The maximum number
    of overpasses of a path/row per year is 23 but the number of acquisitions may
    be greater because of overlapping acquisitions along the same path and between
    adjacent paths. Adjacent Landsat paths are sensed with a seven day time difference
    and the L1T acquisitions acquired in the same row overlap in the across-track
    direction. Overlapping acquisitions occur along the same path because of the way
    the L1T data are generated and not because the same location is sensed twice on
    orbit. We retain these overlapping pixels however as the calibration coefficients
    and the scene center solar geometry can be different between consecutive L1T acquisitions
    along the same path. Download : Download high-res image (1003KB) Download : Download

    product resolution, was used to generate the browse images because the browse
    dimensions of 9700 × 6500 pixels are sufficient to enable visualization of all
    the CONUS study area in a single JPEG file. Download : Download high-res image

    images of the monthly composited mosaics have evident holes (Fig. 6) that are
    due to the unavailability of L1T acquisitions at path/row coordinates with less
    than 40% ACCA cloud cover. Geographically, the incidence of holes tends to be
    higher in more cloudy regions near the Great Lakes and the U.S.–Canada border
    and lower in the Southwest, which is related to cloud distributions at the time
    of Landsat overpass (Ju & Roy, 2008). Some path/row coordinates have greater than
    40% ACCA cloud cover reflecting additional acquisitions ordered by the user community,
    confusing this pattern. Monthly variations in the greenness of the vegetation
    are evident, with a characteristic wave of growth moving northward across the
    CONUS in the early spring and with differences in the timing of growth between
    agricultural and natural vegetation, for example, in and around the Mississippi
    valley. Vegetation senescence, particularly in the deciduous forests on the Eastern
    sea-board may also be apparent, where the leaf chlorophyll responsible for the
    green reflectance of the leaves throughout the spring and summer reduces in the
    autumn and the yellow-red reflectance of other leaf pigments begin to dominate
    in November. These vegetation patterns have been observed with coarser spatial
    resolution MODIS true color reflectance composites (Schaaf, 2007). The spatio-temporal
    distribution of snow is also evident in the monthly composited mosaics, with snow
    predominating in the Northern states and over the Rocky mountains in the winter
    and spring. Cloud contamination looks the same as snow in the visible bands illustrated
    and is most obviously present when there was only one cloudy L1T acquisition,
    for example, December, over southern Texas. The seasonal and annual composited
    mosaics (Fig. 7, Fig. 8) have considerably fewer holes and clouds than the corresponding
    monthly composites. The seasonal composited mosaics still retain some clouds,
    primarily in the winter, spring and autumn where there were only a small number
    of cloud-free L1T observations over the 3 month period. In addition, errors in
    the ACCA and Classification Tree cloud masking algorithms lead to incorrect selection
    of cloudy pixels in the seasonal mosaics although these are not apparent in the
    browse imagery. There are a small number of holes in the winter, spring and autumn
    seasonal composited mosaics where there were no L1T acquisitions over the 3 months
    (Fig. 7). The annual composited mosaic has no missing acquisitions and less apparent
    cloud contamination over the land (Fig. 8). Table 4 quantifies the percentage
    of 30 m pixels in each CONUS composited mosaic that are missing and flagged as
    cloudy by the two cloud masks. There are a greater percentage of composited missing
    and cloudy pixels in winter than in the other seasons which is due to the greater
    winter cloudiness at the Landsat overpass time (Ju & Roy, 2008). The Landsat ETM+
    L1T processing and compositing is working correctly as increasing the compositing
    period from monthly, to seasonal, to annual periods, reduces the percentage of
    cloudy and missing pixels (Table 4). The percent cloud was computed by dividing
    the number of cloud flagged pixels by the number of valid pixels without “Fill”
    values (Table 3). The ACCA cloud cover in the winter, spring, summer and autumn
    seasonal CONUS composited mosaics were 13.0%, 3.8%, 1.4%, and 1.8% respectively
    (Table 4), i.e., lower than the equivalent 25%, 17%, 15% and 15% mean seasonal
    ACCA cloud cover percentages of the input L1T data used to generate the composited
    mosaics (Table 1, column 4). The Classification Tree underestimated the CONUS
    cloud cover relative to ACCA in the input L1T January and July data (Fig. 3) and
    this difference was generally maintained for the composited mosaics (Table 4).
    The annual composited mosaic Classification Tree cloud cover (0.21%) and the annual
    composited mosaic ACCA cloud cover (0.19%) were significantly lower than the 18%
    mean annual ACCA cloud cover of the input L1T data (Table 1, column 4). Table

    1.60 1.43 November 11.2 11.9 26.5 The missing percentages are expressed as the
    percentage of 30 m pixels in each CONUS monthly and seasonal composited mosaic
    that are missing relative to the CONUS annual composited mosaic. As the number
    of L1T acquisitions composited is increased, the percentage of missing data should
    decrease monotonically because the spatial phase of the SLC-off gaps is not constant
    between acquisitions of the same path/row (Lindquist et al., 2008). The percent
    missing statistics reported in Table 4 were computed for each monthly and seasonal
    composited mosaic by counting the number of “Fill” values in the composited mosaic
    occurring where there was no “Fill” value in the annual mosaic, divided by 10,838,923,633
    (the number of annual mosaic pixels without “Fill” values). The monthly composites
    had a variable percentage of missing data from 11% (July) to 28% (December) reflecting
    the seasonal variability of L1T acquisitions with 40% or less cloud cover, and,
    as expected, the percentage of missing pixels in the seasonal composites was much
    less than in the monthly composites, at most 1.8% in the Winter seasonal composited
    mosaic (Table 4). The illustrated monthly, seasonal and annual composites exhibit
    across-track reflectance variations and discontinuities between adjacent paths.
    It is unclear what proportion of this effect is due to the surface or the atmosphere,
    although we note that even if the Landsat data were atmospherically corrected,
    solar zenith variations will remain (Roy et al., 2008). It is established that
    for wide field of view sensor data, such as MODIS or AVHRR, reflectance anisotropy
    can result in the maximum NDVI compositing selection of a pixel with high NDVI
    caused by directional rather than reduced atmospheric effects (Cihlar et al.,
    1994, Meyer et al., 1995, Gao et al., 2002). The Landsat ETM+ sensor, with its
    comparatively narrow field of view, is not as severely affected, but Landsat directional
    reflectance effects have been documented and research on methods to minimize these
    effects undertaken (Danaher et al., 2001, Toivonen et al., 2006, Hansen et al.,
    2008, Roy et al., 2008). In addition, all compositing procedures implicitly assume
    that the surface state remains static, and so increasing the compositing period
    increases the incidence of temporal biases associated with violating this assumption
    (Roy et al., 2006). This may cause adjacent pixels to be sensed from the beginning
    or the end of the compositing period. The maximum NDVI compositing criterion,
    leads to the preferential selection of the greenest dates over the compositing
    period (Roy, 1997, Roy, 2000). This is apparent in Fig. 9 which shows the day
    of the year that the 12 month annual composited mosaic pixels were selected on.
    The majority of the CONUS annual composited mosaic pixels were selected in the
    summer June–August months when NDVI is maximal. However, some path/row coordinates
    in the annual composite have fewer acquisitions (Fig. 5) confusing this pattern,
    and temporal variations driven by phenological variations are also apparent, for
    example, the Southwest and certain high altitude mountains have later September–November
    peak NDVI, and regions in the southern states have peak NDVI in the winter months
    (Fig. 9). In the monthly composites this compositing timing bias is less apparent
    and is illustrated in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (970KB)

    annual composited mosaic. Each pixel shows the day of the year that the reflectance
    illustrated in Fig. 8 was sensed on. 8.3. Phenology To further check that the
    processing was performing correctly, the temporal coherence of the top of atmosphere
    NDVI stored in the 12 monthly composites was examined. Fig. 10 shows the monthly
    top of atmosphere NDVI values from December 2007 to November 2008 extracted at
    four 30 m pixel locations. These four sites represent different surface phenologies
    and three of them are well studied in the literature. The NDVI values in successive
    months are not necessarily multiples of 16 days apart because of overlapping acquisitions
    (Fig. 5). The absence of NDVI values in some months, occurring at all the sites
    except the White Sands site, is due to the unavailability of L1T data with less
    than 40% cloud cover. The phenological curves illustrated in Fig. 9 are consistent
    with the broad patterns of phenology reported in the literature. The Harvard Forest
    site is in Massachusetts (42.5360°N, 72.1729°W) in a temperate deciduous broad-leaf
    forest with high NDVI (~ 0.8) in May–September and rapid phenological change in
    the spring (March–April) and autumn (October–November) (Schwartz et al., 2002,
    Fisher and Mustard, 2007). The FIFE (First International Satellite Land Surface
    Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment) site is a grassland site (39.1097°N,
    96.5225°W) near Manhattan, Kansas (Sellers et al., 1992). The grassland NDVI trend
    is similar to that of Harvard Forest, but with a shorter growing season and lower
    NDVI. The Los Angeles site (34.5000°N, 118.6000°W) is a shrubland site in Los
    Angeles county, California (Dennison et al., 2005). The NDVI clearly shows the
    typical wet winter–spring and dry summer–autumn seasons of the Mediterranean Californian
    climate. The White Sands Missile Range site (32.9190°N, 106.3510°W) is an arid
    desert site devoid of vegetation and commonly used for satellite sensor radiometric
    calibration (Thome, 2001). Consequently, the NDVI is consistently low all year
    around. Only four sites are shown here due to space constraints and they by no
    means represent the full range of CONUS surface phenology (Morisette et al., 2009)
    but illustrate the potential of the monthly composited mosaic data for time series
    monitoring at 30 m resolution. Download : Download high-res image (257KB) Download

    a new era for utilizing Landsat data; users are no longer restricted by data costs
    to selection of acquisitions with low cloud cover, rather, with the advent of
    free Landsat data it becomes feasible to analyze and process long-term and/or
    large-area Landsat data sets. For example, a total of 6521 Landsat acquisitions
    were used to generate the monthly, seasonal and annual composited mosaics of the
    CONUS described in this paper; this data volume would have cost nearly four million
    US dollars when each Landsat acquisition was priced at six hundred dollars (Reichhardt,
    2002). The research described in this paper represents preliminary results of
    a project with the goal of providing consistent continental scale 30 m Landsat
    long-term data records. Such data records are needed to monitor land-cover change
    and study Earth system functioning (Gutman et al., 2008, Wulder et al., 2008)
    and may provide a high spatial resolution analogue to the moderate and coarse
    spatial resolution land products generated from the MODIS and AVHRR data streams
    (Justice et al., 2002, Tucker et al., 2005). The generation of long-term Landsat
    data records, for example from 1972 to present, and at continental to global scale,
    is technically feasible using the approach described in this paper but will be
    constrained primarily by Landsat data access and the ability to calibrate and
    geolocate the data in a consistent manner. The challenges to obtaining such consistently
    processed data are not inconsiderable, as the Landsat data reside in different
    international archives with different formats, documentation, and processing.
    The planned Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) will provide an opportunity
    to continue the development of such a long-term large-area data record. The Landsat
    ETM+ processing described in this paper was necessarily designed to enable large
    volume processing. The processing steps included conversion of digital numbers
    to calibrated radiance to top of atmosphere reflectance and brightness temperature,
    per-band radiometric saturation identification, cloud screening, reprojection,
    and compositing. Increasing the compositing period from monthly, to seasonal,
    to annual periods, reduced the percentage of cloudy and missing pixels. Using
    more Landsat 7 ETM+ acquisitions, and also acquisitions from the Landsat 5 Thematic
    Mapper, would further reduce the incidence of missing and cloudy pixels. The monthly,
    seasonal and annual composited mosaic products qualitatively capture CONUS spatio-temporal
    surface variations and expected land surface phenology. Reflectance discontinuities
    remain in the composited mosaics due to factors including the impact of the atmosphere
    and residual clouds, bi-directional reflectance effects associated with variations
    in solar illumination and observation angles, the unavailability of L1T acquisitions
    at path/row coordinates with greater than 40% ACCA cloud cover, and the sensitivity
    of the compositing procedure to these effects. Future research is needed to more
    fully characterize these effects and to implement systematic atmospheric correction
    and radiometric/BRDF normalization, for example, by a fusion of information from
    contemporaneous MODIS Terra data (Roy et al., 2008). The composited mosaic data
    products described in this paper, and software tools to utilize them, are being
    made available via the Internet from the U.S. Landsat Project at http://landsat.usgs.gov/WELD.php.
    This web site is evolving, and more years of composited mosaic products and future
    versions with refined processing will be provided. Acknowledgements This Web-enabled

    paper is part of a long-term effort to introduce precision viticulture in the
    region of Demarcated Region of Douro. It presents the architecture, hardware and
    software of a platform designed for that purpose, called MPWiNodeZ. A major feature
    of this platform is its power-management subsystem, able to recharge batteries
    with energy harvested from the surrounding environment from up to three sources.
    It allows the system to sustain operation as a general-purpose wireless acquisition
    device for remote sensing in large coverage areas, where the power to run the
    devices is always a concern. The MPWiNodeZ, as a ZigBee™ network element, provides
    a mesh-type array of acquisition devices ready for deployment in vineyards. In
    addition to describing the overall architecture, hardware and software of the
    monitoring system, the paper also reports on the performance of the module in
    the field, emphasising the energy issues, crucial to obtain self-sustained operation.
    The testing was done in two stages: the first in the laboratory, to validate the
    power management and networking solutions under particularly severe conditions,
    the second stage in a vineyard. The measurements about the behaviour of the system
    confirm that the hardware and software solutions proposed do indeed lead to good
    performance. The platform is currently being used as a simple and compact yet
    powerful building block for generic remote sensing applications, with characteristics
    that are well suited to precision viticulture in the DRD region. It is planned
    to be used as a network of wireless sensors on the canopy of vines, to assist
    in the development of grapevine powdery mildew prediction models. Previous article

    deviceRemote sensingEnergy harvesting 1. Introduction Precision agriculture (PA)
    and precision viticulture (PV) are production systems that promote variable management
    practices within a field according to site conditions. The concept is based on
    new tools and information sources provided by modern technologies, such as yield
    monitoring devices, soil, plant and pest sensors and remote sensing. Despite the
    benefits, such diversity is currently restraining the rate of adoption of these
    technological tools, which varies considerably from country to country, and from
    region to region (Seelan et al., 2003). The Demarcated Region of Douro (DRD) (a
    UNESCO World Heritage Site and the oldest Wine Demarcated Region of the World),
    due to its unique characteristics, poses very specific challenges, mainly due
    to the topographic profile, pronounced climatic variations and complex soil characteristics.
    Grape harvest and disease predictions as well as the assessment of the grape value
    are currently left to the grape growers, without the help of decision-support
    mechanisms, in an environment where no significant irrigation systems exists.
    In order to improve the quantity and quality of winegrowers’ products, an array
    of sensors that monitors the environmental, climatic and physiological parameters
    is needed. The on-going technological developments in the miniaturization of electronic
    devices and wireless communication technology have led to the emergence of Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN). The power necessary to effectively run the related circuitry
    is currently being scaled down, with the help of energy harvested from the environment
    where the devices are deployed. Strictly speaking, WSN are arrays of electronic
    devices with sensing capabilities that are interconnected using a radio network.
    Many architectures exist, ranging from micro-devices with embedded smart sensors
    to complete self-powered acquisition devices that support a large variety of external
    sensors (Morais et al., 1996, Gomide et al., 2001, Beckwith et al., 2004, Delin
    et al., 2005, Hart and Martinez, 2006). Regarding network support, many protocols
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee and proprietary forms of radio network interconnections
    exist (Lee et al., 2002, Beckwith et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2006). There are
    several key issues to address when selecting a suitable technology for wireless
    data transfer. One of the most important criteria is the network support, usually
    determined by the application target, which limits the available offer. Other
    key factors include data transfer rates and power consumption. Many stand-alone
    radio-frequency transceivers are suited for cable replacement (point-to-point
    connections), often using proprietary protocols to enhance data transfer reliability.
    However, in these RF devices, mesh-type networks are usually not supported due
    to the complexity of the software implementation. The well known IEEE 802.11 family
    of standards is able to handle very high data rates, which however imply power-demanding
    devices. The IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth) standard, although capable of supporting
    a Personal Area Network (PAN), is primarily intended for cable replacement solutions.
    It does have the capability to form small star-type networks known as piconets
    and scatternets. Within these networks, a master device performs synchronisation
    between all connected slaves, rendering high data rates and continuous data transfers
    possible. Although interesting to deal with a limited number of nodes, it has
    not been widely adopted for the deployment of large arrays of sensing devices
    in crops, mainly due to power demands and restrictions on the number of nodes
    and connections. In contrast, the ZigBee environment has been specifically developed
    to address the demands of sensor networks, including the need to handle a large
    number of nodes. ZigBee builds upon the physical (PHY) and medium access control
    (MAC) layers defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE, 2003), enabling the
    creation of complex ad hoc networks with up to 65536 devices, suitable for industrial,
    agricultural, vehicular, residential and medical environments. The intent of IEEE
    802.15.4 is to provide ultra low power consumption and very short wake-up times
    capabilities at very low cost to devices operating in a Low Rate (250 kbps) Wireless
    Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN). To this effect, the IEEE 802.15.4 assumes that
    the data transmitted are short and that transmissions occur at a low-duty cycle
    (active/sleep times ratio), reducing the overall power needs and enabling the
    application of battery–powered embedded systems. The ZigBee standard defines the
    network layer specification to allow the formation of three network topologies:
    star, tree and peer-to-peer. In the latter topology, also known as mesh-type,
    every network element can communicate with any other within its range. This allows
    more complex network formations to be implemented, such as ad hoc and self-configuring
    networks. These should contain a unique coordinator, responsible for managing
    all the PAN functionalities and, for instance, retrieving all relevant data from
    the ZigBee network. This mesh-type topology, which relies on the routing mechanisms
    for multi-hop provided by the network layer, is a key element for wireless networks
    of smart acquisition devices in the field. ZigBee also defines the type of device
    based on the set of functions that is enabled to perform. The Full-Function Device
    (FFD) can act as a router while the Reduced-Function Device (RFD) is usually an
    end-device that is only allowed to communicate with its router or coordinator.
    In addition, ZigBee also provides a framework for application programming in the
    application layer. More details on ZigBee/802.15.14 networks can be found in the
    survey (Baronti et al., 2007) and in (IEEE, 2003). Currently, ZigBee is a promising
    solution to enhance the development of ad hoc multi-hop sensor networks, and a
    lot of research effort is being invested in adopting and finding new solutions
    for almost every kind of monitoring purpose (Jinsheng et al., 2006). However,
    agricultural production systems suffer from the usual delay in the application
    of these highly innovative technologies. Among the several aspects that constrain
    these developments we mention the issues related to power management and availability,
    and the ease with which the systems can be deployed in an open field. This paper
    addresses some of these challenges and describes a ZigBee multi-powered wireless
    acquisition device, designed to be part of the remote sensing project of introducing
    PV in the Demarcated Region of Douro. The system represents an evolution over
    the SPWAS (Morais et al., 1996) acquisition station, contributing to make highly
    flexible acquisition systems available for application in PV and remote sensing.
    Its features include the ability to harvest energy from the environment, in multiple
    ways. It also contains a software-based method that prevents automatically switched-off
    nodes from being switched-on soon after, as their batteries charge again. Such
    cycles have a negative impact on the battery life, and are more difficult and
    expensive to avoid via hardware. The need to deal with network discovery/connectivity
    failures and avoid repetitive and wasteful connection attempts is also addressed.
    The paper describes the overall architecture of this monitoring system (Section
    2), then the hardware (Section 3) and software (Section 4) of the basic module
    around which the system is built, and then reports on the performance of the module
    in the field, emphasising the energy issues, which are crucial to obtain self-sustained
    operation. This is the main experimental part of the paper (Section 5), and the
    results obtained confirm that the hardware and software solutions proposed in
    the paper do indeed lead to good performance. The conclusions and lessons that
    were learned in the process are discussed in detail in Section 6, which closes
    the paper. 2. Remote sensing wireless network for precision viticulture The layout
    of hillside vineyards in the DRD is strongly conditioned by the original slope
    and relief of the parcels of vines. Also, the soil is mainly based on complex
    schist which imposes some constrains in the assessment of its hydrological aspects.
    The unique characteristics of these vineyards, as well as the topographic aspects,
    erosion control, vertical planting, the intrinsic limited water availability,
    and wide temperature span across all day and year, demand the most recent technological
    tools, such as distributed monitoring and information processing. These may help
    in understanding vineyard variability and therefore how it might be managed, thus
    improving the quantity and quality of the wines. A good example of using WSN as
    a key tool to understand productivity variability can be found in Camilli et al.
    (2007). As an increasing number of electronic devices with various types of sensors
    are embedded in agricultural processes, efficient system integration has become
    a critical goal. The huge amount of data retrieved by intensive field data acquisition
    needs to be centralized and made available on the web, by using for instance geographical
    information systems (GIS). On a regional, or even at a global scale, large plantation
    infrastructures are the result of the interconnection of multiple local plantations,
    which is the DRD dominant scenario regarding vineyards. Such a distributed platform,
    which incorporates information from remote sensing, from in situ weather conditions,
    from water source levels, from soil history, and from farmer knowledge about the
    relative productivity of selected “Management Zones” of the vineyard, can be applied,
    for instance, to predict yield and diseases, and to disseminate advice throughout
    the growing season about the optimum usage of water and the chemical treatments
    needed. To address the relevant issues regarding the deployment of such a monitoring
    network in the DRD with its specificities, we propose a remote sensing network
    architecture, depicted in a simplified way in Fig. 1. The MPWiNodeZ, as a self-sustaining
    smart acquisition device, aims to enhance in-field data gathering and to give
    network support to systems such as those described in (Valente et al., 2006).
    For each vineyard management zone (VMZ), a ZigBee network of MPWiNodeZ devices
    can be deployed to acquire data on soil moisture content, soil temperature, air
    temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation, among other parameters. The
    cluster head (CH) operates as a local (or VMZ) sink node for this wireless sensor
    network. This creates an intermediate level of aggregation nodes that manages
    the sensor networks and performs local data integration and supervision functions,
    while maintaining connectivity through the whole region. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Illustration of the on-going implementation of an in-field data
    acquisition network, based on a ZigBee network of MPWiNodeZ devices in a precision
    viticulture environment. Since each wine making company may have vineyards located
    in any location of the DRD, the connectivity between each VMZ and the company
    office headquarters (shippers’ office in Fig. 1) represents an important issue
    that must be addressed. To this effect, the clusters are wirelessly linked to
    the shippers’ office through a TCP/IP-based connection such as GPRS and 802.11
    links. To accommodate the disparate data sources from vineyards and its surrounding
    environment, each acquisition device should also have a high degree of flexibility
    concerning the types of sensors allowed. To accomplish this goal, the common signal
    conditioning procedures of acquiring voltage-, current-, frequency- and resistance-output
    sensors have been complemented with a small set of IEEE 1451 standards to include
    information about each sensor in a Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS). Each
    acquisition device has the necessary computing power to verify and validate its
    own data and convert them to international units, thus reducing the amount of
    processing at the aggregation node that could have hundreds of devices connected.
    Fig. 2 illustrates the application of a ZigBee network to enhance remote sensing
    in a PV environment. For simplicity, only one parameter is shown for each network
    element. In the case of the MPWiNodeZ device, up to nine parameters can be measured.
    The experimental results reported in this paper show that the power management
    and networking solutions adopted do work in practice, both in the laboratory and
    in the field. The MPWiNodeZ devices will be used to deploy a network of wireless
    sensors on the canopy of vines, which will be used as a tool to develop models
    to predict the development of grapevine powdery mildew. Download : Download full-size

    topology for environment monitoring purposes. 3. The MPWiNodeZ acquisition device
    In order to better understand various issues in deploying a wireless sensor network
    in remote sensing of environmental parameters, we have developed a prototype system
    that satisfies the requirements for self-sustaining network nodes in agricultural
    environments. The MPWiNodeZ (Multi-Powered Wireless Node ZigBee) device is a small
    custom board aimed to act as a router or as an end-device in ZigBee networks.
    It is based on the MPWiNodeX, a generic power-management platform that enables
    self-sustaining devices. A similar device, denoted MPWiNodeS, based on an off-the-shelf
    RF transceiver (RC1280 from Radiocrafts, Norway), has also been developed and
    tested to enable simple star-type networks on a proprietary environment with the
    main purpose of evaluating and characterizing the power-management platform. The
    MPWiNodeZ can manage up to three simultaneously energy sources to charge a compact
    pack of three 1/2 AA-size 650 mAh NiMH batteries. The MPWiNodeZ is built around
    two varieties of waterproof encapsulations to support the harsh environment that
    an open field presents to any electronic device. The power-management hardware
    and software systems were carefully designed to withstand the operating conditions.
    To achieve maximum flexibility, the system recharges its batteries using energy
    harvested from the surrounding environment, from up to three sources (photonic
    energy, kinetic energy from moving water in irrigation pipes and from wind), avoiding
    maintenance and human interference. The MPWiNodeZ device combines these energy
    harvesting methods with a power-conservative software application that avoids
    the repetitive use of the available radio channels when joining an existent network,
    thus extending battery autonomy. The embedded software application is ready for
    the implementation of the IEEE 1451 object model to achieve a higher degree of
    sensor interoperability. The core of the MPWiNodeZ is a wireless μ-controller
    (JN5121 from Jennic, UK) that comprises an 802.15.4 RF transceiver and the ZigBee
    stack. Besides the embedded communications capabilities, this platform has also
    been chosen to provide reliable signal conditioning to raw sensors and subsequent
    data processing. To this effect, it is intended to employ a scaled-down version
    of the IEEE 1451.1 object model for smart sensors, thus promoting a well-defined
    communication protocol for high-level sensor-to-network interaction. 3.1. Hardware
    overview The MPWiNodeZ device offers a rich and flexible set of functions that
    enables a wide range of sensors to be plugged in, regardless of its computation
    and communication capabilities with minimal power consumption. By employing the
    IEEE 1451.1 object model, the MPWiNodeZ device can use this standardized procedure
    to convert raw data from low-cost analog sensors into meaningful information.
    The same approach has also been followed in Oostdyk et al. (2006) and Ding et
    al. (2007), where the implementation of the IEEE 1451 has been simplified to a
    high-level communication between two ZigBee devices (the coordinator and the MPWiNodeZ),
    each one acting as a Network Capable Application Processor (NCAP). The JN5121
    wireless μ-controller has been chosen as a cost-effective solution. This highly
    integrated device integrates a 32-bit RISC processor, with a fully compliant 2.4
    GHz IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver, 64 kb of ROM, 96 kb of RAM, and incorporates a
    wide range of digital and analogue peripherals. With a low sleep current (below
    5 μA), the JN5121 provides a versatile solution for wireless sensor networking
    applications. The block diagram of the MPWiNodeZ device is depicted in Fig. 3.
    Besides the μ-controller, it comprises an external 12-bit, A/D converter (AD7888
    from Analog Devices, MA, USA). The AD7888 is a micro-power (3 μW in power-down
    mode) ADC with serial interface that operates from a single 2.7 V power supply.
    It contains eight single-ended analog inputs and features an on-chip 2.5 V precision
    reference that may be used (software selectable) for the voltage reference for
    A/D conversion instead of using the supply voltage. The power-management block
    is responsible for charging the system battery-pack and additionally it provides
    data on energy harvested from environment. External sensors are powered by a separate
    DC–DC converter (MAX710 from Maxim, CA, USA) that converts the battery voltage
    into a regulated 5 V or 3.3 V output, pin selectable. This converter is turned
    on only when needed, otherwise it remains in the shutdown mode. A photograph of
    the MPWiNodeZ device can be seen in Fig. 4. Download : Download full-size image

    4. Photograph of an MPWiNodeZ device. 3.2. Energy harvesting and power management
    When considering an array of sensing devices that are deployed across an extensive
    agricultural area, the energy supply system is a crucial issue. The traditional,
    yet most used approach is to use batteries, rechargeable or not. However, these
    energy reservoirs can store a finite amount of energy, and their replacement and
    maintenance represents a severe bottleneck. An emerging technique that circumvents
    this limitation is environmental energy harvesting that exploits energy sources
    that are ubiquitous to the operating space (Raghunathan et al., 2006). In the
    present application target, and regarding availability, the most feasible harvesting
    techniques are related to solar and kinetic energy sources. The power requirements
    of the MPWiNodeZ device are mostly satisfied by a low-voltage 0.5 W solar panel
    (MSX005 from Solarex, MD, USA), which is used to efficiently charge a compact
    3.6 V 650 mAh NiMH battery-pack. With only this energy source and reservoir, the
    MPWiNodeZ would operate indefinitely, due to its low-duty cycle operation as a
    ZigBee end-device. However, this turns out to be insufficient to permanently run
    a device operating as a network router. To this effect, supplementary kinetic
    energy is harvested from water and wind flow. In the first case, power is provided
    by a hydrogenerator placed in the irrigation pipes (which we regard as being similar
    to a power outlet in the field) and, in the second case, by a small wind-powered
    generator. Fig. 5 shows photographs of the energy harvesters that have been used.

    device: (a) the small (60 mm diameter by 200 mm height) 6-blade Savonious design
    wind generator; (b) the commercial hydrogenerator designed to be used in smart
    gas-based water heating appliances and (c) the 0.5 W low-voltage solar panel.
    In addition to providing power, the associated harvesting techniques double as
    sensors, yielding data on the amount of solar radiation, water flow and wind speed.
    Fig. 6 shows the simplified power-management block where, besides the main function
    of recharging the system battery, it also supplies data on the amount of solar
    radiation, wind speed and irrigation water flow as a density of pulses related
    with each parameter. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. MPWiNodeZ simplified
    power-management block. Each pulse sequence is applied to a 4:1 precision multiplexer
    (MAX4618 from Maxim, CA, USA), which selects the signal to be filtered (by R1
    and C1 in Fig. 7), in order to generate its mean value. Prior to analog-to-digital
    conversion, this DC value is amplified by a factor of two, using a fixed-gain
    operational amplifier (MAX4174 from Maxim, CA, USA). Due to its low power consumption,
    this amplifier is simply powered from a digital output of the μ-controller. In
    addition, and since each power-management output signals are open-drain, the other
    part of the 4:1 multiplexer is used to connect the appropriate pull-up resistor.
    By using this approach, based on the use of the same components for all inputs,
    the related measurement chain can be disconnected thus saving energy. Download

    signals. 4. Software organization The MPWiNodeZ was built around the ZigBee standard,
    to give wireless networking capabilities to the acquisition devices. Monitoring
    needs, regarding the hypothetical sensing devices that may be attached as well
    as the sampling interval required for each of them, have dictated the implementation
    of a high-level application protocol. For instance, every attached sensor may
    have different operating rules that must be transferred, stored and applied by
    each MPWiNodeZ device. In addition, power-management issues should be addressed
    to avoid any kind of unpredicted behaviour, such as unreliable battery operation.
    4.1. Operation mode The software was designed to meet the demands of battery-operated
    systems. One major concern is the possibility of system oscillations, or more
    precisely system on and off cycles, caused by partially charged batteries. The
    cycles are usually triggered by a battery voltage drop, a consequence of nearly
    drained batteries. The voltage drop leads to the system being turned off. The
    battery voltage then rises again, because the load is removed, and the system
    may be switched on again, and so on. The traditional approach to prevent this
    undesirable oscillating situation is to add some hysteresis to the power-management
    circuits. In the case of the MPWiNodeZ device, the solution was implemented in
    software, and completely avoids the oscillation problem. The application code
    (developed under the Jennic CodeBlocks environment) that was implemented in MPWiNodeZ
    device follows the generic state machine represented in Fig. 8. After a power-on,
    the hardware is properly configured and left in a state of minimum current consumption,
    State 0. After this very first initialization stage, a sleep time T1 is used before
    going to State 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Overview of the
    MPWiNodeZ state machine implementation. State 1 represents the idle state where
    the battery voltage level is monitored. Every T2 s, the system wakes-up and samples
    the battery voltage level. If the battery level is higher than a predetermined
    value, the system goes to State 2 after the sleep time T3, otherwise remains in
    State 1. After switching to State 1, which means that the battery has enough energy,
    the MPWiNodeZ device tries to discover a nearby router or coordinator for binding.
    If successful, it is assumed that the acquisition device has the sufficient conditions
    to operate normally and tries, after the short time T4, to join the existing ZigBee
    network (State 3) in order to acquire and store the network parameters for later
    use. If discovery and joining conditions are not met, it returns to the idle state
    after the sleep time T10. State 4 reflects the data acquisition and transmission
    tasks. The first time that the MPWiNodeZ device goes to this state (on the transition
    3 → 4), it waits the fixed sleep time T5. The sub-states 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4
    (separated by the time T6) are responsible for setting the necessary timing tasks
    in the data acquisition process (sensors power-on time, capture period, etc.).
    At the end (sub-state 4.4), the 802.15.4 radio system of the μ-controller is powered
    on (T7 interval) to send the acquired data using the saved network parameters.
    If an acknowledgement is received from the network layer (indicating that data
    has been transferred to the nearby router or coordinator), the MPWiNodeZ enters
    in sleep mode during the time T9 that represents the time between data samples,
    user defined. In case of failure, it returns to State 1. Besides the above-mentioned,
    states 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 have additional conditions (dashed curves in Fig. 8),
    concerning battery voltage levels, that must be met. Whenever the battery voltage
    falls below a predetermined value, the MPWiNodeZ returns directly to the idle
    mode waiting for the battery to be operative. Table 1 shows these time intervals
    (used by default) and gives a short description for each one. Table 1. Time intervals

    and configuration One of the goals of the MPWiNodeZ device is to promote the on-board
    extraction of meaningful information about the raw sensors that can be connected.
    To this effect, and as a first step to adopt the IEEE 1451 family of standards
    concerning smart sensors, the 1451.0 definition of TEDS is used, mainly to convert
    raw data into metadata. As a result of this implementation, the MPWiNodeZ is able
    to perform some local processing tasks and return meaningful sensor data over
    the network such as the sensor value of the measured parameter in engineering
    units, rather than the unprocessed, raw result of an analog-to-digital conversion.
    The TEDS is an electronic data sheet in a standardized format stored in the μ-controller
    flash memory that describes each attached transducer through the Transducer Interface
    Module (TIM). Since the MPWiNodeZ has a total input capability of 9 channels (8
    analog inputs and a digital counter input), each channel in the TIM must be described.
    For that purpose, a channel TEDS was developed. It contains information of each
    transducer such as the transducer type, range limits, physical units and timing
    restrictions. In this first step to adopt IEEE1451, each channel TEDS was stored
    in the μ-controller flash memory only during the programming process. If some
    transducer attached to some input channel is changed, a new programming procedure
    is needed. In the near future, we intend to upload each TEDS through the wireless
    network. Beside the characterization of each transducer, the behaviour of the
    entire MPWiNodeZ device should also be defined. In our implementation, it is defined
    by a set of functional rules. These rules occupies only four bytes (valid for
    MPWiNodeZ and MPWiNodeS devices), thus being suitable to upload through the ZigBee
    network. Table 2 shows the bit coding of these 4-byte rules, where a short description
    is also given. Table 2. The 4-byte rules that defines the MPWiNodeZ operation

    settings virtually define the full-operation mode of each networked MPWiNodeZ
    device. Besides the usual procedure of enabling each data acquisition channel
    sampling and time window between each sampling procedure, they also allow other
    important settings such as the definition of the transmit power level that may
    be used. When in automatic mode, each MPWiNodeZ device uses the Link Quality Indication
    (LQI) of the wireless μ-controller to adjust the transmitted power, thus optimizing
    energy usage during each data transfer. The identification of the sender also
    poses specific problems that must be addressed. When working with a mesh-type
    network topology, sender identification is not always possible (an example is
    when the sender is more than two hops from the coordinator). To overcome this
    issue, we have decided to transmit the sender identification along with sensor
    data. Fig. 9 shows the ZigBee protocol KVP (Key Value Pair) frame used in data
    transmission. Essentially, our ZigBee payload comprises the sender identification,
    the 4-byte device operating rules and data payload flowing between the MPWiNodeZ
    device and the network coordinator. This data payload field contains the data
    acquired from the attached sensors as well as the time stamp which will be discussed
    in the next section. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. ZigBee Application
    Framework frame format used in the MPWiNodeZ device. 4.3. Time stamp Time synchronization
    is a common requirement for wireless sensor networks since it allows collective
    signal processing, sensor and source localization, data aggregation, and distributed
    sensing (Milenković et al., 2006). In some applications of wireless personal area
    networks, synchronized time stamps are critical for proper correlation of data
    coming from different sensors and for an efficient sharing of the communication
    channel. Time stamping is also important in the case of intermittent communication
    within multi-hop networks that can significantly postpone transmission of the
    sensors’ data. Remote sensing in precision agriculture is one example of a networking
    sensing application where real-time requirements are not strict. Due to the process
    inertia, most of the measurements are commonly taken with a time base of several
    minutes, which relaxes the algorithms that provide a time stamp for each data
    sample. Such time scales are appropriate for parameters such as air and soil temperature,
    relative humidity, soil moisture, solar radiation, precipitation, wind speed and
    sap flow. For the planned sensing network applications of the MPWiNodeZ device,
    the time stamps do not require precision of seconds; 1 min is a typical value.
    The time stamp is usually tagged to a data sample by the ZigBee coordinator every
    time that a data frame is received. However, a more flexible mechanism has been
    added in order to support acquisition devices that have an embedded Real-Time
    Clock (RTC). The general idea is to add a time stamp as soon as possible, at the
    origin of the data if at all possible. If the MPWiNodeZ device uses a low-power
    RTC (in our case DS1302 from Dallas Semiconductor, CA, USA), a valid time stamp
    data is immediately transmitted to the coordinator. If not, the time stamp is
    reset to 0, indicating that the next node must insert it. A network router with
    RTC hardware capabilities may have to insert all the time stamps if none of the
    nodes have the mechanism for doing so. Otherwise, the insertion of the time stamp
    is left to the network coordinator. Fig. 10 illustrates the described process
    where the seconds field in the time stamp is used for illustration purposes only.
    In this example, device A takes some measurements at Coordinator Time (CT) 15:43:28.
    Since device A does not have a RTC, it simply clears the time stamp field. Device
    C, which has a RTC, receives the data payload at CT 15:43:36, inserting that time
    in the time stamp field. Finally, the data reaches the coordinator at CT 15:43:40,
    which inserts the samples values in the internal database with the 15:43 time
    stamp. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Illustration of the insertion
    of a time stamp in the MPWiNodeZ acquired data. 5. Experimental results In order
    to properly evaluate the MPWiNodeZ device, a two-phase experimental methodology
    was used. It validates the power-management solutions during all active time periods
    (acquisition, processing, transmission and reception), and tests the operational
    issues regarding software implementation of the state machine under critical network
    conditions. The first phase took place in a controlled laboratorial environment,
    where a small ZigBee network was formed by using a coordinator (connected to a
    laptop through a RS232 link), two network routers (one hop away from the coordinator)
    and two MPWiNodeZ devices (as the one shown in Fig. 4) as end-devices, each connected
    to its router. The second experimental phase was performed under real operating
    conditions in a nearby vineyard. To this effect, an MPWiNodeZ was used to acquire
    air and soil temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation data, as depicted
    in Fig. 11. To test the discovery and joining procedures of the ZigBee application
    framework, two routers (actually two MPWiNodeZ devices running the router application
    software) were used in between the MPWiNodeZ under test and the coordinator (located
    in the laboratory). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Photograph of
    an MPWiNodeZ device used in environment monitoring in a vineyard (air and soil
    temperature, solar radiation and relative humidity in this case). The main goal
    of the first stage experiments was the validation of all software solutions, including
    the described state machine and the evaluation of the power-management platform
    in low-duty cycle operation modes and under critical situations, such as the power-up
    conditions after a battery charging cycle has been initiated. The handling of
    these situations usually requires a large amount of power that we needed to quantify
    and measure, especially when running network discovery/joining procedures. Because
    this first stage of the experimental setup exercises the system under particularly
    severe conditions, it provides important insight about the deployment of ZigBee-based
    systems running on batteries charged from energy harvested from the surrounding
    environment. In order to take proper and representative waveforms of battery voltage
    and current consumption profiles, this evaluation had to be performed in the laboratory.
    To best describe real operating conditions, several low-power analog sensors were
    used: three temperature sensors for measuring two air and one soil temperature
    (LM60B from National Semiconductor, CA, USA), one relative humidity sensor (HybridCap
    from Panametrics, USA) and two solar radiation sensors (TSL251 and TSL230 both
    from Texas Instruments, USA). The sampling rate of acquired data was kept randomly
    variable between 30 s and 30 min to create several battery discharging profiles.
    Fig. 12 shows the first cycle starting from the power-up condition (state 0) until
    the acknowledge has been received after a successful data transmission (state
    5). The power supply current was measured by using a precision 6 1/2 digit multimeter
    (Keithley model 2000) with data logging capabilities connected to a computer.
    For this purpose, the maximum number of data points allowed (1000) was used. To
    fit this power consumption profile into a 1000-point window with sufficient resolution
    to also describe system operation throughout the entire cycle, the time periods
    between states were reduced, specifically T1 = T3 = T5 = 7 s. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 12. Power supply current profile for a normal data cycle.
    As can be observed from Fig. 12, the total time between State 2 and the end of
    State 3 is approximately 2 s (T4), which represents the most power-demanding period.
    In fact, during this period the MPWiNodeZ device must search an available network
    and issue a joining request. In order to save a significant amount of battery
    energy, it is only allowed a one-shot joining process. If it fails, the system
    will resume T10 + T3 later, according to Fig. 8. After this stage, where the network
    parameters are acquired and saved for later use, the first acquisition task will
    be triggered T5 later. For normal operation, the acquisition process will then
    be repeated every T9 s. Under the application scope of the MPWiNodeZ device, T9
    may take values of the order of several minutes. With a reasonable value of 10
    min, probably even greater, a coarse average current consumption would be given
    by (1) where I′ corresponds to the average current of the active period (State
    4.4 → State 5). Considering T′ ≈ T8 = 2 s, T9 = 600 s, I′ ∼ 40 mA and the measured
    sleep current I9 = 0.11 mA, the expression (1) leads to the average value of 243
    μA. Fig. 13 illustrates the case when no network is available at that time. As
    expected, the MPWiNodeZ fails the discovery/joining process and continues to try
    every T10 + T3, assuming that the battery has enough energy. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Power supply current profile during the discovery and
    joining network procedures. During this process, and considering a current consumption
    of 50 mA during T4 and 110 μA otherwise (sleep times T10 and T3), the average
    value of current consumption is given by (2) which for the intended application
    scope with T10 = 120 s, T3 = 120 s and T4 = 2 s, results in an average current
    consumption of approximately 522 μA. During the normal acquisition process, initiated
    on State 4, the μ-controller checks the battery conditions and loads from memory
    the operational rules that specify which channels to be sampled. Fig. 14 shows
    some waveforms that illustrate this procedure. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 14. Data acquisition-related waveforms. The DC–DC converter that supplies
    the external sensors is turned-on during approximately 100 ms in order to stabilize
    the voltage output. After this time, external sensors are sampled by the analog-to-digital
    converter which will enter automatically in a sleep mode after the required conversions.
    At the same time, if rules apply, the multiplexer is enabled to start averaging
    the pulse outputs from the power-management block (solar panel in this case).
    The bottom waveforms of Fig. 14 show this procedure. During this enable period,
    a pulse train appears at the output of the multiplexer in order to be filtered.
    After the necessary voltage stabilisation time, the amplifier is powered on, supplying
    the signal <PULSESP>, which is amplified by a factor of two, to the μ-controller
    internal ADC. The time that the multiplexer is enabled can also be observed in
    Fig. 12 after the State 4. As can be seen, at the end of time T5, the sensors
    are turned on and data acquired. After that, the μ-controller enables the multiplexer
    and goes sleep mode again. After a period of 2 s, it wakes and turns on the amplifier
    (current consumption has risen from 110 μA to 400 μA). After the acquisition,
    the MPWiNodeZ performs all computations and send the data samples over the ZigBee
    network. After the first evaluation phase, one MPWiNodeZ device, still operating
    as an RFD, was tested as an acquisition device operating under real conditions,
    as seen in Fig. 11, and sending real-time data over a ZigBee network. The objective
    of this second evaluation phase was the validation of the described state machine
    but under operation as a ZigBee network router. For this evaluation scenario,
    the ZigBee network topology has changed to one coordinator, two network routers
    (both MPWiNodeZ, one being under evaluation) and an end-device (located in the
    vineyard). The power supply current consumption of the router device has been
    traced and is shown in Fig. 15, where it can be seen the router joining process
    (first 2 s). After this first stage, the MPWiNodeZ operates as expected, routing
    packets from the end-device to the coordinator and vice-versa. As can be seen,
    a current consumption of almost 50 mA at all times places significant demands
    on the power-management system, which may need an energy supplement harvested
    from the surrounding environment. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 15.
    Power supply current consumption of the MPWiNodeZ device as a router. Fig. 16
    shows the battery voltage profile of the MPWiNodeZ device located in the vineyard.
    The battery was charged by the low-power solar panel that was also used to measure
    the solar irradiance. The result of this measurement is illustrated as the <PULSESP>
    value, which is only showed for battery correlation purposes. In this 6-day window,
    the battery was kept in the charging mode until its voltage reaches almost 4.2
    V. When it happens, the software procedure keeps the battery in a float condition
    providing a trickle charge mechanism. Data were received by the ZigBee coordinator
    at intervals of 60 s, which we consider the most demanding condition in practice,
    considering the scope of this MPWiNodeZ application. The battery voltage profile
    depicted in Fig. 16 has been determined in low–medium solar irradiance values
    (less than 100 W/m2), the batteries being charged with this energy source only.
    As can be seen, even with a data transmission every 60 s, the battery voltage
    was always above 3.9 V. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Battery voltage

    conclusions We have shown the feasibility of a ZigBee-based remote sensing network,
    intended for precision viticulture in the Demarcated Region of Douro. The network
    nodes are powered by batteries that are recharged with energy harvested from the
    environment. The power-management aspects have been found to be particularly critical,
    the main issues being the on–off cycles caused by partially charged batteries,
    and connectivity/network failures that lead to repeatedly unsuccessful connection
    attempts. We have designed the nodes to deal correctly with these issues, and
    tested the correctness of the solutions adopted by testing the nodes under particularly
    severe conditions. The testing and deployment of the devices was a two stage process.
    In the first stage, the devices were tested in the laboratory to validate the
    solutions that had been implemented, with particular emphasis on the power-management
    aspects. The power consumption profiles measured during the tests validated the
    software-based solution, based on a finite state machine. The second and final
    stage was the deployment of a network of devices in the field (see Fig. 11), a
    vineyard, with the cooperation of a winegrower. All results obtained so far confirm
    that the system works as envisaged, and operates reliably. We have concluded that
    the system nodes are able to sustain themselves based on solar energy alone; in
    other words, a ZigBee-based sensor network powered by batteries recharged by solar
    energy alone is feasible, if the networking and power-management issues are handled
    as proposed. No new hardware or software issues appeared when operating the system
    in the field. The system is in principle also able to harvest kinetic energy from
    wind and water in pipes. However, testing of these harvesting techniques has not
    been performed, for two reasons: first, these energy sources are more relevant
    to routers, which need a permanent energy supply, than to network nodes, which
    are less critical and can shut themselves off if necessary. Second, the performance
    of the nodes was our main concern and the main purpose of our study. The system
    was endowed with the possibility of harvesting from both solar and kinetic energy
    sources in anticipation of future applications, including for example applications
    in greenhouses. A router placed inside a greenhouse would clearly benefit from
    harvesting kinetic energy from water in pipes inside the greenhouse itself. The
    router current consumption of 50 mA would drain fully charged 650 mAh batteries
    in less than 13 h. The fact that the amount of solar energy is likely to be reduced
    by the filtering effect of the greenhouse itself provides additional motivation
    to consider alternate energy sources. The testing of the router and nodes under
    such circumstances is planned and will be reported in a future work. Acknowledgments

    Abstract: The application of Information Technologies into Precision Agriculture
    methods has

    clear beneﬁts. Precision Agriculture optimises production efﬁciency, increases
    quality, minimises

    environmental impact and reduces the use of resources (energy, water); however,
    there are different

    barriers that have delayed its wide development.

    Some of these main barriers are expensive

    equipment, the difﬁculty to operate and maintain and the standard for sensor networks
    are still

    under development. Nowadays, new technological development in embedded devices
    (hardware

    and communication protocols), the evolution of Internet technologies (Internet
    of Things) and

    ubiquitous computing (Ubiquitous Sensor Networks) allow developing less expensive
    systems,

    easier to control, install and maintain, using standard protocols with low-power
    consumption.

    This work develops and test a low-cost sensor/actuator network platform, based
    in Internet of

    Things, integrating machine-to-machine and human-machine-interface protocols.
    Edge computing

    uses this multi-protocol approach to develop control processes on Precision Agriculture
    scenarios.

    A greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was developed and tested using Ubiquitous
    Sensor

    Network monitoring and edge control on Internet of Things paradigm. The experimental
    results

    showed that the Internet technologies and Smart Object Communication Patterns
    can be combined to

    encourage development of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts
    (cost, energy,

    smart developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.

    Keywords: precision agriculture; ubiquitous sensor network; internet of things

    1. Introduction

    The integration of information and control technologies in agriculture processes
    is known

    as Precision Agriculture (PA). In order to obtain the greatest optimization and
    proﬁtability PA

    adapts common farming techniques to the speciﬁc conditions of each point of the
    crop, by applying

    different technologies: micro-electro-mechanical Systems, Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN), computer

    systems and enhanced machinery [1]. The right application of this method guarantees
    satisfactory

    results [2]. These technologies can be implemented, among others, in indoor, outdoor
    and

    hydroponics [3] crops; and its management is mainly divided into three stages
    [4]. The ﬁrst one

    is called determination stage, wherein the crop type is identiﬁed and areas thereof
    are clustered based

    on their homogeneity. In this stage, sensors are the devices that analyse the
    characteristics of each area.

    The collected data is processed in the second stage (analysis) by computer systems,
    which establishes

    procedures to apply in each area. Finally, the execution stage is carried out
    by the advanced machinery.

    In the past few years, new trends have emerged in the agricultural sector. Thanks
    to developments

    in the ﬁeld of WSN as well as miniaturization of the sensor boards, PA has started
    to emerge [5–7].

    However, even though there has been considerable progresses in different technological
    areas, few of

    them are focused on the design and implementation of specialized low-cost systems
    for agricultural

    environments [8]. Traditionally, information technologies are available but they
    have not been widely

    introduced in agricultural scenarios: expensive systems and difﬁculties in installing,
    controlling,

    and maintaining these installations are being the main barriers.

    In this regard, new platforms

    particularly directed to remove these barriers are needed. This work proposes
    a solution based on an

    heterogeneous [9] and scalable platform, able to acquire, process, store and monitor
    data from crop

    growing systems using a mobile ubiquitous approach. This approach is developed
    with Ubiquitous

    Sensor Networks (USN) and Internet of Things (IoT) paradigms. The platform is
    specialized in

    crop lands automation maintenance, which aim to control the conditions that determine
    the proper

    development of a crop, such as substrate and atmospheric temperature, luminance,
    atmospheric

    humidity, water PH level, Electric Conductivity (EC); and the actuators management
    which inﬂuence

    these factors. The agricultural processes treated are based in six subsystems
    (Figure 1): crop, soil,

    water, nutrients, climate and energy model.

    Figure 1. Agricultural Production Subsystems.

    This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related works. Information
    Technologies

    applied in PA are reviewed. Section 3, platform speciﬁcations and requirements
    in PA scenarios

    are analysed. A design method is proposed to develop a platform which uses USN
    architecture in

    agricultural production and IoT technologies for the development of effective
    services. Section 4,

    experiments including a prototype development based in an hydroponic installation
    on site are

    analysed and discussed to assess suitability of this method. Finally, Section
    5 provides results

    and conclusions.

    2. Related Work

    PA observes, measures and responds to inter and intra-ﬁeld variability in crops.
    The obtained

    beneﬁts are mainly increased production and proﬁtability. Other beneﬁts come from
    better working

    conditions. Thus, PA contributes to the wider goal concerning sustainability of
    agricultural

    production. The implementation of PA has become possible thanks to the development
    of sensor

    technologies combined with procedures to link mapped variables to appropriate
    farming management

    actions such as cultivation, seeding, fertilization, herbicide application, and
    harvesting. Many sensors

    are currently available and used for data gathering or information provision as
    part of the PA

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    implementation. These devices are designed for both in situ and on-the-go recording.
    Devices

    exist to assess the status of soils, such as apparent EC sensors, gamma-radiometric
    soil sensors,

    and soil moisture devices, among others.

    Others record weather information or micro-climate

    data (thermometer, hygrometer, etc.). Particular importance is given to sensors
    that quantify the

    physiological status of crops (e.g., Nitrogen sensors) [10].

    Sensors have traditionally been essential elements in industrial processes due
    to their ability to

    monitor the physical parameters involved in the different production processes.
    Connectivity between

    them was done using traditional wired networks.

    It is accepted that PA provides beneﬁts, however a number of factors may slow
    down its integration:

    •

    Initial expectations and advantages promised unfulﬁlled. The farming community
    strongly

    endorse the adoption of PA technology to manage variability within paddocks. Nevertheless

    they have become frustrated with the technology, lack of support mainly, and this
    is the main

    impediment for PA to be adopted [11]. At a practical level, farmers need to gain
    the conﬁdence in

    how to deal with variability and work in partnership with PA specialists

    •

    Complexity of technology and incompatibility of components. The rate of adoption
    of PA is

    expected to continue to rise based on greater awareness of the beneﬁts of the
    technology. There are

    constraints to adapt the technical issues with equipment and software and the
    incompatibility of

    equipment with existing farm operations [12].

    •

    Lack of products. The PA integration has been delayed, in part, due to the lack
    of products that

    bring together engineering and agronomics. In [13] this situation has been presented.
    One solution

    (proposed in this paper) is to integrate data collection, data processing, and
    management actions.

    •

    High costs in start-up and maintenance of the facility. There are high start-up
    and maintenance

    costs in PA adoption, in some cases with a risk of insufﬁcient return on the investment.
    In [14],

    German farmers were interviewed about their experiences with PA technology and
    their attitudes

    and barriers towards it, the majority of the interviewed farmers hesitated to
    introduce PA

    techniques mainly because of the high costs of the technology.

    Currently, continuous technological advances have spurred the development of devices

    with wireless communication capabilities, arranged at any location, getting smaller
    and smaller,

    autonomous, more powerful and with a more efﬁcient battery consumption [15]; which
    communicate

    the collected data to a centralized processing station. This is important since
    many network applications

    require hundreds or even thousand of sensor nodes, often deployed in remote and
    inaccessible

    areas. Therefore, a wireless sensor has not only a sensing component, but also
    on-board processing,

    communication, and storage capabilities. With these enhancements, a sensor node
    is often not only

    responsible for data collection but also for in-network analysis correlation,
    and fuses its own sensor

    data from other sensor nodes. When many sensors monitor large physical environments
    cooperatively,

    they form a WSN [16]. Sensor nodes communicate not only with each other but also
    with a base station,

    allowing them to disseminate their data to remote processing, visualization, analysis
    and storage

    systems [17].

    There are some applications based on the IoT paradigm that may be available on
    our smart

    phones and help in agricultural areas to control crops. One of the most promising
    market segments

    in the future, is precisely the use of identiﬁable wireless devices in applications
    related to nature and

    environmental preservation [18].

    The development of WSN applications in PA makes possible to increase efﬁciency,
    productivity

    and proﬁtability in many agricultural production systems, while minimizing unintended
    impacts

    on wildlife and the environment. The real time information obtained from the ﬁelds
    can provide a

    solid base for farmers to adjust strategies at any time. Instead of making decisions
    based in some

    hypothetical average conditions, which may not exist actually anywhere, a precision
    farming approach

    recognizes differences and adjusts management actions accordingly [19].

    The combination of WSN, which are cheaper to implement than wired networks [20],

    with intelligent embedded systems and applying on this combination the technology
    of ubiquitous

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    4 of 20

    systems [21], leads to the development of the design and implementation of low
    cost systems for

    monitoring agricultural environments, which due to its low cost, are optimized
    for developing

    countries and difﬁcult access areas. The state of the art shows different problems
    which need to

    be resolved to achieve full integration of control and information technologies
    in normal activities

    carried out on agriculture.

    2.1. IoT Precision Agriculture

    Initial work is shown in the previous subsection. Different proposals take the
    conventional

    Internet paradigms (web services) and some WSN protocol (Zigbee, Bluetooth, Z-Wave,
    etc.) to built

    new services and platforms. Monitoring applications and cloud services (analysis
    and statistic) are the

    main advantages. In Table 1 main characteristics are shown analysing different
    scientiﬁc works and

    industrial platforms in PA scenarios.

    2.2. First Conclusions

    The ﬁrst conclusions are:

    •

    Current proposals use conventional automated systems on web services.

    •

    Different PA IoT models are proposed using three levels: control, communication
    and application

    layer (cloud services). These models have yet to be put into practice and tested
    with real applications.

    •

    Agricultural production controlled by agronomist and methods to develop low-cost
    prototypes

    are not available.

    •

    Response time controlled on multi-protocol integration is unusual.

    •

    Industrial applications are available. High costs, and the high-level of expertise
    required for

    controlling and maintaining are some of the characteristics of these applications.

    The full potential of these technologies can incorporate new features and improvements
    which

    are as yet undeveloped in real scenarios.

    Response time communication for automated processes.

    Response time controlled using

    IoT sensor/actuator nodes could be distributed in different networks (USN) making
    all devices

    interoperable in control applications. All control devices can use transparently
    any sensor/actuator in

    their control processes. Machine-to-machine (M2M) applications and human machine
    interface (HMI)

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    5 of 20

    could be integrated and adapted to the needs of the users and speciﬁc production.
    M2M will be used on

    automated processes and HMI will be used by agronomists on data monitoring, programming
    events

    with IF...THEN rules and some manual control actions. Methods to develop low cost
    prototypes

    could be designed, easily tested and adapted by agronomist in real agriculture
    production.

    Response time controlled and interoperable sensor/actuator nodes are developed
    using edge

    computing and machine-to-machine (M2M) protocol. With edge computing, a local
    application layer

    is developed to create control rules and process data. With M2M protocol all nodes
    are interoperable

    and edge computing processes can use them.

    3. Network Platform: Design and Development

    The Internet Network was originally designed in a client-server model, where the
    client was

    always the initiator of the request. Devices initiate the communication whenever
    they need to push

    data to the cloud. In IoT applications the server needs to push data to a client
    without the client ﬁrst

    making a request. Web developers have come up with some techniques to overcome
    this challenge.

    Here are three options that we consider more portable to the embedded world:

    •

    Short polling: method where the client periodically connect the server (new data
    are available to

    communicate). This is the simplest solution to code. It is not recommended in
    real time.

    •

    Long polling: the client performs the request and the server do not respond until
    it has something

    to send. This enables real-time push notiﬁcations from the cloud to devices. This
    technique

    consumes more energy and also risks the loss of the connection.

    •

    Adapted protocols: to use newer protocols like Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAp) or

    Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), designed to provide low latency, small
    packet

    sizes and stable communication over weak networks.

    These protocols provide a two-way

    communication channel, which in turn supports push notiﬁcations. This makes them
    good choices

    for IoT projects requiring the ability to control connected devices in real time.
    Firmware libraries

    and examples for embedded devices, normally using HTTP-based connections, are
    required for

    developing new applications.

    Choosing the right protocol depends on IoT application and how much time is needed
    to

    communicate with the devices. Short polling can be favourable in projects where
    the data needs

    to be updated in speciﬁc periods of time. Adapted protocols are optimised for
    control and two-way

    open communication channels. Long polling can be useful in some services of notiﬁcations.

    In this work MQTT protocol is proposed as communication paradigm between sensor/actuator

    devices. Some of the features that makes it especially suitable for this project
    are:

    •

    MQTT is a publish-subscribe messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained
    devices, a

    model already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.

    •

    All messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common
    form is

    /place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers may use
    wild-cards to

    subscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class of device.

    •

    The bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature of the protocol makes
    it very

    energy-efﬁcient.

    •

    Defunct nodes are easily discovered: A publisher can register a «last will and
    testament» which

    the MQTT server sends to the subscribers of a topic after a certain time-out.

    •

    The programming interface is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small,
    making it

    especially suitable for embedded devices.

    •

    Three Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide reliable operations.

    Ubiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication model (Figure 2). Any
    node is able

    to query and be queried by other nodes. In addition, any node may play the role
    of a base station

    (skin node) capable of transmitting its information to remote processing places
    using a gateway device.

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    6 of 20

    USN local nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have
    a global accessibility

    and they offer extended services on an IoT scenario. Local and global access over
    the same node

    (sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities and beneﬁts. Whereas a local
    data processing

    is necessary in basic process control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global
    processing (analytic)

    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the
    proposed platform

    uses both technologies combined: different USN over a local network area (intranet)
    connected to

    cloud-IoT services (internet). A computing layer in local area, called edge computing,
    will serve as

    interface between control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able
    to process data before

    communicating to cloud.

    Figure 2. IoT model used: device-to-gateway pattern (RFC7452).

    3.1. Platform Design: Analysis and Requirements

    Agriculture is a complex system, related to a wide range of environments, which
    is difﬁcult to

    deal perfectly. In all natural or agricultural systems, a hierarchy of levels
    exist [31]. For irrigated crop

    production this hierarchy might be: plant, cropping systems, farming and drainage
    systems.

    Each agricultural subsystem is composed by things (sensor/actuator) that can be
    connected and

    processed using USN and IoT paradigms. The requirements established on the IoT
    platform for PA

    scenarios are:

    1.

    Low-cost elements and low-power consumption of all devices installed improve the
    establishment

    and development.

    2.

    Standard communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.

    3.

    Easy access and maintenance. Users are not specialized in information technologies;
    this can

    improve its acceptability.

    4.

    Support the integration of new smart control modules (modularity and scalability).

    5.

    To ensure interoperability when new devices are required.

    6.

    Non-proprietary hardware-software to reduce dependences.

    The platform communication follows a pattern based in an IoT model: Device-to-gateway

    (RFC7452 [32]). Over this pattern, edge layer computing is developed. The platform
    is based in

    three elements:

    •

    Things. Today there are millions of things (sensors/actuators and devices found
    in commercial

    and industrial settings) connected directly through wireless networks and accessing
    the Internet.

    Usually, the IoT solutions have things ﬁltered and managed using data locally
    and/or connected

    to gateways that provide extended functionality. Basic devices are tagged like
    things. Each thing

    has data that can be shared in the Internet.

    •

    Local Gateway. Most of existing things were not designed to connect to the Internet
    and cannot

    share data with the cloud. To resolve this difﬁculty gateways act as intermediaries
    between things

    and the cloud, providing the needed connectivity, security, and manageability.

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    7 of 20

    •

    Network and Cloud. Cloud infrastructure contains large pools of virtualized servers
    and storage

    that are networked together. IoT solutions run applications that analyse and manage
    data from

    devices and sensors in order to generate services that produce information used
    in decision

    making.

    The device-to-gateway communication pattern can frequently be found with smart
    object

    deployments that require remote conﬁguration capabilities and real time interactions.
    The gateway is

    thereby assumed to be always connected to the Internet.

    However, the gateway can be mobile, i.e., a smart-phone. In these situations connectivity
    between

    the devices and the Internet may be intermittent. This limits the applicability
    of such a communication

    pattern but is very common with wearable and other IoT devices that do not need
    always-on Internet.

    From an interoperability point of view, it is worth noting that smartphones, with
    their sophisticated

    software update mechanism via app stores, allow new functionality to be updated
    regularly at the

    smartphone and sometimes even at the IoT device. With special apps that are tailored
    to each speciﬁc

    IoT device, interoperability is mainly a concerned to the lower layers of the
    protocol stack, such as the

    radio interface, and less so at the application layer.

    3.2. Platform Development

    In order to build a monitoring and control installation on PA scenarios, design
    recommendations

    should be considered. The ﬂow diagram in Figure 3 is the reference model proposed
    to develop

    this type of installations, using IoT paradigm. Agricultural subsystems (crop,
    soil, water, etc.) are

    associated with this model (analysis, control, etc.) to determine development
    requirements. Things

    (sensor/actuators and devices) are inter-operable and are installed in an ecosystem
    based in ubiquitous

    sensor network that use IoT paradigms to communicate and to create cloud services.

    Figure 3. Design and development: project planning.

    The ecosystem proposed is shown in Figure 4. Following platform design model in
    the IoT

    ecosystem, PA processes are developed following different stages:

    •

    Analysis: agronomist and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) technicians
    should

    set the basic goals for the project. Scenarios, objectives and technical needs
    are identiﬁed in

    this phase.

    •

    Design requirements: there are requirements already established on the IoT platform
    (low-cost,

    interoperability, standard communication protocols, easy access and maintenance,
    modularity

    and scalability and non-proprietary dependences). In this phase, these requirements
    are related

    with the requirements of the agricultural installation analysed. A design based
    in things and its

    requirements (compute and communication) is proposed by agricultural and ICT technicians.

    Things and agricultural processes are deﬁned.

    •

    Ubiquitous sensor network: sensors/actuators (things) and its communication/processing

    capabilities should be clearly deﬁned. Also, the intermediary (network access
    nodes) collecting

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    8 of 20

    information from a group of things must be proposed. These nodes facilitate the
    USN network

    access, communicating with a control centre or with external entities. In this
    phase the architecture

    of communication layer is proposed.

    •

    Control Processes: agricultural activities with basic and advanced rules between
    things are

    speciﬁed by agronomists. A technology platform (middleware) to enable the effective
    use of

    a USN in the particular application is proposed by ICT technicians. Control rules
    and things

    relationships are modelled.

    •

    Edge computing: enables analytic and knowledge generation at the source of the
    data. In this

    work, Edge is the layer between data sources and cloud data centers where M2M
    protocol, control,

    data processing and web services are integrated. Edge computing pushes applications,
    data and

    processes away from embedded nodes that control USN to the logical extremes of
    a cloud network.

    •

    Cloud services: monitoring, processing and analytic services, among others, can
    be designed

    in this phase using Internet technologies. Query and analytic layers are also
    deﬁned. Things

    and services are transparent because both cloud and stand-alone cloud use the
    same paradigms,

    technologies and protocols.

    •

    Test and validation:

    things, control processes, USN, Internet communication and Cloud

    applications are tested and validated in real scenarios.

    Figure 4. IoT ecosystem developed. Sensors, actuators and IP access devices make
    up the ubiquitous

    thing layer.

    3.3. Platform Architecture

    Services and activities can be built and distributed in modules localised in local,
    mobile or cloud

    storages. Moreover, things can be used in local installation (sensors, actuators,
    control devices) or

    in mobility (smart-phones, embedded devices). Considering the above, the architecture
    proposed is

    composed by distributed modules (sensors or actuators groups, processes, virtual
    services, storage,

    analytic, etc.) on a basic structure of four layers: Things, Edge, Communication
    and Cloud.

    This model is shown in Figure 5. Critical applications and basic control processes
    should be

    installed in edge layer. Web services, HMI interfaces or analytic applications
    could be installed on

    internet/intranet cloud. Other extended services and applications are developed
    using Internet. Things

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    9 of 20

    and Cloud services are distributed, Communication and Edge layers provide the
    resources to integrate

    and to make them interoperable.

    Figure 5. Platform Architecture. Internet and Intranet computing are integrated
    in the Edge Layer.

    Local processes pushes applications, data and computing power (services) away
    from local points to

    the logical extremes of the network. Logical things are stored and analysed in
    Cloud Layer.

    An activity, service or process is formed by things (inputs and outputs distributed)
    and processing

    modules that work taking advantage of the communication facilities. Sometimes
    they can have storage

    and user interfaces. Both things and processing modules are distributed in local
    or global networks.

    Edge computing provides reliability of response in control processes. Internet
    Cloud provides

    accessibilities, storage and analytic resources that can be exploited by users,
    things or other services.

    Agronomists and experts in control and communication must decide what are the
    cloud

    applications and processes in edge layer. Edge layer provides interoperability
    and time-response.

    Cloud-services provide web services, data storage and analysis.

    Software platform is composed by data acquisition, control-communication processes,

    cloud-services and tools for agronomists.

    3.4. Integration of Protocols: M2M, Edge Computing and Web Services

    Response times and interoperability are required for control processes in PA scenarios.

    Human interfaces, data access and analytic services are services on Cloud-Computing.
    Both of the

    above-mentioned requirements are treated with different protocols: MQTT on control
    and RESTful

    on cloud services. PA IoT applications have to be executed in a distributed cloud,
    instead of in one,

    big data centre. This will require breaking up large and complex computations
    into smaller tasks

    (irrigation, climate, images, crop, energy, water, nutrients) that can be distributed.
    These smaller tasks

    make interoperable different data sources and control process algorithms: all
    these tasks are part of the

    edge computing layer. In this layer, applications M2M using MQTT protocol, control,
    data process and

    data communication to cloud using RESTful protocol are developed.

    MQTT uses an open message protocol that enables the transfer of telemetry-style
    data (i.e.,

    measurements collected in remote locations) in the form of messages from devices
    and sensors, along

    unreliable or constrained networks, to a server (BROKER). Messages are simple,
    a compact binary

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    10 of 20

    packet payload (compressed headers, much less verbose than HTTP), and it makes
    a good ﬁt for simple

    push messaging scenarios such as temperature updates or mobile notiﬁcations. It
    also works well

    connecting constrained or smaller devices and sensors to a web service, for example.

    The Publish/Subscribe model used in MQTT and many other M2M systems is mapped
    to resource

    observers. PUT and GET operations on HTTP / REST are integrated on MQTT broker
    server. Publisher

    and subscribers clients of different networks can acquire or produce data: interoperability
    between

    networks is provided. Figure 5 shows multiple processes connected to a BROKER
    that participate in

    read-write sharing of REST endpoints across MQTT (or other protocol) connections.
    Figure 6 shows

    the potentials operations performed on edge layer that integrates MQTT protocol
    (used in control

    processes) and REST/HTTP protocol (used in web services):

    •

    REST/Publisher MQTT: shows the Process-Publisher publishing the update resulting
    from an

    HTTP PUT to update the resource. In general, a create operation could also result
    in the publishing

    of a topic. A Process publishes a topic when an HTTP PUT is received. Examples
    of this operations

    can be manual control, rules settings, cloud-services request, etc..

    •

    Subscriber MQTT/REST: shows how the Process-Subscriber creates a subscription
    in the broker,

    which updates the REST endpoint when a message is published from the broker on
    the topic

    corresponding to the resource path.

    Process performs HTTP GET operation when a topic

    subscribed is updated.

    •

    Subscriber MQTT/publisher MQTT: shows Real-Time operations performed by a control
    process

    using only MQTT protocol. MQTT allows devices to send (publish) information about
    a given topic

    to a server that functions as an MQTT message broker. The broker then pushes the
    information out

    to those clients that have previously been subscribed to the topics. The design
    principles of MQTT

    is to minimise network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also
    attempting to

    ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery. These principles
    make MQTT a good

    M2M choice for IoT and mobile apps.

    •

    REST/GET-POST: REST API are libraries, resources and speciﬁes the structure of
    the data that will

    be exchanged between different devices and the Server-Cloud. Restful API talks
    HTTP (the same

    protocol browsers use to communicate with web pages), the standard way to communicate
    in the

    World Wide Web. The RESTful API supports four HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT and
    DELETE.

    4. Experimental Prototype

    An installation (Figure 7) for hydroponic crop is provided in a green house to
    design, develop

    and test the proposed model. Hydroponics is a subset of hydroculture and is a
    method of growing

    plants using mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without conventional soil.
    Terrestrial plants may be

    grown with their roots in the mineral solution only, or in an inert medium, such
    as perlite or gravel.

    Our experimental station uses coco coir as Hydroponic Media (soil).

    Figure 7. Experimental Hydroponic Station. Hydroponic crop in greenhouse. Localization
    and

    different components.

    Requirements of experimental platform (shown in Section 3.1) is also transferred
    to the speciﬁc

    USN design:

    •

    Low-cost deployment:

    sensors/actuators (temperature, moisture, PH, EC, Luminosity,

    electro-valves, pumps, lamps) technology used are not expensive. Controllers and
    sink nodes

    (routers) are embedded devices with hardware of widespread use.

    •

    Standard communication protocols and non-proprietary hardware-software. USN networks

    use WIFI, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and serial bus protocols as support to develop

    communication services.

    •

    Easy access and maintenance: sensors/actuators and devices are easy to identify,
    connect

    and maintain.

    •

    Control processes and edge computing layer development: basic control processes
    work in local

    network. Some analytic, storage and user interfaces are distributed in stand-alone
    cloud and

    internet services.

    •

    Support for integration of new smart control modules and interoperability: web
    services protocols

    (REST, HTTP, MQTT, etc.) and open source hardware-software paradigms allow to
    program

    new modules which can be easily integrated. Interoperability between things is
    assured using

    IoT applications.

    •

    Provide support for agronomist use, maintenance, settings and basic extensions.

    •

    Analyse agronomist feedback.

    In Table 2, things, control processes and cloud services are shown.

    Agriculture processes

    are implemented in the edge layer.

    Applications are installed in different devices that control

    different sensor network. Using MQTT messages and RESTful operations all sensors/actuators

    nodes are interoperable. IP addresses in local network,

    MQTT broker and HTTP/web

    server allow all control devices to communicate. Control processes are:

    {image analysis},

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    12 of 20

    {nutrients composition control},

    {light,

    climate control},

    {irrigation,

    PH and EC control},

    {energy management}, {user inter f aces, data storage, statistical calculations,
    analytics}.

    Each program has logic variables (sensor/actuator things) and rules designed by
    agronomist.

    The method and technologies proposed in this work are tested using different type
    of sensors

    and embedded devices. Experimental greenhouse has four kind of embedded devices
    and uses a

    commercial IoT cloud-services shown in Table 3. The embedded devices are low-cost
    hardware

    with adequate computational resources.

    Devices Type 1 and Type 2 have a cost below 50 $.

    Sensors are standard components that provide an adequate accuracy level, approved
    by agronomist:

    moisture, humidity, temperature, luminosity and water ﬂow (4–20 $/sensor), PH
    and EC sensors

    (30–70 $/sensor). Similarly, actuators like relay (5–20 $/actuator), led light
    strip crop (20–50 $/m),

    water pump (50–100 $/400W), industrial heater (50–100 $/3000W), electro-valve
    (20–50 $) and router

    GSM (100–200 $). Magnitude order is about 300–740 $ for the entire ubiquitous
    sensor network

    platform using Internet of Things.

    Analysis and Design Requirements

    Things and Control Processes

    crop

    Hydroponically grown plants have the same general requirements as ﬁeld-grown

    plants. The major difference is the method by which the plants are supported

    and the inorganic elements necessary for growth and development are supplied:

    Temperature, light, water, oxygen, mineral nutrients and support are the

    control parameters.

    sensor/things:

    {growing crop images}

    agricultural-processes: {image analysis}

    soil

    In a garden the plant roots are surrounded by soil that supports the growing plant.

    A hydroponically grown plant must be artiﬁcially supported, usually with string

    or stakes. Soil moisture must be monitored.

    sensor/things:

    {soil

    moisture,

    soil

    temperature}

    agricultural-processes:

    {nutrients composition control}

    climate

    Plants grow well only within a limited temperature range. Temperatures that are

    too high or too low will result in abnormal development and reduced production.

    Warm-season vegetables and most ﬂowers grow best between 15 and 25 oC. All

    vegetable plants and many ﬂowers require large amounts of sunlight. Special

    plant-growth lamps can be used to grow. Relative humidity should be between

    upper and lower limits.

    sensor/things:

    {temperat.,

    luminosity,

    humidity}

    actuator/things:

    {heater,

    lamp,

    humidi f ier}

    agricultural-processes:

    {light, climate control}

    water

    A controlled (time and ﬂow) irrigation is necessary.

    If the aggregate is not

    kept sufﬁciently moist, the plant roots will dry out and some will die. PH and

    Electro-Conductivity (EC) are variables that need to be controlled.

    sensor/things:

    {PH, EC, irrigation f low}

    actuator/things:

    {electrovalve,

    water

    pump}

    agricultural-processes:

    {irrigation, PH and EC control}

    nutrients

    Soil-less growing requires complete and effective hydroponic nutrient solutions.

    Liquid nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) are prepared by agronomist.

    sensor/things:

    {nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium}

    energy

    Monitoring energy consumption and controlling photovoltaic generation enables

    powering devices only when needed. The energy balance of the activity (processes

    and things) must be analysed.

    sensor/things:

    {energy meter sensors}

    actuator/things:

    {switch,

    photovoltaic

    panel}

    agricultural-processes:

    {energy management}

    cloud service

    Storage, analytic and user interfaces must be designed.

    Tables and graphs

    with statistical data show data in real time. IoT resources store principal data.

    Subsequent analysis generate information about the growing process

    things:

    {tables, graphs, variables, events}

    cloud-processes:

    {user

    inter f aces,

    data

    storage,

    statistical calculations, analytics}

    Three embedded devices control three sensors networks:

    1.

    USN1. Monitor water tank using: PH, EC and Temperature sensors. This node control
    nutrients

    using electro-valves. This sensor network is managed by an embedded device type
    2 (Table 3).

    USN2. Monitor radiance using: radiance and luminosity sensor. Monitor soil and
    environmental

    MQTT broker

    is installed in embedded device type 1. Soil temperature installed on USN2 is
    transmitted to processes

    on USN1 and USN3 using MQTT broker with Quality of Service (QoS) level 1. This
    level attempts

    to guarantee that a message is received at least once by the intended recipient.
    Once a published

    message is received and understood by the intended recipient, it acknowledges
    the message with

    an acknowledgement message (PUBACK) addressed to the publishing node. Until the
    PUBACK is

    received by the publisher, it stores the message and retransmits it periodically.
    QoS Level 2 attempts to

    guarantee the message is received and decoded by the intended recipient. This
    is the most secure and

    reliable MQTT level of QoS. This type of message may be useful for turning on
    or off critical control.

    In this ﬁrst experience QoS Level 1 is used in switch ON-OFF actuators and publish
    data sensors.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) exploits network of objects, sensors, and things.

    Robust and

    ﬂexible REST API simpliﬁes the storage and retrieval of sensor data across multiple
    hardware

    platforms. It can also add any type of metadata and attributes to data sources,
    like type: temperature

    sensor_type: temperature sensor or location: greenhouse, building powerful relationships
    within the data.

    These platforms provide support for different languages: python, Java, C, PHP,
    Node and Ruby are

    some examples, the aim is to cut down application development time. In this ﬁrst
    experience HMI

    is based in web graphics of data sensors through custom widgets like line charts,
    gauges, multi-line

    Sensors 2016, 16, 1141

    15 of 20

    charts, scatter plots or maps. Agronomist can customize the look of the dashboard
    through simple

    drag-n-drop gestures, or changing the size of widgets.

    Other cloud-services like Analytic are provided from an arbitrary date range,
    calculate statistical

    ﬁgures over any time period : mean, max, min, count, sum and variance are numeric
    calculation that

    can be performed with the captured dataset. From API authentication, to data trafﬁc
    and storage, web

    security is provided. PA data reach cloud services securely thanks to a token-based
    authentication

    and an optional HTTPS/SSL encryption layer. IoT platforms push data from any Internet-Enabled

    Device and prompt them to quickly get started. Similar platforms with similar
    services show the state

    of commercial IoT technology: Ubidots [33], Thingspeak [34], Zatar [35], Echelon
    [36] or Xiveli [37]

    are some examples of companies that provide IoT services. These platforms are
    built with similar

    architectures and provide, usually, the same resources: API REST communication
    between clients

    and IoT server. I Python language is used to develop control algorithms designed
    by the agronomist.

    REST API Ubidots libraries are integrated in control processes for use in communication
    operations.

    Cloud storage of sensor data is obtained in CSV format ﬁles. GUI Libraries provide
    resources to create

    different graphic interfaces. Events or alarms can be programmed by the agronomist
    on the cloud.

    Basic analytic is provided by the platform: raw, average, maximum and minimum.

    Example of a graphic interface, created with Ubidots cloud-platform is shown in
    Figure 10.

    Different kinds of graphics can be selected conﬁguring a dashboard easily designed
    and modiﬁed

    by users.

    Figure 10.

    Example of Temperature and relative Humidity of greenhouse (in/out) showed on

    cloud-web server. Sampling time is deﬁned by the agronomist. These sensors are
    included in USN3.

    Table 4 shows different services that can be used like graphics, manual control
    using dashboard

    GUI, events that can be programmed: trigger alerts when a sensor value hits a
    threshold. Easily

    conﬁgure under what conditions an alert should be triggered. Agronomist can set
    any type of

    thresholds through simple IF...THEN statements. For example: if a temperature
    is too low, an event

    can be programmed using cloud level. A speciﬁc action can be executed. In some
    cases to send an

    Email or SMS alerting someone about a speciﬁc event. Alternatively, it can request
    a custom URL which

    can be hooked to an actuator (like an electrovalve) or trigger an action inside
    another app. Finally,

    agronomist can create ON/OFF widgets in their dashboard and start controlling
    things remotely,

    at the click of a button. Some things (actuators) are controlled using this level.
    This kind of control

    must be consistent with automated control implemented on edge layer.

    5. Results and Conclusions

    An hydroponic cultivation has been designed following the method proposed in this
    work using

    sensor networks, embedded devices, IoT paradigms and agricultural control processes.
    The main goal

    is to exploit the advantages of these technologies in PA installations. Low-cost
    elements, open systems,

    reusable applications, easy access, friendly interfaces and interoperability between
    devices are some

    of these beneﬁts. A greenhouse station was used to test the growing of a crop
    using the methods

    and technologies proposed. The results obtained on the growth plant are shown
    in Table 5. Using

    emerging embedded hardware technologies and standard sensor/actuator with adapted
    accuracy,

    all components may be replaced by different manufacturers, achieving best price.
    Open software and

    internet resources decrease the ﬁnal price even more when compared to some industrial
    solutions.

    The results experienced by the agronomist and users were positive. The system
    developed provides

    new ways of access to information which is obtained easily with the communication
    services. Users

    can interact with applications through simple conditional statements and quickly
    adapt to changing

    processes requirements: the process control can be adapted to real needs in less
    time. Furthermore,

    through information provided, water used in greenhouse irrigation process (hydroponic
    substrate)

    was compared with the theoretical consumption needed if soil was used. Water consumption
    in

    experimental hydroponic measured is lower (20%) than water needed if evapotranspiration
    (FAO

    Penman-Monteith method [38]) was considered.

    Evapotranspiration equation is a reference to

    calculate the water consumption needs. The agronomists use this information to
    program irrigation

    in traditional processes. In the experimental greenhouse, data obtained by different
    installed sensors

    (soil moisture, water and soil PH, water and soil EC, water and soil temperature,
    ambient temperature

    and relative humidity) may be used to design different rules that control actuators
    (electro-valves,

    lights and electric-pumps). These rules are easily adapted to the conditions and
    evolution of each

    speciﬁc production.

    Interoperability has allowed to develop more advanced controls processes. Algorithms
    adapted

    to installation characteristics, local climate and expert knowledge in growing
    crop can be designed

    and implemented easily and in a shorter space of time.

    Technological results

    Initial expectations unfulﬁlled

    Complexity of technology

    Incompatibility of components

    Lack of products

    High costs

    Develop a reference model based in IoT paradigms and USN resources

    Standard components (devices, sensors, actuators) with low cost

    PA processes automated with software and languages standard

    Graphics Interfaces use simple and universal access

    Tools, facilities and resources create for agronomist and users needs

    New products are created integrating technological resources

    GUI interfaces used on Internet

    New ways of data access

    Low-cost deployment

    Users can interact and created

    conditional statements

    PA information in near real time

    In Figure 11 an example of this potential is shown: Algorithm 1 represents the
    ﬁrsts conditions

    which controlled irrigation electro-valve. All sensors and actuators belonged
    to USN2. Experiences

    with the plant growing and agronomist conclusions modiﬁed initial conditions.
    Algorithm 1 was

    replaced by Algorithm 2, and in this situation sensors and actuators of USN2 and
    USN3 were

    required. Changes in control process and creating new publisher-subscriber messages
    were performed

    easily. Feedback from the agronomist is an important issue for a continuous improvement
    process.

    New ways to understand processes and usability are some of its most important
    features. Storage and

    analytic provide tools to improve growing control. These systems become more efﬁcient
    and energy

    management strategies can be developed. The data aggregation service, which collects
    dataset from

    the connected things, is another advantage.

    Finally, there are no dependencies on proprietary technologies: any sensor, actuator
    or control

    device can be integrated. New applications modules or software services are easily
    designed and

    implemented. Internet protocols and cloud computing assure the durability of these
    networks. In the

    near future, algorithms based in expert systems and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)
    are planned on this

    experimental station. Internet Protocol and energy consumption of embedded devices
    using harvesting

    resources are another works that will be addressed through IoT services.

    New agricultural crops will be soon developed to integrate and test new services
    using the

    method and platform developed.

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    2. Number of occurrences of relevant keywords (at least 50) as they appear in
    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest
    The authors declare no conflict of interest. Acknowledgment This work has received

    View Cite Permissions Share Abstract Plants are affected by complex genome×environment×management
    interactions which determine phenotypic plasticity as a result of the variability
    of genetic components. Whereas great advances have been made in the cost-efficient
    and high-throughput analyses of genetic information and non-invasive phenotyping,
    the large-scale analyses of the underlying physiological mechanisms lag behind.
    The external phenotype is determined by the sum of the complex interactions of
    metabolic pathways and intracellular regulatory networks that is reflected in
    an internal, physiological, and biochemical phenotype. These various scales of
    dynamic physiological responses need to be considered, and genotyping and external
    phenotyping should be linked to the physiology at the cellular and tissue level.
    A high-dimensional physiological phenotyping across scales is needed that integrates
    the precise characterization of the internal phenotype into high-throughput phenotyping
    of whole plants and canopies. By this means, complex traits can be broken down
    into individual components of physiological traits. Since the higher resolution
    of physiological phenotyping by ‘wet chemistry’ is inherently limited in throughput,
    high-throughput non-invasive phenotyping needs to be validated and verified across
    scales to be used as proxy for the underlying processes. Armed with this interdisciplinary
    and multidimensional phenomics approach, plant physiology, non-invasive phenotyping,
    and functional genomics will complement each other, ultimately enabling the in
    silico assessment of responses under defined environments with advanced crop models.
    This will allow generation of robust physiological predictors also for complex
    traits to bridge the knowledge gap between genotype and phenotype for applications
    in breeding, precision farming, and basic research. External phenotype, genome–environment–management

    Challenges in plant phenomics require high-dimensional physiological phenotyping
    data Agriculture and the closely related field of applied plant science research
    face tremendous challenges in the future to feed the world population. The global
    population is expected to increase from ~6 billion in 2000 to >13 billion in 2100
    (Tester and Langridge, 2010). In addition, as a consequence of global climate
    change, crop production is already now more frequently exposed to extreme weather,
    faces limited availability of water and nutrient resources, and will be restricted
    in tropical and subtropical regions by a decrease of the arable land area, estimated
    to be reduced by up to 21% of the currently available area (Zhang and Cai, 2011).
    In particular, drought and increased salinization of arable land could result
    in a 50% land loss by the year 2050 in certain regions (Wang et al., 2003). Thus
    agriculture requires a second green revolution to accelerate breeding of novel
    climate-resilient varieties that satisfy the rising demand for food and the increased
    competition for crops as sources of bioenergy and fibre, and for other industrial
    purposes. The current use of the word ‘phenome’ refers to the phenotype as a whole
    (Soulé, 1967). The plant phenome is determined by the genome (G), environmental
    conditions (E), and their complex dynamic interactions (G×E) (Houle et al., 2010;
    Chen et al., 2014). Crop management (M) is an additional determinant of the phenotype.
    Thus, a plant phenotype in a specific agricultural system has finally to be considered
    as the result of the complex G×E×M interactions (Porter and Christensen, 2013)
    which are depicted in Fig. 1. Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism
    to change its phenotype in response to changes in the environment, which is important
    in particular for sessile organisms such as plants. Thus fundamentally, the phenotype
    of an organism is a manifestation of a genotype’s interaction with the environment.
    The central challenge of modern genetic analysis is to understand the biological
    determinants of quantitative phenotypic variation. Understanding and exploiting
    this phenotypic plasticity in plant breeding thus is both challenging and important,
    in particular with crop plants being more frequently affected by extreme fluctuations
    in abiotic conditions due to global climate change. A compromise is needed between
    increasing the yield optimum while maintaining the yield stability. Fig. 1. Open
    in new tabDownload slide Schematic illustration of phenotypic plasticity, which
    describes the impact of the multifactorial environment (E) such as various abiotic
    and biotic parameters and management strategies (M) on alternative phenotypes
    derived from a constant genotype (G), represented by the response to a specific
    external signal. Common responses in the phenotype can thereby be used as robust
    external predictors of specific internal processes or states. The term ‘phenomics’
    was introduced in 1997 (Schork, 1997) and was defined in analogy to genomics—and
    the many other ‘omics’ technologies—as the systematic study of phenotypes at an
    organism-wide scale (Houle et al., 2010). Thus phenomics refers to the characterization
    of phenotypes via the acquisition of high-dimensional phenotypic data (Houle et
    al., 2010). With the establishment of non-invasive methods for plant phenotyping
    and their high-throughput application in large-scale, automated facilities since
    2009 (Finkel, 2009), phenomic technologies are applied in basic plant research
    and crop plant breeding, and are expected to relieve, in particular, the phenotyping
    bottleneck in breeding (Furbank and Tester, 2011). Whereas high-throughput phenotyping
    techniques were originally developed for controlled environments, their application
    in in-field phenotyping is receiving increasing attention (Araus and Cairns, 2014;
    Langridge and Reynolds, 2015). However, although phenomics is defined in analogy
    to genomics to progress towards the full characterization of the complete set
    of phenotypes of a genome, the analogy is misleading and this ultimate goal will
    remain hypothetical and elusive since phenotypes vary from cell to cell and from
    moment to moment, and therefore can never be completely characterized. This fact
    applies in particular to plants with a phenome that is greatly influenced by external
    factors through the G×E×M interactions. Therefore phenomics will always need to
    involve prioritizing what to measure and a balance between exploratory and explanatory
    goals. The plant phenotype is the set of structural, physiological, and performance-related
    traits of a genotype in a given environment. Thus phenotyping systems not only
    comprise the tools to perform phenotyping itself, but also comprise the means
    to grow plants in a certain environment, ranging widely from strictly controlled
    conditions in climate chambers to the natural environment in the field. Phenotyping
    systems can be described by the terms of throughput, resolution, and dimensionality
    (Dhont et al., 2013). In plant phenotyping systems, the throughput refers to the
    number of individual units at particular organizational levels within plants,
    or at the plant or canopy level, that can be analysed for a particular set of
    traits at a given time. High-throughput refers to automatized, non-invasive phenotyping
    systems that have a high capacity with respect to standardized data acquisition,
    processing, visualization, and feeding into integrated databases. The spatial
    resolution describes the level of separation of plants or plant organs, tissues,
    and cells into their elementary or organizational units used for the measurement
    of the plant trait, thus spanning the range from cell wall and plastids to the
    field. The temporal resolution indicates the separation into elementary time periods
    significant for plant processes and used for the measurement of plant traits,
    spanning seconds (e.g. stomatal conductance) to weeks and months (e.g. yield).
    Finally, dimensionality in plant phenotyping refers to the diversity of phenotypic
    traits measured at different spatial and temporal resolutions and in different
    categories, such as plant structure, physiology, and performance. In phenomics,
    dimensionality additionally includes the number of genotypes and the diversity
    of environmental conditions. Sequencing of multiple plant genotypes, novel genetic
    approaches, and advanced bioinformatics has given plant science researchers and
    breeders a variety of new tools to understand the molecular mechanisms and the
    underlying genetics. In the past decade, new cameras, sensors, and automatic mechanical
    devices such as drones (unmanned airborne vehicles, UAVs) have created unprecedented
    opportunities for fast, accurate, and precise non-destructive phenotyping of morphological
    and physical properties at the whole-plant and canopy level. To interpret high-dimensional
    phenotypic data, especially when they not only address morphological or growth
    parameters but also consider spatial and temporal dynamics of physiological data,
    a conceptual framework is needed. The concept of a genotype–phenotype map (Burns,
    1970; Gjuvsland et al., 2013) is a widely used metaphor for the multiple ways
    in which genomics information influences the phenotype of an organism (Houle et
    al., 2010). In this concept, the interaction of the genomic information (G) with
    external parameters (E, M) creates the internal phenotypic state that includes
    cellular, tissue, and physiological properties (Fig. 2). These internal phenotypes
    in turn shape the external phenotypes that can be more easily measured with high-throughput
    non-invasive techniques. Such a genotype–phenotype map is inaccessible without
    the detailed phenotypic data that allow these interactions to be studied. Despite
    great research efforts, a key challenge remains in narrowing down the knowledge
    gap between the genomic information and the apparent, external phenotype for complex
    traits. Such an example is the effort to breed drought-tolerant crop varieties;
    despite 20 years of worldwide research, the knowledge gap is still considered
    as far from being filled (Tuberosa et al., 2014). Fig. 2. Open in new tabDownload
    slide The position of physiology in integrating genotype, environment, management,
    and their intense interactions (G×E×M), which determines the internal phenotype
    as a link between the genotype and external phenotype. Physiology is therein a
    key interface between the genome and the plant phenotype which comprises multiple
    levels of information processing via the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome,
    as well as regulatory events. Correlation of the physiological status as the internal
    phenotype with the genetic background and external phenotypes can feed in to modelling
    approaches of cellular pathways and whole-plant models, allowing the identification
    and establishment of robust, external predictors. Such predictors can be used
    in practical applications of precision agriculture to change management services
    or as markers for breeding. The plant phenotyping methods applied currently to
    characterize plant phenomes still lag greatly behind our ability to characterize
    genomes. Although the measurement of physiological components has been recognized
    as being essential to predict gene-to-phenotype relationships (Yin et al., 2004;
    Dhont et al., 2013) and for crop improvement (Ghanem et al., 2015), and phenomics
    have even been suggested to be described as ‘high-throughput plant physiology’
    (Furbank and Tester, 2011), most of the currently used high-throughput approaches
    still focus on the external phenotype and, if at all, typically only indirectly
    assess physiological processes. However, cellular physiology forms a key interface
    between genotype and phenotype, describing the functioning of processes such as
    metabolic pathways and regulatory networks (Fig. 2). Notably, at the physiological
    level, the various abiotic and biotic factors of the multifactorial environment
    are integrated into the cellular responses that ultimately determine the quantitative
    and qualitative traits at the tissue, organ, and whole organism level. These processes
    can be monitored as an internal phenotype via physiological and biochemical parameters
    that ultimately determine the external phenotype, but the ability to increase
    the resolution is inherently limited by throughput. There is currently no common
    understanding in the generic use of the term ‘physiological phenotyping’. Despite
    the agreement on the importance of a physiological phenotyping approach in general,
    it will be important to consider and define the aspects of throughput, resolution,
    and dimensionality. Therefore, this opinion paper explores the need for implementation
    of physiological phenotyping into a holistic multidimensional phenomics approach
    across the scales, ranging from the cellular and organ level to whole plants and
    canopies, with particular implications on the methods still needed and already
    applied. This concept should be helpful to dissect complex phenotypic traits into
    specific physiological traits and should also contribute to understanding the
    mechanisms involved in the determination of phenotypic plasticity in a complex
    multifactorial environment. Current status and focus of non-invasive phenotyping
    To explore the current status of physiological phenotyping, the widely applied
    non-invasive phenotyping methods are discussed here. A number of reviews about
    the status and technique of phenotyping roots and the canopy in greenhouses, semi-field,
    and field have been published recently (Furbank and Tester, 2011; Fiorani et al.,
    2012; Fiorani and Schurr, 2013; Araus and Cairns, 2014; Li et al., 2014). Thus,
    only a brief general overview of currently applied and advanced technologies for
    remote sensing and non-destructive phenotyping is given, and summarized in Table
    1. The technologies are classified based on their dimensionality, measured variables,
    traits, and system limitations in general, and their potential is discussed for
    a multidimensional approach that also addresses the quantification of physiological
    parameters to describe plant functions. Table 1.Current technologies for the determination

    phenotyping based on non-destructive measurements in greenhouses and growth chambers
    are now operating at different institutions around the world (Furbank and Tester,
    2011; Fiorani and Schurr, 2013; Araus and Cairns, 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Li
    et al., 2014; Neilson et al., 2015) where large-scale testing of plant genotypes
    under different controlled environments and treatments is carried out. What is
    common for the testing facilities though is that experimental protocols often
    are limited to rosette plants and the main cereal species (Li et al., 2014; Neilson
    et al., 2015). However, newer studies such as that of Neilson et al. (2015) are
    focusing on expanding such protocols to include a larger range of crop species.
    Under field conditions, the approach of non-destructive high-throughput phenotyping
    is undergoing much research, with testing of different technologies and platforms
    (Comar et al., 2012; Busemeyer et al., 2013; Andrade-Sanchez et al., 2014). The
    challenge here is that field agro-ecosystems are complex with respect to phenology
    and physiology due to multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Therefore, it is notoriously
    difficult to implement systems for high-throughput phenotyping in field experiments,
    and a multidimensional approach is necessary (Araus and Cairns, 2014). Nevertheless,
    non-invasive sensor-based phenotyping is successfully integrated into physiological
    breeding programmes (Pask et al., 2012; Reynolds et al., 2012). Clearly, technological
    development has enabled the embedding of a large range of sensors and imaging
    systems to allow non-destructive proximal sensing of plants either as individuals
    or in populations. The most commonly applied sensor and imaging techniques are
    digital RGB (red–green–blue) imaging, spectroscopy, thermography, fluorescence,
    3D, by, for example, stereo cameras and LIDAR (light detection and ranging), real-time
    camera set-ups, and, to a lesser extent, tomography. All technologies listed in
    Table 1 have the potential for high-resolution sensing and imaging, enabling a
    multidimensional approach towards non-invasive phenotyping (Li et al., 2014).
    RGB imaging RGB imaging, based on visible light, is a relevant tool for morphological
    studies of plants from shoot emergence until the ground area is covered by the
    canopy. These tools possess very limited possibilities for studying physiological
    processes based on leaf and canopy biochemistry. RGB set-ups have been applied
    in several studies in greenhouses in 2D (Granier et al., 2006; Arvidsson et al.,
    2011; Golzarian et al., 2011) and 3D (Paproki et al., 2012), and in field experiments
    as proximal sensing (Bojacá et al., 2011; Hoyos-Villegas et al., 2014) and remote
    sensing from UAVs (Bendig et al., 2014). Also approaches to study roots under
    field conditions have utilized simple RGB camera techniques (Kristensen and Thorup-Kristensen,
    2004). Due to limitations of RGB systems, the focus in these studies has been
    restricted to imaging morphological traits related to yield, and only limited
    measurements of physiological processes with other systems have been included.
    Multispectral imaging Multispectral imaging includes the near-infrared range of
    the light spectrum and enables a more detailed analysis of plant and leaf biochemistry
    such as the composition of important pigments (e.g. chlorophyll and carotenoids)
    and water content in leaves, and to calculate a range of vegetation indices (VIs).
    Multispectral sensors and imaging systems have been utilized for these different
    purposes of calculating and evaluating specific indices in field experiments related
    to water content in leaves (Seelig et al., 2008; Gutierrez et al., 2010), evaluations
    of simple VIs to quantify biomass and nitrogen (Mistele and Schmidhalter 2008a,
    b; Cabrera-Bosquet et al., 2011; Svensgaard et al., 2014), and UAVs for plant
    stress detection (Berni et al., 2009, Rossini et al., 2013). Multispectral systems
    have inherent limitations due to the discrete spectral information that is measured,
    which limits the possibility to make complex studies of leaf and canopy biochemistry.
    Hyperspectral imaging Hyperspectral imaging includes the continuous spectrum in
    the entire visible and near-infrared region, and thus serves to make more complex
    studies of specific types of pigmentation, water, biochemical compositions, and
    VIs. Advanced multivariate statistics can be applied to study the continuous spectrum
    in these cases, thus potentially providing more information on crop physiology
    compared with multispectral set-ups. Hyperspectral imaging has been used in studies
    detecting plant diseases in both greenhouses and the field, which was extensively
    reviewed by Bock et al. (2010), and has more generally been applied in studies
    of biochemistry, quality, and yield of crops, as reviewed by Dale et al. (2013).
    Generally the spectral reflectance is greatly affected by illumination and canopy
    structure, and these types of measurements should be coupled with other sensor
    or imaging systems, or with physiological approaches (Berger et al., 2010). In
    outdoor conditions, the wind in particular and the background influence the optimal
    signal-to-noise ratio when measuring (Jones and Vaughan, 2010), and, especially
    in the case of hyperspectral imaging, data load as well as complexity in data
    analysis are also challenging factors (Fiorani and Schurr, 2013). Thermal imaging
    Thermal imaging has shown promising potential for studying surface temperatures
    at either the canopy or leaf level correlated to stomatal conductance, and can
    therefore be used to study plant stress such as drought in field plots with maize
    (Berni et al., 2009; Araus et al., 2012), and generally for stress responses induced
    by plant pathogens or salinity (Costa et al., 2013). Despite the rapid measurement
    of the indirect plant status of transpiration, thermal imaging is challenging,
    as the background temperature of soil, air temperature, wind, and humidity, as
    well as physiological changes, will influence canopy and leaf temperature measurements
    within short time frames; therefore, rigorous protocols for measurements as well
    as calibrations for background noise are crucial (Berni et al., 2009; Costa et
    al., 2013). Fluorescence imaging Fluorescence imaging can be a powerful tool to
    study plant stress. Chlorophyll fluorescence is linked to the photosynthetic apparatus
    and thus such measurements can serve to monitor and quantify how plants and leaves
    respond to biotic and abiotic stress. Fluorescence can be used to study simple
    chlorophyll emission, to assess photosystem II activity via pulse amplitude-modulated
    (PAM) fluorescence using saturating light pulses, or in measuring protocols using
    sun-induced fluorescence (Meroni et al., 2009; Gorbe and Calatayud, 2013). Fluorescence
    imaging has also been used in controlled conditions to study drought stress responses
    (Woo et al., 2008; Jansen et al., 2009) or fungal pathogen development in sugar
    beet (Chaerle et al., 2007). In field systems, solar-induced fluorescence imaging
    has been applied to UAV phenotyping for studies of fungal pathogens in olive trees
    (Calderon et al., 2013). Fluorescence imaging has similar inherent limitations
    to those for spectral imaging with regards to deep complex canopy structures,
    and are also affected by the available illumination, morphology, and wind under
    outdoor conditions. 3D reconstructions by lasers, stereo cameras, and time of
    flight cameras Generally, 2D imaging systems, whether based on RGB, multi/hyperspectral,
    thermal, or fluorescence principles, are inherently limited for studies of canopies
    due to the lack of deep structural information and the influence of plant structure
    in general. Therefore, 3D systems are implemented in field experiments to estimate
    biomass structures and plant height either as single sensor set-ups (Eitel et
    al., 2014), in simple multisensory set-ups (Thomsen and Schelde, 2010), or in
    advanced multisensory set-ups (Busemeyer et al., 2013; Deery et al., 2014). In
    controlled environments, 3D systems are used to make more detailed studies of
    plant morphology such as leaf angles and leaf surface (Kempthorne et al., 2015),
    and overall growth rates (Pengelly et al., 2010). There are general limitations
    to all types of 3D laser and imaging systems, such as plant movement and sun illumination
    under outdoor conditions, which can be controlled indoors. Also modelling and
    data processing are challenging when working with 3D imaging (Li et al., 2014).
    Tomography Tomography, such as X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems,
    is a technology under development for plant phenotyping, and is suitable to study
    internal structures of plants, roots, and soils (Li et al., 2014), and MRI also
    has great potential for studying dynamics of metabolites (Borisjuk et al., 2012).
    Despite the potential especially for root studies, tomography has to undergo a
    great deal of development to improve the signal-to-noise ratio due to non-root
    elements affecting measurements. Radiation from X-rays may also have a negative
    effect on the root itself. Finally, the technology itself cannot be considered
    high throughput due to the advanced imaging and analysis (Fiorani and Schurr,
    2013). In general, these new technologies are individually suitable for specific
    phenotypic measurements and may therefore serve relatively few purposes if used
    in single sensor set-ups, which therefore limits the overall phenological and
    physiological dimensionality (Chen et al., 2014), as also illustrated in Table
    1. Most of the available techniques described above are characterized by a high
    throughput, but the information about physiological processes is typically only
    indirectly assessed. Thus, only conclusions about the general physiological state
    will be possible. Integration of multiscale physiological phenotyping into a phenomics
    approach A range of non-invasive phenotyping methods, as described above, proved
    to be valuable in the functional characterization of genomic information both
    in controlled environments and under field conditions. However, the current application
    and evaluation of non-invasive phenotyping provides only a snapshot of an external
    phenotype at a certain time and within certain environmental conditions, typically
    only at the whole-plant or canopy level. Although the ultimate goal of whole-phenome
    analyses can never be completely achieved, an approximation is the gathering of
    multidimensional phenotypic data across temporal and spatial scales through a
    genuine physiological phenotyping approach. This approach will reverse the current
    development in basic science research to carry out more specialized research at
    smaller scales to an approach that links the various ‘omics’ approaches to agronomy
    and organismic biology. The simplest justification for phenomics is that the characteristics
    of organisms of greatest interest to most biologists and agronomists are phenotypes
    rather than genotypes. This is particularly relevant for applied plant science
    research since the final goals of any plant breeding programme are quantitative
    and qualitative trait phenotypes, with yield quality and stability being the most
    relevant traits. For practical applications in breeding, robust physiological
    traits are required that ideally allow us to recognize predispositions and provide
    the possibility for predictions and extrapolations at early developmental stages,
    which will allow integration of initial larger populations in screening programmes.
    Mapping the internal phenotype and phenotypic plasticity by physiological phenotyping
    Plant phenotypes are inherently complex since plants are, due to their sessile
    lifestyle, exposed to a constantly changing, multifactorial environment. They
    are unable to avoid the interaction and can only react to the wide range of biotic
    and abiotic factors at the level of physiology and through the synthesis of defence-
    or stress-related compounds. Traditionally plant physiologists cannot afford to
    carry out detailed experiments on complex traits with many genotypes, whereas
    geneticists working with many genotypes cannot afford to go into much physiological
    detail. Therefore, so far, phenotyping has been mostly concerned with mapping
    the external phenotype using a limited set of biophysical methods to assess physiological
    parameters mostly indirectly. The plant phenotype is determined by the complex
    interaction of the genetic information (G) with the multifactorial, abiotic and
    biotic environment (E), and, in the case of crop plants, an agricultural management
    regime (M) that modifies the environment in a defined way, including the applications
    of fertilizers, irrigation, and pest and weed control (Fig. 1). The key steps
    of the expression of the information encoded in the genome are the transcription
    into RNA (transcriptome) and translation into proteins (proteome) that determines
    the various cellular metabolites (metabolome). The interplay of enzymatic functions,
    structural components, regulatory networks, and flux through metabolic pathways
    determines the physiology of an organism. It is mainly at the level of physiology
    where the environmental factors and crop management are integrated into appropriate
    cellular reactions that result in the actual phenotype (Fig. 2). The plant physiology
    as a key interface between the genome and the phenotype integrates the various
    levels of regulation involved in the expression of the genetic information, including
    post-transcriptional, post-translational, and epigenetic mechanisms. Thus the
    physiology can be considered as the internal, biochemical phenotype that bridges
    the gap between genotype and external phenotype. Integration of a high-resolution
    physiological phenotyping approach with wet chemistry analyses at the cellular
    level into phenomics will therefore enable causal links between genotypes (G),
    external factors (E, M), and phenotypes to be traced. This will help to dissect
    the genetics of complex quantitative traits, particularly those related to yield,
    pathogen resistance, and abiotic stress tolerance, into defined physiological
    traits that can be more easily measured. The different non-invasive phenotyping
    techniques based on reflectance, fluorescence, and thermography indirectly already
    assess different components involved in physiological reactions (Table 1), so
    that they are also valuable in combination with the direct assessment of physiological
    processes at the cellular and tissue level. However, it will be important to validate
    fully the readout of the sensor-based instruments used to monitor the external
    phenotype with complementary physiological measurements and functional approaches
    under controlled conditions. An exception is the PAM chlorophyll fluorescence
    kinetics which not only allows the assessment of the functional integrity of the
    components of photosystem II, but also allows direct monitoring of the photochemical
    efficiency (Baker and Rosenqvist, 2004). Different parameters, such as Fv/Fm and
    non-photochemical quenching, are differentially affected by abiotic stress and
    provide useful markers for early, pre-symptomatic detection of heat stress and
    defining the degree of tolerance (Sharma et al., 2012, 2015). The value of this
    method can be increased further by implementation of improved measuring protocols
    and special light regimes, as well as by the use of advanced image analyses tools
    based on statistical analyses (Matouš et al., 2006; Berger et al., 2007). Thermal
    imaging indirectly estimates changes in stomatal conductance (gs) and/or transpiration,
    and was successfully used in a range of conditions and plant species to assess
    drought and heat stress responses and to screen for tolerant plants (Costa et
    al., 2013). Most physiological determinations at the cellular level are based
    on wet chemistry, and were originally established for a low number of samples
    (low throughput) and require extensive labour time for processing in the laboratory.
    Thus, a major challenge for the future will be to adopt them for at least semi-high
    throughput. A variety of regulatory mechanisms determine the steady-state level
    and biological activity of proteins, which increases flexibility and adaptability
    and shortens the time scale of information flow, enabling biological networks
    to take on new tasks and adjust to new conditions rapidly (Stitt and Gibon, 2014).
    Therefore, information about the abundance and—most importantly—the biological
    activity of proteins is essential to understand how individual genes function
    and how environmental impacts affect phenotypes. The use of liquid-handling robotics
    and down-scaling to a microplate assay format have dramatically improved throughput
    of activity measurements. A robot-based platform employing stopped assays coupled
    to secondary cycling reactions to amplify the products was established (Gibon
    et al., 2004), which now comprises a total number of 50 enzymes of carbohydrate
    and nitrogen metabolism (Sulpice et al., 2010). A remarkable reproducibility of
    enzyme activity profiles in tomato fruits grown under contrasting environments
    supports the tenet that enzyme activities are highly robust markers (Biais et
    al., 2014). A complex network analysis of enzyme activities and metabolite levels
    and their relationship to biomass has been performed with a large panel of Arabidopsis
    accessions (Sulpice et al., 2010). This study revealed that there was little correlation
    between enzyme activities and metabolites. Within a matrix containing 62 metabolites
    and 37 enzymes, allowing 2294 pair–pair correlations, there was only one significant
    correlation when the traits were compared on a protein basis, further supporting
    that enzyme activities are the more robust physiological markers. A simple, fast,
    and cost-effective alternative platform has been established for the determination
    of an activity signature comprised of 13 key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism
    enzyme in microtiter plates (Jammer et al., 2015). The latter approach is based
    on a unique extraction procedure, separation of soluble and cell-wall bound fractions
    followed by spectrophotometric kinetic activity assays which allow the quality
    control of the individual reactions and do not require the investment in a robotic
    system. The potential of the determination of distinct enzyme activity signatures
    as part of a physiological fingerprint with this method was shown for various
    organs and tissues from three monocot and five dicot model and crop species, including
    two case studies with external stimuli. Differential and specific enzyme activity
    signatures are apparent during inflorescence development and upon in vitro cold
    treatment of young inflorescences in the monocot ryegrass, related to conditions
    for doubled haploid formation. Likewise, treatment of dicot spring oilseed rape
    with an elevated CO2 concentration resulted in distinct patterns of enzyme activity
    responses in leaves (Jammer et al., 2015). The determination of three types of
    invertase activities shows the potential to discriminate between isoenzymes based
    on the subcellular localization and particular properties such as a differential
    pH optimum. Also a differential substrate or product regulation or differential
    inhibitor sensitivity could be integrated into such an approach to discriminate
    between isoenzymes. The approaches to determine enzyme activity profiles have
    concentrated so far on enzymes involved in primary metabolism. Notably similar
    approaches will also be needed for antioxidant and secondary metabolism. Since
    the sum of the steady-state levels of enzyme activities are a good approximation
    of the physiology of a cell, the determination of an enzyme activity signature
    is a robust marker for physiological phenotyping and a key component of a physiological
    fingerprint. Development of user-friendly platforms for instrumental analytics
    of small molecular weight compounds by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography
    (UHPLC) in combination with mass spectrometry also makes the determination of
    regulatory molecules and secondary metabolites feasible to be integrated into
    physiological phenotyping. Since phytohormones, as key regulators of growth, development,
    and stress responses, not only act alone but typically also act in changing combinations,
    the recently established determination of complex phytohormone profiles (Floková
    et al., 2014; Großkinsky et al., 2014) also needs to be considered for internal
    phenotyping. A combination of new measurement technologies for non-targeted analyses
    of metabolites and modelling approaches is bringing us closer to integrating metabolic
    behaviour with whole-plant physiology and growth (Ménard et al., 2013). Thus flux
    analysis also needs to be involved together with modelling of a range of plant
    systems that point to the importance of the supply of metabolic inputs and demand
    for metabolic end-products as key drivers of metabolic behaviour (Sweetlove et
    al., 2014). The integrative analyses of metabolite fingerprints and the determination
    of enzyme activity signatures, in combination with the application of validated
    sensor technologies, have the potential to contribute to the identification of
    novel breeding targets and the recognition of predispositions for specific traits
    that will become apparent only at later stages of development or in response to
    specific environmental factors. This would allow definition of predictors that
    will, with the use and application of advanced crop models, greatly facilitate
    and advance breeding progress. An alternative to the direct assessment of enzymes
    involved in metabolic processes or the determination of metabolites or signalling
    molecules is the determination of the abundance of related transcripts by microarray
    or RNA sequencing techniques. Although such an approach has the potential to provide
    valuable insights into regulatory networks, there is growing awareness that transcripts
    and protein abundance often poorly correlate (Stitt and Gibon, 2014) and that
    the correlations are even poorer for the enzyme activities that are actually the
    main determinants of physiological reactions. Integration of physiological phenotyping
    data into non-invasive signatures: plant physiology meets biophysics Despite advancements
    in the throughput of physiological measurements at the cellular level, it is not
    expected that they will be applicable in high-throughput screening. Thus it is
    the ultimate vision to link hyperscale, non-invasive imaging data to temporal
    and spatial dynamics of key physiological processes and DNA-based markers. Ultimately
    the integration of precision characterization of the internal phenotype at the
    organ and tissue level into high-throughput phenotyping of whole plants and canopies
    will be needed for high-dimensional physiological phenotyping across scales. This
    will allow breaking down complex traits, such as drought resistance, into individual
    components of physiological traits. Since the higher resolution of physiological
    phenotyping at the organ and cell level is inherently limited in throughput, the
    available high-throughput phenotyping methods need to be validated and verified
    across scales to be used as proxy for the underlying physiological processes.
    It is expected that ultimately this will also allow the use of high-throughput
    phenotyping as physiological phenotyping for predictive assessment of predispositions
    and elucidation of robust metabolic markers and fingerprints. This would finalize
    the transition from a yield- and morphology-based phenotyping to a phenomics approach
    with multidimensional, physiology-related trait measurements under consideration
    of complex environmental impacts to determine predictors to facilitate breeding.
    Integration and correlation of phenomics data by modelling the relationship between
    traits Advances in collecting phenotypic information facilitate the analysis of
    specific single or a few parameters. Simultaneous monitoring of multiple parameters
    and integration of the different phenotypic data collected can be used to obtain
    whole-plant phenotypes that could serve as a basis for phenome-wide association
    studies. Within such studies, but also in general, phenomic data should be correlated
    to known parameters derived from other approaches such as genomics or transcriptomics
    and related to physiological processes. Association and correlation of phenotypic
    data to data derived from other approaches can serve to create powerful prediction
    models and, in particular, the correlation of directly accessible external phenotypes
    to internal physiological phenotypes allows the establishment of non-invasive
    predictors that can easily be monitored. These correlations and associations can
    further facilitate the integration of biological functions and processes on different
    levels to create mechanistic models such as crop models used for up-scaling (Sadras
    and Richards, 2014). The use of advanced approaches to model phenotypic data will
    also help to simplify the description of complex results or the illustration of
    processes such as nutrient use efficiency (NUE), water use efficiency (WUE), and
    radiation use efficiency (RUE) (Porter and Christensen, 2013; Brown et al., 2014;
    Granier and Vile, 2014). The crop models will need to be integrated with flux
    models at the cellular and organ level (Baghalian et al., 2014; Kruger and Ratcliffe,
    2015). An example for an integrative approach between physiological phenotyping
    and modelling is the model-assisted analysis of metabolism throughout tomato fruit
    development that reveals enzyme and carrier properties in relation to vacuole
    expansion (Beauvoit et al., 2014) and extensive reprogramming (Colombié et al.,
    2015). Unlike conventional quantitative genetics, integrative phenomics involve
    the detailed analyses of physiological parameters to consider the underlying processes,
    their genetic basis, as well as environmental impacts and agricultural practices.
    This framework is valuable for practical applications because complex crop phenotypes
    with quantitative features and their response to environmental variation cannot
    be understood and predicted based solely on the genes specific to a single macroscopic
    phenotype per se. Armed with this interdisciplinary systems biology approach,
    plant physiology and functional genomics complement each other, ultimately enabling
    the in silico assessment of responses to genetic fine-tuning under defined environments
    (Yin et al., 2004). In practical terms, phenomics demand broad scientific expertise,
    including in genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, systems biology, and higher
    levels of phenotypic expression, and these experts must be capable of communicating
    effectively and of collaboratively designing and executing translational research
    projects on a large scale. Such a multidisciplinary phenomics approach is then
    expected to be able to overcome the operational phenotyping bottleneck currently
    experienced. The big data challenge An increasing major challenge in phenotyping
    is the great number and heterogeneity of data obtained with diverse methods that
    need to be handled and integrated. In particular, the implementation of multiscale
    physiological phenotyping which includes the association of phenotypic information
    with a multitude of metadata and integration of highly diverse data sets, such
    as data deriving from genomic or biochemical analyses, will further contribute
    to the complexity related to the acquisition of large data sets within a multidimensional
    phenomics approach (Krajewski et al., 2015). Such an approach can contribute to
    the aim to capture a detailed image of the current status of as well as processes
    in the plant. The inclusion of additional layers of information such as physiological
    and biochemical data in future phenomics approaches will only allow a better estimation
    of the real plant status as most (if not all) data collected are not of an absolute
    nature. All data acquired at different levels are prone to bias, ranging from
    methodological limitations such as the integration over certain sample sizes in
    biochemical analyses, to errors in experimental set-ups and measurements, to management,
    analysis, and interpretation of data. This is also a complex challenge for advancing
    phenomics beyond state-of-the-art, where an approach would be to integrate physiological
    and biochemical information with genotype and phenotype characteristics (Chen
    et al., 2014) in order to harness the approach towards (i) getting as close to
    the true phenotype as possible considering its true complexity and (ii) identifying
    with a higher frequency specific correlations which ultimately can be used as
    concrete markers that account for specific desired plant traits. A shift from
    the consideration of absolute values to relative signatures that comprise a number
    of individual measuring points will be helpful to diminish the problem. Such approaches
    are, for example, the determination of enzyme activity signatures (Jammer et al.,
    2015) or phytohormone profiles (Großkinsky et al., 2014). An approximation of
    the true phenotype has also to be based on good and standardized experimental
    practices as well as use of uniform nomenclature of data and standardized protocols
    for data processing and interpretation, which can contribute to decrease bias
    and increase comparability of generated data. Data handling Phenotypic data can
    be used for a direct assessment of parameters of interest such as crop traits
    and can create an immediate impression of the plant status. Advanced phenotyping
    approaches generate already enormous amounts of data, which are expected to increase
    in the future considering up-scaling methods for field application, combined use
    of techniques, additional parameters such as derived from physiological phenotyping,
    and increasing resolution and precision. The value of the generated phenotypic
    data thus depends not only on the quality control of the experimentation and data
    collection but also on data management, processing and standardization (Krajewski
    et al., 2015), together forming a kind of ‘good phenotyping practice’. Data nomenclature
    and ontology To make optimal use out of phenotypic data and allow their interpretation
    as scientific results in a uniform way, it is essential to define a nomenclature
    for phenomics. This applies both to the use of terms in the scientific description
    of phenotyping experiments or results and to the ontology needed to secure robust
    data (bio-) informatics of complex data such as derived from sensor measurements
    (Roda and Musulin, 2014). Thus bio-ontologies are essential as integrative tools
    for analysing phenomics and genomics data (Walls et al., 2012). Based on such
    definitions, distinct data can be generated, processed, evaluated, and presented
    in a uniform way, which maintains easy and direct correlations or comparison between
    different data sets. A complete description of data sets necessarily must include
    specific metadata comprising technical information automatically recorded and
    guiding information added manually. Similar to original data, metadata also need
    a certain definition, and especially guidelines on which metadata have to be collected
    for a valid interpretation of the data set. Besides technical metadata necessary
    for functional processing such as unique identifiers, important information could
    include settings of the monitoring device, climatic and light conditions, geographic
    position, and date and time of data collection. Without considering this basic
    information, the interpretation, correlation, and evaluation of phenotypic data
    are hardly possible. With respect to heterogeneity of the data collected, the
    wide range of techniques applied, in particular when integrating wet chemistry
    analyses with non-invasive phenotyping, standardization is urgently needed with
    respect to the metadata, the vocabulary, and formats for data exchange. First
    tools have been already developed for automated plant phenomic analyses using
    plant ontology (Shameer et al., 2014; Oellrich et al., 2015). Data storage, management,
    and processing The information value of the plant phenotype is enormous, but phenotyping
    approaches, particularly high-throughput and high-precision imaging techniques,
    generate huge amounts of data and thus are technically limited by the availability
    of high-performance computation for data storage, management, and processing.
    To maintain phenotypic data generation and processing, advanced computer platforms
    as well as (bio-) informatics tools are needed. To cope with the increasing complexity
    of data, they must be based on newly developed algorithms, which facilitate data
    handling and processing to useful information formats on a reasonable time scale.
    The requirements of informatics thereby strongly depend on the type of generated
    data (amount, complexity), the load of accompanying information as metadata, and
    their ultimate purpose that determines the data analyses needed. For accurate
    data analysis, which procedures are necessary and which are allowed to generate
    an additional value without falsification have to be defined. This applies particularly
    to the important statistical analyses of different complex phenotypic data. Since
    phenomic data derive from phenotyping campaigns conducted worldwide under various
    climatic and geographic conditions, statistical analyses of these data include
    the interesting aspect of geostatistics dealing with such spatial and spatiotemporal
    data. The value and use of phenotypic data would greatly benefit from efforts
    in identification and application of appropriate statistical and geostatistical
    methods to them, which could feed into prediction models, for example for global
    use in precision agriculture. However, all data processing and analysis should
    be feasible and aim towards an easy use of data in an understandable format without
    loss of sense and content. In appropriate formats, phenomic data could also be
    deposited in general databases—comparable with existing databases used, for example,
    in advanced breeding programmes or for genomic data—which would facilitate the
    exchange of information for scientific evaluation of data and directed development
    of novel approaches taking into consideration such database information. Approaches
    are on the way to develop comprehensive information systems making data available
    for the scientific community (Fabre et al., 2011). The future development and
    optimization of phenotyping approaches must involve manufacturers, computer scientists,
    and end-users to define the goals. Successful efforts must therefore be based
    on realistic estimations of the technical possibilities as well as the necessity
    and value of information expected from the use of specific techniques taking into
    consideration certain purposes (e.g. scale of use, broad screening versus detailed
    analysis). Taking these aspects into account, the most promising and powerful
    approaches could be identified and focused on. By intense exchange of information
    from these sectors, the development and validation of useful methods combined
    with the design of user-friendly devices or interfaces including data processing
    to a directly usable format are feasible. The meta-analysis of multiplexed phenotyping
    and phenomics data is both a great opportunity and a challenge (Krajewski et al.,
    2015). Examples of the practical relevance of such analyses of phenomics datasets
    are the crop QTLome (Salvi and Tuberosa, 2015), the analyses of biotic and abiotic
    stress responses (Naika et al., 2013; Blum, 2014), biomass allocation (Poorter
    et al., 2012), and environmental factors (Poorter et al., 2010). Conclusions and
    perspectives In the light of the development of molecular and genetic methods,
    high-performance computing, and automated phenotyping platforms, the implementation
    of physiological phenotyping of the internal phenotype at a cellular or tissue
    level in a multidimensional phenomics approach will open up new opportunities
    to understand the complex interactions between plants and their dynamic environment.
    The combination of high-resolution internal with high-throughput external phenotyping
    offers new opportunities to obtain detailed and complementary information on important
    physiological plant traits which are of agricultural interest. The assessment
    of the phenotype can therefore be used for the improved understanding of the relationship
    between varietal responses to different climate and soil conditions, and management
    strategies. Providing that these methods are fully validated by linking them to
    known genetic and, particularly, physiological functioning, phenotyping is a promising
    and valuable tool for basic and applied plant science and breeding. The establishment
    of robust physiological traits will allow recognition of predispositions and the
    use of predictive physiological phenotyping will be valuable for screening in
    breeding programmes. The rapid development of new research instruments is providing
    scientists with opportunities to work more closely together. This should result
    in more detailed insights into G×E×M interactions, elucidating the mechanisms
    governing phenotypic plasticity, and thus contribute to at least further narrowing
    the genotype-to-phenotype gap. Such an interdisciplinary approach will open up
    completely new perspectives to apply this knowledge for climate-smart breeding
    of new varieties. Through ‘breeding by design’ for sustainable agriculture, varieties
    better adapted to and prepared for future changes in climatic conditions or a
    range of specific local soil conditions, with better ability to resist weeds,
    diseases, and pests and improved ability to exploit water, nutrients, and solar
    energy, can be generated in a more efficient manner (Fig. 2). In addition, from
    this knowledge, precision agriculture will also greatly benefit and stimulate
    the establishment of a closer interaction between breeders and farmers to develop
    protocols mutually for the optimal use of novel varieties (Fig. 2). The tools
    and the knowledge are available to spur on a second green revolution to meet the
    agricultural challenges of the 21st century to feed the world also in the future.

    for enhancing our understanding of genotype–phenotype\nrelationships and its relevance\
    \ to crop improvement\nJoshua N. Cobb • Genevieve DeClerck •\nAnthony Greenberg\
    \ • Randy Clark •\nSusan McCouch\nReceived: 1 November 2012 / Accepted: 8 February\
    \ 2013 / Published online: 8 March 2013\n\x02 The Author(s) 2013. This article\
    \ is published with open access at Springerlink.com\nAbstract\nMore accurate and\
    \ precise phenotyping strate-\ngies are necessary to empower high-resolution linkage\n\
    mapping and genome-wide association studies and for\ntraining genomic selection\
    \ models in plant improvement.\nWithin this framework, the objective of modern\
    \ pheno-\ntyping is to increase the accuracy, precision and throughput\nof phenotypic\
    \ estimation at all levels of biological orga-\nnization while reducing costs\
    \ and minimizing labor\nthrough automation, remote sensing, improved data inte-\n\
    gration and experimental design. Much like the efforts to\noptimize genotyping\
    \ during the 1980s and 1990s, design-\ning effective phenotyping initiatives today\
    \ requires multi-\nfaceted collaborations between biologists, computer sci-\n\
    entists, statisticians and engineers. Robust phenotyping\nsystems are needed to\
    \ characterize the full suite of genetic\nfactors that contribute to quantitative\
    \ phenotypic variation\nacross cells, organs and tissues, developmental stages,\n\
    years, environments, species and research programs. Next-\ngeneration phenotyping\
    \ generates signiﬁcantly more data\nthan previously and requires novel data management,\n\
    access and storage systems, increased use of ontologies to\nfacilitate data integration,\
    \ and new statistical tools for\nenhancing experimental design and extracting\
    \ biologically\nmeaningful signal from environmental and experimental\nnoise.\
    \ To ensure relevance, the implementation of efﬁcient\nand informative phenotyping\
    \ experiments also requires\nfamiliarity with diverse germplasm resources, population\n\
    structures, and target populations of environments. Today,\nphenotyping is quickly\
    \ emerging as the major operational\nbottleneck limiting the power of genetic\
    \ analysis and\ngenomic prediction. The challenge for the next generation\nof\
    \ quantitative geneticists and plant breeders is not only to\nunderstand the genetic\
    \ basis of complex trait variation, but\nalso to use that knowledge to efﬁciently\
    \ synthesize twenty-\nﬁrst century crop varieties.\nIntroduction\nAgriculture\
    \ faces tremendous challenges in the decades\nahead. The FAO predicts that population\
    \ and income\ngrowth will double the global demand for food by 2050,\neffectively\
    \ increasing competition for crops as sources\nof bioenergy, ﬁber and for other\
    \ industrial purposes\n(http://www.fao.org).\nCompounding\nthe\npressure\nfor\n\
    increased agricultural output are looming threats of water\nscarcity, soil fertility\
    \ constraints, and climate change.\nAddressing\nthese\nproblems\nwill\nrequire\n\
    innovative\napproaches to both the agronomic and the genetic com-\nponents of\
    \ crop production systems. More sustainable\nmanagement of renewable soil and\
    \ water resources, in\nconcert with more efﬁcient utilization of genetic diversity\n\
    will be key to achieving the necessary gains in productivity\nCommunicated by\

    \ al. 2011;\nPypers et al. 2011; McCouch et al. 2012).\nGenetic diversity provides\
    \ the basis for all plant\nimprovement. Historically, plant breeders have sought\
    \ to\nunderstand the nature of genetic variation by evaluating the\nperformance\
    \ of breeding populations over years and loca-\ntions. Using replication and sophisticated\
    \ experimental\ndesigns, they obtained useful insights about trait herita-\nbility,\
    \ the inﬂuence of environment, the breeding value of\ndifferent parents, and strategies\
    \ for selecting genetically\nsuperior offspring in the ﬁeld. With the dawn of\
    \ the\ngenomics era, emphasis began to shift toward the evalua-\ntion of genetic\
    \ diversity directly at the DNA level. This\napproach is of interest to geneticists\
    \ for the evolutionary\nand functional insights it brings, and to plant breeders\
    \ as a\nsource of tools for improving the power and efﬁciency of\nselection. Parallel\
    \ investments in genotyping and pheno-\ntyping have generated datasets that can\
    \ be associated with\neach other to address both basic and applied questions.\n\
    Geneticists are interested in the nature and origin of\nmutations and their functional\
    \ signiﬁcance in the context of\nboth qualitative and quantitative traits. Plant\
    \ breeders\nembrace genomics as a way to document and protect the\ngenetic composition\
    \ of plant varieties, trace pedigree\nrelationships, identify and select valuable\
    \ mutations, and\ngain insight into the nature of genotype by genotype\n(G9G)\
    \ and genotype by environment (G9E) interactions.\nThe ultimate goal of genomics\
    \ research in plant breeding is\nto contribute to improving the efﬁciency, effectiveness\
    \ and\neconomy of cultivar improvement.\nAs biology moves from a data-starved\
    \ and largely\nobservational discipline to a data-rich science capable of\nprediction,\
    \ it follows the path of physics and engineering\nthat came before. The tremendous\
    \ innovation in genomics\ntechnology over the last two decades has been driven\
    \ by\nmulti-faceted collaborations between chemists, biologists\nand engineers,\
    \ and today, costs continue to decline while\naccuracy and throughput continue\
    \ to increase (Elshire et al.\n2011; Tung et al. 2010). Correlated with the downward\n\
    trend in the cost of sequencing is the expanded use of high-\nresolution genotyping\
    \ in plant species that were previously\nignored by the genomics community, a\
    \ sampling of which\ninclude cassava, common bean, pea, sunﬂower, cowpea,\nand\
    \ grain amaranth (Bachlava et al. 2012; Ferguson et al.\n2011; Hyten et al. 2010;\
    \ Maughan et al. 2011; Smy´kal et al.\n2012; Varshney et al. 2009; Varshney et\
    \ al. 2010). In\naddition to offering new insights into diverse germplasm\nresources,\
    \ high-throughput genotyping and next-generation\nsequencing (NGS) make it possible\
    \ to efﬁciently leverage\ngenetic information across species. The power of whole-\n\
    genome sequencing as a unifying force in biology has\nmotivated the development\
    \ of diversity panels and large\nmapping populations in many crop species to facilitate\
    \ trait\ndissection and gene discovery (Atwell et al. 2010; Huang\net al. 2010;\
    \ McCouch et al. 2012; Yu et al. 2008; Zhao\net al. 2011a; Neumann et al. 2011;\
    \ Pasam et al. 2012). It\nhas also catalyzed new thinking about how to manipulate\n\
    the genetic variation that exists in elite gene pools (Chen\net al. 2011; Thomson\
    \ et al. 2011; Trebbi et al. 2011).\nWith the deluge of low-cost genomic information\
    \ on\nimportant crop species, a fundamental change in research\nemphasis is needed\
    \ to address the shortage of high-quality\nphenotypic information. At this time,\
    \ phenotyping has\nreplaced genotyping as the major operational bottleneck\nand\
    \ funding constraint of genetic analyses. Unlike geno-\ntyping, which is now highly\
    \ mechanized and essentially\nuniform across organisms, phenotyping is still a\
    \ cottage\nindustry, species-speciﬁc, labor intensive, and inevitably\nenvironmentally\
    \ sensitive. Further, while sequence varia-\ntion is theoretically ﬁnite, and\
    \ thus all sequence variants\ncould conceivably be discovered for a given crop\
    \ species,\nthere is no expectation that the phenome will ever be fully\ncharacterized\
    \ (Houle et al. 2010). The phenome of an\norganism is dynamic and conditional,\
    \ representing a com-\nplex set of responses to a multi-dimensional set of endog-\n\
    enous and exogenous signals that are integrated over the\nevolutionary and developmental\
    \ life history of an individ-\nual. Phenotypic information can be envisioned as\
    \ a con-\ntinuous stream of data that changes over the course of\ndevelopment\
    \ of species, a population or an individual in\nresponse to different environmental\
    \ conditions. While it can\nbe associated with genomic information to understand\
    \ the\ncomponents of phenotypic variation that are due to genetics,\nwith increasing\
    \ availability of high-density genotypic\ninformation, understanding genotype–phenotype\
    \ relation-\nships is becoming more dependent on the availability of\nhigh-quality\
    \ phenotypic and environmental information.\nOver the next two decades, the development\
    \ of pheno-\ntyping strategies will almost certainly mirror innovations in\ngenotyping\
    \ technology that have occurred over the last\n20 years, characterized by increasing\
    \ automation and\nthroughput (Rafalski and Tingey 1993; Perlin et al. 1995;\n\
    Shefﬁeld et al. 1995; Weber and Broman 2001). As the\nscience of phenotyping evolves,\
    \ emphasis will increasingly\nbe placed on generating information that is as accurate\n\
    (able to effectively measure traits and/or performance\ncharacteristics), precise\
    \ (small variance associated with\nreplicated measurement), and as relevant as\
    \ possible, while\nkeeping costs within reasonable limits. If developments in\n\
    genotyping offer a roadmap for where phenotyping is going\nin the future, these\
    \ objectives will be reached based on new\nforms of automation and collaborations\
    \ between biologists,\nengineers and computer scientists.\nThe purpose of this\
    \ review is to outline considerations\nrelated to the future of phenotyping as\
    \ the basis for asso-\nciation mapping and gene discovery as well as for\n868\n\
    Theor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n123\ndeveloping predictive genomic selection\
    \ (GS) models for\ncrop improvement.\nAssociation between phenotype and genotype\n\
    The central challenge of modern genetic analysis is to\nunderstand the biological\
    \ determinants of quantitative\nphenotypic variation. To date efforts in the plant\
    \ genetics\ncommunity have done well at identifying genes underlying\ntraits controlled\
    \ by one or a few loci with large effects.\nThis is particularly true in the major\
    \ crop species where\ngenetic analyses have identiﬁed the biochemical basis of\n\
    many important phenotypes (particularly, resistance to\nbiotic and abiotic stress)\
    \ and have also been the driving\nforce behind the development of tools for marker-assisted\n\
    selection in crop improvement (Foolad and Panthee 2012;\nJin et al. 2010; Paux\
    \ et al. 2010; Robbins et al. 2010).\nHowever, understanding complex trait variation\
    \ has proven\nfrustratingly difﬁcult, as the genetic architecture of these\nimportant\
    \ traits often involves many loci of small effect\nthat may interact with each\
    \ other as well as with the\nenvironment (Buckler et al. 2009; Collard and Mackill\n\
    2008; Schuster 2011). To discriminate such small effects, a\ncombination of technologies\
    \ and statistical methods are\nnow being employed. NGS technologies have provided\
    \ an\neconomically feasible way to survey genetic variation with\na resolution\
    \ that is now limited more by the linkage dis-\nequilibrium (LD) in a particular\
    \ mapping population than\nby marker density. This phenomenon has motivated the\n\
    assembly of large panels of genetic diversity as well as the\ncreation of large\
    \ inter-mated populations to manipulate LD\nand facilitate the association of\
    \ genotype with phenotype\n(Huang et al. 2011; Morris et al. 2013; Yu et al. 2008;\
    \ Zhao\net al. 2011a). These large and diverse populations aim to\nincrease the\
    \ recombination frequency and the frequency of\nrare alleles in order to enhance\

    \ need for\ncareful population design and advocates for the inclusion\nof admixed\
    \ lines that may provide statistically useful\nobservations\nof\nallele\neffects\n\
    in\ndiverse\ngenetic\nbackgrounds.\nPhenotyping for genomic selection\nThe emphasis\
    \ on precision-phenotyping represents a sig-\nniﬁcant change for breeders engaged\
    \ in variety develop-\nment who have traditionally favored simplicity, speed,\
    \ and\nﬂexibility over sensitivity, precision and accuracy. This is\nbecause,\
    \ historically the advantages of the latter could not\nbe translated into economically\
    \ relevant genetic gain in a\nbreeding context. We argue that this paradigm is\
    \ beginning\nto change with the potential to integrate GS into a variety\ndevelopment\
    \ program. As the cost and efﬁciency of\nobtaining genomic information on large\
    \ numbers of indi-\nviduals dips below the cost and efﬁciency of evaluating\n\
    populations phenotypically over years and environments,\nthe breeding community\
    \ is alert to the idea that genomic\ninformation can be leveraged to predict phenotypic\
    \ out-\ncomes (Cabrera-Bosquet et al. 2012; Heffner et al. 2009;\nHeslot et al.\
    \ 2012). Further, the use of Bayesian models\nfacilitates the analysis of sparse\
    \ data (where not all indi-\nviduals or families are evaluated phenotypically\
    \ in each\nenvironment) and strongly suggests that there are cost-\neffective\
    \ experimental designs that can dramatically reduce\nthe amount of replication\
    \ needed to extract meaningful\nphenotypic performance indicators for a population\
    \ (see\nsection on ‘‘Analysis, adjustment, and value extraction of\nphenotypic\
    \ data’’).\nIf the accuracy of genomic predictions is sufﬁcient to\noffset the\
    \ time and expense required to evaluate the per-\nformance of the breeding populations\
    \ in the traditional\nmanner, and if GS demonstrates a clear increase in the rate\n\
    of genetic gain per cycle of selection, then breeders will\nquickly adopt the\
    \ most efﬁcient strategy to accomplish\ntheir goals. This may require staggered\
    \ use of traditional\nand precision-phenotyping, depending on the trait(s) and\n\
    the species under consideration. What is important is\nbreeders begin to reevaluate\
    \ how a focused investment in\nprecision-phenotyping of a training population\
    \ may be able\nto minimize the requirement for costly, extensive pheno-\ntyping\
    \ of large numbers of lines every generation in the\nfuture. The purpose of this\
    \ paper is to explore some of the\nkey dimensions of next-generation phenotyping\
    \ that will\nallow geneticists and breeders to productively interrogate\nthe complex\
    \ me´nage-a`-trois between genotype, phenotype\nand the environment as well as\
    \ to develop models that\nleverage genotypic information to predict phenotypic\n\
    outcomes.\nUnder a GS model, precision-phenotyping is most\nimportant when evaluating\
    \ a training population because\nthat dataset provides the basis for developing\
    \ the statistical\nmodel that is then used to predict phenotypic performance\n\
    in related members of a breeding population. The model is\nderived from the relationship\
    \ between phenotype, geno-\ntype, and G9E, where marker genotypes are treated\
    \ as\nrandom variables. GS is particularly useful when it can\nsave a generation\
    \ or two of time-consuming and expensive\nphenotyping, as only comparatively small\
    \ training popu-\nlations need be screened.\nGenomic selection aims to model genome-wide\
    \ SNP\nvariation without concern for identifying particular alleles,\nloci or\
    \ pathways or understanding how different alleles\ncontribute to the phenotype.\
    \ Since the metric of success is\nthe ability to predict the performance of an\
    \ adapted line or\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n869\n123\nvariety under\
    \ relevant agronomic conditions, it is important\nto consider phenotyping strategies\
    \ that (1) estimate crop\nperformance under appropriate management conditions\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld; (2) can evaluate performance across a population\nof target environments;\
    \ and (3) can generate useful data in\nreal time without a disproportionate investment\
    \ in labor\nand infrastructure. Despite the advantages of accelerating\nthe breeding\
    \ cycle, the ability of GS models to accurately\npredict phenotype is dependent\
    \ on using prohibitively large\ntraining populations when working with traits\
    \ with low\nheritability and complex inheritance (Calus et al. 2008;\nGuo et al.\
    \ 2012; Hayes et al. 2009; Heffner et al. 2010; Jia\nand Jannink 2012; Kumar et\
    \ al. 2012; Nakaya and Isobe\n2012; Munoz et al. 2011; Resende et al. 2012; Zhao\
    \ et al.\n2011b; Zhong et al. 2009). This is due to the fact that G9E\ninteraction\
    \ plays a major role in explaining ﬁeld perfor-\nmance, and GS is highly dependent\
    \ on a prediction model\ndeveloped from a limited sampling of the environmental\n\
    variance. Recombination also disrupts phasing of markers\nand leads to low accuracy\
    \ of predictions as breeding gen-\nerations are farther and farther removed from\
    \ the training\npopulation. Further research is needed to improve the\naccuracy\
    \ of prediction under GS models.\nPhenotyping for QTL and gene discovery\nIn contrast\
    \ to GS, phenotyping of a diversity panel for\ngenome-wide association studies\
    \ (GWAS) or a bi-parental\nmapping population for QTL analysis is designed to\n\
    interpret and dissect the genetic architecture of complex\ntraits and to understand\
    \ how speciﬁc DNA variants con-\ndition the inheritance of diverse phenotypes.\
    \ Both forms of\nlinkage mapping are successful at implicating genomic\nregions\
    \ involved in complex trait variation, but cloning the\ngene(s) underlying the\
    \ QTL remains time-consuming and\nresource intensive, even when the QTL explains\
    \ a sub-\nstantial proportion of the phenotypic variation (Bhatta-\ncharyya 2010;\
    \ Fan et al. 2006; Krattinger et al. 2009; Li\net al. 2010; Liu et al. 2008; Saito\
    \ et al. 2010). Bi-parental\npopulations are limited by the particular alleles\
    \ present in\nthe parents, but they offer power for QTL dissection\nbecause population\
    \ structure is disrupted and genetic\nbackground differences in the progeny are\
    \ constrained.\nAssociation mapping studies, on the other hand, generally\nprovide\
    \ higher resolution of QTL for the same number of\nlines and evaluate a wider\
    \ array of alleles but are limited by\nthe inability to interrogate rare alleles\
    \ or to dissect phe-\nnotypes that are perfectly correlated with population\n\
    structure (Manolio and Collins 2009; Price et al. 2006;\nPritchard and Cox 2002;\
    \ Reich and Lander 2001). When\nlarge numbers of markers are used for either QTL\
    \ analysis\nor GWAS, a multiple test correction is required to limit the\nfalse\
    \ discovery rate. With ever-improving approaches to\nstatistical modeling and\
    \ improvements in the accuracy and\nprecision of phenotyping, both forms of linkage\
    \ mapping\nhold great promise for elucidating the genetic architecture\nof complex\
    \ traits and identifying the genes and speciﬁc\nalleles underlying trait variation.\n\
    Sampling vs. controlling environmental variation\nDifferent approaches to phenotyping\
    \ are required for dif-\nferent purposes (Campos et al. 2004; Crouch et al. 2009;\n\
    Gordon and Finch 2005; Kloth et al. 2012; Masuka et al.\n2012; Pieruschka and\
    \ Poorter 2012). Plant breeders have\ntraditionally relied on large-scale replication\
    \ of phenotypic\ntrials over years and locations to identify individual fami-\n\
    lies or populations that perform best in a target population\nof environments\
    \ (TPE). By modeling locations and years as\nrandom effects, they were able to\
    \ reliably extract genetic\nsignal from environmental noise and identify varieties\
    \ with\nbroad or narrow zones of adaptation (Beavis 1998), though\nthe process\
    \ was very time and labor consuming. Many\ngeneticists, on the other hand study\
    \ phenotypic variation at\nthe cell or tissue-speciﬁc level using plants grown\
    \ under\ncarefully deﬁned environmental conditions, and evaluate\ncascades of\
    \ molecular events using biochemical and\n‘‘omics’’ technology. The world of the\
    \ plant breeder and\nthat of the molecular geneticist intersect at the level of\
    \ the\nplant, but the different scales of phenotyping make it\nchallenging to\
    \ integrate the knowledge contributed by each\ncommunity into a uniﬁed and comprehensive\
    \ view of the\ngenetic determinants of plant growth, development and\nresponse\
    \ to environment.\nUnder ﬁeld conditions, it is often convenient to collapse\n\
    quantitative phenotypes into discrete categories to facilitate\nmanual data collection\
    \ in real time and at reasonable cost.\nThis has been the practice for many years\
    \ among breeders\nand geneticists working with large, ﬁeld-grown popula-\ntions,\
    \ and different communities of researchers have\ndeveloped standardized categorical\
    \ scales or indices for\nimportant whole-plant phenotypes that are easy to apply\n\
    (Clarke et al. 1992; De Boever et al. 1993; International\nRice Research Institute\
    \ 1996; Kuhn and Smith 1977; Mo-\nlina-Cano 1987; Yuan et al. 2004). For example,\
    \ traits such\nas ﬂowering time or disease resistance are frequently\nestimated\
    \ using a visual assessment of ‘‘days to 50 %\nﬂowering’’ in a row or plot, or\
    \ ‘‘percent leaf area affected’’\non individual diseased plants. Historically,\
    \ trait evaluation\nusing these indices was reliable enough to provide rea-\n\
    sonable data in the context of plant breeding. However,\nnew population designs\
    \ (Yu et al. 2008) in combination\nwith high-density marker coverage have increased\
    \ the\npower to detect small-effect QTL and estimate their\n870\nTheor Appl Genet\
    \ (2013) 126:867–887\n123\neffects, even on whole-plant phenotypes. This suggests\
    \ that\nmore rigorous, quantitative approaches to phenotyping are\nlikely to bring\
    \ rewards. Further, when there is signiﬁcant\nvariability in phenotypic scores\
    \ collected by different\nindividuals, more objective phenotyping protocols are\n\
    desirable (Poland and Nelson 2010).\nRecently, it has been argued that automated,\
    \ high-\nthroughput, ﬁeld-based organismal phenotyping techniques\ninvolving remote\
    \ sensing (such as near-infrared spectros-\ncopy mounted on agricultural harvesters\
    \ to measure spec-\ntral canopy reﬂectance with the aid of global positioning\n\
    system (GPS)-guided tractors) will enhance the precision\nand accuracy of phenotyping\
    \ without extracting plants\nfrom the production environment (Cabrera-Bosquet\
    \ et al.\n2012; Houle et al. 2010; Montes et al. 2007; Tuberosa\n2012; White et\
    \ al. 2012). While these efforts can certainly\nfacilitate selection for enhanced\
    \ performance in a target\nzone of adaptation, one of the biggest challenges associated\n\
    with these automated, ﬁeld-based technologies is the var-\niable nature of most\
    \ natural environments.\nTo enhance the ability to screen for stress tolerance\
    \ in\nﬁeld-grown plants, scientists often use plant populations to\n‘sample’ the\
    \ degree of stress encountered in a TPE. Once\nthis has been ascertained, the\
    \ TPE is used to evaluate the\nrelative performance of different populations over\
    \ several\ngrowing seasons. This requires signiﬁcant up-front invest-\nment, as\
    \ many different locations must be tested over\nmultiple years in order to make\
    \ an accurate estimation.\nAlternatively, breeders use ‘‘managed stress’’ as a\
    \ way of\noptimizing screening protocols for application to large\nplant populations\
    \ in the ﬁeld. By managing the amount and\ntiming of water, fertilizer, pest control\
    \ or soil amendments,\nplants can be exposed to fairly reliable levels of stress\n\
    while experiencing normal temperature, day length, etc.,\nover the course of the\
    \ growing season. These approaches\nwork well if the genetic component of phenotypic\
    \ variation\n(heritability) is high, and if the differences among popu-\nlations\
    \ or individuals within a population are large. How-\never, in cases where complex\
    \ traits are conditioned by\nmany alleles with small effects, the error associated\
    \ with\nestimating the phenotype and the environmental variance\ncontributing\
    \ to the observed phenotypic variation are likely\nto dilute the relatively weak\
    \ genetic signals and may pre-\nclude their detection.\nTo partially overcome\
    \ this problem, many researchers\nhave endeavored to take advantage of phenotyping\
    \ strate-\ngies based on analytical chemistry (i.e. gas chromatogra-\nphy–mass\n\
    spectroscopy,\nhigh\nperformance\nliquid\nchromatography, inductively coupled\
    \ plasma spectroscopy,\netc.) or a wide range of -omics technologies (transcripto-\n\
    mics, metabolomics, ionomics, proteomics, etc.). These are\nall highly automated\
    \ and are important and useful due to\ntheir high throughput and high accuracy.\
    \ They are\ngenerally used to analyze speciﬁc anatomical parts of a\nplant at\
    \ a particular time(s) in its development, and are best\nused on plants grown\
    \ under well-deﬁned growing condi-\ntions. Owing to the high cost per sample and\
    \ the require-\nment\nfor\nconsiderable\ntechnical\nexpertise\nand\ninfrastructure,\
    \ these techniques may not be available to\neveryone and it may not be economically\
    \ feasible to survey\nlarge numbers of ﬁeld-grown plants. Thus, it often makes\n\
    sense to ﬁrst screen a population under controlled condi-\ntions with minimal\
    \ replication and once a hypothesis about\nthe genetic control of a trait of interest\
    \ is formulated, it can\nbe tested in a focused way in the ﬁeld, or simply used\
    \ to\neliminate a large proportion of a population prior to\nundertaking ﬁeld\
    \ evaluation.\nScreening populations under controlled conditions is\nalso appropriate\
    \ when the controlled environment is nec-\nessary to impose a particular form\
    \ of stress or to permit\ngrowth of plants under speciﬁc conditions that cannot\
    \ be\nreplicated in the ﬁeld. Controlled environments have been\nsuccessfully\
    \ used to inoculate plants with a particular strain\nof a pathogen, or to impose\
    \ a particular abiotic stress such\nas aluminum toxicity without the natural coupling\
    \ with\nphosphorus deﬁciency, or high CO2 in combination with a\ncritical night\
    \ time temperature. Use of multi-step strategies\ninvolving both controlled and\
    \ ﬁeld environments are often\nthe best way to maximize the extraction of useful\
    \ genetic\ninformation while minimizing the expense and time\ninvolved (Fernie\
    \ and Schauer 2009; Rafalski 2010).\nDrought tolerance as an illustration\nWhile\
    \ a complete survey of advances in drought pheno-\ntyping is beyond the scope\
    \ of this review (see Mir et al.\n2012 for a detailed overview of this topic),\
    \ drought toler-\nance offers a compelling example of a combined approach\nof\
    \ leveraging both controlled and uncontrolled phenotyp-\ning designs to enhance\
    \ genetic analysis. The onset of water\ndeﬁcit and its impact on plant performance\
    \ is a dynamic\nprocess that occurs across space and time. Under ﬁeld\nconditions\
    \ the inability to obtain standardized and consis-\ntent drought stress contributes\
    \ to a loss in heritability and\npresents a challenge for both selection and mapping\n\
    experiments (Berger et al. 2010). Many different approa-\nches have been used\
    \ to apply deﬁned levels of drought\nstress in an effort to understand the nature\
    \ of this complex\ntrait, ranging from chemically manipulating osmotic bal-\n\
    ance in hydroponics (Rengasamy 2010; Tavakkoli et al.\n2010) to conveyer systems\
    \ in glasshouses with digitally\ncontrolled irrigation systems (Granier et al.\
    \ 2006; Jansen\net al. 2009; Neumann 2013; Pereyra-Irujo et al. 2012) to\nthe\
    \ use of rainout shelters in the ﬁeld (Czyczyło-Mysza\net al. 2011; Dodig et al.\

    \ Zhu et al.\n2011b; Clark et al. 2011) to physiological metrics related to\n\
    water status (Bartlett et al. 2012a, b; Blum 2009; Gilbert et al.\n2011; Ogburn\
    \ and Edwards 2012; Tucker et al. 2011) to\nspectral imaging of shoot tissue (Berger\
    \ et al. 2010; Goltsev\net al. 2012; Liu et al. 2011; Zia et al. 2012) to simply\
    \ evaluating\nyield under stress in the ﬁeld (Bennett et al. 2012; Bernier et\

    \ Rehman et al. 2011; Swamy et al. 2011; Venuprasad\net al. 2012; Vikram et al.\
    \ 2011). Screening can be done using\nin-house facilities (growth chambers, green\
    \ houses) or out-\nsourced to a phenotyping facility such as the Ju¨lich Plant\n\
    Phenotyping Centre—JPPC (Ju¨lich, Germany; http://www.fz-\njuelich.de/ibg/ibg-2/EN/About_us/organisation/JPPC/JPPC_\n\

    the High Resolution Plant Phenomics Center—HRPPC\n(CSIRO Plant Industry, Canberra\
    \ Australia; http://www.plant\nphenomics.org/HRPPC). The two former facilities\
    \ are part of\nthe larger European Plant Phenomics Network (http://\nwww.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/)\
    \ and the latter two are\npart of the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility (http://www.\n\
    plantphenomics.org.au/). Each system presents its own\nadvantages and disadvantages,\
    \ but collectively they empower\nthe researcher to investigate plant response\
    \ to drought in ways\nthat are more comprehensive than any one design can offer.\n\
    These approaches are most often utilized for linkage mapping\nand gene discovery,\
    \ and once QTL or candidate genes are\nidentiﬁed, they can be validated for practical\
    \ application by\nevaluating speciﬁc germplasm, genetic stocks or breeding\npopulations\
    \ under managed drought conditions in the ﬁeld (Ali\net al. 2010; Cavanagh et\
    \ al. 2008; Huang et al. 2012; Kholova´\net al. 2010; Saisho and Takeda 2011;\
    \ Venuprasad et al. 2011;\nYadav et al. 2011). If validated, lines carrying the\
    \ genes or\nQTLs of interest will be useful for elucidating the molecular\nmechanism(s)\
    \ involved in the component trait(s), and will also\nbe of immediate value as\
    \ donor material for breeding with elite\ngermplasm.\nExamining the relationship\
    \ between phenotypic varia-\ntion under controlled environments and that observed\n\
    under ﬁeld conditions offers valuable insights that can be\nused to iteratively\
    \ improve controlled environment phe-\nnotyping techniques so they are more predictive\
    \ of plant\nperformance in the ﬁeld (Table 1; Fig. 1). Ultimately, the\nchoice\
    \ of phenotyping approach will depend on the inten-\ntion of the researcher, the\
    \ size of the population in question\n[e.g. less than ten individuals for precise\
    \ physiological\nexperiments, to a moderate number of lines (200–400) for\nmapping\
    \ studies or GS training populations, or a large\nnumber of lines (400–1,000?)\
    \ for association studies], the\nheritability of the phenotype, the tractability\
    \ of the phe-\nnotype to controlled environment testing, and resource\navailability.\n\
    Development of technology and phenotyping tools\nThe creative use of technology\
    \ and careful development of\ntools to automate processes without sacriﬁcing predictive\n\
    power will be critical as next-generation phenotyping\nplatforms are developed.\
    \ This can be a real challenge as\nmany\nexperimental\ntechniques\nin\nplant\n\
    physiology,\nmolecular biology and breeding can be restrictive and\nrequire specialized\
    \ protocols that are often difﬁcult to\nstandardize. The integration of these\
    \ approaches will be\nnecessary to fully interrogate the genetic landscape of\n\
    complex traits. Standardized phenotyping systems are not\nfeasible for all research\
    \ questions, but with thorough con-\nsideration and clearly deﬁned objectives,\
    \ many techniques\ncan be harnessed to investigate speciﬁc traits under high-\n\
    throughput settings.\nIn recent years, automation, imaging, and software\nsolutions\
    \ have paved the way for many high-throughput\nphenotyping studies. Semi-automated\

    plant growth and development, and can be used to help\ntackle basic research questions\
    \ when combined with\ngenetic mapping strategies (Famoso et al. 2010). Addi-\n\

    \ plant phenotyping incorporate\npredeﬁned processing and analysis procedures\
    \ into semi-\nautomatic or automatic routines in order to quantify mul-\ntiple\
    \ phenotypes from single images or groups of images.\nIn its essence, high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping means\nintegrating and optimizing a phenotyping process in a way\n\
    that makes it as efﬁcient and controlled as possible. In\nconsidering efﬁciency,\
    \ several questions and decisions\narise related to the accuracy, precision, automation,\
    \ and\nadaptability of various stages of the phenotyping process,\nfrom growth\
    \ techniques to experimental design and man-\nagement practices to data capture\
    \ and analysis strategies.\nThe accuracy and precision of the treatment and mea-\n\
    surement process is a fundamental concern during any\nexperimental procedure.\
    \ During phenotyping studies where\nmultiple individuals and replicates from different\
    \ genetic\nbackgrounds are evaluated across batches, effectively\ncontrolling\
    \ the accuracy and precision of the phenotyping\nsystem will have direct impacts\
    \ on the outcome of the\nanalysis. Accuracy and precision are intimately interre-\n\
    lated, where accuracy represents how close the process or\nmeasurement is to the\
    \ absolute truth and precision repre-\nsents the repeatability or variance of\
    \ the measurement\nprocess. Accuracy is important when there is variation\nacross\
    \ individual genotypes during mapping experiments.\nFor instance, Clark et al.\
    \ (2011) characterized the root\nsystems of a rice bi-parental recombinant inbred\
    \ line (RIL)\npopulation, and found that one parental genotype had\ndense, highly\
    \ branched root systems while the other had\nlong, sparse root systems. In order\
    \ to clearly capture these\ndifferences, a system needed to be designed that could\n\
    correctly quantify both types of root systems in order to\nproperly assess their\
    \ relationship and further analyze var-\niation within the progeny. Comparison\
    \ and validation\nstudies with known standards, such as the use of comple-\nmentary\
    \ imaging modalities or other quantiﬁcation soft-\nware, can help evaluate the\
    \ accuracy of a system.\nPrecision is critical when individual genotypes have\n\
    multiple replicates that are evaluated across several bat-\nches. Presuming that\
    \ the replicates share similar charac-\nteristics, the measurement system must\
    \ be able to quantify\nthe features in a repeatable way to prevent unpredictable\n\
    system noise from masking the true similarities/differences\nbetween the genotypes.\
    \ While there are statistical approa-\nches for accounting for unwarranted variability\
    \ in silico,\nefforts to improve the precision of data collection will only\n\
    serve to enhance the statistical power of any analysis per-\nformed. The key to\
    \ maintaining precision throughout a\nphenotyping activity is to employ stable\
    \ instrument designs\nthat can effectively control precision, such as the ﬁxed\n\
    lighting and camera setups used in the root systems in\nstudies cited previously.\n\
    Unfortunately, there will always be trade-offs between\nthe maintenance of accuracy,\
    \ precision, and the ultimate\nthroughput of the phenotyping approach. As throughput\n\
    and standardization increase, it necessitates a drop in\naccuracy and precision\
    \ that must be carefully monitored in\norder to maintain the economic feasibility\
    \ of the data\ncollection. It is not always straightforward to properly\nbalance\
    \ these trade-offs, but through iterative design and\ntesting, phenotyping tools\
    \ can be established to satisfy\nresearch objectives and meet resource constraints.\n\
    The level of automation employed by a phenotyping\napproach is counter-balanced\
    \ not only by trade-offs with\naccuracy\nand\nprecision,\nbut\nalso\nwith\nadaptability.\n\
    Increasing automation improves throughput and reduces\nlabor costs, but also results\
    \ in more specialized designs that\nhave less adaptability and predictive power,\
    \ and are prone\nto errors from non-standard individuals. This principle is\n\
    illustrated well when image analysis involves batch pro-\ncessing many photographs\
    \ using predeﬁned algorithms and\ncommands. It is fairly obvious that batch processing\
    \ is\ninvaluable during large-scale phenotyping experiments\nwhere thousands of\
    \ images can be generated daily, but this\nalso means that the software must rely\
    \ on a rigid set of\nconstraints. The quality of the images is usually not a\n\
    problem during high-throughput phenotyping where the\nimaging process is standardized,\
    \ but if any individuals\ndeviate from pre-speciﬁed growth assumptions of the\n\
    measurement algorithm, unpredictable and misleading\nmeasurement errors can arise.\
    \ Even with automated anal-\nysis algorithms that have been thoroughly tested,\
    \ it is\nnecessary for the experimenter to manually check and\nvalidate the system\
    \ outputs regularly. Along those same\nlines, incorporating user-guided processes\
    \ into the pheno-\ntyping pipeline can also provide a useful compromise that\n\
    improves the ﬂexibility while maintaining the efﬁciency\nneeded to perform large\
    \ experiments (Clark et al. 2012; Le\nBot et al. 2010; Lobet et al. 2011).\nMost\
    \ phenotyping tools that have been developed by\nresearch groups in the public\
    \ and private sector are inte-\ngrated in a way that makes them easy to disseminate\
    \ and\nuse, but sometimes this convenience can limit the range of\ntheir functionality\
    \ to other studies. While this has precip-\nitated the release of a number of\
    \ software programs\navailable for the extraction of phenotype data from images\n\
    (Table 2), the highly speciﬁc nature of individual pheno-\ntypes also motivates\
    \ the development of in-house tools\nideally suited to the analysis at hand. Although\
    \ it is not a\nsimple task, implementing modular designs will help\nincrease ﬂexibility\
    \ of phenotyping in the future. The\n874\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n\

    \ users to create and share custom-developed plugins\nthat expand the functionality\
    \ of the software and make it\napplicable to wide range of research disciplines.\
    \ Modular\nconcepts have proven quite successful for the high-\nthroughput phenotyping\
    \ of notoriously difﬁcult phenotypes\nsuch as root system traits. A notable example\
    \ is GiaRoots,\na software program that allows users to incorporate their\nown\
    \ processing and algorithms into the automated analysis\nroutines as a way of\
    \ overcoming the limitations imposed by\nmore integrated approaches (Galkovskyi\
    \ et al. 2012).\nAccess, storage, and management of phenotypic data\nIt is clear\
    \ then, that much of next-generation phenotyping\nwill be done at the intersection\
    \ of the ﬁelds of biology,\nengineering, and computer science. Progress in developing\n\
    technology in these disciplines that empowers next-gener-\nation phenotyping strategies\
    \ is moving forward rapidly.\nHowever, congruent with the progress in the capability\
    \ to\ncollect high-throughput phenotypic data, is the growing\nproblem of managing\
    \ these data sets in ways that empower\nvalue extraction. Retroﬁtting a lab to\
    \ handle the rapid\ninﬂux of phenotype data could require signiﬁcant invest-\n\
    ment in facilities, device control systems and computa-\ntional resources.\nFor\
    \ experiments that are only measuring a few traits on a\npanel of germplasm, setting\
    \ up a local (customized) phe-\nnotyping system in-house might be practical; but\
    \ in such\ncases, a laboratory information management system (LIMS)\nor local\
    \ database may be needed to manage the high vol-\numes of phenotypic information.\
    \ Generally, there are no\n‘off the shelf’ solutions that can be applied universally,\
    \ so\nsome computer expertise will be needed for data manage-\nment. Even so,\
    \ organizing that information into a ‘‘phe-\nnome’’ is challenging because of\
    \ the continuous, multi-\nfaceted, and interpretive nature of what a phenotypic\n\
    observation is, contrasted with the ‘‘discrete’’ nature of\ngenotypic data, which\
    \ can be abstracted into a single\nalphabetical character (National Science Foundation\
    \ 2011).\nBeyond the technologies used to run, collect and digest\nlarge-scale\
    \ phenotypic evaluations, the ﬁeld of phenomics\nfaces similar bottlenecks that\
    \ genomics has been grappling\nwith as the drop in cost of DNA sequencing outpaces\
    \ the\ncost of hard drive data storage (Stein 2010). Though there\nis ample exploration\
    \ that can be done on genomic data\nalone, for many plant researchers, associating\
    \ and enrich-\ning genotype data with phenotypic manifestations contex-\ntualized\
    \ by the ﬁeld environment is a vital part of gaining\ntrue biological insight\
    \ and solving agronomic problems.\nThe storage of phenotype data at this scale\
    \ has become a\nsub-discipline on its own and some projects are dealing\nwith\
    \ it quite well. There are many public databases that\nhave been working to organize\
    \ and collate plant phenotype\ndata (Lai et al. 2012; Table 3), but most only\
    \ have the\ncurrent capacity to present free-text phenotypic descrip-\ntions of\
    \ mutants, e.g. SoyBase (Grant et al. 2010) and\nMaizeGDB (Schaeffer et al. 2011).\
    \ Some crop databases\nhave tried to move beyond this paradigm by including\n\
    functionality for the management of phenotypic measure-\nments, predominantly\
    \ from either managed ﬁeld trials or\nGWA studies [e.g. T3 Triticeae Toolbox (http://triticeae\n\
    toolbox.org), Panzea (Canaran et al. 2008), and Gramene’s\ndiversity module (Chen\
    \ et al. 2010)]. They are also among\na number of projects preparing for an increasing\
    \ amount of\nassociation data emerging from the marriage of powerful\ngenomic\
    \ information with next-generation phenotyping.\nOne effort is NCBI’s dbGAP (Mailman\
    \ et al. 2007), which\nwas created as a public repository for phenotypes, geno-\n\
    types and the associations between them. Currently, how-\never, dbGAP only accepts\
    \ human data.\nThere are a few database projects that specialize spe-\nciﬁcally\
    \ in plant phenomics data, and deserve to be high-\nlighted. The ﬁrst example\
    \ of these is PHENOPSIS DB\n(Juliette et al. 2011), which mainly houses information\n\
    regarding the growth response of Arabidopsis thaliana to\nvarious environmental\
    \ conditions. The database is popu-\nlated with phenotype information extracted\
    \ from images\nand measurements collected automatically in specialized\ngrowth\
    \ chambers. The collaborative international network\nfor ionomics ( http://www.ionomicshub.org;\
    \ Baxter et al.\n2007) is a second example that hosts ICP-mass spectrom-\netry\
    \ ionomics data for thousands of Arabidopsis, rice, and\nyeast samples with the\
    \ goal to facilitate the understanding\nof response mechanisms in plants to various\
    \ nutrient\navailabilities and/or abiotic toxicities.\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ other efforts in human and mouse\ngenomics research that could serve as useful\
    \ models for\ncontinued development in the plant phenomics domain.\nMouse genomics\
    \ informatics (MGI), (http://www.infor\nmatics.jax.org)\ncomprise\nseveral\ndatabase\n\
    projects,\nincluding the mouse genome database (MGD), (Eppig et al.\n2012) and\
    \ houses a variety of tools for searching and\nbrowsing large phenotype data sets.\
    \ PhenomicDB is\nanother, multi-species (primarily human, mouse, fruit ﬂy,\nand\
    \ yeast) resource designed to empower ‘‘comparative\nphenomics’’ (Kahraman et\
    \ al. 2005). The nutritional phe-\nnotype database (Van Ommen et al. 2010) is\
    \ a third, which\nfocuses on human nutritional phenotype data. The DbNP\neven\
    \ goes a step further than most databases by empha-\nsizing the importance of\
    \ the characterization and uniﬁca-\ntion of experimental designs and allows for\
    \ ﬁner grained\nstorage and searching protocol parameters. The DbNP\n876\nTheor\
    \ Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n123\nproject recently announced that it will\
    \ further expand the\nscope of the resource to include management of environ-\n\
    mental plant studies (http://www.dbnp.org).\nOne important feature shared among\
    \ many current dat-\nabases organizing phenotype data is the use of controlled\n\
    vocabularies known as ‘ontological terms’. Ontologies are\nsets of deﬁned keywords\
    \ that can be used as tags to qualify\nand describe features related to biological\
    \ data points and\ndata sets. Such ontological terms can be used to describe\n\
    traits, genes, environments, or taxonomy. As an example,\none might use the hierarchy\
    \ of terms ‘‘growth and devel-\nopment C shoot\ndevelopment C inﬂorescence\ndevelop-\n\
    ment C ﬂower development C ﬂowering time C days to\nﬂower’’ to describe formally\
    \ what is colloquially referred\nto as simply ‘‘ﬂowering time’’. While this is\
    \ an arguably\nsimple example, it is not difﬁcult to imagine the com-\nplexity\
    \ that ensues when trying to use ontologies to\ndescribe\ncomplicated\nmolecular\n\
    pathways.\nUsage\nof\nontologies is a critical step toward making diverse and\n\
    rapidly growing collections of biological data searchable,\nand accessible to\
    \ computational algorithms. The Open\nBiological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry\
    \ (OBO\nfoundry) (Smith et al. 2007) has emerged as an important\ncentralized\
    \ repository for plant and animal ontological\ncollections, with the goal of increasing\
    \ standardization and\nmaximizing interoperability between ontologies. For plant\n\
    data the most commonly used ontologies include the plant\nontology (PO), (Avraham\
    \ et al. 2008; Jaiswal et al. 2005)\nthe plant trait ontology (TO), plant environment\
    \ ontology\n(EO), and the phenotypic quality ontology (PATO).\nUnfortunately,\
    \ all research groups do not universally\nadopt usage of these community standards\
    \ and without a\ncritical mass of ‘‘buy-in’’, their beneﬁts cannot be fully\n\
    realized. Also a great deal of time and resources go into the\ncuration and maintenance\
    \ of ontologies and projects rely\non term-based grant funding, which is not always\
    \ reliable.\nIn order to meet the demand imposed by the upscaling\nof phenotypic\
    \ data production, sophisticated computational\nmethods will need to be employed.\
    \ Phenotype data is\ncomplex and highly context sensitive, and crucial infor-\n\
    mation can potentially be lost when data descriptions are\nﬂattened down to only\
    \ a few ontology terms. As a way of\ndealing with this complexity, some groups\
    \ have been\nexploring the potential of the Semantic Web (Lee et al. 2001)\ntoexpandthedimensionalityofstoredbiologicaldata\
    \ inorder\nto more effectively mine the enormous volume of descriptive\ndata available\
    \ in the literature (Vision et al. 2011). The\nPhenoscape project (http://kb.phenoscape.org;\
    \ Mabee et al.\n2012) has been working on developing semantical search\nalgorithms\
    \ capable of linking biological data by relationships\nbetween ontological terms\
    \ and by similarities found between\nfree-text descriptions. Data are characterized\
    \ as statements of\nfact, where there is a subject (e.g. ‘‘a ﬂoret’’), a predicate\
    \ (e.g.\nTable 3\nA selection of integrated storage and maintenance systems designed\

    \ this approach adds some of the\nnecessary dimensionality for unlocking biological\
    \ meaning\nusing linguistic and intuitive tool sets.\nAnalysis, adjustment, and\
    \ value extraction\nof phenotypic data\nIndependent of the effort involved to\
    \ both collect and\nappropriately manage high-throughput phenotype data, the\n\
    data sets themselves are only as valuable as the analyses\nthat can be performed\
    \ on them. Great care must be taken to\nmake accurate inferences from the data\
    \ in order to cor-\nrectly characterize the genotype–phenotype relationship.\n\
    Correct estimations of genetic gain from selection, for\nexample, depend heavily\
    \ on accurate estimates of herita-\nbility and the covariance among phenotypes\
    \ (Dickerson\n1955). Because none of these parameters are directly\nobservable,\
    \ they must be estimated from data using a\nvariety of statistical models.\nWhile\
    \ the methods for measuring phenotypic data are\nbecoming more sophisticated and\
    \ the ability to catalog and\nquery data across experimental designs is becoming\
    \ more\nachievable, the precision of such data will always be lim-\nited by inherent\
    \ biological noise. This biological noise is\nunavoidable and is even present\
    \ under the most controlled\nexperimental conditions. These ﬂuctuations can be\
    \ local,\naffecting single organisms, or more general, inﬂuencing the\nwhole experiment\
    \ and modifying the phenotypes for the\nwhole replicate population. Furthermore,\
    \ where automation\nis impractical, and a team of researchers is employed to\n\
    conduct the experiment, individual bias can skew obser-\nvations, even in cases\
    \ where subjective criteria are not\ndirectly used to measure the phenotypes.\
    \ These problems\nare further compounded by the environmental variability\nthat\
    \ inconsistently affects phenotypic observation over\nboth space and time. Unpredictable\
    \ environmental condi-\ntions can also lead to a fair amount of missing data,\
    \ which\nin turn will limit the statistical power to make inferences\nabout the\
    \ genotypic contribution to the phenotype. In\naddition to biological and environmental\
    \ noise, variable\nassay quality can introduce further uncertainty and must be\n\
    accounted for in any statistical models that are used to\nestimate parameters\
    \ of interest.\nLinear models have long been the mainstay of quanti-\ntative-genetic\
    \ experiments, and are the most commonly\napplied statistical approach to understanding\
    \ phenotypic\nvariation. Traditionally, these models are ﬁt using a variety\n\
    of maximum-likelihood approaches (Lynch and Walsh\n1997; Sorensen and Gianola\
    \ 2002). These approaches are\npopular because they are fast and easy to use,\
    \ and their\nlong history has resulted in a wide availability of user-\nfriendly\
    \ software. However, maximum-likelihood methods\nhave a number of serious limitations.\
    \ Fundamentally,\nmaximum-likelihood model ﬁtting yields point estimates of\n\
    parameters, ignoring the inherent uncertainty in their val-\nues. Parameters are\
    \ then tested for statistical signiﬁcance\nbased on a threshold (typically the\
    \ 5 % cut-off) and are\nexcluded from further analysis if they are not ‘‘signiﬁcant’’.\n\
    Finally, these statistical tests rely on restrictive assump-\ntions about the\
    \ distributions of model parameters. These\nconstraints of maximum-likelihood\
    \ model ﬁtting affect\nexperimental designs and data acquisition procedures, as\n\
    well as biasing the resulting associations. More pointedly,\nthese estimates perform\
    \ well only when measurements are\nextensively replicated and normally distributed.\
    \ Therefore,\na great variety of procedures for data normalization and\ndetection\
    \ of outliers are necessary in order to meet the\nassumptions of the model. Unfortunately,\
    \ these methods\nare often poorly motivated from a statistical point of view\n\
    because they involve arbitrary thresholds for data exclu-\nsion. Despite these\
    \ drawbacks, the speed and prevalence of\nmaximum-likelihood\nmethods\nmake\n\
    them\nuseful\nas\nexploratory data analysis tools even in cases where the\nresulting\
    \ estimates are not expected to be robust.\nThe Bayesian approach to statistical\
    \ inference is funda-\nmentally different and overcomes many of the limitations\n\
    imposed by a maximum-likelihood approach. Instead of\narriving at single most\
    \ likely point estimates of parameters,\nthe goal of Bayesian inference is to\
    \ describe distributions of\nrandom variables of interest, taking into account\
    \ uncertainty\nin all the other model parameters. This perspective on\ninference\
    \ is thus much more in line with biological reality\nand should be preferable\
    \ when dealing with phenotype data\nthat have been contextualized by both the\
    \ genotype and the\nenvironment. The drawback of Bayesian inference is its\ncomputational\
    \ complexity. Historically, this complexity has\nbeen the disadvantage that held\
    \ back widespread applica-\ntions of Bayesian statistics. However, with the dramatic\n\
    increase in computer power, it is now feasible to apply this\napproach to inference\
    \ even when the data sets are large and\nmulti-faceted. Furthermore, computer\
    \ packages that make\nmodel building and analysis relatively simple and accessi-\n\
    ble to researchers without a programming background are\nstarting to make an appearance\
    \ (Lunn et al. 2009; Plummer\n2003). Bayesian formulations of the standard quantitative-\n\
    genetic models have been extensively studied (Sorensen\nand Gianola 2002), but\
    \ these models can be computation-\nally inefﬁcient for large data sets. This\
    \ is true for maximum-\nlikelihood as well, but because Bayesian estimation\n\
    involves the extra step of estimating full distributions rather\nthan just point\
    \ estimates of parameters the computational\nproblems are particularly acute.\n\
    Appreciable improvements in computational stability\nand efﬁciency can be achieved\
    \ by re-formulating the\n878\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n123\nstandard\
    \ linear models in a hierarchical framework (Gel-\nman et al. 2003; Gelman and\
    \ Hill 2007). This framework is\npopular in the analyses of sociological data,\
    \ and is now\nachieving more currency in genetics (Greenberg et al.\n2010; Lenarcic\
    \ et al. 2012). The basic idea is that quanti-\ntative-genetic experiments are\
    \ inherently structured. For\nexample, when an inbred line is evaluated in a number\
    \ of\nenvironments, environmental effects can be nested within\ngenotypic effects.\
    \ Such nesting improves computational\nefﬁciency, increases power by incorporating\
    \ data-driven\npooling of observations from replicates (Gelman et al.\n2003; Gelman\
    \ and Hill 2007; Greenberg et al. 2010), and\naids in biological interpretation\
    \ of the results. Nesting\nenvironmental effects within genotypes has the added\n\
    convenience of allowing the direct modeling of G9E\ninteractions simply by estimating\
    \ the regression slopes as\nthey vary between inbred lines.\nIn cases where even\
    \ modest numbers of outlier obser-\nvations are present, Bayesian hierarchical\
    \ models also\nout-perform\nsimilar\nmaximum-likelihood\napproaches\n(Greenberg\
    \ et al. 2010). Furthermore, it is straightforward\nto expand hierarchical models\
    \ to include non-normal data\n(Gelman et al. 2003; Gelman and Hill 2007; Greenberg\n\
    et al. 2010), handle unbalanced designs (Gelman et al.\n2003; Greenberg et al.\
    \ 2010), incorporate variable assay\nquality (Greenberg et al. 2010, 2011), account\
    \ for outlier\nobservations without using arbitrary thresholds to exclude\nthem\
    \ from the data (Greenberg et al. 2010, 2011; Lenarcic\net al. 2012), and interrogate\
    \ phenotypic networks by\nextending the analyses to multiple phenotypes through\n\
    multivariate modeling (Greenberg et al. 2011). Finally,\nbecause the Bayesian\
    \ approach integrates over the inherent\nuncertainty in a system and borrows power\
    \ across the\nexperiment through hierarchical modeling, it reduces the\nneed for\
    \ extensive biological replicates, and therefore\nmaximizes the number of lines\
    \ that can be evaluated in a\ngiven study (Greenberg et al. 2010).\nThat being\
    \ said, while Bayesian hierarchical models are\nrobust to many problems in experimental\
    \ design and data\nacquisition, it is still a good idea to follow best practices\n\
    when embarking on a quantitative-genetic experiment.\nCertain problems, such as\
    \ putting all replicates for a line in\na single block, lead to complete confounding\
    \ of variables\nthat cannot be resolved by any statistical treatment.\nAlthough\
    \ it is possible to incorporate non-Gaussian data\ninto Bayesian models, these\
    \ extensions are typically com-\nputationally more expensive. For example, when\
    \ modeling\ncategorical data, one attempts to estimate an underlying\ncontinuous\
    \ distribution that would yield the observed data\nwhen coerced to being discrete.\
    \ Converting quantitative\nphenotypes (for example, the fraction of a plant tissue\n\
    affected by disease) to an index (susceptibility class) leads\nto loss of information\
    \ and an increase in model complexity.\nLikewise, summarizing replicate observations\
    \ and report-\ning only means can lead to either increased noise when\noutliers\
    \ are present or unwarranted precision. Such short\ncuts were defensible in the\
    \ past, when computational power\nand storage capacity to handle large data sets\
    \ was limited,\nbut this is no longer the case and the data should be\nreported\
    \ as ‘‘raw’’ as possible, and then modeled explicitly.\nGermplasm development\
    \ and distributed phenotyping\nnetworks\nAdvances in phenotyping and genotyping\
    \ technology, as\nwell as data storage, and computational capacity are\nopening\
    \ many new opportunities to extract meaningful\ninferences from even noisy biological\
    \ data. New statistical\nmodels that account for biological uncertainty and estimate\n\
    values of direct interest, rather than those dictated by\ncomputational\nconvenience,\n\
    promise\nto\naid\nin\nthe\nachievement of this goal. However, the value of any\
    \ pro-\ngress that may be gained through the marriage of next-\ngeneration phenotyping\
    \ with modern genomic tools is\npredicated on the availability of diverse germplasm\
    \ and\ngenetically well-deﬁned populations. Indeed associating\ngenotype with\
    \ phenotype in ways that address hypothesis-\ndriven questions and empower crop\
    \ improvement depends\non the availability of appropriate germplasm resources\
    \ to\naddress speciﬁc questions.\nThe preservation of plant biodiversity in publicly\n\
    available, international germplasm collections is of central\nimportance to our\
    \ quest to understand natural variation and\nto utilize that variation to meet\
    \ the future needs of the\nplanet. It is not unimaginable that we will be able\
    \ to ge-\nnomically characterize most of the accessions in the\nworld’s repositories\
    \ of genetic resources, but the sheer size\nof these collections, the broad range\
    \ of adaptation they\nrepresent, import–export restrictions, and the genetic\n\
    redundancy housed within their ranks presents a challenge\nfor direct phenotypic\
    \ evaluation. Targeted subsets of this\nvariation need to be assembled so that\
    \ available pheno-\ntyping resources can be efﬁciently used to evaluate them,\n\
    taking advantage of economies of scale wherever possible\n(Glaszmann et al. 2010;\
    \ McCouch et al. 2012). The\ndevelopment of shared populations with publically\
    \ avail-\nable, high-resolution genotype data will be critical for\npermitting\
    \ the kind of distributed phenotyping necessary to\nunderstand genotype–phenotype\
    \ relationships (Valdar et al.\n2006). Examples of research communities that have\n\
    developed these kinds of publicly shared germplasm\nresources include rice (Zhao\
    \ et al. 2011a), maize (Yu et al.\n2008), wheat (Neumann et al. 2011) Arabidopsis\
    \ (Atwell\net al. 2010), sorghum (Mitchell et al. 2008), barley (Pasam\net al.\
    \ 2012) and many other species (Zhu et al. 2008). The\nTheor Appl Genet (2013)\
    \ 126:867–887\n879\n123\navailability of these resources makes it possible for\
    \ mul-\ntiple researchers to interrogate the same genetic materials,\nphenotyping\
    \ in environments and with technology and\nanalytical expertise that are uniquely\
    \ available to different\nresearch groups. Integrating such vast phenotypic datasets\n\
    on common germplasm resources in well-structured dat-\nabases will permit high-end\
    \ analysis not just of the phe-\nnotypes\nthemselves,\nbut\nalso\nof\ncomplex\n\
    correlated\nphenotypic networks that represent a more accurate\ndepiction of biological\
    \ reality.\nAdditionally, more genetically structured resources such\nas chromosome\
    \ segment substitution lines (Ali et al. 2010;\nLu et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012;\
    \ Fukuoka et al. 2010; Xu\net al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2011), multi-parent advanced\n\
    generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations (Huang et al.\n2011, 2012; Rakshit\
    \ et al. 2012), and nested association\nmapping (NAM) populations (Yu et al. 2008)\
    \ will permit\nthe interrogation of natural variation in elite genetic\nbackgrounds\
    \ that may be intractable otherwise. These\ngenetically structured populations\
    \ partition the variation in\nways that facilitate the identiﬁcation of exotic\
    \ alleles that\nmay have a signiﬁcant impact on a phenotype of interest,\nbut\
    \ only when introgressed into the elite background. They\nalso expedite the subsequent\
    \ use of these resources as\nparents in a breeding program, helping expand the\
    \ range of\ngenetic variation available in an elite gene pool and\nopening up\
    \ new opportunities to utilize natural variation to\ndrive crop improvement.\n\
    Conclusions\nEver since the ﬁrst published QTL analysis (Sax 1923),\ngenetics\
    \ as a discipline has endeavored to shed light on the\ncomplexities of phenotypic\
    \ variation. For most of recent\nmemory, progress in understanding the genetic\
    \ architecture\nof complex traits has been driven by improvement in\ngenotyping\
    \ technology. As a clear picture of the genome\nemerges, a renewed focus on understanding\
    \ the nature of\nphenotypes will be necessary for continued advancement.\nWe have\
    \ discussed the role of phenotyping in gene\ndiscovery and crop improvement through\
    \ both GWAS and\nGS, and we have attempted to understand the complexities\nincumbent\
    \ on the association of genotype with phenotype\nunder variable environmental\
    \ conditions. We considered\nstrategies that permit the collection of phenotypic\
    \ data in\nquantitative ways as well as the development of modular\ntechnologies\
    \ to accommodate the changing needs and\nopportunities of phenotyping in the future.\
    \ We have pon-\ndered on the best practices for storing, cataloging, man-\naging,\n\
    and\ndisseminating\nthis\ninformation\nwithin\na\ncommunity, and suggested how\
    \ this data might be com-\nbined with cutting edge statistical analysis to leverage\n\
    increased computing capacity (Fig. 2). To conclude, we\nconsider where some of\
    \ the current deﬁciencies lie and\nhighlight a few questions that still need answers.\n\
    Genotyping, while closing in on understanding the full\nextent of allelic variation\
    \ in major crop species, is still\nyears away from delivering on the quest to\
    \ catalogue the\nworld’s collection of DNA variants for an entire species.\nThis\
    \ requires assembly of multiple de novo reference\ngenomes and re-sequencing of\
    \ thousands of diverse lines to\nidentify all of the SNPs, copy number variants,\
    \ and other\nforms of DNA and epigenetic variation within a gene pool.\nAs that\
    \ information is generated, researchers will seek to\nannotate the functional\
    \ signiﬁcance of the SNPs and\ninsertion/deletion polymorphisms, and design databases\n\
    that can host this information and make it accessible and\nquery-able for the\
    \ research community. This is a real\nchallenge because many functional variants\
    \ do not fall\nwithin gene models, but are found as inter-genic regulatory\nelements\
    \ or may condition gene expression through epi-\ngenetic pathways that contribute\
    \ to quantitative phenotypic\nvariation (Ding et al. 2012; Loehlin et al. 2010;\
    \ Salvi et al.\n2007; Zhou et al. 2012; Zhu and Deng 2012). This chal-\nlenge\
    \ also highlights the value of positional cloning to\nverify the functional nucleotide\
    \ polymorphisms (FNP)\nrather than taking a candidate gene approach, as the FNP\n\
    may not be found within a gene model at all. Additionally,\nfor many years to\
    \ come, the identiﬁcation and character-\nization of rare alleles will remain\
    \ a priority, despite the fact\nthat both GWAS and GS have little power to detect\
    \ their\ncontributions to phenotypic variation.\nAlgorithms for optimizing signal-to-noise\
    \ ratios in\nphenotypic experiments, pipelines for identifying GWAS\npeaks and\
    \ extracting meaningful lists of candidate genes\nunderlying those peaks are needed\
    \ to help standardize\nassociation mapping studies. Functional annotation of QTL\n\
    alleles and correspondence to the germplasm samples in\nwhich they are found would\
    \ help link genetic research with\nbreeding applications. Better tools for SNP\
    \ haplotype\nvisualization and management of high-volume SNP data\nneed to be\
    \ integrated into software platforms to facilitate\nthe identiﬁcation of functionally\
    \ relevant SNPs that can be\nused for marker-assisted selection and as ﬁxed variables\
    \ in\ngenomic prediction. As more and more phenotype data are\ncollected and databased,\
    \ tools to facilitate our under-\nstanding of intersecting phenotypic networks\
    \ will shed\nlight on the complex relationships within and between\nphenotypes\
    \ (Yin and Struik 2008). This information will\nprovide important insights about\
    \ selection trade-offs and\nphenotypic correlations that are relevant to variety\
    \ devel-\nopment and plant breeding.\nMajor questions about phenotypic variation,\
    \ which we\ncurrently have limited capacity to answer, include: How\ndoes variation\
    \ in regulatory elements manifest itself in the\n880\nTheor Appl Genet (2013)\
    \ 126:867–887\n123\nphenotype? Which environmental variables act as signals\n\
    that regulate these genes and how do different allelic\nvariants recognize those\
    \ signals? What is the role of epis-\ntasis and epigenetics in determining phenotypic\
    \ variation,\nor in phenotypic plasticity?\nApproaching many of these questions\
    \ will require more\nreﬁned strategies of collecting and managing phenotype\n\
    data. Many of the considerations that need to be addressed\nbefore making decisions\
    \ about deﬁning a phenotyping\napproach include: How easy is it to evaluate the\
    \ pheno-\ntype? How quantitative is that measurement? Can the\nprocess be automated?\
    \ If so, does it make economic sense\nto do so? What value would automation bring?\
    \ What\nindirect\nfactors\nwill\ninﬂuence\nthe\nphenotypic\nFig. 2\nWhen combined\
    \ with high-throughput genotyping on shared\ngermplasm resources, and done in\
    \ geographically distributed collab-\norative networks, next-generation phenotyping\
    \ can empower both\ngene discovery and crop improvement. Central to that capacity\
    \ is the\ncareful and judicious use of modular technologies and managed\nenvironments.\
    \ The use of standardized ontologies and Bayesian\nanalysis then create a controlled\
    \ vocabulary for describing the data\nand provide a way to integrate results across\
    \ experiments by\naccounting for the unique signatures of biological noise generated\n\
    by environmental covariates\nTheor Appl Genet (2013) 126:867–887\n881\n123\nmeasurement?\
    \ Can they be quantiﬁed? How much storage\ncapacity do I need to maintain the\
    \ raw or processed phe-\nnotypic data? How will the data be organized so that\
    \ it is\nboth query-able and understandable? What data processing\nneeds must\
    \ be considered before the phenotype is biolog-\nically meaningful? Do I have\
    \ the skills in-house or\nappropriate collaborators in place to realize a sophisticated\n\
    analysis of the data? Answers to these questions will\ndepend entirely on the\
    \ purpose and intention of collecting\nphenotypic data to start with, and of course\
    \ the nature of\nthe phenotype itself.\nThe phenotype of an organism is fundamentally\
    \ a\nmanifestation of a genotype’s interaction with the envi-\nronment. With increased\
    \ allocation of funding and intel-\nlectual investment over the next decade, advances\
    \ in\nphenotyping will enhance our ability to associate that data\nwith the genotypic\
    \ and environmental variables to simul-\ntaneously and synergistically drive gene\
    \ discovery efforts\naimed at understanding the genetic basis of quantitative\n\
    phenotypic variation and fuel the development of genomic\nprediction models for\
    \ crop improvement. As these two\ndrivers of genetic analysis feed into each other,\
    \ not only\nwill tremendous gains be made in comprehending the\nbiology of plants,\
    \ but we will also ensure continued\nadvancement in crop improvement aimed at\
    \ meeting the\ndemands of a growing population.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors\

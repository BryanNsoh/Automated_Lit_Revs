    In the 21st century, the global population has become predominantly urban, with
    more than half residing in cities, marking the era of urbanization (Kabisch and
    Haase, 2011, Zhao et al., 2020, Guo et al., 2022). This trend has been fueled
    by the rapid advancements in information technology, which have accelerated urban
    growth, commonly referred to as the third wave of urbanization (Cohen, 2006).
    According to projections, urban areas are expected to accommodate more than 70
    % of the global population by the year 2050, solidifying their role as primary
    hubs for economic growth and inventive activity (Ferrão & Fernández, 2013). Presently,
    the 600 largest cities worldwide generate approximately 80 % of the global GDP
    (Cadena et al., 2012). However, urbanization has brought with it challenges such
    as air pollution, climate change, high energy consumption, and increased pressure
    on urban infrastructure, especially in developing countries (Singh et al., 2020).
    To tackle these issues, there is an urgent need for systematic integration of
    all dimensions of urbanization with smart technology while preserving urban natural
    resources. Traditional urban planning and governance approaches must be revamped
    to cater to the development of 21st-century cities with a holistic view of all
    dimensions of urbanization (Hall & Pfeiffer, 2000). The notion of smart cities
    has surfaced as a potential remedy for urban challenges in contemporary times,
    particularly in the domain of urban planning and development (Neirotti et al.,
    2014). This approach to urban planning involves incorporating the capabilities
    of both the physical and digital worlds to address urban issues. The utilization
    of sophisticated information and communication technologies, together with the
    enormous amount of data generated in urban areas, offers unparalleled prospects
    for addressing significant urban challenges. One of the key components of a smart
    city is the ability to access real-time information on citizens'' actions and
    preferences. This access enables the identification and recognition of behavioral
    and normative patterns to understand what is happening at both city-wide and individual
    levels. Currently, many countries worldwide explore virtual world approaches and
    solutions to resolve urban problems. However, due to different perspectives in
    various scientific fields, the concept of a smart city lacks an official definition
    (Lai et al., 2020; Silva et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2015). The sustainable management
    of natural resources and urban green spaces poses a significant challenge as cities
    continue to expand. Urban green spaces, including parks, gardens, and trees, play
    a vital role in providing ecosystem services such as air purification, regulation
    of microclimates, noise reduction, and opportunities for recreation and social
    interaction. However, the rapid growth of urban areas exerts pressure on these
    valuable spaces. To ensure the development of smart cities, it is essential to
    implement effective planning and management strategies for urban resources, urban
    air pollution, urban climate and green infrastructure (Shang & Luo, 2021; Guo
    et al., 2022; Ban et al., 2023; Yin, Liu, Liu, Zheng, & Yin, 2023). Economic downturns
    have been a driving force behind the trend of cities transitioning toward smartness.
    To attract skilled labor and compete on the global stage, cities began seeking
    smart and innovative solutions to overcome economic challenges. Moreover, cities
    require resources to generate wealth and become centers of global competition.
    In the present era, service-based economies dominate the global market, and cities
    play a vital role in this competitive landscape. Consequently, cities must create
    a favorable and high-quality environment to entice the creative classes and stimulate
    further wealth generation and economic competitiveness. Furthermore, cities seek
    to attract young, educated, and skilled labor, address urban challenges, and create
    high-quality living standards to appeal to the creative class. Smart cities offer
    greater resilience against economic crises. By utilizing smart technologies, cities
    can improve their economy, generate greater income, and enhance their resilience
    against economic crises. Additionally, smart systems can optimize resource management,
    improve the environment, and reduce administrative and operational costs, which
    all contribute to building resilience against economic downturns (Camero & Alba,
    2019; Chamoso et al., 2018; Meijer & Bolívar, 2016). Cognitive collective changes
    are a significant driving force behind the trend of cities transitioning towards
    becoming smart, and aim to put an end to the destruction of urban capabilities.
    This trend aims to put an end to the destruction of urban capabilities and enhance
    the quality of life for residents through technological, political, and economic
    forces. One of the main reasons for this shift is the expected global population
    growth of elderly individuals, which is anticipated to double in the next decade.
    As a result, urban infrastructure must adapt and become compatible with these
    changes, and significant transformations are expected in the healthcare and elderly
    care sectors. Smart cities play an essential role in this regard, and one of their
    key functions is to assist the elderly and people with disabilities in performing
    daily tasks (Anthopoulos, 2015; Farmanbar et al., 2019; Ramírez-Moreno et al.,
    2021). By reducing the need for in-person visits to medical centers and performing
    administrative tasks, smart cities can significantly enhance the quality of life
    for these individuals. Various technologies can be utilized to achieve this goal,
    such as smart homes, transportation services, healthcare services, and social
    engagement platforms. Smart homes are equipped with sensors and smart devices
    that can monitor the health and wellbeing of elderly or disabled residents. For
    example, sensors can detect if a person has fallen or is having difficulty moving
    around the house and alert caregivers or emergency services if necessary. Smart
    cities can also provide transportation services that are accessible and convenient
    for the elderly and disabled, including on-demand ride-sharing services, specialized
    transportation services for people with disabilities, and public transportation
    systems that are designed to be accessible to all. Moreover, smart cities can
    use telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies to provide healthcare services
    to the elderly and disabled. This can include virtual consultations with doctors,
    remote monitoring of vital signs, and medication management systems. Lastly, smart
    cities can use technology to help the elderly and disabled stay connected with
    their communities and social networks, including virtual social events, online
    support groups, and other digital platforms that facilitate social interaction
    (Kasznar et al., 2021; Mohammed et al., 2014; Razmjoo et al., 2022). In recent
    times, there has been a notable transformation in the urban paradigm due to the
    utilization of technological progress. The emergence of information and communication
    technology has brought about a revolutionary shift in the development of cities,
    enabling seamless interconnectivity among citizens, businesses, and institutions,
    reminiscent of a complex neural network. Therefore, connectivity is a crucial
    aspect of urban life that can be achieved through technological advancements.
    Various technologies can facilitate urban communication, such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT), 5 G networks, smart traffic systems, electronic payment systems,
    social networks, and smart citizen support systems. By utilizing sensors, smart
    devices, and communication technology, IoT allows cities to collect information
    about the external environment, energy consumption, and traffic, enabling better
    and more sustainable urban management (Calvillo et al., 2016; Lara et al., 2016).
    Moreover, 5 G networks provide high-speed wireless communication with less delay,
    allowing cities to use faster internet for public networks and machine-to-machine
    (M2M) communications. Smart traffic systems gather and analyze traffic information
    using sensors and smart devices, enabling cities to better manage traffic. Electronic
    payment systems allow citizens to make online payments easily and use electronic
    money transfers, while social networks enable citizens to communicate with each
    other and share information about events, locations, and urban services. Additionally,
    smart citizen support systems allow citizens to easily communicate with different
    urban departments and receive services such as reporting urban problems, viewing
    traffic status, and requesting urban services. These technologies and many others
    can enable cities to improve urban communication and provide the necessary infrastructure
    for a smart city. Through the use of advanced technologies, cities can enhance
    their economic competitiveness and create higher living standards for their citizens
    (Ammara et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2021; Zhuhadar et al., 2017). The rapid expansion
    of urban areas in modern societies, encompassing both developed and developing
    regions, has emphasized the pressing necessity for effective urban management
    (Y. Li et al., 2023; Luo, Wang, & Li, 2023; Yin et al., 2023). Scholars have conducted
    numerous research studies aimed at identifying various parameters associated with
    the process of urbanization (Chen et al., 2022; X. Li et al., 2023; Shang & Luo,
    2021; Xiao et al., 2023). In this context, the exploration of different technological
    advancements and a comprehensive review of prior research findings can significantly
    contribute to the analysis and understanding of diverse urban challenges (Cheng
    et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2022; Wang & Tao,
    2023). The extensive body of literature on the investigation of various technologies
    in recent years highlights the crucial importance of embracing contemporary technological
    advancements to effectively address the complexities of present-day urban issues
    (Ding et al., 2023; B. Guo et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2021; J. Luo et al., 2023;
    Tong et al., 2023). Consequently, harnessing a wide range of information sources
    and conducting further investigations can play a pivotal role in addressing critical
    concerns such as the expansion of information networks, the promotion of sustainability,
    and the advancement of smart city initiatives (Y.-K. Fang et al., 2023; Liu et
    al., 2023; J. Luo et al., 2023). As a result, a considerable number of studies
    have been undertaken in recent years within the fields of technology, smart cities,
    and the dissemination of information to advance our knowledge in these areas (Lv
    et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Kafiliveyjuyeh & İlhan, 2017). Despite the widespread
    focus on leveraging technology for sustainable urban development, limited scholarly
    attention has been given to the integration of urban green spaces and smart technologies
    as a means of fostering sustainability. This study aims to bridge this research
    gap by examining the potential of smart cities to enhance environmental, social,
    and economic sustainability through the synergistic utilization of green spaces
    and advanced technologies (Gharaibeh et al., 2017; López-Quiles & Rodríguez Bolívar,
    2018; Xiong et al., 2012). In Europe, smart cities prioritize energy and sustainability
    concerns, which are critical for ensuring a superior standard of living in urban
    areas. The rapid pace of urban expansion calls for intelligent approaches to tackle
    forthcoming challenges. Smart cities harbor an ecological outlook, with a fundamental
    aim of utilizing technology to bolster sustainability and facilitate superior
    management of natural resources. Smart cities encounter various challenges when
    it comes to managing natural resources. One of the primary obstacles is the large
    amount of data needed to manage natural resources, efficiently (Mohamed et al.,
    2020; van Twist et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2021). Although smart cities are dependent
    on data, the management, analysis, and application of this information can be
    challenging, necessitating substantial investments in technology and infrastructure.
    Another challenge is the allocation of resources effectively and efficiently to
    achieve sustainable outcomes while balancing short-term goals with long-term sustainable
    development plans, despite the emphasis on sustainability. Developing sustainable
    infrastructure is another challenge for smart cities. Sustainable management of
    natural resources, such as renewable energy systems, requires significant investments
    and long-term planning, which can be challenging for smart cities. Citizen engagement
    in the management of natural resources is essential for the success of smart city
    initiatives. Nevertheless, achieving citizen participation can be challenging,
    necessitating effective communication strategies and the provision of relevant
    information to citizens. Furthermore, smart cities require supportive policy and
    regulatory frameworks to implement sustainable initiatives successfully. However,
    these frameworks may be intricate and require coordination across multiple government
    levels and stakeholders (Djahel et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2018; Rodríguez Bolívar,
    2016). Smart cities are emerging as a potential solution to address various urban
    challenges, including improving efficiency, sustainability, safety, citizen engagement,
    and quality of life. By utilizing data and technology, smart cities can optimize
    the use of resources such as energy, transportation, and water, resulting in increased
    efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, promoting sustainable practices,
    such as reducing waste, utilizing renewable energy sources, and promoting green
    spaces, can help limit the adverse environmental effects of urbanization. Moreover,
    smart cities can enhance safety by utilizing sensors, cameras, and other technologies
    to monitor and detect potential hazards such as traffic accidents, crime, and
    natural disasters, facilitating faster and more efficient responses (H. Kim et
    al., 2021; Ruhlandt, 2018; Talari et al., 2017). Citizen engagement also improves
    in smart cities by using technology and data to involve them in decision-making
    processes, providing them with better information to make informed decisions on
    the development of their communities. Lastly, the concept of smart cities has
    the potential to enhance the well-being of urban inhabitants by offering improved
    access to crucial services such as healthcare, education, and public transportation,
    while concurrently establishing more habitable and inclusive urban environments.
    This renders smart cities an auspicious approach to tackling urban challenges
    by optimizing resource allocation, promoting sustainability, enhancing safety,
    engaging citizens, and elevating their quality of life through the application
    of data and technology. However, there are potential challenges to address, such
    as the high cost of implementation, data privacy and security issues, equitable
    distribution of benefits, citizen participation, and coordination between stakeholders
    to ensure the sustainability of these solutions (Hancke et al., 2012; Kummitha
    & Crutzen, 2017; Sánchez-Corcuera et al., 2019). The implementation of smart cities
    poses a range of challenges that must be tackled to effectively harness their
    potential advantages. A prominent obstacle is the considerable expense associated
    with deploying smart infrastructure and technologies, which could impede the progress
    of many cities, particularly those in developing nations. Furthermore, apprehensions
    exist concerning data privacy and security, since the functioning of smart cities
    hinges heavily on the acquisition and analysis of vast amounts of data, thereby
    raising queries regarding data accessibility and its application. Another challenge
    is ensuring that the benefits of smart city technologies are equitably distributed
    across the population, rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. If smart
    technologies are implemented primarily in affluent areas, it could widen the gap
    between rich and poor neighborhoods. Moreover, there may be apprehensions about
    the potential loss of employment as automation and artificial intelligence become
    more common in smart cities. Citizen participation is another challenge in the
    development and implementation of smart city solutions. Without adequate engagement
    and participation from citizens, there is a risk that these solutions may not
    address the needs and priorities of the communities they are intended to serve
    sufficiently. Also, there may be challenges in coordinating among various sectors
    and stakeholders involved in implementing smart city solutions, such as government
    agencies, private companies, and community groups. Effective coordination and
    collaboration will be crucial for successfully executing these solutions and ensuring
    their long-term sustainability (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Toh et al., 2020; Yigitcanlar,
    2015). While smart cities aim to utilize technology and data for sustainable development,
    there is a lack of research on the integration of urban green spaces and smart
    technologies as a pathway to promote sustainability. This is an important area
    of study given the increasing urbanization worldwide and the need for livable
    and environmentally-friendly cities. The objective of this descriptive-analytical
    study is to investigate how smart cities can utilize green spaces and technologies
    to advance environmental, social and economic sustainability. Through a systematic
    literature review of academic and policy documents, this study identifies key
    approaches, benefits, and challenges related to smart and sustainable city development.
    Given the escalating global urbanization and the imperative for creating livable
    and ecologically sustainable cities, this research area assumes significant importance.
    The outcomes of this study have the potential to offer valuable insights to policymakers,
    urban planners, and researchers regarding the effective management of natural
    resources and the advancement of sustainability within the context of smart cities.
    2. Definitions and theoretical foundations of the research 2.1. Perspectives on
    smart cities: academic, industrial, and governmental views The creation of a smart
    city begins with developing a comprehensive understanding of the concept. The
    notion of a smart city has evolved in various domains, including academia, industry,
    and government. In academic literature, a smart city is deemed as a self-configuring,
    self-healing, self-protecting, and self-optimizing system. Conversely, in industrial
    literature, the term smart pertains to intelligent products and services, artificial
    intelligence, and smart devices. In government documents, the concept of smart
    cities is closely linked with the theory of urban planning that emerged in the
    early 1990s to counteract urban sprawl. This concept primarily emphasizes the
    utilization of technology and social innovation. A suitable definition of a smart
    city, according to academic literature, is an intelligent city characterized by
    smart people, smart mobility, smart governance, smart living, smart economy, and
    smart environment, resulting from a combination of assets and independent activities.
    On the other hand, industrial literature defines a smart city as a system of systems
    that employs technology to transform and optimize its primary systems while fully
    utilizing limited resources (Caragliu et al., 2011; H.M. Kim et al., 2021; Mutambik,
    2023). A smart city is a city that integrates smart facilities and independent
    activities, such as smart people, smart transportation, smart governance, smart
    living, smart economy, and smart environment. In this context, industrial literature
    characterizes a smart city as a system of systems that optimizes the city''s primary
    systems and employs technology to utilize limited resources. Governmental literature,
    meanwhile, aims to enhance the quality of life, foster economic growth, promote
    sustainable environments, and improve energy, sustainability, safety, health,
    and mobility. In summary, a smart city is defined as a sustainable and efficient
    city that enhances mobility, optimizes resource utilization, improves health and
    safety, fosters social development, supports economic growth, and provides participatory
    governance through information and communication technologies, cooperation, and
    investment in social capital (Wang & Tao, 2023; Lim et al., 2021; Vujković et
    al., 2022; Hu et al., 2023; Luo, Zhuo, & Xu, 2023; Wang et al., 2023). While different
    perspectives exist on smart cities, they agree that information and communication
    technology is the central feature of a city''s future performance. Although some
    researchers argue that information and communication technology is the main characteristic
    of a smart city, this does not mean ignoring social issues since people play a
    crucial role in shaping a smart city through continuous interaction. Each writer
    emphasizes different aspects of a city, making it complicated to measure the intelligence
    of a city due to its unique administrative, economic, social, and geographic conditions
    and priorities. Hence, defining a universal system for all cities based on the
    diverse characteristics of cities across the world is difficult. Moreover, the
    definitions of smart cities put forward by individual cities are not necessarily
    universal, making it advisable to use the fundamental structures of the smart
    city model as the basis for conceptualization. Each city''s intelligence must
    be redefined based on its perspectives, priorities, and content. The definition
    of a smart city places significant emphasis on concepts such as the utilization
    of information and communication technology in urban services and infrastructure,
    integration of different systems in planning and implementation, a collaboration
    of various stakeholders in all stages of urban development, investment in social
    capital, independence in decision-making, participatory governance, connectivity,
    creativity, learning, and management of various local resources (Albino et al.,
    2015; Goodspeed, 2015; Grossi et al., 2020). 2.2. Smart sustainable cities and
    environmental benefits A sustainable smart city leverages advanced technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data analytics, and geographic
    information systems to enable urban planning, construction, management, and the
    provision of intelligent urban services. This concept has been embraced as a means
    of promoting industrial, informational, and sustainable development advantages
    for cities. In contemporary times, sustainable smart cities have emerged as a
    hybrid model for addressing urban challenges and transforming cities into livable
    environments (Abusaada & Elshater, 2021; X. Fang et al., 2023; Heidari et al.,
    2022; Li et al., 2022). The development of sustainable smart cities involves various
    groups, including those who focus on developing technology infrastructure and
    sustainable development policies, those who advocate for the implementation of
    e-government services in sustainable smart cities, and those who do not find existing
    urban development models suitable. The sustainable smart city is an innovative
    urban center that harnesses information and communication technologies and other
    related tools to improve the standard of living, efficiency of activities and
    urban services, and competitiveness, while simultaneously catering to the requirements
    of both present and upcoming generations. The sustainable smart city comprises
    complex social and technical systems and has a novel framework for urban development
    (Balova et al., 2021; Catalano et al., 2021; Jedliński, 2014). Copenhagen, Denmark
    provides an exemplary instance of a smart sustainable city, where a variety of
    technologies have been implemented to promote sustainability and efficiency. The
    city has introduced several smart sustainable city projects, including a smart
    traffic system, sustainable waste management systems, and sustainable energy production.
    The smart traffic system utilizes data from traffic systems to enhance driving,
    reduce traffic congestion, and improve road safety. Sustainable waste management
    systems incorporate advanced technologies such as smart sensors and IoT systems
    to collect and recycle waste, air, and water pollution. Additionally, Copenhagen
    has invested in sustainable energy production projects, such as wind and solar
    energy, and improved energy efficiency in buildings and homes, making the city
    a leader in smart sustainable cities through the use of innovative technologies
    (Bibri, 2018; Hara et al., 2016; Kramers et al., 2014). Smart sustainable cities
    possess the potential to yield several environmental advantages. They can help
    mitigate carbon emissions by advocating for eco-friendly transportation modes
    like public transportation, electric vehicles, and bicycles, in addition to utilizing
    smart grids, energy-efficient constructions, and renewable energy sources. Additionally,
    smart sustainable cities can improve waste management practices, enhance urban
    green spaces, and implement water conservation measures to reduce water consumption
    and preserve natural resources. In conclusion, smart sustainable cities can promote
    sustainable development, improve the quality of life for citizens, and minimize
    the negative impact of urbanization on the environment by incorporating innovative
    technologies and sustainable practices (Höjer & Wangel, 2015; Huovila et al.,
    2019; Martin et al., 2018). 2.3. Comparing sustainable smart cities and technology-driven
    cities The growth of information and communication technology-centered cities
    has prompted the emergence of several terms, including "e-city," "digital city,"
    "virtual city," "virtual community," "smart city," and "ubiquitous city." While
    each of these cities possesses distinctive characteristics, the most significant
    variation and disagreement exist between sustainable smart cities and smart cities.
    It is erroneous to use the term smart cities to refer to sustainable smart cities
    (Bibri, 2021; Jiang et al., 2023). Höjer et al. points out that smart cities often
    lack sustainability due to two reasons (Höjer & Wangel, 2015). Primarily, sustainability
    is not universally incorporated in all smart city concepts and has been assumed
    rather than explicitly considered in smart cities. Additionally, there is a lack
    of a precise definition of sustainability in smart cities, and none of the smart
    city definitions assign hierarchical importance or prioritize their dimensions.
    Establishing a clear definition of sustainability is an imperative aspect of sustainable
    smart cities. Li et al. identify significant challenges related to privacy, government
    surveillance, digital rights, connecting urban sustainability challenges, social
    cohesion issues, technology discourse, and policymaker approach to smart city
    initiatives as weaknesses of smart cities (Li & Woolrych, 2021). Similarly, Yigitcanlar
    et al. criticize smart cities for adopting a technocratic and neoliberal approach
    to urban development, and it is unclear how a smart city plan will lead to sustainability
    (Yigitcanlar et al., 2019). Monfaredzadeh et al. believe that smart cities do
    not emphasize sustainability concepts (Monfaredzadeh & Krueger, 2015). Datta et
    al. note that most cities introduce themselves as smart cities to escape economic
    crises and produce more wealth (Datta & Odendaal, 2019). This results in the creation
    of new markets through the digitization of urban infrastructures, such as smart
    energy and mobility systems, and the formation of new consumers through smart
    technology consumption. These factors lead to a contradictory formation between
    the goals, expectations, and claims that smart cities have regarding urban sustainability
    (Radtke, 2022; Roblek & Meško, 2020). Therefore, Sustainable smart cities and
    technology-driven cities are two different concepts. Although both concepts focus
    on the use of technology in urban development, they differ in their approach to
    sustainability. Sustainable smart cities prioritize sustainability in their urban
    development plans and use technology as a tool to achieve their sustainability
    goals. They consider social, economic, and environmental factors in their planning
    and aim to create livable and resilient cities for present and future generations.
    Technology-driven cities, on the other hand, focus primarily on the use of technology
    in urban development without necessarily prioritizing sustainability (Al Sharif
    & Pokharel, 2022; ur Rehman et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2022; Xia et al., 2023).
    They may use technology to improve efficiency, connectivity, and convenience,
    but may not consider the broader impact on social, economic, and environmental
    factors. Therefore, the main difference between sustainable smart cities and technology-driven
    cities is their approach to sustainability. Sustainable smart cities prioritize
    sustainability as a core component of their planning, while technology-driven
    cities may prioritize technology without necessarily considering sustainability
    (Dameri, 2014; Verrest & Pfeffer, 2019; Zheng et al., 2020). 2.4. Natural resource
    conservation and the role of smart cities The degradation of natural resources
    in recent decades has necessitated the urgent protection of these resources. Although
    human interventions such as industrial and green revolutions have contributed
    to these changes, the role of human factors in both the destruction and conservation
    of natural resources has been overlooked. Instead, the destruction of resources
    has often been attributed to natural processes and physical, biological, and chemical
    developments, leading to a flawed approach to natural resource management. Traditional
    approaches to resource protection have focused on technical and technological
    knowledge, emphasizing humans'' dominance over nature and the adaptation of ecosystems
    to human desires. However, this approach has resulted in intensified damage and
    destruction of resources. Furthermore, ignoring the needs of local communities
    and stakeholders has led to dissatisfaction and a change in the prevailing ideology
    of resource conservation. This shift emphasizes the preservation of the functional
    integrity of ecosystems and the flexible, proportional use of environmental capacities.
    Additionally, contemporary thinking emphasizes the relationship between the social
    system and the ecosystem, making concepts such as social complexity and ecosystem
    more prominent (Chu et al., 2021; Portney, 2005). Therefore, while current conservation
    programs focus on ecosystem functions, they need improvement and reform. This
    includes giving more importance to the role of local communities and residents
    in natural resource management, providing them with access to new technologies
    and optimized resource management, and involving them in decision-making processes.
    Policy-makers and planners should also value the environmental and economic values
    of natural resources and prioritize the environmental and ecosystem needs in their
    conservation programs. Education and training processes on natural resource conservation
    should be included in school curricula (Bifulco et al., 2016; Khalimon et al.,
    2020; Phadtare & IndajeetJadhav, 2017). The implementation of smart cities is
    a crucial way to protect the environment globally. Smart city transformation involves
    the use of innovative technologies to enhance citizens'' quality of life, optimize
    energy consumption, improve urban management, and protect the environment. Therefore,
    smart city transformation can play a vital role in natural resource conservation.
    Smart technologies can be used to improve the quality of city air, reduce pollution,
    optimize energy consumption, manage water and wastewater, manage waste, conserve
    water resources, prevent food waste, and enhance civic interactions. For instance,
    smart city systems such as smart lighting management systems, smart HVAC systems,
    and smart water and energy management systems can be implemented to reduce energy
    consumption in buildings. Similarly, smart waste collection, separation, and recycling
    systems can improve municipal waste management and preserve natural resources.
    Smart city transformation can improve citizens'' quality of life and conserve
    natural resources, contributing significantly to ecosystem sustainability and
    sustainable development (Guo et al., 2022; Kumar & Dahiya, 2017; Sukhwani et al.,
    2020). This study is centered on the examination of urban green spaces as significant
    natural assets within cities. These green spaces, encompassing parks, gardens,
    trees, and vegetation, play a pivotal role in the urban environment. Given the
    ongoing expansion and increased population density of cities, the effective management
    of these green spaces becomes imperative for achieving sustainability. Hence,
    the primary objective of this study is to explore the integration of smart city
    technologies with urban green spaces to enhance environmental sustainability.
    Through this research, a range of solutions and approaches will be examined, including
    green space planning, data analysis, community involvement, and policy formulation,
    all aimed at fostering livable and environmentally-friendly cities. 3. Research
    methodology The present study employs a descriptive-analytical research methodology
    to explore the concept of smart cities and their features. A comprehensive review
    and analysis of academic literature, practical tools intended to aid cities, and
    official international documents published between 1990 and 2023 were undertaken
    to identify the crucial components, dimensions, beliefs, and perspectives associated
    with the concept of smart cities. The literature search was performed using a
    range of keywords and phrases related to the concept of smart cities, such as
    smart community, digital city, intelligent city, ubiquitous city, virtual city,
    information city, creative city, learning city, knowledge city, urban natural
    resources, the relationship between urban natural resources and smart cities,
    sustainable smart city, energy and water consumption control. The literature was

    were subsequently screened for their relevance to the research topic. The screening
    process involved reviewing titles, abstracts, and full texts of the identified
    documents. Following the screening, 194 documents were deemed suitable for inclusion
    in the final literature review, based on their direct relevance to the integration
    of urban natural resources and smart technologies. The selected documents underwent
    a rigorous evaluation by the research team to assess their quality and credibility.
    Only peer-reviewed scholarly articles, conference papers, and book chapters were
    included in the final literature sample, ensuring a high standard of scholarly
    work. To analyze the collected literature, a descriptive-analytical approach was
    adopted, employing thematic analysis. Key themes, concepts, and findings were
    identified from the literature, and codes were developed to categorize the data
    and identify common patterns. By employing this systematic screening process,
    evaluating the quality of the selected literature, and utilizing thematic analysis,
    this study aims to provide an unbiased synthesis of the current knowledge on the
    integration of urban natural resources and smart technologies for sustainable
    development. However, it is worth noting that this study has certain limitations,
    such as the likelihood of overlooking relevant literature due to the search criteria
    and the likelihood of partiality in the selection and analysis of the articles.
    Therefore, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion,
    this study employed a rigorous methodology to explore the concept of smart cities
    and the integration of urban natural resources and smart city technologies for
    sustainable development. The study''s findings offer valuable insights for policymakers,
    urban planners, and researchers interested in promoting sustainable development
    in smart cities. 4. Finding and discussion Smart cities are a novel concept in
    urban management that aims to enhance the quality of life for citizens, optimize
    energy consumption, protect the environment, and improve urban management. The
    use of innovative technologies enables smart cities to collect, analyze, and share
    urban data and information from diverse perspectives, contributing to their sustainable
    development objectives. Consequently, there is a direct relationship between the
    concept of smart cities and natural resources, as smart technologies can help
    conserve natural resources by reducing energy consumption, optimizing water and
    energy usage, reducing air and water pollution, promoting the use of public transport
    and pedestrian activities, and improving environmental quality (Adali et al.,
    2022; Oberascher et al., 2022; Qayyum et al., 2021; Weil et al., 2023). Implementing
    smart city systems such as smart lighting management, heating, ventilation, and
    air conditioning, and water and energy management systems can facilitate energy
    reduction in buildings. Furthermore, utilizing smart waste collection, separation,
    and recycling systems can help improve municipal waste management and preserve
    natural resources. Smart cities can also function as a monitoring and control
    system for natural resources, such as water and air pollution. By utilizing smart
    water resource management systems, data on runoff, water quality, and water consumption
    can be collected and utilized for optimal planning. Similarly, monitoring air
    pollution through smart systems can help improve air quality and reduce pollutants,
    contributing to a cleaner environment. The utilization of smart energy management
    systems can aid in minimizing energy consumption and encouraging the usage of
    sustainable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy. Additionally, smart
    transportation systems can optimize traffic, reduce air pollution, and encourage
    the use of public transport and pedestrian activities. The integration of these
    technologies into smart cities can facilitate sustainable development and preserve
    natural resources. To conclude, smart cities are an innovative solution for enhancing
    urban management and promoting environmental protection and sustainable development.
    The integration of smart technologies can help conserve natural resources and
    improve the quality of life for citizens (Alshuwaikhat et al., 2022; Mortaheb
    & Jankowski, 2023; Shang & Lv, 2023; Wang & Zhou, 2023). This study will further
    discuss the relationship between smart cities and natural resources in detail
    in the following sections. 4.1. Green spaces in smart city development Utilizing
    natural resources within urban environments, particularly through the integration
    of green spaces, presents a promising avenue to bolster the sustainability of
    smart city development. This study delves into a range of strategies aimed at
    harnessing the potential of green spaces in smart cities. One such approach involves
    the implementation of smart green spaces, which leverage advanced technologies
    like sensors to effectively manage irrigation and artificial lighting, optimizing
    resource usage in these areas. This can effectively reduce water and energy consumption,
    improve air quality, and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Another solution
    is the conversion of green spaces into energy sources, such as installing solar
    panels on green roofs to generate energy and meet a building''s energy needs.
    Green spaces can also serve as filters for air purification and reducing air pollutants,
    reducing the effects of climate change, and mitigating the heat effects in the
    city. Green spaces can also be designed as venues for social development in smart
    cities, providing recreational and sports activities, a peaceful and friendly
    environment, and social gathering spaces to enhance citizens'' quality of life
    and promote social development. Additionally, green spaces can act as filters
    to reduce noise pollution in smart cities, particularly for sound levels caused
    by traffic or industrial and commercial activities (Anguluri & Narayanan, 2017;
    Artmann et al., 2019; Nitoslawski et al., 2019; Obringer & Nateghi, 2021; Salman
    & Hasar, 2023). This study focuses on a thorough analysis of the role of urban
    green spaces in cities, encompassing parks, gardens, trees, and vegetation. These
    green spaces are valuable natural assets that contribute significantly to the
    urban environment. They offer various ecosystem services, such as the purification
    of air, regulation of microclimates, reduction of noise, and opportunities for
    recreational activities and social interactions. Given the global expansion and
    increased density of cities, it is crucial to effectively manage these urban green
    spaces. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to explore the integration
    of smart technologies with these green spaces to enhance their sustainability.
    Additionally, this research examines other essential natural resources in urban
    settings, including water, energy, and waste materials. It investigates how smart
    technologies can be utilized to manage these resources efficiently, promote conservation
    efforts, and achieve sustainability. By clearly defining these natural resources,
    this study aims to provide specific insights into harnessing smart city technologies
    to improve natural resource management and enhance urban sustainability. The creation
    of a green space network in cities has been proposed as an effective solution
    for smart city development. This approach involves integrating and connecting
    various green spaces such as parks, gardens, squares, and natural spaces in the
    city to create a network. This green space network can be used as a hub for communication
    between people and the city, promoting sustainable urban development. Also, analyzing
    green space data can facilitate smart city development by using sensors and smart
    systems in green spaces to collect and analyze information on factors such as
    air quality, pollution levels, temperature, and irrigation levels, improving green
    space management, and promoting sustainable urban development. The design of green
    spaces in smart cities can play a crucial role in promoting social development
    (Aly & Dimitrijevic, 2022; Branny et al., 2022; S. Zhang et al., 2022; Japir Bataineh
    et al., 2023). One way to achieve this is by creating recreational and sports
    spaces within green areas to encourage physical activity and social interaction,
    which can enhance the physical and mental health of residents and foster a sense
    of community. Additionally, creating a serene and welcoming environment within
    green spaces can provide a space for residents to relax and unwind, which can
    also encourage social interaction and community building. Another effective approach
    to promoting social development through green spaces is to design these areas
    to include social meeting spaces, such as picnic areas, cafes, and community gardens.
    By providing residents with spaces to gather, socialize, and exchange ideas, green
    spaces can help build a sense of community and promote social development. Moreover,
    involving the community in the design and maintenance of green spaces can promote
    social development by instilling a sense of ownership and pride in their neighborhood,
    which can lead to partnerships and collaborations between residents, local government,
    and other stakeholders. Lastly, designing green spaces to be easily accessible
    and connected to other parts of the city can encourage residents to use these
    spaces and promote social interaction. This can be achieved by creating bike lanes,
    pedestrian walkways, and public transportation routes that connect green spaces
    to other parts of the city. By doing so, green spaces can become a hub for social
    activities and gatherings, promoting social development and enhancing the overall
    quality of life in smart cities (Irvine et al., 2022; Li, 2022; Zain et al., 2022).
    Fig. 1 illustrates the strategies for utilizing green spaces in smart city development.
    The figure is divided into two main categories, including smart green spaces and
    green spaces for social development. The smart green space category includes the
    use of smart systems, such as sensors, to manage irrigation and artificial lighting,
    and the conversion of green spaces into energy sources. The green spaces for social
    development category includes the creation of recreational and sports spaces,
    design for social meeting spaces, and involving the community in the design and
    maintenance of green spaces. This figure highlights the potential of green spaces
    in smart city development to enhance sustainability and promote social development.
    The utilization of smart green space strategies plays a pivotal role in improving
    resource efficiency, leveraging technology to optimize operations, and mitigating
    environmental impacts. Concurrently, social development approaches contribute
    to the promotion of community well-being through inclusive and recreational green
    spaces, as substantiated by prior research. Download : Download high-res image

    spaces in smart city development: enhancing sustainability and promoting social
    development. 4.2. Challenges and benefits of green space data analysis The utilization
    of technological advancements to analyze data pertaining to green spaces offers
    significant potential in mitigating air pollution levels within urban areas. Through
    the integration of sensors, CCTV cameras, 3D mapping, and other intelligent systems,
    valuable information regarding green spaces can be collected and subjected to
    analysis using machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. This analytical
    approach enables the prediction of optimal irrigation requirements and facilitates
    the regulation of water consumption, thus promoting enhanced water conservation
    practices within green spaces. Moreover, this data-driven methodology enables
    the acquisition of accurate insights into changes in vegetation and air quality
    across cities, thereby facilitating the identification and implementation of effective
    solutions for sustainable urban development (Ding et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2023;
    Ma, 2020; Sharifi et al., 2021). Green space data analysis can be an effective
    solution for reducing air pollution in cities (Douglas et al., 2017; Kabisch et
    al., 2017; Niemelä et al., 2010). One way to achieve this is by using the data
    to increase the area of green spaces in cities, which can help in reducing air
    pollution. By identifying areas that require the creation of green spaces, city
    officials and managers can make informed decisions for sustainable urban development.
    Another way to reduce air pollution is by increasing the number of trees in cities
    with the use of green space data analysis. By analyzing the amount of greenery
    and distribution of trees in different areas of the city, decisions can be made
    about planting trees and vegetation in areas with a shortage of green spaces.
    This can help increase the amount of oxygen produced, leading to improved air
    quality and reduced air pollution. Finally, analyzing green space data can provide
    an accurate picture of changes in the level of greenery and air quality in cities,
    leading to effective solutions for improving air quality. By identifying areas
    that need to increase the number of trees and creating green spaces, cities can
    improve air quality and promote sustainable urban development (Baycan-Levent &
    Nijkamp, 2009; Lee & Maheswaran, 2011; Wolch et al., 2014). Green space data analysis
    holds the potential to provide a host of benefits to urban residents. For instance,
    it can improve air quality by identifying areas that require more greenery and
    trees to reduce air pollution. This, in turn, can positively affect the health
    and well-being of urban residents. Additionally, by analyzing data, cities can
    identify areas that require green spaces and create new ones, which can increase
    access to outdoor recreation, physical activity, and social interaction, thereby
    improving the quality of life of urban residents. Green space data analysis can
    also contribute to improved water conservation by predicting the amount of water
    required for irrigation and controlling water consumption in green spaces. This
    can help ensure that urban residents have access to clean and safe water, which
    is critical for their health and well-being. Moreover, green space data analysis
    can offer valuable insights into how cities can improve their urban planning and
    design. By identifying areas that require more green spaces and trees, cities
    can develop plans that prioritize sustainable urban development, ultimately creating
    more livable communities. Green spaces can also have a positive impact on public
    health by reducing stress levels, promoting physical activity, and improving mental
    well-being. With the help of green space data analysis, cities can create more
    green spaces that are accessible to urban residents, thereby providing them with
    opportunities to improve their health and well-being. Also, green space data analysis
    can involve residents in the planning and maintenance of green spaces, promoting
    community engagement and collaboration. This can help build stronger communities
    and foster a sense of ownership and pride in their neighborhoods (Kabisch et al.,
    2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Ibeanu et al., 2023). The implementation of green space
    data analysis, while beneficial for sustainable urban development, can present
    several challenges for cities. The first challenge is data collection, which can
    be particularly difficult for older cities with limited digital infrastructure.
    Weather conditions, equipment failure, and vandalism are among the factors that
    can affect the quality of data collected on green spaces. The second challenge
    is data management, which can be complex due to the large amounts of data generated
    by green space data analysis. To address this, cities may need to invest in appropriate
    data management systems to ensure that the data collected is well-organized, easily
    accessible, and secure. Another challenge is the need for technical expertise
    in fields such as data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
    This requires cities to either hire experts or partner with organizations that
    specialize in these fields to analyze the data collected effectively. Moreover,
    the implementation of green space data analysis can be costly, particularly for
    cities with limited budgets. As such, cities may need to seek funding from external
    sources or prioritize their spending to allocate resources to this area. Privacy
    concerns are also a challenge, particularly if the data collected includes images
    or videos of people. Cities may need to implement appropriate privacy policies
    and regulations to ensure that they comply with relevant laws and protect citizens''
    privacy rights. Finally, engaging stakeholders, including residents, community
    groups, and local businesses, is essential for the success of green space data
    analysis initiatives. Cities may need to invest in public outreach and engagement
    efforts to ensure that stakeholders are well-informed, involved, and supportive
    of these initiatives (Kabisch & Haase, 2011; Kabisch, 2015; Kabisch et al., 2015).
    Green space data analysis has been implemented in various cities worldwide to
    evaluate the distribution and density of green spaces and improve the quality
    of life for citizens. For instance, in Singapore and Shanghai, 3D mapping technology
    and green space data analysis have been utilized to assess the distribution and
    density of green spaces. Similarly, in European cities such as Copenhagen and
    London, green space data analysis has been employed for planning and developing
    green spaces. This includes analyzing the amount of greenery and tree distribution
    in different areas of the city, determining the amount of green space available
    in the city, identifying areas that require green space development, and assessing
    the distribution of green space in public places such as parks and squares. This
    data analysis helps cities prioritize sustainable urban development and create
    more livable communities by providing more opportunities for outdoor recreation,
    physical activity, and social interaction. Green space data analysis can aid city
    officials and urban managers in decision-making related to the creation of green
    spaces. This data analysis can precisely identify areas that require green space
    development and evaluate the amount of green space available in different areas
    of the city. By analyzing green space data, officials can gain insight into the
    amount of greenery and tree distribution in different areas of the city, enabling
    them to make informed decisions regarding planting trees and vegetation in areas
    with a shortage of green spaces. Furthermore, green space data analysis can be
    used to identify areas that require green space development and implement green
    space development plans in these areas. This can help city officials prioritize
    sustainable urban development and create livable communities by providing urban
    residents with more opportunities for outdoor recreation, physical activity, and
    social interaction. By using green space data analysis, city officials can make
    evidence-based decisions and ensure that green spaces are developed in areas where
    they are most needed (Haaland & van Den Bosch, 2015; Madureira et al., 2015; Wood
    et al., 2018). Fig. 2 presents the benefits and challenges of green space data
    analysis in urban development. The figure is divided into two main categories:
    benefits and challenges. The benefits category includes improving air quality,
    water conservation, urban planning and design, public health, and community engagement
    through the creation and maintenance of green spaces. The challenges category
    includes data collection and management, technical expertise, cost, privacy concerns,
    and stakeholder engagement. This figure highlights the potential of green space
    data analysis in sustainable urban development and the challenges that need to
    be addressed for its successful implementation. The existing body of research
    substantiates the favorable environmental, social, economic, and health outcomes
    associated with the benefits mentioned earlier. To ensure the successful implementation
    of green space data analysis, it is imperative to tackle the identified challenges
    through diverse approaches, such as active community involvement, collaborations
    between public and private entities, and enhanced provision of financial resources.

    of technology for green space data analysis, the importance of green space data
    analysis for reducing air pollution and improving the quality of life, challenges
    in implementing green space data analysis, and the importance of stakeholder engagement.
    This comparative analysis helps to identify the common themes and patterns related
    to the integration of urban natural resources and smart city technologies for
    sustainable development. Table 1. Comparison of green space data analysis implementation
    in smart cities of the west and east for sustainable urban development. 4.3. The
    impact of smart cities on urban environmental sustainability Smart cities possess
    the capacity to tackle environmental issues by leveraging cutting-edge technologies
    and intelligent communication systems. This has the potential to yield enhancements
    in air quality, reduction in noise pollution, efficient waste management, and
    optimized resource utilization. To realize these advantages, the implementation
    of smart and automated waste collection systems, adoption of electric vehicles,
    and integration of intelligent irrigation systems are among the key tools that
    can be deployed within smart cities. Moreover, smart cities can effectively curb
    traffic congestion and urban density, resulting in decreased air pollution levels
    and enhanced resource efficiency. By harnessing smart technologies, public transportation
    can be enhanced, car usage can be optimized, and pedestrian and bicycle traffic
    can be promoted (Q. Guo et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023). Various technologies,
    such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI), smart
    driving systems, smart energy networks, smart waste management systems, and smart
    home appliances, are utilized in smart cities to enhance the environment. IoT
    sensors can collect data on weather and pollution levels, providing accurate information
    about the environment. AI can optimize environmental processes and improve air
    quality, waste management, and resource efficiency. To achieve a sustainable and
    environmentally friendly smart city, it is essential to implement these technologies
    in a consistent and unified manner (Khawand et al., 2022; Niyi Anifowose et al.,
    2022). By doing so, it is possible to improve the urban environment, reduce the
    negative impact on the environment, and enhance the quality of life for citizens.
    Therefore, the integration of these technologies is crucial to ensure that smart
    cities have a positive impact on the environment while providing the necessary
    services and amenities to citizens (Mauree et al., 2019; Ortega-Fernández et al.,
    2020; Shruti et al., 2020). The impact of implementing smart cities on various
    environmental parameters is discussed in detail in the following sections. 4.3.1.
    The impact of smart city technologies and policies on reducing air pollution Air
    pollution presents a substantial environmental challenge within urban settings,
    and the integration of smart city technologies holds great potential for mitigating
    its impact. Addressing the imperative to enhance air quality is essential, considering
    the detrimental health implications associated with air pollution. One of the
    key approaches by which smart cities can effectively combat air pollution is through
    the optimization of transportation systems. By implementing smart traffic management
    systems, cities can reduce traffic congestion, resulting in vehicles running more
    efficiently and decreasing emissions from cars and trucks. Additionally, smart
    public transportation systems can promote the use of buses, trains, and other
    forms of public transit, which can reduce the number of cars on the road and associated
    emissions. Another approach to addressing air pollution in smart cities is by
    using smart buildings and energy systems. By optimizing energy consumption and
    reducing waste, buildings can become more energy-efficient and generate fewer
    pollutants. Smart grids and renewable energy sources can also help lower emissions
    from power plants and other electricity sources. Smart waste management systems
    can also contribute to reducing air pollution. By minimizing the amount of waste
    sent to landfills and incinerators, smart waste management can lessen the quantity
    of methane and other pollutants released into the air. Furthermore, smart city
    technologies such as air quality sensors can enable cities to monitor air pollution
    levels in real-time and implement measures to reduce emissions when pollution
    levels exceed safe levels. Such measures can include implementing low-emission
    zones or promoting the use of electric vehicles and other low-emission transportation
    options (Shen et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Xu & Yang, 2022; Moshayedi et al.,
    2023). Air quality sensors play a critical role in smart cities, offering several
    advantages such as real-time monitoring, data-driven decision-making, improved
    public health, environmental monitoring, and citizen engagement. Air quality sensors
    allow cities to monitor air quality in real-time, enabling them to quickly identify
    pollution hotspots and respond promptly to prevent health issues and mitigate
    environmental damage. Moreover, air quality sensors generate vast amounts of data
    that can inform evidence-based environmental policies. This data can help in determining
    the placement of green spaces, prioritizing transportation modes, and regulating
    industrial activities. Air quality sensors also significantly contribute to improving
    public health. By identifying areas with high pollution levels, cities can implement
    public health interventions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, improving
    the health of residents and reducing the healthcare costs associated with pollution-induced
    illnesses. Additionally, air quality sensors enable environmental monitoring of
    other factors such as humidity, temperature, and noise levels. This data can be
    used to better understand the relationship between environmental factors and air
    quality and improve overall environmental health. Furthermore, air quality sensors
    can increase public awareness of environmental issues and promote citizen engagement
    in environmental initiatives. Citizen involvement in data collection and analysis
    can foster stronger relationships between cities and their communities, promote
    sustainable behavior, and encourage greater participation in environmental monitoring
    efforts (Angelidou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Liu & Zhang, 2021). Although
    the implementation of air quality sensors in cities offers several benefits, it
    also poses several challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges include
    cost, data reliability, data integration, data privacy, equity, and regulatory
    challenges. One of the primary challenges for cities is the cost of purchasing
    and installing air quality sensors, which can be particularly problematic for
    cities with limited budgets. Additionally, there are ongoing expenses associated
    with maintaining, calibrating, and storing data generated by these sensors. Data
    reliability is another challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure that the
    data generated by air quality sensors is accurate and reliable. Measures need
    to be in place to ensure that the data collected is of sufficient quality to support
    effective decision-making processes. Cities also need to have the necessary infrastructure
    and expertise to manage and integrate the large amount of data generated by air
    quality sensors. Furthermore, privacy concerns may arise as air quality sensors
    collect data on individuals'' movements and activities. Therefore, it is vital
    to be transparent about how data is collected and used and to protect individuals''
    privacy. Equity is another challenge, as air quality sensors need to be placed
    in locations that accurately reflect the air quality experienced by different
    communities. This necessitates the placement of sensors in low-income and minority
    communities, which are frequently impacted disproportionately by air pollution.
    Additionally, regulatory challenges may arise as air quality sensors may not meet
    regulatory standards for air quality monitoring. Hence, cities must work with
    regulatory agencies to ensure that the data collected by sensors is usable for
    regulatory purposes (Neirotti et al., 2014; Benevolo et al., 2016; Su et al.,
    2023). To address environmental justice and reduce health disparities, it is crucial
    to ensure that air quality sensors are equitably distributed in low-income and
    minority communities. Cities can adopt various strategies to ensure the fair placement
    of sensors. One strategy is to engage with community organizations and residents
    to identify locations where air quality sensors should be placed. By involving
    the community in the decision-making process, cities can ensure that sensors are
    positioned in areas that accurately reflect the air quality experienced by residents.
    Another approach is to use existing data on air quality, traffic patterns, and
    other relevant factors to identify areas where air quality is likely to be poor.
    This data can help guide the placement of sensors in areas where they are most
    needed. Collaborative partnerships between cities, community organizations, universities,
    and other stakeholders can also facilitate the deployment of air quality sensors.
    These partnerships can ensure that sensors are placed in locations that are relevant
    to the community and that the data collected is used to address community concerns.
    Cities can also adopt policies that require air quality sensors to be placed in
    specific locations, such as near schools or in neighborhoods with high asthma
    rates. Such policies can ensure that sensors are placed in areas where they are
    most needed. Furthermore, prioritizing funding for air quality sensor deployment
    in low-income and minority communities is another strategy that cities can use
    to address environmental health disparities. By doing so, cities can ensure that
    these communities have access to the resources they need to improve their air
    quality (Chatti & Majeed, 2022; Cui & Cao, 2022; Kaginalkar et al., 2021). Apart
    from deploying air quality sensors, cities have implemented various policies to
    reduce air pollution in low-income communities. Green infrastructure projects,
    such as planting trees and building green roofs, can absorb pollutants and improve
    air quality while also reducing the urban heat island effect. Transit-oriented
    development is another policy implemented by cities to reduce air pollution in
    low-income communities. This policy involves building affordable housing near
    public transit and promoting alternative modes of transportation such as walking
    and biking, which reduces the number of cars on the road. Cities have also implemented
    low-emission zones that restrict the most polluting vehicles from entering certain
    areas of the city, often placed in low-income communities. Moreover, clean energy
    incentives such as rebates for solar panels and electric vehicles can help low-income
    residents access clean energy technologies and reduce their reliance on fossil
    fuels. Cities have also implemented regulations on industrial activity to reduce
    emissions and improve air quality in nearby communities, including emissions standards,
    pollution fees, and zoning restrictions. Education and outreach campaigns that
    raise awareness of air quality issues and promote sustainable behavior have also
    been implemented by cities, including campaigns that target low-income communities
    and provide resources and support to help residents reduce their exposure to air
    pollution. The effectiveness of policies implemented by cities to reduce air pollution
    in low-income communities can vary depending on the policy itself, implementation,
    and community engagement (Almalki et al., 2021; Michalec et al., 2019; Yao et
    al., 2020). Smart traffic management systems have the potential to make a significant
    contribution in reducing air pollution in urban environments. By reducing traffic
    congestion and associated emissions from cars and trucks, these systems can optimize
    traffic flow, reduce idling, and improve air quality (Djahel et al., 2014). Studies
    have shown that smart traffic management systems can have a positive impact on
    reducing air pollution in cities. For instance, a study revealed that the implementation
    of an intelligent transport system (ITS) resulted in a 15 % reduction in carbon
    dioxide emissions (El-Hansali et al., 2021). Smart traffic management systems
    can also promote the use of sustainable modes of transportation, such as public
    transit, biking, and walking, which can further reduce emissions and improve air
    quality (De Oliveira et al., 2020). Smart traffic management systems can promote
    sustainable transportation in several ways. Firstly, by providing real-time traffic
    information, these systems enable commuters to plan their routes and avoid congested
    areas, which can encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation such
    as public transit, biking, and walking. Secondly, smart traffic management systems
    can promote multimodal transportation planning by providing information on a range
    of transportation options. For example, some systems offer real-time information
    on public transit schedules and bike-sharing availability, making it easier for
    commuters to incorporate these options into their travel plans. Another approach
    to promoting sustainable transportation is the integration of smart parking systems
    into smart traffic management systems. By offering real-time information on parking
    availability and pricing, these systems can make it easier for people to find
    parking and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as
    public transit and biking. For example, drivers can be directed to park-and-ride
    facilities located near public transit stations, which can incentivize the use
    of public transit (Li et al., 2017; Sharif et al., 2017; Sumi & Ranga, 2018).
    Smart parking systems possess the potential to play a significant function in
    mitigating traffic congestion and the related air pollution in urban areas. One
    of the key benefits of these systems is that they can reduce the amount of time
    drivers spend looking for parking spots and circling around, which can lead to
    increased traffic congestion and associated emissions from idling vehicles. Smart
    parking systems can achieve this by providing real-time information on parking
    availability, allowing drivers to quickly find a parking spot without circling
    around, reducing the amount of time spent looking for parking and consequently
    reducing traffic congestion. In addition to providing real-time parking information,
    smart parking systems can also use dynamic pricing to incentivize drivers to park
    in less congested areas or at off-peak times. Smart parking systems can aid in
    balancing the supply and demand of parking and minimizing traffic congestion by
    charging higher rates in high-demand regions and lower rates in low-demand regions.
    This approach can encourage drivers to choose less congested parking areas, ultimately
    reducing the overall traffic congestion in the city. Another significant benefit
    of smart parking systems is their ability to reduce double-parking, which can
    block traffic and reduce road capacity. By providing real-time information on
    parking availability and reducing the need for drivers to park illegally, smart
    parking systems can help reduce double-parking and improve traffic flow. Lastly,
    smart parking systems can reduce the amount of time drivers spend cruising for
    parking by providing real-time information on parking availability and incentivizing
    drivers to park in less congested areas. For instance, offering discounts or rewards
    for parking in less congested areas can encourage drivers to choose these areas
    and reduce traffic congestion and associated emissions from idling vehicles. Therefore,
    smart parking systems have the potential to significantly reduce traffic congestion
    and air pollution in cities by reducing the amount of time drivers spend looking
    for parking spots, using dynamic pricing to balance parking supply and demand,
    reducing double-parking, and incentivizing drivers to park in less congested areas.
    These strategies can improve traffic flow, reduce emissions from idling vehicles,
    and ultimately contribute to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment
    (Englund et al., 2021; Liu & Ke, 2023; Zhu et al., 2016). To implement smart parking
    systems in cities, a comprehensive assessment of parking needs is necessary. This
    includes factors such as parking demand, availability, and current technologies.
    After assessing the needs, cities can select from several technology solutions,
    such as sensors, cameras, and mobile applications. The chosen technology solution
    should be suitable for the city''s needs and budget. In the case of a sensor-based
    solution, parking sensors will need to be installed in parking spaces or on the
    street. These sensors can detect whether a space is occupied or vacant and relay
    this information to a central database. Additionally, a parking management system
    should be developed by cities to gather and analyze data from the sensors or other
    technology solutions. This system should provide real-time information on parking
    availability and pricing, as well as enable payment and enforcement. To encourage
    the use of the smart parking system, cities should promote it to the public through
    marketing and outreach campaigns. This can help increase awareness and encourage
    commuters to choose more sustainable transportation options. Furthermore, continuous
    monitoring and evaluation of the smart parking system is crucial to ensure that
    it meets its objectives and identifies areas for improvement. This includes analyzing
    data on parking usage, revenues, and customer satisfaction. By following these
    steps, cities can successfully implement smart parking systems that meet their
    specific needs and contribute to more sustainable transportation choices. Regarding
    smart traffic management systems, their implementation feasibility and effectiveness
    can vary depending on the size, budget, and infrastructure of the city. Implementing
    smart traffic management systems involves significant investment in technology,
    data infrastructure, and personnel, which may not be feasible for smaller cities
    or those with limited budgets. Additionally, cities with older infrastructure
    may need to invest in upgrading their transportation systems to enable the integration
    of smart traffic management technologies. Moreover, the effectiveness of smart
    traffic management systems may depend on the existing transportation infrastructure
    of the city. For instance, cities with well-developed public transportation systems
    may have an easier time integrating smart traffic management systems that promote
    the use of alternative modes of transportation. Conversely, cities with high levels
    of car dependency may face more significant challenges in promoting sustainable
    transportation options through smart traffic management systems (Alsafery et al.,
    2018; Khanna & Anand, 2016; Vakula & Kolli, 2017). Fig. 3 provides an overview
    of the different categories under the core theme of smart city technologies for
    reducing air pollution. The figure illustrates the various strategies and challenges
    associated with the deployment of air quality sensors, optimizing transportation
    and energy systems, improving waste management, and implementing smart traffic
    and parking systems. The categories are organized to highlight the potential benefits
    of these strategies for improving public health, reducing environmental damage,
    and promoting citizen engagement. Additionally, the figure outlines the challenges
    associated with the equitable deployment of air quality sensors and the need for
    regulatory standards to ensure data reliability and privacy protection. A range
    of strategies, including transportation optimization, smart waste management implementation,
    air quality sensor deployment, and the establishment of smart parking and traffic
    systems, have been extensively studied and proven effective in reducing urban
    air pollution. By adopting a comprehensive approach that combines these solutions,
    substantial improvements in air quality and public health can be achieved, as
    supported by previous research. Download : Download high-res image (760KB) Download

    solutions for sustainable urban water management Cities worldwide are facing a
    critical imperative to address water consumption in light of global warming, population
    growth, and escalating per capita consumption. The pressing challenges posed by
    a growing global population and the finite nature of natural resources have elevated
    the urgency of implementing smart city initiatives as an essential endeavor for
    current and future generations (Holdren & Ehrlich, 1974; Jury & Vaux, 2007). Various
    regions around the world are experiencing serious water shortages, particularly
    countries with low rainfall such as Central Asia, India, the Middle East, North
    Africa and North America (Rijsberman, 2006). The quality of water is also a challenge,
    with approximately 1.1 billion people worldwide lacking access to water of desirable
    quality (Elimelech, 2006). One out of every four cities globally is experiencing
    a water shortage crisis, with population growth and urbanization exacerbating
    the situation (Zhang et al., 2020). By 2050, over six billion people are projected
    to live in cities. As a response, since 2012, more than 142 cities in North America,
    Europe, and East Asia have initiated smart city initiatives (Shafiullah et al.,
    2022). Smart building systems, which use artificial intelligence, can react to
    environmental conditions and perform some tasks automatically (Wong & Li, 2008).
    The Japanese company Hitachi, with more than a century of experience in water
    treatment across nearly 42 countries, is working towards creating smart cities
    that efficiently use water resources and establish effective water infrastructure
    (Alusi et al., 2011). In the city of Austin, Texas, approximately 5.8 billion
    barrels of drinking water were lost in 2015 due to leaks in pipes before reaching
    consumers, which accounted for approximately 12 % of the total drinking water
    consumed that year (Blatt, 2011). To address this issue, a water management system
    was introduced, which measures water pressure and pH levels to detect water leaks
    and ensure safe pH levels for human health. These systems use sensors to collect
    data, which is then processed by microcontrollers and communicated through computers
    and wireless networks (Nie et al., 2020; Saad & Gamatié, 2020). Moreover, ultrasonic
    sensors have been used by researchers to evaluate water quantity, quality, and
    leaks, and this data is announced on a website using an Arduino board (Yasin et
    al., 2021). Lopez et al. have developed a method for determining dynamic water
    tariffs and notifying users based on smart meters. Implementing this method in
    the city of Valencia in Spain with 430,000 subscribers resulted in an 11 % reduction
    in water consumption (Lopez-Nicolas et al., 2018). Additionally, Curry et al.
    have proposed five smart pilot projects to reduce water consumption in smart airports,
    smart homes, smart schools, smart buildings, and have reported the amount of water
    saved (Curry et al., 2018). The importance of addressing water consumption reduction
    in cities through smart city implementation and its technologies has been highlighted
    in previous research. By using smart water management systems, such as those that
    detect leaks and monitor water pressure and quality, cities can reduce water losses
    and ensure safe water for human consumption. Furthermore, implementing dynamic
    water tariffs and notifying users based on smart meters can encourage water conservation
    and reduce consumption. The use of smart pilot projects in various settings can
    also help reduce water consumption and promote sustainable water management practices
    (Ntuli & Abu-Mahfouz, 2016; Shahanas & Sivakumar, 2016; Singh & Ahmed, 2021).
    One of the most significant protocols for smart building automation is the KNX
    protocol, which is a global communication standard for home and building control.
    The Konnex Association created the KNX standard in 1999 by combining three older
    European home systems standards, namely EHS, BatiBUS, and EIB or Instabus. The
    KNX standard is widely used in residential and commercial buildings for controlling
    integrated systems, including HVAC, lighting, security, remote control, shading
    and curtain control, monitoring systems, and energy management. The KNX protocol
    has several advantages, such as millions of devices currently in service, all
    devices specifically designed for building automation, a unified software for
    all products regardless of the manufacturer, the ability to use tree, line, star,
    or any combination of topology, the ability to choose between different communication
    interfaces, and the ability to connect to other protocols through different communication
    gateways. The widespread adoption of the KNX protocol has resulted in a vast ecosystem
    of compatible devices, which provides customers with a wide range of options for
    building automation and control. With its versatility and compatibility, the KNX
    protocol is a popular choice for building automation and is widely used in smart
    buildings worldwide. Smart building projects that utilize the KNX protocol require
    the connection of various modules, sensors, and devices that are under the KNX
    protocol or through other communication interfaces to sensors or devices that
    need to be controlled by this system. These devices are connected in a network,
    and sensors receive information and transmit it to the smart modules through the
    network. The received information is then processed in the modules, and appropriate
    actions are taken based on the information (Domingues et al., 2016; Kastner et
    al., 2005; Lohia et al., 2019). The implementation of smart solutions to reduce
    water consumption using the KNX protocol is presented in the following sections,
    divided into three categories: irrigation, residential, and urban solutions. In
    this section, we focus on the irrigation and urban solutions, while the residential
    solutions will be explored in the next section. The irrigation solutions involve
    the use of smart irrigation controllers that monitor the weather and soil moisture
    to optimize irrigation and reduce water consumption. The urban solutions, on the
    other hand, include the use of smart water meters to monitor water consumption
    and detect leaks, as well as the implementation of dynamic water tariffs to encourage
    water conservation. These solutions provide significant opportunities for reducing
    water consumption in smart buildings and promoting sustainable water management
    practices (Christensen et al., 2020; Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2017; Vanus et al., 2016).
    Modern irrigation techniques involve two general forms: pressurized irrigation
    and drip and sprinkler irrigation. However, these methods often face challenges
    such as high implementation costs, technical maintenance of the system, and servicing
    of pumping system peripherals. Sprinkler irrigation may also face limitations
    in mixed planting schemes, as well as water loss due to incorrect system design
    or strong winds (Chaudhary et al., 2011). Rain irrigation systems have an efficiency
    rate of up to 70 %, while drip irrigation systems have an efficiency rate of up
    to 95 % (Payero et al., 2008). In contrast, surface irrigation of farms has an
    efficiency rate of no more than 50 % (Maisiri et al., 2005). In traditional situations,
    where most of the country''s lands are irrigated in this manner, the efficiency
    rate is even lower, at less than 35 % (Oweis & Hachum, 2006). The primary reasons
    for water loss in the agricultural sector are the use of fresh water for irrigation,
    over-irrigation of crops, creation of surface runoff, and irrigation at inappropriate
    times (Legesse & Ayenew, 2006). On the other hand, the development of green spaces
    is a crucial aspect of urban development. Trees are the lifelines of cities, and
    the construction of green spaces is essential for the mental and physical health
    of society. Maintaining these spaces is a fundamental principle of green space
    management, and irrigation is one of the primary needs for maintenance. Currently,
    urban green spaces are irrigated using various methods, such as mobile tanks,
    fixed tanks, human-powered irrigation through embedded taps, pressurized irrigation
    systems, or combined systems. The choice of irrigation method depends on factors
    such as climatic conditions, existing infrastructure, budget, and the type of
    plant tissue used (Choukai et al., 2022). In a smart agricultural field, moisture
    sensors are placed at regular intervals within the soil and next to the planted
    crops. These sensors are connected to a network through specialized wiring. The
    sensors send a message to the central control system as soon as the moisture within
    the soil decreases below the specified level for the plant. This message is displayed
    on a display screen, which is available to the farmer through the central controller
    display screens or control software that can be installed on a mobile phone. Upon
    receiving a message indicating decreased soil moisture from a predetermined number
    of sensors within each row of the planted crops, the system first examines weather
    changes using models provided on reputable weather websites, via a remote control
    module. If rainfall is expected in the coming days based on the weather maps,
    irrigation is delayed until the specified time (the number of days irrigation
    can be delayed is determined by the type of crop). Otherwise, the system sends
    an irrigation command to electric valve gates for the irrigation operation to
    be carried out within the soil. The irrigation continues until the soil moisture
    level is less than the predetermined moisture threshold for the embedded soil
    sensors. Once sufficient moisture is created, irrigation is immediately stopped
    to prevent water loss. Moreover, the system can be adjusted to perform irrigation
    based on temperature changes throughout the day. In hot seasons, irrigation is
    carried out at minimum temperature to prevent water evaporation, while in cold
    seasons, irrigation is carried out at maximum temperature to prevent crop freezing.
    The smart irrigation system reduces water consumption in agriculture and promotes
    sustainable water management practices. The equipment required for implementing
    an intelligent irrigation system for urban green spaces using the KNX protocol
    includes a switch operator, power sources, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering primary information, electric valve
    gates, soil moisture sensors, environment temperature sensors, a sensor for determining
    light intensity, and a network platform. The number, type of programming, and
    method of communication between devices are determined based on several factors
    such as the location of water supply, accessible water quantity and quality, types
    of crops used in the planting scheme, soil parameters, and regional climate. The
    input level of the switch operator is determined based on the diversity of plant
    coverage in terms of irrigation type. The equipment is designed to ensure efficient
    irrigation and reduce water waste in urban green spaces. The sensors, combined
    with the central control display, provide real-time monitoring and control of
    the irrigation system, allowing for adjustments to be made based on changing conditions
    in the environment (Cruz-S''nchez et al., 2012; Khujamatov & Toshtemirov, 2020).
    Water loss in cities is a significant problem, often resulting from water leakage
    in urban infrastructure (Mutikanga et al., 2009). High-pressure pumps send a considerable
    amount of water into urban water distribution networks daily. The pressure within
    the pipes has the most significant and quickest hydraulic effect on the amount
    of leakage (Trifunovic, 2006). As time passes, some parts of the network become
    worn out and experience water leakage due to high water pressure within the pipes.
    If a broken pipe causes water to leak to the surface, the damage is easily identifiable.
    However, if the pipe is damaged deep underground, the water will never reach the
    surface, making detection and repair much more challenging (Puust et al., 2010).
    In a smart city, installing water leakage detection sensors and pressure-reducing
    pumps, and creating a network between them, can significantly reduce water loss.
    During certain hours of the day, water consumption by users decreases. If the
    water pressure inside the pipes is higher than the needs of the users during these
    hours, water leakage occurs in the worn-out urban infrastructure. Therefore, by
    reducing the water pressure during off-peak hours of water consumption by subscribers,
    water leakage can be prevented to a great extent. Smart water meters measure the
    peak and off-peak hours of water consumption by subscribers, and the information
    obtained from them is sent by the urban smart system network to the central controllers
    and displays. Consequently, if necessary, the water pressure can be reduced or
    increased by the installed pumps. Additionally, smart water meters are present
    in various nodes of the water distribution network structure, measuring the amount
    of water reaching that node. The total amount of water pumped in the nodes should
    match the amount of water output from the main pump. If the difference between
    the numbers exceeds the predetermined limit, a warning message is sent to the
    network supervisor on the central display to inform them of the existence of a
    leakage in the distribution network. Furthermore, a network of water leakage sensors
    is placed around the water distribution network infrastructure. These sensors
    measure the soil moisture around the pipes. If the soil moisture exceeds the standard
    limit determined according to the region''s climate, a warning message is sent
    to the network manager to take prompt action to repair the leak. The implementation
    of these measures in a smart city can significantly reduce water loss and promote
    sustainable water management practices (Fantozzi et al., 2014; Kulkarni & Farnham,
    2016; Laspidou, 2014). The smart water distribution system has several features,
    including the ability to report the amount of water consumed by subscribers in
    each area, detect water leaks, and schedule pre-determined water pressure reductions
    or increases (Bhardwaj et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2018). To implement the water
    leakage detection system using the KNX protocol, the following equipment is required:
    a switch operator (with the input level determined based on the diversity of vegetation
    coverage in terms of the type of irrigation), power supply, internet connection
    module, central control display for monitoring and entering initial information,
    electric valve, water leakage detection sensors, and network infrastructure. The
    water leakage detection sensors are crucial components of the system, as they
    detect any leaks and identify their exact location. The central control display
    receives information from the sensors and displays it to the network supervisor,
    who can take prompt action to repair the leak. The smart water distribution system
    reduces water loss and promotes sustainable water management practices in urban
    areas (Ciholas et al., 2019; Rinaldi et al., 2020). In addition to the solutions
    discussed earlier, smart cities can also employ other methods to control urban
    water resources. One such method is smart water pricing, which involves implementing
    pricing schemes that reflect the true cost of water production and distribution.
    This can incentivize water conservation and discourage wasteful usage. For instance,
    tiered pricing systems that charge higher rates for excessive water usage can
    encourage people to be more mindful of their water consumption. Another effective
    approach is public education and awareness campaigns. By educating the public
    about the importance of water conservation and providing practical tips for reducing
    water usage, cities can encourage residents to adopt more sustainable water usage
    habits. Such campaigns can be carried out through various channels, including
    social media, public service announcements, and community outreach programs. Therefore,
    implementing smart city solutions can significantly reduce urban water resource
    waste, which is of great importance in the face of increasing water scarcity in
    many countries around the world. By promoting sustainable water management practices,
    smart cities can ensure the availability of safe, clean water for future generations
    (Chandran et al., 2021; Karwot et al., 2016; Moy de Vitry et al., 2019). Fig.
    4 shows the main categories of smart city solutions for sustainable urban water
    management, including irrigation solutions and urban solutions. Irrigation solutions
    involve the use of smart irrigation controllers that optimize irrigation and reduce
    water consumption through moisture sensors and weather models. Urban solutions
    include the use of smart water meters to monitor water consumption and detect
    leaks, as well as the implementation of dynamic water tariffs. Additional methods
    include smart water pricing schemes and public education campaigns to promote
    sustainable water usage habits. The implementation of these solutions can significantly
    reduce water waste and promote sustainable water management practices in smart
    cities. Therefore, the existing literature provides substantial evidence regarding
    the water-saving and conservation advantages offered by smart irrigation systems
    and technologies that encompass leak detection and pressure management. Augmenting
    these measures with pricing incentives and educational campaigns is crucial for
    cultivating a culture of sustainable water usage in urban areas, as substantiated
    by previous research. Download : Download high-res image (555KB) Download : Download

    strategies and technologies for efficient water use and conservation in urban
    environments. 4.3.3. Technologies and strategies for electricity resource management
    in smart cities Smart city implementation holds immense potential for effective
    electricity resource management. To tackle this challenge, advanced technologies
    and strategic approaches are being employed within smart cities. These include
    smart grid systems, integration of renewable energy sources, energy-efficient
    building practices, demand response programs, infrastructure for electric vehicle
    charging, energy storage systems, microgrid frameworks, and data analytics. Smart
    grid systems use advanced sensors and communication technologies to monitor and
    control electricity distribution in real-time. Smart grids can aid in averting
    blackouts and enhancing the overall efficacy of the electricity system by optimizing
    electricity flows and curbing wasteful usage (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2012; Xia et
    al., 2021). Additionally, smart cities are progressively adopting sustainable
    energy sources like solar and wind power to minimize dependence on fossil fuels
    and diminish greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of renewable energy sources
    into the grid can also enhance the resilience of the electricity system and reduce
    the probability of power outages. The promotion of energy-efficient building designs
    and technologies, such as LED lighting, smart thermostats, and automated shading
    systems, is advocated by smart cities to lower energy consumption in buildings.
    This can decrease electricity demand and help forestall power shortages. Furthermore,
    demand response programs urge consumers to decrease their electricity utilization
    during peak demand periods, thereby lowering the need for costly new power plants.
    Furthermore, smart cities are investing in electric vehicle charging infrastructure
    to support the transition to sustainable transportation (Silva et al., 2018; Pellicer
    et al., 2013). By providing convenient and accessible charging stations, smart
    cities can encourage more people to switch to EVs and reduce the demand for gasoline-powered
    vehicles that contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy
    storage systems are also being explored to help balance electricity supply and
    demand, thereby preventing blackouts and improving the reliability of the electricity
    system. Several smart cities are adopting microgrids, which are small-scale electricity
    systems capable of functioning autonomously from the primary electricity grid.
    Microgrids can help improve the resilience and reliability of the electricity
    system by providing backup power during blackouts or other disruptions. Additionally,
    advanced data analytics tools are being used to better understand electricity
    usage patterns and identify opportunities for energy savings. Smart cities can
    analyze data from smart meters and other sensors to develop targeted programs
    to reduce electricity usage (Caragliu et al., 2011; Khalil et al., 2021). Smart
    grid systems are designed to incorporate advanced digital technologies to modernize
    traditional electricity grids. These systems use sensors and other devices to
    collect real-time data on electricity usage and grid conditions, and then use
    advanced analytics and control systems to optimize the flow of electricity and
    reduce wasteful usage (Phuangpornpitak & Tia, 2013). The implementation of smart
    grid systems can assist utilities in achieving a better balance between electricity
    supply and demand, which can enhance the overall dependability of the electricity
    system. Smart grids can automatically redirect electricity away from regions with
    high demand or store surplus electricity during periods of low demand and distribute
    it during peak demand. Moreover, smart grids can optimize the usage of sustainable
    energy sources like solar and wind power, which can aid in minimizing dependence
    on fossil fuels and diminishing greenhouse gas emissions. This can reduce the
    necessity for new power plants and enhance the utilization of existing generation
    capacity. Two-way communication is a key feature of smart grids, allowing utilities
    to collect data from sensors and other devices in real-time and send signals back
    to these devices to control their operation. This two-way communication enables
    smart grids to be more responsive to changing conditions and optimize the flow
    of electricity in real-time. By using advanced analytics and control systems,
    smart grids can optimize the use of these resources to reduce reliance on centralized
    power plants and increase the resilience of the electricity system. The cybersecurity
    of these systems is critical as smart grids rely on digital technologies and communication
    networks. Smart grid systems need to be designed with strong cybersecurity measures
    to prevent cyberattacks and protect the privacy and security of data. Smart grids
    rely on a variety of devices and systems that need to be interoperable and able
    to communicate with each other. Ensuring that these systems work together seamlessly
    can be challenging, especially when different vendors are involved (Colak et al.,
    2015; Lo & Ansari, 2011). The incorporation of sustainable energy sources like
    solar and wind power into the electricity grid is a crucial approach for smart
    cities to encourage sustainability and decrease dependence on fossil fuels. Solar
    power is increasingly being used by smart cities as solar panels can be installed
    on rooftops, carports, and other structures to generate electricity locally. By
    integrating solar power into the grid, smart cities can reduce reliance on centralized
    power plants that burn fossil fuels and contribute to air pollution and climate
    change. Wind power is another renewable energy source being embraced by smart
    cities. Wind turbines can be installed in windy areas to generate electricity
    that can be fed into the grid, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable
    energy mix. However, one of the biggest challenges with renewable energy sources
    is their intermittency. The production of solar and wind power can fluctuate,
    making it challenging to balance electricity supply and demand, particularly during
    periods of high demand or low renewable energy production (Anees, 2012; Bhandari
    et al., 2014; Yousif et al., 2019). Smart cities are utilizing energy storage
    systems like batteries to accumulate surplus electricity generated by renewable
    energy sources and dispense it when required, assisting in enhancing the dependability
    of the electricity system and reducing the likelihood of power outages. Additionally,
    smart cities are adopting microgrids as small-scale electricity systems that can
    operate autonomously from the primary electricity grid. Microgrids can be fueled
    by sustainable energy sources like solar and wind power, offering backup power
    during power outages or other disruptions. Integrating renewable energy sources
    into the grid may require upgrading the grid infrastructure to handle the variable
    and distributed nature of these sources, which can be costly (Khan et al., 2018).
    Regulations and policies can also present barriers to integration, such as regulations
    around energy pricing or grid interconnection that may need to be updated to support
    the integration of renewable energy sources or the deployment of energy storage
    systems. Additionally, some members of the public may have concerns about the
    visual and environmental impacts of renewable energy sources, requiring public
    education and addressing concerns to promote acceptance. Despite these challenges,
    many smart cities are making progress in integrating renewable energy sources
    into the grid. By addressing these challenges and working collaboratively with
    stakeholders, cities can build more sustainable and resilient energy systems that
    benefit their citizens and the environment (Hammons, 2008; Liserre et al., 2010;
    Zahedi, 2011). Smart cities need to manage the electricity resources required
    to power electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure effectively. Charging station
    locations must be carefully chosen to ensure that they are easily accessible to
    EV drivers, even if it means installing new electrical infrastructure. Smart cities
    must also consider the types of charging stations installed, ranging from slow
    chargers to fast chargers, which can impact the demand on the electricity grid.
    Load management strategies, such as scheduling charging during off-peak hours
    or incentivizing EV owners to charge their vehicles during times of low demand,
    can help avoid overloading the electricity grid. To ensure that EV charging stations
    are located in areas that are easily accessible to EV drivers, smart cities can
    conduct a needs assessment, engage with stakeholders, use mapping tools, partner
    with private companies, and consider zoning and permitting regulations. A needs
    assessment can analyze data on the number of EVs in the area, the locations of
    existing charging stations, and the availability of electrical infrastructure
    in different areas. Engaging with stakeholders, including EV owners, local businesses,
    and community groups, can help identify convenient locations that meet the needs
    of the local community. Mapping tools can help identify potential locations for
    charging stations based on proximity to major highways, public transportation,
    and popular destinations. Partnering with private companies can provide valuable
    expertise in identifying optimal locations for charging stations. Finally, zoning
    and permitting regulations can encourage the installation of charging stations
    in areas that are easily accessible to EV drivers. By taking a proactive and collaborative
    approach, smart cities can build a more sustainable and resilient transportation
    system by ensuring that EV charging stations are located in areas that are easily
    accessible to EV drivers, promoting the adoption of EVs, and reducing greenhouse
    gas emissions from transportation (Maglaras et al., 2014; Qureshi et al., 2021;
    Vaidya & Mouftah, 2020). Managing electricity resources for energy storage systems
    is crucial for sustainable urban environment. The sizing of energy storage systems
    is a critical component to ensure that they provide the required electricity when
    needed. Historical electricity demand data is analyzed to determine peak demand
    periods and size the energy storage system accordingly. Smart cities may also
    need to implement load management strategies to manage electricity demand, such
    as scheduling charging during off-peak hours or incentivizing electricity users
    to reduce consumption during high demand. Regular maintenance is required to operate
    energy storage systems efficiently and effectively. Smart cities should consider
    maintenance and replacement costs when evaluating the economic feasibility of
    energy storage systems. To maintain energy storage effectively, smart cities can
    establish a regular maintenance schedule, use remote monitoring, perform performance
    analysis, provide maintenance personnel training and education, and enter into
    contractual agreements with energy storage system manufacturers or service providers.
    A comprehensive maintenance strategy can ensure effective and efficient energy
    storage maintenance, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient electricity
    system (Almihat et al., 2022; O''Dwyer et al., 2019; Taveres-Cachat et al., 2019).
    Smart cities are increasingly using data analytics tools to effectively manage
    electricity resources. By analyzing historical data on electricity usage, these
    tools can help forecast future demand patterns, allowing utilities to plan for
    electricity supply and demand, ensuring that there is enough electricity supply
    to meet demand during peak periods. Additionally, data analytics tools can help
    smart cities identify areas where energy is being wasted or used inefficiently,
    allowing utilities to develop targeted programs to reduce electricity usage and
    improve energy efficiency. Load management strategies such as scheduling charging
    during off-peak hours or using demand response programs can also be implemented
    using data analytics to incentivize electricity users to reduce their electricity
    consumption during times of high demand. Furthermore, smart cities can use data
    analytics tools to predict maintenance needs for electricity infrastructure, such
    as transformers and switches, reducing downtime and lowering the costs associated
    with equipment repairs and replacements. By improving energy efficiency, implementing
    time-of-use pricing, managing electricity demand, and predicting maintenance needs,
    data analytics tools can help smart cities reduce electricity costs for residents
    and businesses (Chen et al., 2021; Hashem et al., 2016; Sarker, 2022). Implementing
    smart city technologies for managing electricity resources can be challenging,
    and there are several factors that can impact the success of these initiatives.
    Some of the key challenges that smart cities face include cost, interoperability,
    data privacy and security, public engagement, and regulatory barriers. One of
    the primary challenges is the cost of implementing smart city technologies, which
    can be expensive. Building a smart grid or installing energy-efficient technologies
    in buildings can require significant upfront investments that may take years to
    recoup through energy savings. In addition, smart city technologies rely on a
    variety of sensors, devices, and systems that need to be interoperable and able
    to communicate with each other. Ensuring that these systems work together seamlessly
    can be challenging, especially when different vendors are involved. Data privacy
    and security is another significant challenge. Smart city technologies rely on
    vast amounts of data that need to be collected, stored, and analyzed. Ensuring
    the privacy and security of this data can be a significant challenge, as it may
    be vulnerable to cyberattacks or other threats. Public engagement is also crucial
    for the success of smart city initiatives. Educating the public on the benefits
    of these technologies and engaging them in the planning and implementation process
    can be challenging, especially when there are concerns about data privacy or the
    cost of these initiatives. Furthermore, regulatory barriers such as energy pricing
    or grid interconnection may need to be updated to support the integration of renewable
    energy sources or the deployment of energy storage systems. Despite these challenges,
    many cities are making progress in implementing smart city technologies for managing
    electricity resources. By addressing these challenges and working collaboratively
    with stakeholders, cities can build more sustainable and resilient energy systems
    that benefit their citizens and the environment (Shafiullah et al., 2022; Bawany
    & Shamsi, 2015; Hassan et al., 2021). Fig. 5 illustrates the various strategies
    and technologies that smart cities are implementing for electricity resource management.
    The figure is divided into two main categories: advanced technologies and challenges/considerations.
    The advanced technologies category includes smart grid systems, renewable energy
    integration, energy-efficient buildings, demand response programs, electric vehicle
    charging infrastructure, energy storage systems, microgrids, and data analytics.
    The challenges/considerations category includes cybersecurity, interoperability,
    intermittency of renewable energy sources, upgrading grid infrastructure, regulations
    and policies, and public acceptance. The figure highlights the importance of addressing
    these challenges to achieve more sustainable and resilient energy systems in smart
    cities. The findings depicted in Fig. 5 highlight that the adoption of smart grid
    systems, integration of renewable energy sources, establishment of EV infrastructure,
    and utilization of other relevant technologies can lead to a substantial reduction
    in greenhouse gas emissions, as demonstrated by various assessments. Nevertheless,
    effectively addressing the identified challenges necessitates collaborative efforts
    among multiple stakeholders and innovative policy measures to achieve the desired
    sustainability objectives. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download :

    management in smart cities: advanced technologies and challenges/considerations.
    4.3.4. Environmental effects and challenges of waste management in smart cities
    The primary objective of smart cities is to enhance the well-being of urban inhabitants
    and mitigate environmental pollution through the utilization of advanced technologies
    and efficient resource utilization. In the context of smart city development,
    sustainable management of urban resources, particularly recyclable materials like
    plastics, papers, metals, and glass, assumes great significance. To facilitate
    effective recycling management in smart cities, technologies specific to this
    domain are employed for the collection, segregation, recycling, and optimized
    management of recyclable waste materials. Smart technologies enable the collection
    of data from different recycling containers, which enhances the accuracy of waste
    collection and recycling. This, in turn, leads to efficient and effective recycling
    of waste, resulting in a decrease in the amount of waste produced, enhanced resource
    availability, and reduced environmental pollution. Moreover, recycling various
    materials creates employment opportunities and reduces waste management costs.
    Smart cities utilize various technologies for efficient and effective collection
    and recycling of recyclable waste, such as smart collection systems, separation
    and recycling technologies, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and blockchain.
    Smart collection systems, such as smart recycling containers, smart recycling
    bins, and smart collection networks, employ sensors and smart devices to collect
    and optimize the waste collection process with precision. Separation and recycling
    technologies like automatic sorting systems, advanced recycling systems, and recycling
    machines such as recycling mills are used to recycle recyclable waste. Artificial
    intelligence and deep learning technologies can detect, separate, and recycle
    recyclable waste in a smart and accurate manner (Ullah et al., 2023; Yong et al.,
    2023). By identifying recyclable waste, these technologies can streamline the
    recycling process and increase efficiency. Furthermore, blockchain technology
    can be utilized to ensure that all stages of the collection and recycling process
    are transparent and traceable, minimizing the likelihood of fraud and illegal
    transactions (Aazam et al., 2016; Anagnostopoulos et al., 2017; Esmaeilian et
    al., 2018). Advanced technologies such as sensors, data analytics, and IoT devices
    are used by smart collection systems to improve the collection and management
    of recyclable waste. Sensors are deployed to collect data on the level of recyclable
    waste in recycling containers or bins. These sensors can detect when a container
    or bin is full or nearly full and send an alert to waste collectors to empty it.
    Subsequent to the collection of data by sensors, data analytics tools and algorithms
    are implemented to optimize waste collection routes. By devising more efficient
    routes, waste collectors can diminish the duration and expenses related to redundant
    collections. IoT devices, such as smart recycling containers and bins, communicate
    with one another and with waste management systems, delivering real-time data
    on the whereabouts and status of recyclable waste. This enables waste management
    systems to optimize the collection process and minimize waste. The system also
    utilizes smart routing to optimize waste collection routes. By scrutinizing data
    on the status and location of recycling containers or bins, waste collectors can
    plan the most effectual collection routes, reducing the duration and costs associated
    with unnecessary collections. Additionally, smart collection systems offer remote
    monitoring capabilities for recycling containers or bins, which enable waste management
    systems to keep track of the status of recycling containers or bins in real-time.
    This allows them to respond to issues or emergencies rapidly. In conclusion, smart
    collection systems leverage advanced technologies to enhance the collection and
    management of recyclable waste, resulting in waste reduction and improved efficiency
    for waste management systems (Ali et al., 2020; B. Fang et al., 2023; Shukla &
    Hait, 2022). The introduction of smart collection systems comes with several challenges
    that require attention. One of the prominent concerns is the cost, as the implementation
    of such systems can be expensive, and the associated costs may be passed onto
    residents and businesses. This may act as a barrier to the adoption of these systems,
    especially in areas where the costs of waste management are already high. Moreover,
    the installation of new infrastructure, such as sensors, data analytics systems,
    and communication networks, is essential for the operation of smart collection
    systems, which can be time-consuming and costly. This is particularly true for
    areas with existing waste management infrastructure that may require upgrading
    or replacement. Another challenge associated with smart collection systems pertains
    to data management. These systems generate a vast amount of data that needs to
    be collected, analyzed, and utilized to optimize the waste collection process.
    This requires specialized skills and resources that may not be readily available
    in all areas. Additionally, the success of smart collection systems depends on
    the participation of various stakeholders, including waste collectors, residents,
    and businesses. Engaging these stakeholders and getting them to participate in
    the waste collection process can be challenging, especially in areas where waste
    segregation and recycling are not widely practiced or where there is resistance
    to change. Furthermore, smart collection systems rely on advanced technologies
    that may be susceptible to technical issues or failures. Ensuring that these systems
    are reliable and function correctly at all times can pose a challenge. Despite
    these challenges, the benefits of smart collection systems, such as increased
    efficiency, higher recycling rates, and reduced waste management costs, make them
    an attractive approach to waste management in smart cities. Therefore, it is imperative
    to address the challenges associated with the implementation of smart collection
    systems to fully realize their potential in waste management (Ahmad et al., 2021;
    Ebekozien et al., 2022; Ijemaru et al., 2022). Blockchain technology can be applied
    in numerous ways to enhance waste management practices. One such application is
    the utilization of blockchain for supply chain tracking to track the movement
    of waste from its inception to its final destination, such as a recycling facility
    or landfill. By documenting each step of the waste management process on the blockchain,
    stakeholders can maintain a clear and tamper-proof record of the waste''s journey,
    which can aid in tracking and management of waste streams (Arabian et al., 2022;
    Barenji & Nejad, 2022). Additionally, blockchain can be used to establish digital
    identities for waste management facilities, regulators, and other stakeholders
    involved in the waste management process, ensuring the legitimacy of waste management
    activities and that waste is being handled appropriately and lawfully. Another
    application of blockchain in waste management is the use of smart contracts to
    automate processes such as waste collection and recycling. Smart contracts can
    be programmed to execute specific actions automatically, such as initiating waste
    collection when a recycling bin is full (Samuel et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2022).
    Furthermore, blockchain-based reward systems can be implemented to incentivize
    sustainable waste management practices, such as recycling or reducing waste generation.
    For example, a blockchain-based reward system could provide tokens or other incentives
    to individuals or businesses that engage in sustainable waste management practices
    (X. Zhang et al., 2023; X. Zhang et al., 2023; X. Zhang et al., 2022; Kolahan
    et al., 2021). Also, blockchain technology can be utilized to establish decentralized
    waste management systems where waste management activities are coordinated among
    several stakeholders in a peer-to-peer network. This approach can reduce the need
    for centralized waste management facilities, which can be costly and time-consuming
    to construct and maintain. In summary, blockchain technology can be utilized to
    enhance transparency, efficiency, and sustainability in waste management practices
    (Aithal, 2021; Aroba et al., 2023; Nižetić et al., 2019). Blockchain technology
    holds tremendous potential in augmenting waste management practices by providing
    several benefits, such as transparency, traceability, efficiency, fraud prevention,
    and incentivization. Blockchain technology can establish a transparent and tamper-proof
    record of waste management activities, starting from waste collection to recycling.
    This can increase trust among stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Also, with blockchain, waste management activities can
    be traced back to their source, allowing for improved tracking and management
    of waste streams. This can lead to better waste management practices, a reduction
    in waste, and an increase in recycling rates. Blockchain technology can facilitate
    the efficient and secure exchange of information and resources between stakeholders.
    This can result in a reduction in the time and cost associated with waste management
    activities. Additionally, blockchain technology can aid in preventing fraud and
    illegal activities in waste management, such as illegal dumping or improper handling
    of hazardous waste. With blockchain, waste management activities can be recorded
    and verified, making it challenging for malicious actors to manipulate the system.
    Moreover, blockchain technology can be utilized to incentivize positive waste
    management behaviors, such as recycling or reducing waste generation. For instance,
    blockchain-based reward systems can offer incentives to individuals or businesses
    that engage in sustainable waste management practices. Blockchain technology has
    the potential to revolutionize waste management practices, but its implementation
    also presents challenges. One of the significant challenges is the technical complexity
    of blockchain-based waste management systems. This involves a considerable investment
    of specialized expertise and resources, making it costly and time-consuming. Additionally,
    integrating blockchain-based waste management systems with existing waste management
    infrastructure can be challenging as it requires significant changes to existing
    processes and systems, which may not be feasible or cost-effective. Another challenge
    is the accuracy and completeness of data recorded on the blockchain. If data is
    inputted manually or by multiple stakeholders with varying levels of expertise,
    it can affect the reliability of waste management data and the effectiveness of
    blockchain-based waste management systems. Besides, the implementation of blockchain-based
    waste management systems may raise regulatory and legal challenges, such as data
    privacy and security concerns, and compliance with waste management regulations.
    Lastly, the success of blockchain-based waste management systems depends on the
    adoption and engagement of stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Ensuring that all stakeholders are willing and able
    to participate in blockchain-based waste management systems can be a challenge.
    Therefore, while blockchain technology offers numerous benefits to waste management
    practices, it is crucial to address these challenges for its effective implementation
    (Cheng et al., 2022; Fayomi et al., 2021; Ogutu et al., 2021). Artificial intelligence
    and deep learning have the potential to revolutionize waste management practices
    in a multitude of ways. One notable area of improvement is waste sorting. AI and
    deep learning algorithms can be utilized to automatically sort waste into different
    categories, such as recyclable and non-recyclable waste, which reduces the need
    for manual sorting and minimizes the risk of contamination. Predictive analytics
    is another area where AI and deep learning can be applied. The scrutiny of data
    on waste generation and collection patterns permits waste management systems to
    predict future waste generation and devise waste collection routes more competently.
    This can result in more accurate waste forecasting, reduced time and cost associated
    with waste collection, and increased recycling rates. Furthermore, the development
    of smart bins equipped with sensors and cameras that can detect and sort waste
    automatically is made possible by AI and deep learning. These smart bins can accurately
    and efficiently sort waste into different categories, reducing contamination and
    increasing recycling rates. In addition, AI and deep learning algorithms can optimize
    waste management processes such as waste collection, transportation, and recycling
    by analyzing data on waste generation, collection, and recycling. This identification
    of inefficiencies can lead to suggestions for improvements to waste management
    processes. Also, AI and deep learning can be used to detect fraud and illegal
    activities in waste management. By analyzing data on waste management activities,
    AI and deep learning algorithms can identify anomalies or suspicious patterns
    and trigger alerts to waste management authorities. Artificial Intelligence and
    deep learning have the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact
    of waste management practices. One of the notable ways in which these technologies
    can enhance waste management is through optimizing waste collection routes. By
    analyzing waste generation and collection patterns, AI and deep learning algorithms
    can identify the most efficient waste collection routes, reducing the distance
    traveled by waste collection vehicles and minimizing fuel consumption. This can
    lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Another way
    in which AI and deep learning can assist waste management is by predicting waste
    generation. By leveraging historical data and considering variables such as weather
    patterns and demographics, AI and deep learning algorithms can forecast future
    waste generation. Accurate predictions can help waste management authorities to
    plan for future waste management needs, reducing the likelihood of overcapacity
    or undercapacity in waste management facilities. Furthermore, AI and deep learning
    algorithms can be utilized to reduce contamination by identifying and sorting
    recyclable materials more accurately. This can help increase the quality of recycled
    materials while decreasing contamination, leading to a reduction in the environmental
    impact of waste management. Properly recycled materials can be reused instead
    of ending up in landfills, which can help mitigate the environmental impact of
    waste disposal. In addition, AI and deep learning can improve landfill management
    by monitoring and analyzing data on landfill conditions such as temperature, moisture,
    and gas emissions. This can enable waste management authorities to better manage
    landfills and reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal. Lastly, AI and
    deep learning technologies can be used to identify hazardous waste, such as chemicals
    and heavy metals, in waste streams. By doing so, these technologies can ensure
    that hazardous waste is appropriately handled and disposed of, reducing the risk
    of environmental contamination and harm to human health (Pirlone & Spadaro, 2014;
    Shah et al., 2018; Thakur et al., 2022). There exist several challenges in the
    implementation of AI in waste management. Data quality is a primary challenge.
    The accuracy and completeness of data used to train AI models can be inconsistent
    and incomplete, making it challenging to develop accurate and reliable AI models.
    Waste management data is collected from various sources, and standardizing it
    can be difficult, leading to inaccuracies and incomplete data sets. Technical
    complexity is another challenge. Implementing AI systems in waste management can
    be technically complex, requiring specialized expertise and resources. Developing
    and maintaining AI algorithms and systems can be costly and time-consuming, and
    the lack of technical expertise in waste management can further complicate the
    process. Integrating AI systems with existing waste management infrastructure
    is another challenge. This can require significant changes to existing processes
    and systems, which may not be feasible or cost-effective. Moreover, waste management
    infrastructure varies widely across different regions, making it challenging to
    develop a standardized approach for implementing AI systems. Regulatory and legal
    challenges also pose a significant hurdle for the implementation of AI systems
    in waste management. These challenges can include data privacy and security concerns,
    compliance with waste management regulations, and liability issues associated
    with the use of AI systems. The success of AI systems in waste management depends
    on the adoption and engagement of stakeholders, including waste management companies,
    regulators, and citizens. Ensuring that all stakeholders are willing and able
    to participate in AI-based waste management systems can be a challenge. Additionally,
    public perception of AI and concerns about job displacement may hinder the adoption
    of AI systems in waste management (Agarwal et al., 2020; Han et al., 2022; Rubab
    et al., 2022). As previously mentioned, smart city technologies can exert both
    favorable and unfavorable effects on urban natural resources and the environment.
    These technologies can mitigate energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions
    by fine-tuning energy usage in buildings, transportation systems, and other infrastructure.
    This can lead to improved air quality. Water conservation can also be improved
    by monitoring water use, detecting leaks, and optimizing water distribution systems,
    which can reduce water pollution and conserve scarce water resources. In addition,
    waste management practices can be enhanced through the implementation of smart
    city technologies. This can include waste collection, sorting, and recycling,
    which can lead to reduced waste generation, increased recycling rates, and a decrease
    in the environmental impact of waste disposal. Additionally, the use of smart
    city technologies to establish green infrastructure, like urban gardens, green
    roofs, and parks, can aid in augmenting urban biodiversity, lessening the urban
    heat island effect, and refining air quality. Smart city technologies also have
    the potential to optimize transportation systems, which can reduce congestion,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution while promoting physical activity
    through the use of sustainable transportation modes like public transport, cycling,
    and walking. However, the implementation of smart city technologies can also have
    negative impacts on the environment. For example, the production and disposal
    of electronic devices used in smart city technologies can generate electronic
    waste if not managed properly. Moreover, if powered by non-renewable sources,
    smart city technologies can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution.
    Additionally, the installation of smart city infrastructure, such as sensors,
    can require land and resources, which can have negative environmental impacts
    if not managed appropriately. To maximize the positive impacts of smart city technologies
    on the environment, it is crucial to prioritize sustainable and environmentally
    friendly solutions, such as renewable energy sources, green infrastructure, and
    sustainable transportation modes. The negative impacts of these technologies should
    also be carefully managed, such as the proper disposal of electronic devices and
    the appropriate use of land and resources during their installation. In conclusion,
    the impact of smart city technologies on urban natural resources and the environment
    depends on various factors, and implementing sustainable and environmentally friendly
    solutions is essential to ensure their positive impact on the environment (Chu
    et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2022). Therefore, smart city waste management technologies
    present both opportunities and challenges for promoting urban sustainability,
    as presented in Fig. 6. These technologies include smart collection systems, separation
    and recycling technologies, artificial intelligence, deep learning, and blockchain.
    Smart collection systems and separation recycling technologies can improve waste
    collection and sorting, increasing recycling rates and waste reduction. Artificial
    intelligence and deep learning enable predictive analytics and the optimization
    of waste management processes. Blockchain promotes transparency and security in
    waste management through supply chain tracking and can incentivize sustainable
    behaviors. However, the implementation of these technologies faces challenges
    related to costs, technical complexity, integration with existing infrastructure,
    data quality, regulations, and stakeholder participation. Consequently, the smart
    waste management solutions presented exhibit promising potential for diminishing
    waste volumes, enhancing recycling and circularity practices, reducing carbon
    emissions, and generating various sustainability benefits, as evidenced by previous
    implementations. However, effectively surmounting the identified challenges is
    crucial for the successful widespread adoption of these solutions at the city
    scale. Download : Download high-res image (930KB) Download : Download full-size

    technologies. 4.4. Smart cities and housing resource management The implementation
    of smart cities can yield both favorable and adverse environmental outcomes. On
    one hand, the incorporation of advanced technologies and optimized resource management
    practices can result in a reduction in environmental pollution and promote sustainable
    development in the housing sector. Notably, the utilization of energy-efficient
    appliances, monitoring systems for water consumption, and the integration of renewable
    energy sources within smart homes can contribute significantly to these objectives.
    However, it is important to acknowledge that the construction and maintenance
    of smart city infrastructure may also engender negative environmental consequences,
    such as heightened energy consumption and increased greenhouse gas emissions.
    Furthermore, the production and disposal of electronic devices and technological
    components used in smart cities may give rise to challenges related to electronic
    waste and other environmental concerns. The overall impact of smart city implementation
    on the environment and sustainable development in housing depends on various factors,
    such as the specific technologies and practices utilized, the level of public
    engagement and education, and the regulatory frameworks in place to ensure environmental
    sustainability (Jonek-Kowalska, 2022; Maalsen, 2019). In this section of the article,
    the impact of smart city implementation on enhancing sustainable development and
    managing natural resources in smart city houses is discussed. 4.4.1. Smart city
    technologies for optimizing home electricity consumption Smart city technologies
    provide various ways to manage electricity resources in houses. One of these ways
    is through home energy management systems that optimize energy consumption by
    controlling and automating electricity use. Such systems adjust lighting, heating,
    and cooling based on occupancy, time of day, and other factors. Smart appliances,
    including smart thermostats, lighting systems, and home appliances, can also be
    remotely controlled and adjusted based on energy demand and user preferences.
    Moreover, smart city technologies enable time-of-use pricing, which charges residents
    different rates for electricity use depending on the time of day. This approach
    incentivizes residents to reduce their electricity consumption during peak demand
    periods when electricity prices are high. Additionally, smart city technologies
    support energy-efficient building design through features such as insulation,
    efficient lighting and appliances, and energy-saving building materials. Time-of-use
    pricing provides several benefits to residents. Firstly, it encourages them to
    shift their electricity consumption to off-peak hours when electricity prices
    are lower, leading to reduced electricity bills. Furthermore, this approach reduces
    the overall demand for electricity during peak hours, thereby mitigating the risk
    of power outages and reducing the need for expensive new power plants. Secondly,
    time-of-use pricing promotes energy-efficient practices among residents, such
    as using appliances during off-peak hours or reducing overall energy consumption
    during peak hours. By adopting such practices, residents can reduce their carbon
    footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future. Finally, time-of-use pricing
    can lower overall electricity costs for the local community by decreasing the
    need for expensive peak capacity power plants. This can result in more stable
    and predictable electricity prices for residents in the long term. By utilizing
    time-of-use pricing, communities can benefit from lower electricity bills, reduced
    carbon emissions, and a more stable electricity supply. Smart city technologies
    also facilitate home energy audits, which can be conducted remotely using smart
    sensors. These audits provide personalized recommendations to residents for reducing
    energy consumption. By using these various approaches, smart city technologies
    optimize electricity use in houses, reducing energy consumption and greenhouse
    gas emissions while lowering electricity bills (H. Kim et al., 2021; Curiale,
    2014; Humayun et al., 2022). Smart appliances are increasingly being used in homes
    to manage energy consumption effectively and improve overall efficiency. These
    smart appliances include smart thermostats, smart lighting systems, smart home
    appliances, smart plugs, and smart water heaters. Smart thermostats are programmed
    to adjust heating and cooling settings automatically by taking into account factors
    such as occupancy, time of day, and weather conditions. By learning the residents''
    preferences and adjusting the settings accordingly, they help to reduce energy
    consumption and lower electricity bills. Smart lighting systems are equipped with
    sensors and automation technology that can adjust lighting levels based on occupancy
    and time of day. These systems can be conveniently controlled using a smartphone
    app from anywhere, enabling residents to turn lights on and off remotely and reduce
    energy consumption. Smart home appliances, such as refrigerators, washing machines,
    and dishwashers, can be connected to home automation systems and controlled remotely.
    They can adjust their energy usage based on demand and provide feedback on energy
    consumption, enabling residents to manage their usage effectively. Smart plugs
    can control the power supply to appliances and devices that are not smart-enabled.
    They can be programmed to turn off automatically when not in use, reducing energy
    consumption. Smart water heaters utilize sensors and automation technology to
    adjust the temperature of the water based on demand. They can be controlled remotely
    and provide feedback on energy consumption and usage patterns, enabling residents
    to manage their usage effectively (Alzoubi, 2022; Asare-Bediako et al., 2012;
    Saad al-sumaiti et al., 2014). There are various methods available for integrating
    smart appliances into home automation systems, depending on the appliance and
    the automation system. These methods include Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity,
    Zigbee or Z-Wave protocols, IFTTT, and home automation hubs (Al-Qaseemi et al.,
    2016). Smart appliances that are equipped with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity can
    be connected to the home Wi-Fi network, enabling them to be controlled using smartphone
    apps or voice assistants (Jabbar et al., 2019). Some smart appliances use Bluetooth
    connectivity to communicate with other devices like smartphones or smart home
    hubs (ur Rehman & Gruhn, 2018). Zigbee or Z-Wave protocols are wireless communication
    protocols that are commonly used in smart home automation systems, and smart appliances
    that are compatible with these protocols can be connected to smart home hubs and
    controlled through the hub (Naidu & Kumar, 2019). IFTTT is a web-based service
    that allows users to create custom automation rules between different devices
    and services. Smart appliances that are compatible with IFTTT can be integrated
    into home automation systems and controlled based on specific triggers and actions
    (Coronado & Iglesias, 2015). Home automation hubs, such as Amazon Echo, Google
    Home, or Apple HomeKit, offer a centralized interface for controlling multiple
    smart appliances. Smart appliances that are compatible with these hubs can be
    connected to the hub and controlled using voice commands or smartphone apps (Kamdar
    et al., 2017). Smart appliances offer great convenience and flexibility as they
    can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. These apps enable users to
    manage and monitor their appliances from anywhere with an internet connection.
    For instance, a smart thermostat app allows users to adjust their home''s temperature
    remotely, ensuring a comfortable environment while saving energy. Similarly, a
    smart lighting app enables users to turn lights on and off from anywhere, even
    when not at home. Moreover, a smart dishwasher app allows users to start and stop
    their dishwasher remotely, allowing them to run it during off-peak electricity
    hours and save money on their energy bill. To control smart appliances using a
    smartphone app, users typically have to connect their appliances to a Wi-Fi network
    and download the manufacturer''s app. Once the app is installed, users can control
    their appliances using their smartphone, tablet, or any other mobile device. This
    feature provides ease of access and control to users, making their lives more
    convenient. While the ability to control smart appliances remotely using a smartphone
    app is a significant advantage, there are also some limitations to consider. One
    of these limitations is that the app''s functionality and the range of tasks it
    can perform may be restricted compared to the physical controls on the appliance
    itself. For instance, a smart oven may provide more temperature and cooking options
    on its physical control panel than on the app. Another limitation is that controlling
    smart appliances remotely requires a stable and dependable internet connection.
    If the internet connection is weak or lost, users may face difficulty controlling
    their appliances remotely. Moreover, if the app or the manufacturer''s server
    experiences technical issues, users may also encounter difficulties controlling
    their appliances. Furthermore, some users may have concerns about the security
    of their personal data and the privacy of their homes when using a smartphone
    app to control their smart appliances remotely. Hackers could potentially access
    the app and gain control of the appliances, leading to security concerns and privacy
    violations (Makhadmeh et al., 2019; Molla et al., 2019; Molla et al., 2018). 4.4.2.
    Reducing water consumption with smart home appliances and technologies Smart home
    appliances are useful not only for reducing energy consumption but also for reducing
    water consumption. By utilizing these appliances, homeowners can significantly
    reduce their water usage, contributing to a sustainable future. Among these, smart
    irrigation systems can reduce water usage in gardens and green spaces. These systems
    adopt soil moisture sensors to regulate watering schedules contingent on weather
    conditions and plant requirements. Similarly, smart toilets equipped with advanced
    technologies such as automatic washing and drying systems can minimize water usage
    by using only the necessary amount of water for cleaning. Smart washing machines
    are also equipped with water flow sensors that can precisely control the amount
    of water used, reducing water consumption as a result. Smart faucets can also
    help reduce water usage by using motion sensors to allow water flow only when
    needed and shutting off automatically when not in use. Smart showerheads equipped
    with sensors that detect shower occupancy and limit the amount of water used per
    shower also help to reduce water consumption. Additionally, smart leak detectors
    can prevent water waste by detecting leaks in pipes or appliances and alerting
    homeowners before the damage becomes severe. Smart irrigation controllers can
    detect leaks, and prevent water waste. Smart water meters can help homeowners
    track their water consumption and identify areas where water usage can be reduced.
    Smart pool systems also use sensors and automation to optimize pool water chemistry
    and detect leaks, minimizing water waste (Ishak et al., 2017; Nilsson et al.,
    2018; Passenberg et al., 2016; Veselinović et al., 2020; Waleed et al., 2018).
    In KNX protocol-enabled smart buildings, a smart water meter is installed after
    the main water pipe enters the subscriber''s premises. The smart water meter determines
    the required amount of water for each day and night based on water consumption
    patterns, considering the number of residents and other factors. If the building''s
    water consumption exceeds the predetermined amount, the smart water meter sends
    a message to the controllers to cut off the water flow and sends an alert message
    to the residents'' control panels or mobile phones. Following this alert, if the
    water flow is reconnected, the cost of water per liter progressively increases.
    To configure the KNX protocol, several equipment items are necessary, including
    a switch operator, two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve,
    two energy meters, and eight network infrastructures. Improper reuse, dripping,
    or leaks caused by corrosion and wear on washers in water valves lead to significant
    drinking water wastage in residential buildings. These issues are often prevalent
    in areas of the building where people are not always present, such as bathrooms
    and toilets. In smart buildings designed with the KNX protocol, presence detection
    sensors are installed in these areas to turn the water on and off based on the
    person''s presence. To implement a smart system that controls the water temperature
    in residential homes using the KNX protocol, specific equipment is required, including
    a switch operator, two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central
    control display for monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve,
    two human presence detection sensors, and eight network infrastructures. Around
    60 % of household drinking water is used for washing purposes, resulting in wastage
    of a portion of water to achieve the desired temperature in each wash (such as
    in bathrooms and kitchen sinks). Therefore, in a smart building, sensors can be
    installed at the outlet of water valves to determine the desired water temperature.
    The embedded system then adjusts the water temperature inside the pipes until
    it reaches the desired temperature and makes it available to the user. To implement
    a smart system that controls the water temperature in residential homes using
    the KNX protocol, specific equipment is required, including a switch operator,
    two power supplies, an internet connection module, a central control display for
    monitoring and entering initial information, an electric valve, two water temperature
    sensors, eight human presence detection sensors, and one network infrastructure
    (Bajer, 2018; Benavente-Peces, 2019; Koulamas et al., 2017). Fig. 7 shows the
    various smart home appliances and technologies that can optimize energy and water
    consumption in households. The figure is categorized into three sections: smart
    energy management systems, time-of-use pricing, and smart water management systems.
    The smart energy management systems category includes examples such as smart thermostats,
    lighting systems, and home appliances, which can be remotely controlled and adjusted
    based on energy demand and user preferences. Time-of-use pricing, demonstrated
    in the second category, incentivizes residents to reduce electricity consumption
    during peak demand periods when electricity prices are high, resulting in reduced
    electricity bills, stable electricity supply, and a smaller carbon footprint.
    The third category, smart water management systems, comprises smart toilets, washing
    machines, faucets, showerheads, leak detectors, irrigation controllers, water
    meters, and pool systems, which can significantly reduce water usage. In general,
    the utilization of smart home appliances and technologies empowers homeowners
    to effectively manage their energy and water usage, thereby making a valuable
    contribution towards a more sustainable future. Extensive research reveals that
    the implementation of smart home energy and water systems, as depicted, facilitates
    substantial resource savings and conservation while offering residents flexibility
    and convenience. When combined with sustainable building practices, these technologies
    assume a critical role in promoting sustainable housing and achieving cities''
    efficiency objectives. Download : Download high-res image (832KB) Download : Download

    and water resource management. 5. Conclusion This study employed a descriptive-analytical
    research methodology to investigate the integration of urban natural resources
    and smart city technologies for sustainable development. Through a systematic
    review and analysis of literature, the study aimed to explore the concept of smart
    cities and identify key elements related to the integration of green spaces and
    smart technologies in cities. The findings of this study indicate that green spaces
    play a significant role in promoting sustainability in smart cities. The incorporation
    of green spaces, such as converting them into renewable energy sources, using
    them as natural filters to improve air and water quality, and designing them as
    public spaces, can facilitate environmental, social, and economic development
    in smart cities. However, effectively utilizing green spaces requires the implementation
    of smart technologies, such as sensors, to collect and analyze data on factors
    like air pollution, temperature, and irrigation levels. This data can provide
    insights to improve the planning and management of green spaces in a sustainable
    manner. While the implementation of green space data analysis offers several benefits,
    such as improved air quality, water conservation, urban planning, and public health,
    it also faces challenges related to cost, data reliability, privacy, and expertise.
    Strategies, such as public-private partnerships, community engagement, and allocating
    funding and resources, can help address these challenges. Comparative analysis
    further revealed that cities in the West and East employ green space data analysis,
    but they differ in their approaches and motivations. The focus in the West has
    been primarily on environmental and social benefits, whereas in the East, the
    emphasis has been more on urban planning and development. The study also demonstrates
    that smart cities can use various technologies and policies to address environmental
    challenges, such as air pollution in low-income and disadvantaged communities.
    Deploying air quality sensors, implementing green infrastructure, transit-oriented
    development, low-emission zones, clean energy incentives, and community outreach
    campaigns have been effective in improving air quality and public health in these
    communities. However, the effectiveness of these interventions depends on factors
    such as policy design, community engagement, available resources, and infrastructure.
    Smart cities are utilizing advanced technologies and strategies to effectively
    manage electricity resources and build more sustainable energy systems. Smart
    grid systems allow cities to optimize the flow of electricity in real-time, resulting
    in improved efficiency and reliability. Integrating renewable energy sources such
    as solar and wind power into the grid promotes sustainability by reducing reliance
    on fossil fuels and emissions. Energy-efficient building designs and demand response
    programs help to lower overall electricity demand and costs. Investing in electric
    vehicle charging infrastructure and energy storage systems provides more options
    for balancing supply and demand. Microgrids increase resilience by providing backup
    power. Furthermore, data analytics tools enable targeted programs aimed at reducing
    waste and predicting infrastructure needs. Despite the numerous benefits, challenges
    such as high costs, interoperability, and data privacy must be addressed to ensure
    the feasibility and success of these technologies. A comprehensive, collaborative
    approach that promotes public understanding and policy reform can further progress
    in this area. The future of urban living depends on adaptable, renewable energy
    systems and efficient resource use. With global populations centralized in cities,
    their infrastructure and policies will shape sustainability on a broad scale.
    Technological and social innovation must converge to develop pragmatic solutions
    for managing electricity in cities. Transitioning from outdated systems requires
    long-term vision and investments that yield returns through environmental and
    financial security. Though a complex undertaking, reimagining how we power our
    shared spaces paves the way for greater wellbeing, connectivity, and prosperity.
    With smart designs and stronger communities, cities can lead in fostering a cleaner,
    brighter future for generations to come. Several key conclusions can be drawn
    regarding smart city solutions for sustainable urban water management. Smart irrigation
    systems that utilize soil moisture sensors and weather data can optimize water
    usage for urban green spaces and reduce waste. By linking the sensors to a central
    control system, irrigation can be tailored to the specific needs of the plants
    and delayed during times when rain is forecast. This precision approach can improve
    irrigation efficiency and reduce excess water usage, which can range from 50 to
    70 % to up to 95 %. Smart water distribution systems equipped with meters, sensors,
    and variable pressure pumps can significantly curb water loss from leakage. Installing
    meters at network nodes and linking them to a control center allows for the continuous
    monitoring of water flow, enabling the rapid detection of anomalous losses. Reducing
    pressure during low-demand periods can also mitigate leakage from worn infrastructure.
    Such systems have been shown to achieve water savings of up to 11 % when implemented
    at a city scale. Demand management initiatives, such as tiered pricing and education
    programs, can encourage conservation among water users. Dynamic pricing that increases
    rates for higher levels of consumption has been demonstrated to motivate people
    to use less water. Education programs that provide information about water issues
    and offer tips for reducing usage can also help foster a culture of sustainability.
    Smart cities aim to utilize advanced technologies to enhance sustainability and
    improve the quality of life. However, it is important to consider the potential
    positive and negative impacts of these technologies on the environment. While
    smart technologies can optimize energy usage, enhance water conservation, improve
    waste management, and promote the use of green infrastructure and sustainable
    transportation, their production and disposal can also generate electronic waste
    that requires careful management to avoid environmental harm. Additionally, the
    installation of smart infrastructure requires land and resources, which must be
    used responsibly. Despite these challenges, the benefits of smart cities can far
    outweigh their costs when proper safeguards and policymaking are in place. This
    section highlights several key conclusions regarding the role of smart technologies
    in urban sustainability. Smart energy systems that utilize renewable sources and
    optimize usage can substantially decrease greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.
    Precision technologies for water distribution and irrigation can curb excess water
    usage and loss, mitigating scarcity even as populations grow. Advanced waste collection
    and sorting techniques enabled by sensors and AI can minimize waste generation,
    increase recycling, and reduce the impact of waste disposal on the environment.
    Blockchain technology, in particular, shows promise for transparent and efficient
    waste management. Smart transportation and infrastructure can reduce vehicle usage,
    promote walking and cycling, and foster the development of green spaces, with
    benefits for both the environment and public health. By prioritizing minimal environmental
    impact through sustainable solutions and policies, smart cities can leverage technology
    to conserve natural resources rather than exploit them. The integration of smart
    home technologies offers promising solutions for optimizing resource management
    and reducing environmental impacts in housing. Through the use of smart appliances,
    home automation systems, and sustainable building practices, residents can significantly
    reduce their energy and water consumption. Smart thermostats, lighting systems,
    leak detectors, and time-of-use pricing systems enable convenient and efficient
    monitoring of resource usage, incentivizing more sustainable behaviors. Despite
    limitations related to technology access and electronic waste, communities stand
    to benefit both environmentally and economically by transitioning to smart and
    eco-friendly homes. Smart city systems can leverage data on resource demands to
    develop targeted programs for residential efficiency and infrastructure improvements.
    Given the concentration of global populations in cities, sustainable housing is
    a crucial component of the broader movement toward secure and livable urban spaces.
    However, further research is needed to assess the long-term impacts, ensure equitable
    access, and streamline the complex processes of upgrading conventional homes or
    developing new smart communities. The main findings and contributions of this
    study encompass the positive role of green spaces in promoting sustainability
    through their utilization as renewable energy sources, natural filtration systems,
    and public gathering spaces. Additionally, the study underscores the importance
    of incorporating smart technologies, such as sensors, to effectively gather and
    analyze data for enhanced planning and management of green spaces. While the utilization
    of data analysis in green space management offers numerous advantages, it is crucial
    to address associated challenges through strategies like public-private partnerships
    and community involvement. By conducting a comparative analysis of Western and
    Eastern cities, the research uncovers distinct motivations behind green space
    data analysis, with a focus on environmental and social benefits in Western cities,
    and urban planning benefits in Eastern cities. Furthermore, the study highlights
    the potential of technologies and policies to address environmental justice concerns
    in disadvantaged communities. Notably, the research evaluates various technologies
    and strategies for optimizing electricity resources, conserving water, and managing
    waste with the goal of promoting urban sustainability. Therefore, the integration
    of smart technologies and sustainable practices in homes and cities demonstrates
    the potential for technology and social innovation to converge in pragmatic solutions
    that yield wellbeing through efficiency, cost savings, and reduced environmental
    harm. By embracing green designs and practices, communities can lead the way in
    building a cleaner and brighter future for generations to come. Declaration of

    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:

    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    and environmental applications. 7. Conclusions This paper presented an updated
    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

    \ Greenhouse cultivation has evolved from simple covered rows of open-fields crops\
    \ to highly sophisticated controlled \nenvironment agriculture (CEA) facilities\
    \ that projected the image of plant factories for urban agriculture.  The advances\
    \ and \nimprovements in CEA have promoted the scientific solutions for the efficient\
    \ production of plants in populated cities and \nmulti-story buildings.  Successful\
    \ deployment of CEA for urban agriculture requires many components and subsystems,\
    \ as \nwell as the understanding of the external influencing factors that should\
    \ be systematically considered and integrated.  This \nreview is an attempt to\
    \ highlight some of the most recent advances in greenhouse technology and CEA\
    \ in order to raise the \nawareness for technology transfer and adaptation, which\
    \ is necessary for a successful transition to urban agriculture.  This \nstudy\
    \ reviewed several aspects of a high-tech CEA system including improvements in\
    \ the frame and covering materials, \nenvironment perception and data sharing,\
    \ and advanced microclimate control and energy optimization models.  This research\
    \ \nhighlighted urban agriculture and its derivatives, including vertical farming,\
    \ rooftop greenhouses and plant factories which are \nthe extensions of CEA and\
    \ have emerged as a response to the growing population, environmental degradation,\
    \ and urbanization \nthat are threatening food security.  Finally, several opportunities\
    \ and challenges have been identified in implementing the \nintegrated CEA and\
    \ vertical farming for urban agriculture. \nKeywords: smart agriculture, greenhouse\

    \ \ntransition driven by the advances in precision technology, data \nprocessing\
    \ and smart farming.  Protected cultivations have \nchanged from simple covered\
    \ greenhouse structures to high-tech \nplant factories that optimize the productivity\
    \ of the plants and \nhuman labour.  A modern greenhouse operates as a system,\
    \ \ntherefore, it is also referred to as controlled environment agriculture \n\
    (CEA), controlled environment plant production system (CEPPS), \nor Phytomation\
    \ systems[1].  These structures use natural or \nartificial light within which\
    \ optimum growth conditions is intended \nto achieve for producing horticultural\
    \ crops, or for plant research \nprograms.  They also offer greater predictability,\
    \ reduce the cost \nof production and increase crop yields.  A comprehensive history\
    \ \nof greenhouses in the past three decades can be found in the works \nof [2-6].\
    \  Examples of earlier works in automation and computer \ncontrol of greenhouse\
    \ environment are showed in [7-9].  Previous \nstudies on greenhouse engineering\
    \ during the 1990s have been \nreviewed by Hanan[10] and Critten and Bailey[11].\
    \ \nThe United Nations has predicted that by 2050, more than \ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ nine billion world population will live in the cities.  \nSecuring the supply\

    \ and plant \nfactories can significantly contribute to this context for the \n\
    year-round production of fresh vegetables in urban areas.  For \nsuch a system\
    \ to operate successfully and achieve its production \nobjectives, attention needs\
    \ to be paid to the technical aspects of \nautomation (A), culture (C), environment\
    \ (E) and system (SYS).  \nTing et al.[1] defined ACESYS terms as follow: Automation\
    \ is the \nprocessing of information and execution of tasks for operation of \n\
    CEA through computerized instrumentations and various control \nalgorithms that\
    \ might include decision support programs and \nartificial intelligence.  The\
    \ cultural and environmental factors \ncomprise \ncultivation \ntechniques, \n\
    plants \ncharacteristics, \nmicroclimate requirements and growth responses.  It\
    \ also contains \nmorphological and physiological conditions such as “multiplication,\
    \ \nrooting, transplanting, pruning, water and nutrient delivery, \npesticide\
    \ application, harvesting, post-harvest processing, etc”.  \nTing et al.[1] stated\
    \ that “Systems analysis and integration is a \nmethodology that starts with the\
    \ definition of a system and its goals, \nand leads to the conclusion regarding\
    \ the system’s workability, \nproductivity, reliability, and other performance\
    \ indicators.” \nResearch trends in this field are toward innovative methods for\
    \ \nshifting from conventional greenhouses to smart controlled \nenvironments\
    \ that benefit from natural resources for eliminating \ndeleterious external conditions.\
    \  The ultimate objective in this \nregard would be achieving high yield and high-quality\
    \ fruits at \nminimum possible cost. \nInnovations in the low-cost and low-power\
    \ consumption \nsensors and instrumentations, communication devices, data \nprocessing\
    \ and mobile applications, along with the technological \nadvances in the design\
    \ structures, simulation models, and \nhorticultural engineering have provided\
    \ the state-of-the-art \nfacilities that are shifting the traditional CEA to plant\
    \ factories for \nurban farming.  This paper begins with a summary of several\
    \ \nreviewed literature in Section 2 on the advances in greenhouse \ncovering\
    \ materials, artificial light, and the efficiency of the \nmicroclimate controller\
    \ for a viable CEA system.  This part aimed \nto investigate the effects of the\
    \ existing and new covering materials \non the resulting microclimate (including\
    \ influencing factors and \ntheir interactions with cultural practices), plants\
    \ growth, and yield.  \nModeling of CEA, as well as object-oriented automation-culture-\
    \ \nenvironment system analysis that is presented in the works of Ting \net al.[1]\
    \ provide a systematic approach for a better understanding of \nthese influencing\
    \ factors.  These findings and their implications in \na modern CAE such as plant\
    \ factories and agri-cubes are further \ndiscussed in Section 5.  After that,\
    \ environmental monitoring and \nperception by means of wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSN) and \ninternet of things-based (IoT-based) platforms have been \ndemonstrated\
    \ and reviewed as an essential part of an automation \nsystem.  In our opinion,\
    \ the three biggest challenges for the \ndevelopment of an efficient and viable\
    \ CEA system are the creation \nof automation levels for energy management, reduction\
    \ of \nenvironmental impact, and maximizing use of natural resources.  \nA comprehensive\
    \ review of the advances in environmental control \nmethods, energy optimization\
    \ models, prediction tools, and \ndecision support systems are provided in Section\
    \ 4.  Specifically, \nthe applications of different high-level algorithms for\
    \ the most \nefficient microclimate control solutions are highlighted in Section\
    \ \n4.1.  These control methods and automation phases have been \nreviewed to\
    \ illustrate how each part can facilitate achieving the \noverall objectives of\
    \ a CEA.  A summary of some of the research \nworks in the past decade on energy\
    \ analysis, artificial intelligence, \nand simulation models with applications\
    \ in different aspects of \ngreenhouse production are presented in Sections 4.2\
    \ and 4.3.  A \nsubstantial amount of research has been done on individual aspects\
    \ \nof automation, culture, and environment, as well as their \ncombination, however\
    \ improvements of CEA also require decision \nsupport systems (DSS) and assessment\
    \ tools for long-term risk \nmanagement by accurately determining the interactions\
    \ between \nclimate parameters and growth responses prior to the actual \ncultivation[12].\
    \  To identify technological pathways for energy \nefficient CEA, a survey was\
    \ performed in Section 4.4 to highlight \nsome of the improved solutions based\
    \ on decision support systems \nfor energy management strategies in the commercial\
    \ greenhouses.  \nIn Section 5, the research covered urban agriculture and the\
    \ \ndevelopment of plant factories and vertical farming which is \ngrowing rapidly\
    \ in the East and Southeast Asia, most noticeably in \nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan\
    \ Province of China, and Malaysia, and \nreviewed several conceptual designs such\
    \ as the rooftop \ngreenhouses to highlight how various research and educational\
    \ \ninstitutes, real estate developers, and construction companies are \ninvolved\
    \ in the emerged opportunities.   \n2  Considerations for viability \nSeveral\
    \ factors to be considered in designing of a viable \ngreenhouse system for producing\
    \ year-round crops and \nvegetables are the structure frame, landscape, topography,\
    \ soil, \nclimate conditions, microclimate control system, light condition, \n\
    intercepted solar radiation, windbreaks, the availability of \nelectricity, roadways,\
    \ and labor force.  Other conditions that \nshould also be taken into account\
    \ for an efficient large-scale \ncommercial greenhouse production[13,14] are the\
    \ environment, \neconomic and social factors.  For example, a modern greenhouse\
    \ \nstructure might be constructed within a commercial building or \nnear commercial\
    \ or residential lands.  Some of the most popular \ngreenhouse structures and\
    \ CEA are presented in Figure 1. There \nare numerous experimental and analytical\
    \ research works that \naddress how environmental parameters inside a greenhouse\
    \ is \naffected by the structural design and shape, volume size, \ndimensions,\
    \ plants density, covering films, structure material, \nwind speed, geographical\
    \ orientation, and most importantly the \nmicroclimate control system.  For example,\
    \ in regions where \nsolar radiation or ambient air temperatures are high, several\
    \ \ndesign factors for optimum air exchange such as the ratio of the \narea of\
    \ the vent openings to the ground area covered by the \ngreenhouse, the ratio\
    \ of the greenhouse volume to the floor area, \nand the vertical distance between\
    \ the air inlets and air outlets can \nsignificantly improve the ventilation performance.\
    \  Optimization \nof vent configuration by evaluating greenhouse and plant canopy\
    \ \nventilation rates under wind-induced ventilation has been studied \nby Kacira\
    \ et al.[15].  This section provides a summary of the \nresearch works that have\
    \ addressed improvements in covering \nmaterials, and microclimate control systems.\
    \  To avoid \noverlapping of the contexts and maintain a consistent flow of the\
    \ \ntopics, we have covered the advances in structure design (i.e., \nrooftop\
    \ greenhouses) as a separate subsection under urban \nagriculture. \nJanuary,\

    \ \n \n2.1  Covering materials \nConsiderations for greenhouses covering materials\
    \ involve \nsupporting foundation, shape and framing materials, geographical \n\
    direction for optimal light entrance, the load of equipment, factors \nfor static\
    \ and dynamic loads (i.e., hanging plants, structure weight, \nand wind speed),\
    \ dimension ratio, and volume.  Greenhouses \nstructures and covering can take\
    \ different forms which can be used \nto surround the whole or a section of the\
    \ cultivation area and space.  \nThe most dominant transparent materials in use\
    \ are 2-3 mm glass \npanels, net-screen film, and  0.1 mm and 0.2 mm Polyethylene\
    \ \n(PE) plastic films, and ultraviolet (UV) stabilized PE-films.  \nBaudoin et\
    \ al.[16] recommended that in order to obtain a reasonable \nheat rise of less\
    \ than 4°C in a glass-clad greenhouse, the airflow \nrate should be 0.04-0.05\
    \ m3/s of floor area (1 m2).  Selection of \ncovering material for a greenhouse\
    \ depends on its application, the \ntype of crop to be cultivated, and the climate\
    \ condition of the \nregion.  It can vary from simple covers such as one layer\
    \ plastic[17,18], \ndouble-wall plastic[19,20], and glass[21,22], to fiberglass[23,24],\
    \ \ndouble-wall plastic, acrylic sheet[25], polyethylene film[26-29], \npolyvinyl\
    \ \nchloride \n(PVC)[30], \ncopolymers[31], \nPolycarbonate \npanels[32], and\
    \ selective transmission medium[33,34] for different \nspectral frequencies. \
    \ Some of these materials are designed to trap \nenergy inside the greenhouse\
    \ and heats both plants zone and its \nsurroundings.  Detailed properties of these\
    \ covering, as well as the \nquality assessments of their mechanical properties,\
    \ have been \naddressed in detail by a study on the effects of cover diffusive\
    \ \nproperties on the components of greenhouse solar radiation[34]. \nCondensation,\
    \ radiation transmittance and diffusing properties \nof different types of transmitting\
    \ covering materials in greenhouses \nhave been discussed by Pollet et al.[35].\
    \  Glazing materials allow \nshorter-wavelength radiation (i.e. visible light)\
    \ to pass through, but \nlong wavelength radiation such as infrared (heat) is\
    \ trapped inside \nthe greenhouse.  A comparison between different greenhouse\
    \ \ncovering materials, including polyethylene film, photo-selective red \ncolor\
    \ film, and insect-proof net for tomato cultivation during \nsummer is available\
    \ in the works of Arcidiacono et al.[36] and \nHemming et al.[37] Jarquín-Enríquez\
    \ et al.[38] studied the effects of \ndouble layer plastic and flat glass cover\
    \ on the lycopene \naccumulation and color index during tomato fruit ripening.\
    \  They \nconcluded that lycopene biosynthesis in tomato fruits was increased\
    \ \nby the amount of light after the beginning of ripening growth stage.  \nStudying\
    \ the effect of greenhouse covering materials on the inside \nair temperature\
    \ under tropical climate condition showed that while \noutside temperature was\
    \ between 28°C-33°C, the temperature \ninside \na \npolyethylene \nfilm \ncovered\
    \ \ngreenhouse \nwithout \nenvironment control reached 68°C-70°C, leading to air\
    \ vapor \npressure deficit (VPD) of 4 kPa[39].  Al-Mahdouri et al.[40] \nevaluated\
    \ optical properties and thermal performances of different \ngreenhouse covering\
    \ materials.  The combinations of external \nclimate conditions and type of greenhouse\
    \ for the most appropriate \napplication have been studied by Kempkes et al.[41]\
    \ A computer \napplication to measure geometric characterization and dimensions\
    \ \nof insect-proof screens was designed by Álvarez et al.[42].  \nPolythene-clad\
    \ greenhouses do not become as hot because of the \ntransparency of the plastic\
    \ to long-wave radiation that is \ntransmitted back out of the greenhouse.  Therefore,\
    \ for a \npolythene-film covered greenhouse, the ventilation rate can be \nreduced\
    \ to 0.03-0.04 m3/s of floor area (1 m2)[43].  With \ngreenhouse shading, the\
    \ amount of solar radiation and light \nintensity reaching the plants is restricted,\
    \ creating a closed \ndifference between air temperature inside and outside the\
    \ \ngreenhouse.  Shading also decreases leaf surface temperature \nsignificantly.\
    \  According to Glenn et al.[44], while a 20% to 80% \nlight reduction can be\
    \ expected depending on the shading materials, \nthe sufficient light reduction\
    \ for most greenhouse applications is \nbetween 30% and 50%.  Hassanien and Li[45]\
    \ investigated the \nmicroclimate parameters and growth responses of lettuce plants\
    \ \ninside a greenhouse that was shaded with semi-transparent \nmono-crystalline\
    \ silicon double glazing photovoltaic panels \n(STPV).  The STPV panels of their\
    \ study accounted for 20% of \nthe greenhouse roof area, and showed that the combination\
    \ of \nSTPV and polyethylene cover decreased the solar radiation by 35% \nto 40%\
    \ compared to the use of polyethylene cover.  They also \nshowed that the STPV\
    \ shading decreased the air temperature by \n4   January, 2018               \

    \ effect on the relative \nhumidity, fresh weight, leaf area and the chlorophyll\
    \ contents under \nnatural ventilation. \nProtected cultivation of Solanaceous\
    \ crops such as tomatoes \nand peppers by means of Screen-houses operating on\
    \ natural \nventilation is now a commonly practiced in tropical lowlands for \n\
    reducing insect migration, the risk of damage by high rainfall, \nextreme solar\
    \ radiation, and high wind speeds.  In addition, by \nusing insect-proof net covered\
    \ greenhouse, the inside and outside \ntemperature may remain similar, while temperature\
    \ has been \nobserved to be rising with the photo-selective film during summer.\
    \  \nStudies showed that net-screen greenhouses have gained more \npopularity\
    \ in tropical regions due to the potential of climate \nparameters that have optimality\
    \ degrees close to the plants desired \nlevels.  Shamshiri[46] observed that under\
    \ an insect-proof \nnet-screen covered greenhouse operating on natural ventilation,\
    \ the \ninside and outside air temperature remained close to each other, \nwhile\
    \ the air temperature was found to increase inside two \nphoto-selective film\
    \ covered greenhouses (polycarbonate panel and \na polyethylene covered) operating\
    \ on evaporative cooling[39].  \nShading nets ease the natural ventilation process\
    \ and can protect \nplants from excessive sunlight, wind, and heavy rains.  Lorenzo\
    \ et \nal.[47] reported that movable shade under intense sunlight in Spain \n\
    caused 10% increase in the marketable yield of greenhouse tomato.  \nOther reports\
    \ indicated that external and internal shading nets \nreduced horizontal and vertical\
    \ gradients in air temperature \ncompared with those without shading nets[48].\
    \  Results of a study \non the effect of roof height of a large screen-house on\
    \ the \nventilation rate using one-dimensional computational model and \npreliminary\
    \ measurements showed that increasing roof height by 2 \nm increases both temperature\
    \ and humidity levels in the canopy \nlayer[49].  Microclimate, air velocity,\
    \ ventilation efficiency, and \nlight transmittance are mainly influenced by the\
    \ properties of the \nnet-screen mesh and the greenhouse shape.  While these structures\
    \ \nenhance natural ventilation in hot and humid climate conditions, \nthey still\
    \ require strong shelters for protecting plants from extreme \nsolar radiation,\
    \ rain, and strong winds.  The screen-house itself is \nan important pest protection\
    \ device, provided it is equipped with \nfine mesh screens in all openings, and\
    \ a double-door system. \n2.2  Light control and artificial lights \nThe main\
    \ approaches for controlling light level and the \nintercepted radiance in CEA\
    \ are through planted density, shading \nscreens, and artificial lights.  Light\
    \ condition and air temperature \nare the two most important environmental factors\
    \ for plants growth.  \nIn fact, discussions about optimal air temperature without\
    \ including \nlight condition and plant evapotranspiration does not generate any\
    \ \nuseful data for maximizing yield and producing high-quality \nvegetable. \
    \ Light and air temperature are intrinsically related and \nit is a well-known\
    \ fact that one cannot be optimized without \nconsidering the other.  For example,\
    \ tomato quality, including \nyield, productivity and lycopene value is not only\
    \ affected by the \nmicroclimate parameters and cultural experience, but with\
    \ the \nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).  In fact, it is the \noptimal\
    \ combination of air temperature, relative humidity, and light \nthat will result\
    \ in maximum yield (assuming that other factors such \nas CO2, soil pH, and nutrient\
    \ are not limiting).  A schematic \ndiagram is presented in Figure 2 to illustrate\
    \ the effects of light \nspectral, intensity and photoperiod on plant growth,\
    \ along with a \ncomparison between spectral power distribution of natural and\
    \ \nartificial light sources, and the plant’s response to irradiance level. \n\

    \ distribution of natural and artificial light sources and light response curve\
    \ of plants  \n \nThe most common artificial light sources that are used in \n\
    modern greenhouses and CEAs are incandescent/halogen lamps, \ndischarge lamps\
    \ (such as fluorescent light tubes, Metal Halide, \nand high-pressure sodium lamps),\
    \ and the Light-emitting diodes \n(LEDs).  Among these, LEDs have gained significant\
    \ popularity \nin the research and development communities due to their \nadvantages\
    \ such as cost efficiency, compact design, durability, \nlight quality, and low\
    \ thermal energy generation.  Research on \nLEDs as a substitute for plant growth\
    \ began in 1980s; however it \nwas only after mid-2000s that they became economically\
    \ feasible \nfor large scale commercial production.  These devices reduce \nthe\
    \ costs of electricity by using plant from effectual \nJanuary, 2018         \

    \ to directed light wavelengths.  \nMoreover, the compact design of LEDs that\
    \ located close to the \nplants, allows the structure of various layers of plant\
    \ production \nto stack vertically in CEA, while decreasing the costs of cooling\
    \ \ncompared with other artificial light sources.  Nowadays the \nfunctional costs\
    \ of LEDs are a high-priority study and advance \nsubject for upcoming greenhouse-based\
    \ plant factories.  In the \ncase of tomatoes, shading affects biosynthesis and\
    \ carotene level \nof lycopene.  According to the study of Cockshull et al.[50],\
    \ plant \nfactory yield will be reduced by 20% by utilizing a cover with \n23%\
    \ shade.  Yields also will be enriched with color shaded in \nplant factories\
    \ in hot weathers.  Yet, color shades can be \ndisadvantageous in areas with limited\
    \ sunlight hours in cloudy \nand cold climates.  In fact, choosing suitable planting\
    \ density \ncan increase crop water output and improve light capture.  On \nthe\
    \ other hand, the planting density has an effect on the harvest of \ntomato in\
    \ greenhouse growing system and evapotranspiration \n(ET)[51].  According to the\
    \ reports of several studies, factors \nsuch as numbers of flowering, fruits location\
    \ in per plant and \nsingle fruit weight were all lesser with more density of\
    \ planting, \ntherefore, resulting in lesser harvests[52-54].  In another study,\
    \ Ilić \net al.[55] showed that in the tomato factory, by using red shade \nnetting\
    \ techniques the lycopene content highly increased, \nhowever, these fruits had\
    \ minor carotene content.  Maximum \nproduction of tomato by percentages of covering\
    \ are described \nunder 40% by El-Aidy and El-Afry[56] and 35% by El-Gizawy et\
    \ \nal.[57] Moreover, El-Gizawy et al.[57] claimed that by increasing \ncovering\
    \ intensity, the production of tomato will increase up to \n51%.  The soil surface\
    \ will lose its moisture in plants faster by \nabsorbing the more radiant energy,\
    \ but, the high density of \ntomato plants caused less radiation at the soil surface[52].\
    \ \n2.3  Efficiency of microclimate controller \nAn efficient greenhouse requires\
    \ environment control for air \nquality, disease reduction, pest control, and\
    \ nutrient and water \nuptake.  The inputs and outs of a greenhouse system are\
    \ shown \nschematically in Figure 3.  The quality of air is governed by \nfactors\
    \ such as air and root-zone temperature, humidity, carbon \ndioxide, air movement,\
    \ dust, odors and disease agents.  Other \nvariables in the greenhouse environment\
    \ that affect plant’s life are \nlight condition, soil feeding solution pH and\
    \ electrical conductivity.  \nThese parameters and the problems associated with\
    \ each have been \nextensively discussed by several textbooks, see for example\
    \ \nHochmuth and Hochmuth[58], Cherie[59] and Jones[60].  Plant \ngrowth responses\
    \ to other influencing factors and climate changes \nsuch as carbon dioxide and\
    \ wind speed have been discussed in the \ntextbook of Morison and Morecroft[61].\
    \  In general, microclimate \nparameters in a CEA are manipulated by passive and\
    \ active \nventilation, \nevaporative \ncooling \ntechniques, \nshadings, \nand\
    \ \nrefrigeration dehumidification.  Several methods based on the \nFans Assessment\
    \ Numeration System (FANS) for evaluation of the \nventilation performance and\
    \ suggestions for the energy efficiency \nof greenhouse fans are presented in\
    \ [62].  It should be noted that \nthe high operating costs of air-conditioners\
    \ make them impractical \nfor commercial application. \n \nFigure 3  Inputs and\
    \ outputs of controlled environment agriculture \n \nThe efficiency of active\
    \ systems, i.e., fan and pad evaporative \ncooling, has been widely studied and\
    \ modeled for modular \ngreenhouses that use mechanical ventilation[63,64], but\
    \ research \nworks on their use alongside natural ventilation in greenhouses in\
    \ \nsemiarid climates are narrow[65].  Reports showed that when \nventilation\
    \ fan belts were adjusted to the proper tension, the fan \nspeed and airflow rate\
    \ were respectively 13.1% and 30.1% higher \nthan those of original belts[62].\
    \  The same study also reports that \nthe daily average energy consumption for\
    \ the ventilation fan with \nthe original loose belts was 20.4% higher than that\
    \ with the \nadjusted belts when the pad was not working, and 24.2% higher \n\
    with pad working.  There are theoretical and experimental studies \nwhich compare\
    \ the effects of fogging and fixed shading systems on \nthe Mediterranean greenhouse\
    \ climate[66]; however, the assessment \nof mobile shading is not well documented.\
    \  In order to determine \nthe size of fans and pads for evaporative cooling,\
    \ the volume of the \ngreenhouse needs to be calculated.  An air exchange (m3/min)\
    \ of 1 \nto 1.5 times of the greenhouse volume is recommended every \nminute[16].\
    \  The number of fans should be selected based on the air \nexchange and by taking\
    \ into account that their placement should \nnot be spaced more than 7.6 m apart.\
    \  According to Duan et al.[67], \na properly operated typical swamp cooler has\
    \ the potential to cool \nair within 3°C to 4°C of the wet-bulb temperature. \
    \ These units \ncost less than air-conditioner and consume 60% to 80% less \n\
    electricity; however, they are only practical for small greenhouses \nin hot dry\
    \ regions.  Another form of evaporative cooling is \nmisting which reduces plant\
    \ moisture loss and leaf transpiration by \nreducing its temperature due to evaporative\
    \ cooling.  Misting is \n6   January, 2018                         Int J Agric\

    \ as \nfog-cooling).  In fog-cooling systems, high-pressure water is \npassed\
    \ through nozzles with orifice sizes usually less than 10 μm.  \nA fan then blows\
    \ the extremely small droplets of water into \ngreenhouse air and reduces temperature\
    \ through an evaporative \nprocess.  These systems are usually used in greenhouse\
    \ cooling \nfor seed germination and propagation.  A major drawback of this \n\
    method is that it creates high humidity climate inside canopies \nwhich facilitates\
    \ the development of bacterial diseases, such as \nalgae and botrytis.  Several\
    \ recommendations for obtaining \nbetter cooling results with misting are available\
    \ in the work of \nSchnelle and Dole[68].  Low and high-pressure fogging systems\
    \ \nin a naturally ventilated greenhouse have been studied and \ncompared by Li\
    \ and Willits[69], suggesting that compared to the \nlow-pressure fogging system,\
    \ the average evaporation efficiency \nfor the high-pressure system was at least\

    \ in the ASABE standards[71].  Here, Tout \nis the outdoor air temperature, °C;\
    \ Tcool is the temperature of air \nexiting the cooling pad, °C, and Twb is the\
    \ wet-bulb temperature \nof the outside air, °C. \nMeasurement and data analysis\
    \ for greenhouse evaporative \ncooling are discussed in the work of Kittas et\
    \ al.[72] A decrease in \nair temperature by 4°C to 5°C inside a greenhouse with\
    \ \npad-and-fan evaporative cooling is reported by Jain and Tiwari[73].  \nPerformance\
    \ of a two-stage pad cooling system in broiler houses \nwas analyzed by Petek\
    \ et al.[74] showing that the resulting air \ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ were significantly lower than \nthose of the traditional system.  A thermal\
    \ model for prediction of \nmicroclimate factors inside a greenhouse with mechanical\
    \ \nventilation and the evaporative cooling system was introduced by \nWillits[75].\
    \  Their results suggested that in the presence of \nevaporative cooling, increasing\
    \ canopy size is more influential in \nreducing air temperature.  They also concluded\
    \ that without \nevaporative cooling pads, the ratio of energy used for transpiration\
    \ \nto incoming solar energy (known as the evapotranspiration \ncoefficient) is\
    \ predicted to range from 1-75 for an outdoor air \ntemperature of 36.8°C and\
    \ a humidity ratios of 3.3 g/kg, to 0.8°C \nfor an outdoor humidity ratio of 29.9\
    \ g/kg at the same air \ntemperature.  In another study, Max et al.[76] investigated\
    \ the \neffects of greenhouse cooling methods, including mechanical \nventilation\
    \ and evaporative cooling, on yield and quality of tomato \nin tropical climates.\
    \  It was found that the proportion of \nmarketable yield was significantly higher\
    \ in a net-screen covered \ngreenhouse with mechanical ventilation, and the quantity\
    \ of \nundersized and blossom-end rot affected fruits was reduced in \npolyethylene\
    \ film covered greenhouse with the evaporative cooling \nmethod.  The researchers\
    \ then concluded that in regions with high \nrelative humidity, evaporative cooling\
    \ without customized \nadjustments for dehumidification will not improve closed-field\
    \ \nproduction of tomato. \nPassive cooling methods, including natural ventilation\
    \ and \nshading, are widely practiced in greenhouses, especially those in \ntropical\
    \ regions, by means of non-adjustable, manually adjustable, \nor automatically\
    \ controlled.  Natural ventilation is caused by the \nstack effect, wind ventilation,\
    \ or both.  Ventilation for air \ntemperature control is efficient only when outside\
    \ air temperature \nof the greenhouse is less than inside.  Some of the factors\
    \ to be \ntaken into account for designing of a proper naturally ventilated \n\
    greenhouse are the location of the structure, insulation, ceiling \nslope and\
    \ ventilation openings.  Various references have \nconcluded that using natural\
    \ ventilation, it is more difficult to \nuniformly distribute fresh air in wider\
    \ greenhouse structures[77,78].  \nA comprehensive review of ventilation systems\
    \ is available in the \nworks of Ganguly and Ghosh[79].  The air inlet and outlet\
    \ size for \nnatural ventilation are determined based on stack effect theory as\
    \ \nexpressed by the Equation (1).   The steady-state heat balance for \ndetermination\
    \ of maximum ventilation rate requires heat gains to \nbe equal to heat losses\
    \ and is given by Equation (2).  This \nequation is used to determine: (i) the\
    \ required ventilation rate to \nmaintain a given inside temperature for a given\
    \ heater capacity; (ii) \nthe minimum outside temperature (balance temperature)\
    \ to \nmaintain the desired inside temperature without using supplemental \nheat\
    \ (qh=0) at a given ventilation rate; and (iii) the size of heater \nrequired\
    \ to maintain the desired inside temperature for a given \nventilation rate and\

    \ data \ncollection architectures.  Various data acquisition platforms, either\

    \   7 \nmost popular greenhouse monitoring frameworks, the wireless \nsensor networks\
    \ (WSN), and the IoT based systems, which have \nredirected greenhouse measurement\
    \ concentration to a new level \nfor improving efficiency and viability. \n3.1\
    \  Wireless sensor networks \nResearch and development in greenhouses in the early\
    \ 2000s \nbegan to adopt wireless communication technology for monitoring, \n\
    sending early warning messages, and remote control using \nsimplified rules. \
    \ One of the earliest reports of WSN application in \ngreenhouse environment monitoring\
    \ can be found in the work of \nSerôdio \net \nal.[92] \n \nThe \ncompact \nsize,\
    \ \nreliability, \nand \ncost-effectiveness of WSN modules, as well as flexibility\
    \ for \ndeveloping custom applications besides easy installation, have \nmade\
    \ this technology gain attention and popularity for monitoring \nand control in\
    \ open-field[93,94] and in closed-field environment \nagriculture. \n \nSource:\
    \ www.AdaptiveAgroTech.com. \nFigure 4  General components and instrumentations\
    \ in a typical greenhouse environmental monitoring \n \nAn interesting application\
    \ of WSN in greenhouse includes CO2 \nmanagement[95] and multipoint measurements\
    \ of microclimate for \nmonitoring spatial gradients and three-dimensional changes\
    \ in \nparameters during the cultivation process[96].  For example, Ji et \nal.[97]\
    \ developed a WSN for precision control of CO2 fertilizer with \nan improved method\
    \ for prediction of tomato photosynthetic rate.  \nA computerized horticulture\
    \ data management system that is \naddressed in [92] was developed by implementing\
    \ WSN, controller \narea \nnetwork \n(CAN), \nand \nseveral \ninternet \nand \n\
    email \ncommunication tools, and was able to support distributed data \nmonitoring\
    \ and control inside the greenhouse environment.  \nMorais et al.[93] reported\
    \ the architecture of a WSN platform called \nMPWiNodeZ, a mesh-type array of\
    \ acquisition devices that was \ndesigned based on ZigBee multi-powered wireless\
    \ acquisition \ndevice for the purpose of remote sensing applications in precision\
    \ \nhorticulture.  A remarkable advantage of this platform is the \npower management\
    \ capability that allows the system to \ncontinuously operate in large coverage\
    \ areas where connection \nstability and power sources are a concern.  A simple\
    \ deterministic \nWSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and XMesh protocol for online \n\
    monitoring and control of air temperature and relative humidity \nwith several\
    \ sensors nodes that were placed inside the greenhouse \nin a uniform gridded\
    \ topology is presented in the work of Pahuja et \nal.[98]  The authors used a\
    \ network health analyzer and found that \nwhile the data reliability was 100%,\
    \ their network mean packet \nreliability was between 75%-100% due to the packet\
    \ losses.  This \nfailure can be related to the canopy coverage and sensors occluded\
    \ \nby the dense plantation which reduces the signal strength of the \nnodes.\
    \  This network was integrated into a multiple inputs and \nmultiple outputs fuzzy\
    \ logic based controller and an RS-485 \nactuator network to manipulate the greenhouse\
    \ vapor pressure \ndeficit.  Prima et al.[91] developed and evaluated a simple\
    \ and \nflexible remote environmental monitoring and control based on a \ncloud\
    \ platform.  They implemented a local-global management \nstrategy supporting\
    \ synchronization of online and offline system \nconfiguration, actuation, and\
    \ offline management to respond to the \nunstable network connection in the rural\
    \ area.  They tested the \nfunctionality of their system during a 10-day data\
    \ collection period \nfor automated monitoring of soil moisture content and fertigation\
    \ \ncontrol in tomato cultivation.  Their results showed that under \nunstable\
    \ network, the system only had 0.78% error, and provided \n99.2% in-range soil\
    \ moisture content measurement, which shows \nthe potential for long-term microclimate\
    \ monitoring application in \ngreenhouses.   \nAn important consideration in designing\
    \ of an efficient WSN \nfor the greenhouse is the number of nodes, their location,\
    \ distances \nbetween nodes, antenna and the operating frequency based on the\
    \ \ngreenhouse microclimate condition.  Studies showed that radio \nwave propagation\
    \ is strongly affected by the high greenhouse \nenvironment[99].  Several other\
    \ connectivity issues with WSN in \nthe greenhouse have been addressed in [100]\
    \ using connection \nmatrix to estimate the network connectivity in the disconnected\
    \ \nspots.  For this purpose, Chen et al.[100] established a remote \nmonitoring\
    \ \nsystem \nin \nan \nexperimental \ngreenhouse using \nZigBee-based WSN which\
    \ could monitor air temperature, humidity \nand light intensity as well as the\
    \ wireless link quality.  Their \nresults showed that by adding long-distance\
    \ backup routing nodes, \nnetwork connectivity can be guaranteed in the spots\
    \ having poor \n8   January, 2018                         Int J Agric & Biol Eng\

    \ \nReceived Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), for example, situations \nwith\
    \ low energy and RSSI value of less than 100 dBm.  Another \nZigBee WSN application\
    \ based on star and mesh network \narchitecture for monitoring air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and \nsoil moisture content inside the greenhouse is available\
    \ in the work \nof Zhou et al.[101] More recently, Azaza et al.[102] presented\
    \ a smart \ntype-2 fuzzy logic based control system to manage the greenhouse \n\
    microclimate with attention to the effectiveness, the energy use and \nthe production\
    \ costs.  They integrated an observer and smart \nautomation system into the control\
    \ process by using a wireless data \nmonitoring platform enabling a distance data\
    \ measurement.  Their \nmethod also provided a real-time data access and building\
    \ database \nthat can be used for future enhancement of the system accuracy and\
    \ \ndecisions making.  The efficiency of their proposed monitoring \nand control\
    \ system was validated through a comparative study by \nevaluating the energy\
    \ saving (22%), and the water use (33%). \n3.2  IoT-based monitoring \nThe traditional\
    \ data monitoring techniques in greenhouse \nfrequently suffer from lack of sharing\
    \ and availability, great \nlabor-intensity, low spatiotemporal resolution, a\
    \ lack of data \ncentralization, and organizational management in observing the\
    \ \nenvironmental aspects of a greenhouse.  The IoT offers an \nexcellent opportunity\
    \ not only in greenhouse environment \nmonitoring but as a method for non-destructive\
    \ quantification of \nphysiological factors of the cultivated plants to be shared\
    \ within a \nnetwork of other greenhouse producers.  The potential \ngreenhouse\
    \ applications of IoT cover a variety of scenarios.  \nGeneral components of a\

    \  General components of a greenhouse environmental monitoring based in wireless\
    \ sensor network and IoT concept \n \nThe main element in the IoT is the network,\
    \ which has made \npossible a breakthrough in data communication and sharing for\
    \ \ngreenhouse monitoring and control.  It contains several physical \nitems,\
    \ software, and sensors that are linked with wires or wirelessly \nthrough standard\
    \ communication protocols[103].  Both academic \nand industry sections have shown\
    \ interest in greenhouse \napplications of IoT[104].  In fact, IoT has been used\
    \ in many areas \nof researchers, such as: smart city[105], agriculture[106,107]\
    \ and \nhealthcare[108-110], and is changing the traditional farming \nobservation\
    \ approaches by quickly providing quantitative data with \neffective spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution.  For example, long-term past \ninformation collected by IoT applications\
    \ can be an offer to a local \ngreenhouse community to conduct combined pest and\
    \ disease \nmanagement agendas in order to stop spreading of the associated \n\
    damages.  These data can also improve cultural practices and \ndecision making\
    \ plans[107].  An application of this technology can \nbe found in the work of\
    \ Liao et al.[111] who developed an IoT \nmonitoring system to simultaneously\
    \ screen the growth condition \nof Phalaenopsis and the environmental features\
    \ of an orchid plant \nfactory.  For example, Peng et al.[112] showed that by\
    \ using a \nspectroscopic and spectrometer investigation can correctly provide\
    \ \nthe total of orchid chlorophyll.   \nMoreover, Lin and Hsu[113] applied a\
    \ chlorophyll fluorometer \nin their study.  The monitored the photosynthetic\
    \ status of \nPhalaenopsis under diverse lighting situations.  Although the \n\
    physiological analysis is often occupied manually, these \nexamination approaches\
    \ need tools with perfect accuracy to \nnondestructively \ndegree \nphysiological\
    \ \nfactors \nof \norchids.  \nFurthermore, because of the cost, farmers will\
    \ not use highly \nprecise tools to measure physiological factors of orchids.\
    \  With \nscalability and flexibility of IoT, growers can have an excellent \n\
    opportunity to meet such observing demands[109]. \n4  Environmental control and\
    \ energy optimization \nThis section reviews some of the recently published works\
    \ on \nthe advances in microclimate modeling and control, greenhouse \nenergy\
    \ analysis, predictions of yields and environmental \nparameters, optimization\
    \ models, and decision support systems \napplication for best cultivation practices.\
    \ \n4.1  Advances in microclimate control \nConventional microclimate control\
    \ algorithms are designed \nbased on a series of reference values known as set\
    \ points.  The \ncontroller then adjusts the outputs with implemented rules to\
    \ \nachieve stability by minimizing the error between references and \nthe inputs.\
    \  The control of the microclimate in a greenhouse is a \nhigh-level task because\
    \ of the number of involved variables that are \ncoupled and interrelated, making\
    \ a complex non-linear system.   \nSome of the earlier attempts to apply advanced\
    \ control \nJanuary, 2018           Shamshiri R R, et al.  Advances in greenhouse\
    \ automation and controlled environment agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1\
    \   9 \ntechniques for greenhouse environment can be found in the works \nof Caponetto\
    \ et al.[114], Pan et al.[115], Lin[116], Castañeda-Miranda et \nal.[117] and\
    \ Xu et al.[118] Recent advances in computer simulation \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ have worked their way into greenhouse \nenvironment modeling and predictions.\
    \  Identifications and \nmodellings of different parameters in greenhouses have\
    \ been topics \nof numerous research works that aimed at improving production\
    \ \nefficiency (i.e., higher yield and quality, maximum return) by \nevaluating\
    \ and adjusting microclimate parameters and modeling of \nmicrometeorology[119,120].\
    \  The level of approaches vary from \nsimple models and timer-based feedback\
    \ controls[121,122] to more \nadvanced solutions, such as model-free control strategy[123],\
    \ \nnonlinear control methods[124], adaptive control and adaptive \nmanagement\
    \ framework[120,125], robust[126], optimal control[127-132], \nenergy balance\
    \ models[133], and model-based predictive control[134].  \nAn important drawback\
    \ in utilizing advanced control methods in a \nCEA is the difficulty in developing\
    \ the dynamic model to simulate \nthe behavior of the variables.  Ultimately,\
    \ the goal of any of these \ncontrol systems is to minimize the input cost per\
    \ unit of production \nand to increase the return by achieving high yield and\
    \ quality. \nThe success of greenhouse systems analysis relies on the \neffective\
    \ use of information.  To meet these requirements, various \ncontrol strategies\
    \ based on complex algorithms of artificial \nintelligence have been discussed\
    \ in the literature.  For example, \nfuzzy systems have achieved significant results\
    \ in the area of \nprecision irrigation[135] and microclimate control.  Several\
    \ \ntechniques and approaches have been presented, including \ninverting \nfuzzy\
    \ \nmodel[136], \nreconfigurable \nadaptive \nfuzzy \nfault-hiding \ncontrol[137],\
    \ \nTakagiSugeno \nfuzzy \nmodeling[138], \nconventional fuzzy logic control for\
    \ smart greenhouses[102], and \ndecentralized decoupling fuzzy logic controller[139].\
    \  These \nsolutions have shown a more effective set-point tracking compared \n\
    with \nthe \nconventional \nPID \ncontrollers. \n \nFor \nexample, \nEl-Madbouly\
    \ et al.[137] designed an active fault-tolerant control \nsystem to fix of the\
    \ device or sensor errors in weather system of a \ngreenhouse.  This control scheme\
    \ involves a self-tuned fuzzy \nproportional-integral \n(PI) \ncontrol \nscheme,\
    \ \na \nstrong \nfault-hiding-based reconfigurable controller that can fix the\
    \ faulty \neffects, and a reliable and sensitive observer-based fault detection\
    \ \nand diagnosis (FDD) system for diverse kinds of errors in the \npresence of\
    \ scheme disorderliness.  A set of practical actuators \nand sensors were applied\
    \ in this method to renovate the closed-loop \nconsistency and also to confirm\
    \ correct tracking of resource inputs.  \nAzaza et al.[102] introduced a smart\
    \ fuzzy logic based control \nscheme and upgraded by a special measure to the\
    \ humidity \nrelationship and temperature.  Also, the scheme control was \nimproved\
    \ with wireless information observing platform for \ninformation routing and logging\
    \ which prepares actual time of \ninformation entree. \n4.2  Energy analysis and\
    \ optimization models \nEnergy management strategies for optimizing greenhouse\
    \ \ncost[104] require a comprehensive research and knowledge and \nunderstanding\
    \ of climate condition, greenhouse systems, and \nplants’ requirements.  Some\
    \ of these research involves practicing \ninnovative concepts of energy conservation\
    \ and clean-energy using \nmathematical models[141,142], determining energy load\
    \ using \nbuilding energy simulation models[143], computational fluid \ndynamics\
    \ method[119,144,145], or providing optimal growth condition \nwith \nminimum\
    \ \nenvironmental \nimpacts[120,146,147]. \n \nOther \nresearchers have proposed\
    \ optimization methods for maximizing \nthe returns.  See for example the works[148]\
    \ in which a dynamic \nmodel of a greenhouse tomato and the optimal control problem\
    \ for \nthe seasonal benefit of the grower has been presented.  A \nformulation\
    \ of the optimal control problem for minimizing energy \ninput to the greenhouse\
    \ with a dynamic energy balance was \npresented by van Beveren et al.[149] and\
    \ later expanded in [150] to \ninclude humidity balance.  Incrocci et al.[151]\
    \ proposed that \noptimal CO2 concentration in the greenhouse can be based on\
    \ an \neconomic evaluation.  To maintain a given CO2 concentration \nwithin the\
    \ greenhouse, the supply must balance the assimilated CO2 \nflux to the outside\
    \ air due to ventilation.  Linker et al.[152] \noptimized greenhouse operation\
    \ and in particular CO2 control, \nusing a neural network.  Most of these approaches\
    \ have used crop \nmodels and prices of the harvested product.  van Beveren et\
    \ al.[153] \nexpanded this process further by including a dynamic CO2 balance.\
    \  \nThey reported a method to minimize the total energy that is \nrequired to\
    \ heat and cool a greenhouse.  Their research provides a \nmodel to define bounds\
    \ for temperature, humidity, CO2 \nconcentration, the maximum amount of CO2 available,\
    \ and the \neffect of different bounds on optimal energy input.  The addition\
    \ \nof the dynamic CO2 balance provides a truly integrated approach \nthat takes\
    \ all major aspects of greenhouse climate control into \naccount.  This is important,\
    \ given the trade-off between natural \nventilation and the injection of industrial\
    \ CO2, which occurs in a \ngreenhouse with active cooling.  Nadal et al.[154]\
    \ presented an \nenergy and environmental assessment for a roof-top greenhouse\
    \ \nand showed that their greenhouse achieved an annual saving in CO2 \nemissions\
    \ of 113.8 kg/m2 per year, relative to an equivalent \noil-heated greenhouse.\
    \  Vadiee and Martin[155] developed a \ntheoretical model using TRNSYS to carry\
    \ out greenhouse energy \nanalysis.  From the economic feasibility assessment,\
    \ their results \nshowed that the concept has the potential of becoming cost \n\
    effective.  A literature survey on greenhouse energy analysis[156] \nhas concluded\
    \ that evapotranspiration has a significant impact on \nthe micro-climate[156,157].\
    \  This is true since the amount of \nmoisture that is added to the greenhouse\
    \ environment due to \nevapotranspiration helps moderate the vapor pressure deficit.\
    \ \nCurrent advances in CEA systems tend towards sustainability \nand utilizing\
    \ renewable energy by studying wind power, solar \nthermal applications[142] and\
    \ solar energy conservation[141] to \nreduce fuel consumption[158].  For example,\
    \ in tropical and \nsubtropical conditions, the strategy in microclimate control\
    \ is to \nimprove resource efficiency by benefiting from the potentials of \n\
    natural ventilation and shading[120].  In fact, studies of different \ncontrol\
    \ strategies indicated that smart management of natural \nventilation for manipulating\
    \ the environment under specific \nexterior conditions is an effective approach\
    \ to improve productivity \nand increase benefits[124].  A smart tropical greenhouse\
    \ that \noperates on solar panels and benefits from an adaptive design and \n\
    covering materials (i.e., mesh screens) will maximize the use of \nnatural and\
    \ mechanical ventilation[144, 159-162] and will be less \ndependent \non \nhigher-cost\
    \ \ncooling \nmethods \nsuch \nas \nevaporative[67,163-167] and high pressure\
    \ fogging systems[168].  \nNevertheless, the use of anti-insect screens decreases\
    \ the natural \nventilation capacity and aggravates thermal conditions.  It is\
    \ \ntherefore unrealistic to completely eliminate other means of cooling, \n10\

    \ for the weather \nforecast, photosynthesis predictions for plant growth progress[170],\
    \ \npredicting disease[171], simulation of yield[172], and production \nplanning\
    \ and cost-benefit analysis.  Some of the earlier examples \nof climate models\
    \ to predict the temperature and humidity inside a \ngreenhouse can be found in\
    \ the works of [7, 173-176].  A thermal \nmodel for prediction of microclimate\
    \ factors inside a greenhouse \nwith mechanical ventilation and an evaporative\
    \ cooling system was \nintroduced by Willits[75].  More recent mathematical models\
    \ for \npredicting greenhouse microclimate from external data have been \naddressed\
    \ in [121, 177-180].  An innovative air temperature \nprediction model based on\
    \ least squares and support vector \nmachine with optimized parameters using an\
    \ improved particle \nswarm optimization (IPSO) technique is presented in [181].\
    \  The \nauthors compared and validated the performance of their model \nwith\
    \ conventional modeling techniques by predicting the air \ntemperature in a solar\
    \ greenhouse.  Another example is KASPRO, \nan advanced dynamic model for microclimate\
    \ prediction in \ngreenhouses[176,182].  This model consists of sub-functions\
    \ based \non mass and energy balance of the greenhouse environment.  A \ndetailed\
    \ description of this model is presented in the work of \nRigakis et al.[78] This\
    \ model was used by Graamans et al.[183] to \ndescribe crop transpiration and\
    \ energy balance in plant factories by \ndetermining vapor flux and the relation\
    \ between latent and sensible \nheat exchange for production of lettuce. \nSustainable\
    \ development of modern greenhouse production \nsystems also requires yield estimation\
    \ models and knowledge- \nbased information software for adaptive management of\
    \ resources.  \nSince it is impossible to actually plant and experiment with every\
    \ \nsingle greenhouse design and climate scenario, mathematical \nmodels for simulation\
    \ of yields and growth responses are \nessential for achieving high yield at low\
    \ cost.  These models can \nalso contribute to the optimization and management\
    \ of \ngreenhouse energy under adverse climate conditions.  An early \nexample\
    \ includes the work of Gary et al.[184] in which an \neducational software called\
    \ SIMULSERRE for simulating \ngreenhouse plant system was developed.  Some of\
    \ the \nwell-known simulation models for tomato plants include \nTOMSIM[185],\
    \ TOMPOUSSE[186,187] and TOMGRO[188,189].  A \ncommon weakness with these models\
    \ is that their parameters are \nspecific for the climate condition and greenhouse\
    \ design that they \nwere derived from.  In addition, because of the complexity\
    \ of \nthe interactions between the greenhouse elements and the crop \nitself,\
    \ it is often impossible to correctly predict microclimate \neffects on the final\
    \ yield with the same model parameters.  One \nof the most widely accepted yield\
    \ simulation models is the \nTOMGRO[189] in which the author claimed that “it\
    \ is possible to \nuse the same reduced model with parameters estimated at one\
    \ \nlocation to simulate leaf area and above-ground weight of tomato \ngrowing\
    \ in greenhouse conditions in other locations”.  The first \nversion of TOMGRO[188]\
    \ and the third version[190], respectively \nhad 69 and 574 state variables for\
    \ simulation of tomato growth on \nthe basis of three inputs that are measured\
    \ inside greenhouse \nenvironment: \nthe \nphotosynthetically \nactive \nradiation,\
    \ \nmmol/(m2·s), air temperature, °C and CO2 concentration, ppm.  \nA simplified\
    \ version of TOMGRO[189] was developed with the \nobjective of providing a practical\
    \ application and only has five \nsteady-state variables: (i) node number for\
    \ the main stem, (ii) leaf \narea index, (iii) total plant dry weight (WT), (iv)\
    \ total fruit dry \nweight (WF), and (v) mature fruit dry weight (WM).  Jones\
    \ et \nal.[189] provided simulation results for three tomato varieties \nincluding\
    \ DeRuiters, Beefsteak, and Bigboy respectively for three \nexperiment locations\
    \ at Gainesville (Florida), Avignon (France) \nand Lake City (Florida).  Some\
    \ of the studies related to \nevaluation and adaptation of TOMGRO model to specific\
    \ climate \nconditions and cultural practices can be found in the works of \n\
    [172, 191, 192].  It should be noted that the simplified \nTOMGRO model only takes\
    \ into account the effect of air \ntemperature and light condition, and other\
    \ important variables \nsuch as CO2 concentration were not included in this version.\
    \  In \naddition, Jones et al.[189] did not take the work any farther than \n\
    making the model calculations in an Excel spreadsheet, hence the \nmodel could\
    \ not be used directly with other models to control \ngreenhouse environments.\
    \  To fill this gap, Shamshiri et al.[193] \nevaluated and verified the performance\
    \ of the reduced state \nvariable version of TOMGRO model of Jones et al.[189]\
    \ using \nboundary data that were expected to result in zero yield output.  \n\
    The hypothesis was to test whether the model parameters are \nrobust enough to\
    \ translate an adverse greenhouse environment \n(with air temperature so high\
    \ to prevent any crop growth \ndevelopment) to realistic biomass and yield.  For\
    \ this purpose, \nShamshiri et al.[193] converted the model from spreadsheets\
    \ \nformat to Matlab Simulink (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, \nUSA), provided\
    \ a user interface to access the TOMGRO inputs \nand outputs, and replaced the\
    \ lengthy calculation procedures of \nMicrosoft Excel with one-click step operation\
    \ in Matlab.  This \nSimulink model of Shamshiri et al.[193] provided a flexible\
    \ \nplatform for individuals unfamiliar with computer programming \nlanguages\
    \ and crop modeling to have an easy access to the \nTOMGRO model functionality.\
    \  It was shown that the designed \nSimulink model can be used reliably as a replacement\
    \ for the \nspreadsheet version of TOMGRO model.  Additional research \nworks\
    \ with experimental and simulated based studies for \ninvestigating the effects\
    \ of structure design, covering materials \nand \ncontrol \nsystems \non \ngreenhouse\
    \ \nmicroclimate, \ncrop \ntranspiration, and expected yields are available in\
    \ the works of \n[51, 55, 76, 120, 193, 194]. \n4.4  Decision support systems\
    \ \nThe management of production in a greenhouse requires \ndecision making on\
    \ several tasks and time scales.  These \ndecisions are mainly related to management\
    \ of the crop growth \nconditions[195], the culture period and practice such as\
    \ seedling \nproduction[196], event-based irrigation[197] and the control and\
    \ \nmanagement \nof \nenvironment \nbased \ngrowth \nmodels[198].  \nResearch\
    \ and development in decision support system (DSS) for \ngreenhouse application\
    \ began during the 1990s, primarily for \nrecommending microclimate reference\
    \ values and set-points, and \nfor pest and disease management.  Early studies\
    \ included the \nworks of Fisher et al.[199], Clarke et al.[195] and Sun et al.[200].\
    \  A \nDSS was built by Tchamitchian et al.[201] based on the \nJanuary, 2018\

    \ of expert practices and scientific \nknowledge to generate set-point values\
    \ for greenhouse cultivation \nof tomato is reported to contribute to energy saving\
    \ of 5%-20%.  \nA similar application is presented in [202] for decision making\
    \ \nabout the climate control regime that can quantify the energy \ncosts based\
    \ on different control strategies.  More recent studies \ncan be found in the\
    \ works of Cañadas et al.[203] and Aiello et al.[204] \nAn interactive decision\
    \ support system (DSS) developed by \nShort et al.[205] based on the HYTODMOD\
    \ growth response \nmodel of El-Attal[206] is available to describe the optimality\
    \ \ndegrees of air temperature and relative humidity at five growth \nstages and\
    \ under three light conditions (night, sun and cloud).  \nThese functions were\
    \ tested and validated by four independent \nexpert growers and were results of\
    \ experiments with tomato \ncultivar “Carusso” in an A-Shade greenhouse located\
    \ at the Ohio \nAgriculture Research and Development Center with a floor area\
    \ \nof 7.3 m2.  In order to build a model for defining the optimality \ndegrees\
    \ of VPD at different light conditions and growth stages of \ntomato, Shamshiri\
    \ et al.[207] integrated the growth response model \nof El-Attal[206] and developed\
    \ the OptVPD model (Figure 6) with \na series of membership function that take\
    \ VPD (kPa) as input, and \ngenerate a real number between 0 and 1 as output.\
    \  The effects \nof air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) on the \noptimality\
    \ degree of VPD based on this model are shown in \nFigure 6.  The knowledge behind\
    \ these functions and the \noptimal and failure microclimate values were condensed\
    \ from \nextensive peer-reviewed \nscientific published \nresearch on \ngreenhouse\
    \ cultivation of tomato and physiology, with the goal of \nsimultaneously achieving\
    \ high yield and high-quality fruit.  \nShamshiri et al.[120] extended and implemented\
    \ TOMGRO model \nin SIMULINK and interfaced it with the HYTODMOD and \nOptVPD\
    \ for microclimate evaluation and yield estimation (Figure \n7).  The interfaced\
    \ HYTODMOD, OptVPD, and TOMGRO \nmodels can be used as a DSS tool for evaluation\
    \ purpose by \nexploring \noptimality \ndegrees \nof \nthe \nmicroclimate \nand\
    \ \nmacroclimate parameters as well as yield estimation depending \non the growth\
    \ stage of the plant and different light condition.  It \nallows growers to manually\
    \ change the values of the growing \nparameters as well as the growth stages and\
    \ receive a feedback by \nmeans of a number between 0 and 1 representing how close\
    \ that \nparameter is to high yield and high quality.  An application of \nthis\
    \ DSS has been presented for dynamic assessment[208], \nmeasuring optimality degrees[46],\
    \ and comparative evaluation of \nmicroclimate parameters[193] in greenhouses\
    \ with different \ncovering materials.  Microclimate evaluation with VPD \ninfluences\
    \ the energy costs involved in greenhouse cultivation \nand must be taken into\
    \ account in humidity and temperature \ncontrol algorithms.  A more in-depth analysis\
    \ and practical \nexamples of this DSS is presented by Shamshiri et al.[120] via\
    \ an \nadaptive management framework.  This framework provides a \nflexible platform\
    \ for altering each participating variables in the \ngreenhouse.  It simulates\
    \ growth and environment responses in \ndifferent light condition, growth stages,\
    \ growing season and \nlocation.  The result is a cost-benefit analysis that shows\
    \ at what \nlevel each combination of variables is close to the optimal \nrequirements.\

    \ (UA) \nThe fast growth of global population is changing the food \nproduction\
    \ systems to keep up with the growing demands.  \nAgricultural innovation and\
    \ research in the past three decades, \ncombined with the advances in information\
    \ technology have \nintroduced promising cultivation techniques that are valuable\
    \ for \nsustainability and economic viability of CEA.  Ellis[209] described \n\
    that throughout the history, agriculture has always been associated \nwith urban\
    \ centers, much more than it is imagined today.  While \ntraditional and modern\
    \ agriculture have been separated in the upper \nlayers, they are still attached\
    \ to each other in the roots.  Today, \nfood, as well as animal livestock, is\
    \ surrounding us everywhere, \nand the question about the origin of this supply\
    \ is not a concern \nanymore.  By the late 2000s, major cities reached the point\
    \ that \nmost people did not even need to associate food with natural \nresources[210].\
    \ \nThe concepts in UA and the associated facilities have \nreceived significant\
    \ attention and popularity in the last 8 years, \nand are growing to meet the\
    \ needs of the ever-developing urban \nlife.  A variety of systems may fall under\
    \ UA concept in \ndifferent scale and possession (Figure 8), ranging from a personal\
    \ \nor local community gardens for social and self-sufficiency \npurposes, to\
    \ complicated systems which involve indoor food \nproduction with the help of\
    \ artificial light or inside factories that \nare capable of controlling the climate\
    \ to produce sensitive plants.  \nSince UA is mostly practiced indoors, it is\
    \ also referred as \nvertical farming (VF)[211], integrated farming inside buildings[212],\
    \ \nand Z-farming (which stands for ZeroAcreageFarming)[213].  \nThis type of\
    \ food production is entering all cities in the world and \nhas attracted public\
    \ interest.  There are new consumers’ needs \nfor fresh food of good quality with\
    \ no damage to nature.  \nSeveral reports indicated that more projects are involved\
    \ in \nbringing farming products into cities[214,215].  “UA is an industry \n\
    that makes, processes and markets food and fuel, mostly in \nreaction to the daily\
    \ need for consumers in a town, city, or \nmetropolitan areas, on land and on\
    \ water spread in the urban and \nsemi-urban area, by employing many methods of\
    \ production, \nusing and recycling natural resources and city wastes to produce\
    \ a \nvariety of products and livestock”[216-219].  In fact, UA is a \nfarming\
    \ movement in the cities for circulation of food and \nnon-food plants and tree\
    \ products.  Some of the suggested \nsolutions for a closed-field production system\
    \ in UA are the plant \nfactories, vertical farming (VA), and rooftop greenhouses.\

    \ a city center \n \n5.1  Vertical farming and rooftop greenhouses \nThe concept\
    \ of VF is not new.  Kaplan[220] explained that VF \nhas been unknown for a long\
    \ time, and was then brought to \nattention in the recent years through the advances\
    \ in technology.  \nLife magazine has published one of the very first sketches\
    \ of a tall \nconstruction that promotes agricultural products for people daily\
    \ \nfood requests as early as 1909.  In 1915, the American geologist \nGilbert\
    \ Ellis Bailey used the concept of the tall multi-story \nbuildings for indoor\
    \ cultivation.  He created the term “Vertical \nFarming” in his book with the\
    \ same title as “Vertical Farming”[221].  \nDesigners and landscape architects\
    \ have frequently looked into the \nconcept, particularly at the end of the 20th\
    \ century.  During the \n1970s until the early 1980s, the Malaysian-born architect,\
    \ Ken \nYeang improved and advanced the ideas of Bailey into an \narchitectural\
    \ project[222,223].  It is called Bioclimatic Skyscraper \n(Menara Mesiniaga)\
    \ that was built in 1992.  In 1993, Nancy Jack \nTodd and John Todd envisioned\
    \ the idea of VF in their book \nentitled “From Eco-Cities to Living Machines”.\
    \  The most recent \nand greatest challenging form of this idea however appeared\
    \ in \n1999 by Dickson Despommier’s, an Emeritus Professor of \nMicrobiology at\
    \ the Columbia University, speculating that a \n30-floor farm on one city block\
    \ could provide food for 50 000 \npeople with vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat,\
    \ explaining that \nhydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; and the lower\
    \ \nfloors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plants waste.  \nIn\
    \ the concept of VF, heat and lighting would be provided by \ngeothermal, tidal,\
    \ solar, or other recyclable sources of energy.  \nNitrogen along with other nutrients\
    \ would be sieved from animal \nwaste and maybe from the urban sewage system.\
    \  It should be \nnoted that until 2010, there was no report of evidence for VF\
    \ \nconstruction before it began emerging in USA, Singapore, Japan, \nand Korea.\
    \  In theory, VF is the technique that includes \nlarge-scale food production\
    \ in skyscrapers that makes rapid growth \nand planned production possible through\
    \ managing nutrient \nsolution of crop and the growth context according to hydroponics\
    \ \nmethods.  With the help of cutting-edge greenhouse approaches, \nthese buildings\
    \ can be used as a precision farming system that \npaves the way for the acquisition\
    \ of a safe crop growth through \ncontrolling and supervising of the microenvironment\
    \ using sensors, \ninterfacing gadgets and instrumentation[210,213,224-227]. \n\
    In the recent years, the majority of scientific publications in \nUA have focused\
    \ on different aspects of the VF concept.  For \nexample, Sivamani et al.[228]\
    \ studied the viability of smart \ntechnology used in agriculture as an opportunity\
    \ to be used for \nVF[228,229].  Research findings have shown that VF is a promising\
    \ \ntechnique for providing food for cities in a sustainable way.  \nHowever,\
    \ it is also a function of the location and design[229].  It is \nmentioned that\
    \ VF is a way of feeding and at the same time a \nmovement in the society to reduce\
    \ greenhouse gas emission[219,230].  \nA common debate about VF is the compromising\
    \ between the \nbuilding structure and the returns.  Some estimates that an \n\
    abandoned building can be adapted to the needs of VA, while other \nbelieves that\
    \ only buildings with new design will satisfy that need.  \nA study by Kalantari\
    \ et al.[231] presented several effective VF \nprojects in different countries\
    \ by estimating their feasibility and \nviability in various geographical areas.\
    \  The data was shaped \nbased on the technology of different VF in different\
    \ climate areas.  \nIt was shown by Kalantari et al.[231] that every VF has its\
    \ own \ntechnologies and techniques according to the different geographical \n\
    locations.  Table 1 presents the details of some of effective VF \nprojects in\
    \ different countries and shows the different areas by their \ntype of building\
    \ and typologies.  An interesting example includes \nthe conceptual design of\
    \ the Urban Sky-farm for downtown of \nSeoul is shown in Figure 9 with different\
    \ sections of the structure \nillustrated by labels.  This design was the winner\
    \ of the 2013 \ngreen dot design competition.  The key concept of a vertical farm\
    \ \nis to yield as much crop as possible under optimal circumstances, \neven in\
    \ the center of cities.  Thus, the VF shown in Figure 9 \nincludes many floors\
    \ with a variety of crops on each.  Different \ncrops need different environmental\
    \ conditions.  Therefore, tracing \na crop and its location is of a great significance[228].\
    \ \nVertical farms can be diverse from city to city and their \nstructures also\
    \ vary around the world[210].  The other two \nconceptual designs for vertical\
    \ farms are shown in Figure 10. The \nfirst design (Figure 10a) was designed by\
    \ ODESIGN group for \nAustralia. The other type of VF called urban farming units\
    \ (UFU) \nis shown in Figure 10b, a farm within shipping containers that can \n\
    produce organic fish, fruits, and vegetables in the street. The entire \nprototypes\
    \ are rooted in circular agriculture techniques. The main \ngoals of UFU are to\
    \ find a way to grow food under polluted and \nlimited ground[232]. Figure 10b\
    \ shows a conceptual design of an \nAquaponics farm with fish tanks that can be\
    \ placed inside or close \nto the plant in different levels of the farm.  In this\
    \ system, the \nplants clean and purify the water for the fish, and in return,\
    \ fish \nfeed the plants with their waste as a source of nutrients.  The \nFreight\
    \ Farms in Table 1 is also an example of a vertical farm in a \nshipping container.\
    \ \nAnother solution for UA is the rooftop greenhouse (RTG) and \nbuilding integrated\
    \ rooftop greenhouse (i-RTG) concept.  It is \ndefined as a greenhouse constructed\
    \ on top of a building, usually \nmatched with soilless culture systems[233].\

    \ effect on climate change decrease), local \nadvantages (such as naturalization\
    \ of urban areas), integrations and \nadaptations with the building, as well as\
    \ production benefits \n(including the accessibility of high quality food).  These\
    \ structures \ncan optimize the energy, water, and CO2 flows only when the RTG\
    \ \nand the building are capable of exchanging air and can harvest the \nrainwater\
    \ or make use of the decently treated grey water for the \npurpose of irrigation.\
    \  Some experimental research indicated that \ni-RTG has failed to provide proper\
    \ light transmission[236], resulting \nin low radiation use efficiency (RUE),\
    \ however this issue is not \nconcerning RTG structure.  In comparison to traditional\
    \ greenhouses \nin the region, which are generally unheated, a primary advantage\
    \ of \ni-RTG is their better and more uniform temperature regime, owing \nto the\
    \ thermal links to the building.  This is an obvious benefit for \nenergy saving\
    \ over the conventional ground greenhouses.  Some \nof the examples of RTG farming\

    \ are usually used for commercial production of \nleafy greens, but their potential\
    \ remains uncertain.  A general \nstructure design of a plant factory and corresponding\
    \ components \nsections are shown in Figure 11.  In order to achieve economic\
    \ \nviability, the increased resource productivity and/or the value of \nadditional\
    \ services in these structures would have to outweigh the \ndisadvantage of the\
    \ absence of solar energy.  Plant factories have \nbeen primarily used in Asia\
    \ to refer to a commercial plant production \nfactory similar in operations to\
    \ an ordinary industrial firm.  Some \nof the technological instrumentations and\
    \ equipment supporting \nthese factories for deriving the plants to their maximum\
    \ potentials \nare precision sensors, nutrition solution, process controllers,\
    \ \nautomated instruments, computer systems, and environmental \nsupervision along\
    \ with implementation of DSS and task \nmanagement software.  Moreover, a number\
    \ of plant factories also \nbenefits from robotic systems for sorting, transferring,\
    \ and handling \nof the plants, as well as quality control, and post-harvesting.\
    \  Because \nof the relatively higher economic investment that is required for\
    \ \nplant factories, they are managed with resource efficiency and \nproduction\
    \ predictability to attain market-valuable crops. \nIn the Japanese context, there\
    \ existed 165 plant factories which \nare using artificially lighting combined\
    \ with natural solar lights[237].  \nAdditional sub-system might be required in\
    \ plant factories for air \nexchange to eliminate the temperature increase due\
    \ to the artificial \nlight.  Plant factories which have full artificial light\
    \ sources \nusually utilize opaque building materials.  This would offer a \n\
    chance to have the walls and roofs well resistant which makes \ncontrolling the\
    \ internal temperature easier and helps conserve the \nenergy.  Furthermore, often\
    \ the skin facade of the building is \ncovered by a self-cleaning and transparent\
    \ material such as \nEthylene Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (ETFE).  In addition, a material\
    \ \nwhich is highly clear and a high thermal rate are required to \nincrease the\
    \ intensity of sunlight that enters the building.  ETFE is \nlight enough as it\
    \ enjoys only 1% weight of an equal-sized piece of \nglass.  However, it lets\
    \ in 95% of light.  There exists a different \nintensity of pressure between the\
    \ ETFE layers.  Such a pressure \nhelps to close and open the screens so as to\
    \ change the passage of \nsunlight[209].  ETFE which is a standardized construction\
    \ material \nhas been used on an extensive surface of ethereal domes in the \n\
    Eden Project in the south of England[14,238]. \nStudies showed that quantitative\
    \ blue light was able to improve \nphotosynthetic performance or growth through\
    \ motivating \nmorphological as well as physiological responses.  Miyagi et \n\
    al.[239] showed that synergistic effects of monochromic LED \ntogether with high\
    \ CO2 and nutrients can enhance lettuce growth in \na plant factory.  Shimokawa\
    \ et al.[240] concluded that red and blue \nirradiation used at the same time\
    \ improve plant growth more than \nmonochromatic \nand \nfluorescent \nlight \n\
    irradiation. \n \nThese \nresearchers also observed that alternatively use of\
    \ red and blue light \naccelerated plant growth dramatically, with the fresh weight\
    \ of a \nrandomly measured plant that was found to be two times as much \nas the\
    \ usual LED production methods.  The bacterial biofertilizers \nused in plant\
    \ factories may positively affect plant growth in several \n16   January, 2018\

    \ \nFigure 11  General structure design of a plant factory \n \n5.3  Opportunities\
    \ and challenges \nVertical farming entails producing plants in a soil-less culture\
    \ \nwith nutrient solution and deals with problems concerning the use \nof soils,\
    \ including the need for herbicides, pesticides, and \nfertilizers and then it\
    \ supplies healthy organic food which is free \nfrom \nchemicals[213]. \n \nAnother\
    \ \nprivilege \nis \nto \nremove \ntransportation costs and CO2 production which\
    \ accompany the \ncarry-over of foods far away to somewhere near the consumer.\
    \  \nMoreover, products can be provided all-year-round corresponding \nto people’s\
    \ demand.  Furthermore, plant-production conditions \ncan be improved to increase\
    \ the yield by adjusting temperature, \nhumidity, and lighting conditions precisely.\
    \  Indoor agriculture \nin a controlled setting also needs much less water than\
    \ outdoor \nfarming as it involves recycling the graywater and lowering the \n\
    evaporation.  Together with the regulation of temperature and \nhumidity, it can\
    \ also decrease or omit the effects of seasonality.  \nFreshwater is increased\
    \ through the evaporation of black and \ngraywater in order to preserve water\
    \ resources.  Moreover, \nrecycled water obtained from rain can be innovatively\
    \ reused.  \nRecycling and dehumidifying strategies can be used for the city’s\
    \ \nwater supplies.  Similarly, aeroponic and hydroponic systems \ncan help raise\
    \ the efficiency of water consumption to 97% in \ncomparison to traditional agriculture[242].\
    \  Moreover, a constant \nflow of air is produced through air conditioning that\
    \ can be \nenhanced with carbon dioxide (CO2) so as to contribute to plant \n\
    growth even more.  Both environmental parameters and nutrient \nuptake may be\
    \ kept at certain levels that improve the speed of \nplant growth.  It was mentioned\
    \ that plants will have a better \nevapotranspiration and yield with the modification\
    \ of bandwidth \nof LED lighting.   \nUA, VF, RTG and plant factories provide\
    \ a unique opportunity \nfor reducing fossil fuels by utilizing solar panels,\
    \ roof-top wind \nturbines, or storage batteries[242,243] as shown schematically\
    \ in \nFigure 12.  The economic benefits of vertical farms include the \nreduction\
    \ of the cost of energy, lowering of food price, and an \neconomic opportunity\
    \ to secure land and return investments to the \ninvestor through protecting floods,\
    \ droughts, or damage caused by \nthe sun.  New job opportunities can be created\
    \ by VF in \nengineering, \nbiochemistry, \nbiotechnology, \nconstruction, \n\
    maintenance and research, with the chances to improve the \ntechnology.  Moreover,\
    \ the social benefits of VF are diverse and \ninvolve the psychological, and spiritual\
    \ health of the community, \nsuch as education, leisure, and more social communication\
    \ and \nhealthier food habits[213,242,244]. \n \nFigure 12  Conceptual design\
    \ for adaptation of renewable energy \nfor commercial development of sustainable\
    \ CEA and plant \nfactories \n \nSeveral researchers have claimed that, in a VF\
    \ system, the \nplants on the upper sections of the structure will only benefit\
    \ from \nsolar radiation, and that the energy supplied by the photovoltaics \n\
    solar panel may be restricted, or not justified cost wise[225].  \nHowever, solar\
    \ panels are now more efficient in generating energy, \nJanuary, 2018        \

    \ agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1   17 \nand the introduction of new affordable\
    \ and energy efficient LED \nlighting is an accepted substitute to compensate\
    \ the lack of natural \nlight.  We mentioned earlier that the LED sources are\
    \ capable of \nincreasing the yield in greenhouse context significantly because\
    \ of \nmatching spectral features with plant type and physiology[229,242].  \n\
    In addition, extra sun exposure is also possible through stacked \nlevels of plants\
    \ that can be rotated within one high-rise closed-space. \nThe extra cost of VF\
    \ start-ups can be resolved if the supporting \nstructures are not built on the\
    \ expensive central business districts, \nhowever there are still several challenges\
    \ with VF.  Indeed, the \nprimary costs of establishing, equipping and implementing\
    \ a VF \nare certainly high and are mostly accounted for energy \nconsumption.\
    \  The number and variety of crops grown is not as \nmany as in rural farming.\
    \  The quantity and loads of the crops are \nalso not as much as in the open-field\
    \ cultivation.  There are other \nchallenges too such as the need for disruption\
    \ management to the \nrural sector, to raise investment capital, and to train\
    \ workforce.  \nThese costs will be lowered through the time, particularly those\
    \ \nconcerning energy provision.  Abel[210] also mentioned that \nalthough establishing\
    \ VF is very costly at the beginning, but when \nit is well-established and fully\
    \ operated, the price of food will be \nlowered.  According to Despommier[14],\
    \ there are many \nappropriate locations for VF projects in every city and if\
    \ these \nlocations are used efficiently, they are able to return and circulate\
    \ \nlarge sums of money to the city[245].  It is concluded by Voss[246] \nthat\
    \ assessing all conditions on every level is essential, in order to \nthoroughly\
    \ consider all possibilities and then to decide on the \nestablishment of a VF.\
    \  Furthermore, VF as a concept is a \npromising move along the right path for\
    \ the fans of the \nrevolutionary resource-based economy movement.  Economic \n\
    analysis, along with the exploration of the impact of VF on \npost-industrial\
    \ cities can be topics of future studies. \n6  Conclusions \nUrbanization and\
    \ living in multi-story buildings request a \nredefinition of agricultural awareness\
    \ for securing food supply.  \nThe economic viability of traditional greenhouses\
    \ in this new \nscenario is likely to fade in the coming decades.  A trend in\
    \ the \npast 15 years of published literature showed that researchers and \ngreenhouse\
    \ growers have become more interested in shifting \ntowards smart controlled environment\
    \ agriculture.  The research \nconcentration has shifted from instrumentation\
    \ control and \nhardware-software interfacing to other scopes, such as simulating\
    \ \nthe interactions between microclimate parameters and plant growth.  \nResearchers\
    \ in this field are developing complex mathematical \nmodels to minimize energy\
    \ inputs, or are interested in finding \ninnovative solutions for replacing the\
    \ fossil energy consuming \ngreenhouses with energy neutral CEA systems that operate\
    \ on solar \nand wind power.  The main aspect that requires improvements in \n\
    this field is the task planning algorithms.  Path planning is well \nknown, but\
    \ to provide the CEA with an adaptive design and control \nstrategy that forms\
    \ the right shape and perform the right task at the \nright time, while increasing\
    \ profits and remaining competitive in \nthe market is still a challenge.  This\
    \ research presented an \noverview \nof \nmodern \ngreenhouses, \ncontrolled \n\
    environment \nagriculture and their derivatives, and highlighted some of the \n\
    advances in environmental monitoring, control, and optimization.  \nWhile biological\
    \ sensors, like those that measures plant stress are \nthe key to such high-level\
    \ of automation, this technology is either \nvery expensive for local growers\
    \ to afford, or even not available.  \nIn addition, it is not clearly well known\
    \ the cost of increased \nautomation relative to increase in profitability.  Therefore,\
    \ another \narea helping sustainability is knowledge based and decision making\
    \ \nsupport systems, i.e., model based computer applications that \naddress the\
    \ cost benefit for a proposed automation technology.  \nThis paper highlighted\
    \ some the most recent technological \nadvances for closed-field agriculture by\
    \ reviewing the applications \nof plant factories and rooftop greenhouses.  Some\
    \ of the \nconceptual designs in this context were introduces along with \nseveral\
    \ existing commercial examples to show the trends in \ndeveloping sustainable\
    \ farming system in the center of dense cities.  \nBased on the review literature,\
    \ this study concludes that a more \naccurate economic analysis and justifications\
    \ of the high startup \ncosts involved with vertical farming and plant factories\
    \ are required \nbefore large-scale commercial development.  The computer \nsimulation\
    \ models and adaptive analysis software are already \navailable for greenhouses\
    \ and CEA systems can be extended and \nmodified for this purpose.  The cost of\
    \ increased automation level \nrelative to increases in profitability is a key\
    \ consideration, and \nshould form part of future study to justify the implementation\
    \ of a \ngreater level of automation. \n \n[References] \n[1] \nTing K C, Lin\

    \ of crop water use efﬁciency (CWUE), deﬁned as crop yield per volume of\nwater\
    \ used, is an important goal for both crop management and breeding. While many\
    \ technologies\nhave been developed for measuring crop water use in crop management\
    \ studies, rarely have these\ntechniques been applied at the scale of breeding\
    \ plots. The objective was to develop a high-throughput\nmethodology for quantifying\
    \ water use in a cotton breeding trial at Maricopa, AZ, USA in 2016\nand 2017,\
    \ using evapotranspiration (ET) measurements from a co-located irrigation management\n\
    trial to evaluate the approach. Approximately weekly overﬂights with an unmanned\
    \ aerial system\nprovided multispectral imagery from which plot-level fractional\
    \ vegetation cover (fc) was computed.\nThe fc data were used to drive a daily\
    \ ET-based soil water balance model for seasonal crop water\nuse quantiﬁcation.\
    \ A mixed model statistical analysis demonstrated that differences in ET and\n\
    CWUE could be discriminated among eight cotton varieties (p < 0.05), which were\
    \ sown at two\nplanting dates and managed with four irrigation levels. The results\
    \ permitted breeders to identify\ncotton varieties with more favorable water use\
    \ characteristics and higher CWUE, indicating that the\nmethodology could become\
    \ a useful tool for breeding selection.\nKeywords: breeding; drought; evapotranspiration;\
    \ modeling; phenomics; remote sensing; unmanned\naerial system\n1. Introduction\n\
    Drought stress arising from water deﬁcit is a leading cause of crop production\
    \ losses worldwide.\nSpeciﬁc regions of the world are also projected to experience\
    \ increases in the frequency and severity\nof future drought events due to effects\
    \ of climate change on precipitation patterns [1,2]. To maintain\nproductivity\
    \ and security of food, ﬁber, and other agricultural products, increasing crop\
    \ water use\nefﬁciency (CWUE), deﬁned as the ratio of crop yield and water consumption\
    \ volume, is an important\ngoal to ameliorate impacts of future drought. Increases\
    \ in CWUE can result both from improvements\nin agronomic management practices\
    \ [3] and by developing improved crop cultivars that yield highly\nunder water\
    \ deﬁcit conditions [4]. Although these pathways are often pursued independently\
    \ within\ndisciplinary boundaries, the most comprehensive solutions towards CWUE\
    \ improvement will be\nachieved through multidisciplinary efforts.\nAdoption of\
    \ information technologies for problem solving in the agricultural sciences has\
    \ been\nan especially pervasive occurrence in recent years. For example, precision\
    \ irrigation, where water\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682; doi:10.3390/rs10111682\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n2 of 19\napplications\
    \ are tuned based on the spatial and temporal crop need, is a primary technology\
    \ for\nimproving CWUE in crop production settings [5,6]. Other agronomic solutions\
    \ involve improved\nfertility management, optimizing sowing dates, using cover\
    \ crops or mulches, and choosing\nalternative crops or crop rotations [3]. In\
    \ the plant sciences, high-throughput plant phenomics,\nwhich involves deployment\
    \ of crop sensing systems for rapid phenotyping of breeding populations,\nhas\
    \ potential to guide crop improvement efforts toward cultivars with increased\
    \ tolerance to drought\nstress [4,7,8]. Information technologies in the form of\
    \ sensors, imagers, data loggers, sensor deployment\nvehicles, geographic information\
    \ systems, geostatistical methods, data management approaches,\nand engineering\
    \ control systems are central to the success of these technical solutions to improving\n\
    CWUE. However, further efforts are needed to solidify the role of information\
    \ technology for practical\nadvancement towards this goal.\nRemote sensing has\
    \ been used to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) and predict drought stress\n\
    at multiple scales [9–13]. For example, Yebra et al. [14] combined vegetation\
    \ metrics derived from\nthe MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ satellite with the Penman-Monteith\nequation to estimate ET for evergreen and\
    \ deciduous broadleaf forests. At the agricultural ﬁeld scale,\nColaizzi et al.\
    \ [15] installed infrared thermometers on an overhead sprinkler irrigation machine\
    \ to\nestimate daily ET. They proposed that the approach could improve CWUE through\
    \ better irrigation\nscheduling. In addition, Hunsaker et al. [16] used multispectral\
    \ cameras aboard a manned helicopter\nto map the normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) of a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) ﬁeld,\nestimated basal crop\
    \ coefﬁcients from NDVI, and scheduled irrigation using an ET-based soil water\n\
    balance model [17]. Results for one growing season showed that the recommendations\
    \ from the\nscheduling model led to increased CWUE when NDVI was used to estimate\
    \ basal crop coefﬁcients.\nAdditional ﬁeld testing is needed to further realize\
    \ CWUE improvements using remote sensing to\nguide irrigation management decisions.\n\
    Leveraging the technology previously developed for precision agriculture applications,\
    \ remote and\nproximal sensing has recently become a highly popular tool for field-based\
    \ plant phenotyping,\nparticularly by integrating imaging equipment with unmanned\
    \ aerial systems (i.e., drones) to obtain very\nhigh resolution imagery of plant\
    \ breeding trials. For example, Zaman-Allah et al. [18] related nitrogen\nstress,\
    \ senescence, and yield for ten maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids to NDVI from multispectral\
    \ images\ncollected with a drone. In addition, Sankaran et al. [19] used a multispectral\
    \ camera with a drone to\nestimate seedling emergence and stand density for more\
    \ than 100 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\nvarieties in Washington State.\
    \ Condorelli et al. [20] measured NDVI with a drone-based multispectral\ncamera\
    \ over 248 durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) lines at different growth stages and\
    \ water regimes.\nA subsequent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified\
    \ 22 single quantitative trait loci (QTL)\nfor NDVI, particularly as related to\
    \ terminal drought stress. Although many important advancements\nhave been made,\
    \ moving remote sensing data analyses beyond the NDVI will enhance the quantification\n\
    of useful phenotypes.\nFew studies, if any, have aimed to directly phenotype crop\
    \ water use or CWUE for purposes\nof breeding or genomic analysis. Rather, the\
    \ focus has been to estimate related plant traits, such as\nspectral indices that\
    \ correlate with plant water status, under both well-watered and water-limited\n\
    conditions [21–24]. A key difference is that plant water status describes the\
    \ plant state at a singular\ntime point, whereas crop water use is a process that\
    \ occurs over time. For this reason, efforts to\nintegrate process-based simulation\
    \ models with spectral measurements of plant states may provide\nphenotypes that\
    \ better express the process-based nature of plant growth and water consumption\
    \ [25].\nAlthough the integration of remote sensing data with models of radiation\
    \ transfer, crop growth,\nand soil water balance has been widely studied for regional\
    \ and ﬁeld-scale mapping of crop water use,\nsuch techniques have not been applied\
    \ for ﬁeld-based, high-throughput plant phenomics.\nThe main goal of this study\
    \ was to develop a methodology for phenotyping crop water use\nand CWUE in a cotton\
    \ breeding trial, using ET estimates from a co-located irrigation management\n\
    study to evaluate the approach. It attempts to merge efforts from the ET remote\
    \ sensing community\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n3 of 19\nwith efforts in the\
    \ plant science community in a multidisciplinary effort toward CWUE improvement.\n\
    Speciﬁc objectives were to (1) estimate fractional vegetation cover (fc) from\
    \ multispectral images\ncollected over the cotton ﬁeld trials with a drone, (2)\
    \ use plot-level fc to derive crop water use\ncalculations from an ET-based daily\
    \ soil water balance model, and (3) identify cotton cultivars with\nfavorable\
    \ yield, ﬁber quality and water use efﬁciency across treatments and growing seasons.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Field Experiments\nCotton ﬁeld experiments were\
    \ conducted at the University of Arizona’s Maricopa Agricultural\nCenter (MAC)\
    \ near Maricopa, AZ (33.079◦N, 111.977◦W, 360 m above sea level) during the 2016\n\
    and 2017 growing seasons (Figure 1).\nThe environment in central Arizona is arid\
    \ and hot,\nwith maximum daily air temperatures regularly exceeding 38 ◦C in July\
    \ and August. Growing\nseason precipitation from April through September amounted\
    \ to 42 and 51 mm in 2016 and 2017,\nrespectively. In comparison, short crop reference\
    \ ET during the same period was 1364 and 1404 mm in\n2016 and 2017, respectively.\
    \ Thus, cotton production required irrigation to meet evaporative demand.\n2014\n\

    \ 2018, 10, 1682\n4 of 19\nSoil variability at the 6-ha ﬁeld site was characterized\
    \ via a multi-year soil sampling effort at\n160 locations (not shown). A tractor-mounted\
    \ soil sampler (model 25-TS, Giddings Machine Co.,\nWindsor, CO, USA) was used\
    \ to collect cylindrical soil samples (0.04-m diameter × 0.4-m depth)\nat ﬁve\
    \ incremental soil proﬁle depths centered at 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, 1.4 and 1.8 m. Soil\
    \ texture analysis\nwas conducted in the laboratory using the hydrometer method\
    \ of Gee and Bauder [26], and the soil\nwater holding limits of each sample was\
    \ computed from texture data using the Rosetta pedotransfer\nfunctions [27]. For\
    \ ET estimation purposes (discussed below), ordinary kriging was used to spatially\n\
    interpolate soil water limits at the central location of each ﬁeld plot (Figure\
    \ 1). Geostatistics were\nconducted using the “geoR” package within the R Project\
    \ for Statistical Computing software. Primarily,\nsoil texture at the ﬁeld site\
    \ was sandy loam and sandy clay loam with drained upper limits between\n0.16 and\
    \ 0.22 cm3 cm−3 and lower limits between 0.08 and 0.11 cm3 cm−3.\nData from two\
    \ ﬁeld experiments (Experiment #1 and Experiment #2), each with a unique\nexperimental\
    \ design and purpose, were used to complete the objectives of this study. The\
    \ two ﬁeld\nexperiments were established on adjacent land areas (Figure 1), both\
    \ receiving irrigation from the same\noverhead, lateral-move sprinkler irrigation\
    \ system (Zimmatic, Lindsay Corporation, Omaha, NE, USA).\nAdvanced technology\
    \ on the irrigation machine permitted the application of variable irrigation rates\n\
    based on georeferenced irrigation maps uploaded to the machine’s control panel.\
    \ The variable-rate\nirrigation system permitted unique control of irrigation\
    \ rates from individual drop hoses, which were\nspaced 1.0 m apart and located\
    \ at the center of each interrow area. Nozzles were positioned to emit\nwater\
    \ less than 1.0 m above the soil surface. For uniform soil wetting prior to cotton\
    \ emergence, spray\npads giving a spray diameter of approximately 5.0 m were used.\
    \ After emergence, the pads were\nchanged to a “bubbler” style, which emitted\
    \ large droplets with a 0.3-m spray diameter at the center of\neach interrow area.\
    \ In addition to reducing water loss to evaporation, the bubbler pads increased\
    \ the\nspatial accuracy of irrigation applications relative to the intended application\
    \ areas delineated in the\ngeoreferenced irrigation maps. Spatial application\
    \ error with the variable-rate irrigation machine was\nestimated to be less than\
    \ 2.0 m. The overhead irrigation system with variable-rate capability permitted\n\
    both ﬁeld experiments to incorporate multiple irrigation rates as a primary treatment.\n\
    Experiment #1 tested cotton yield and water use responses to variable irrigation\
    \ rate and timing\nfor one commercial cotton variety (Deltapine 1549 B2XF, Monsanto\
    \ Company, St. Louis, MO, USA).\nTreatment plots were relatively large (12.2 m\
    \ (12 cotton rows) × 30.0 m) and required a majority of\nthe ﬁeld area (Figure\
    \ 1). The experimental design included four replications of sixteen irrigation\n\
    management treatments (64 plots), which involved all the possible combinations\
    \ of four irrigation\nrates applied during two distinct periods of the growing\
    \ season. The four irrigation rates were 60%,\n80%, 100%, and 120% of the recommendation\
    \ provided by an irrigation scheduling tool based on the\nCSM-CROPGRO-Cotton agroecosystem\
    \ model [28]. The two irrigation periods were from ﬁrst square\nto peak bloom\
    \ (approximately the ﬁrst of June through mid-July) and from peak bloom to 90%\
    \ open\nboll (approximately mid-July through the ﬁrst week of September). The\
    \ various combinations of the\nfour rates during the two times resulted in sixteen\
    \ total irrigation treatments, which led to cotton\ngrown under a variety of soil\
    \ water status conditions. The entire ﬁeld area was disked and planed\nprior to\
    \ planting. Cotton was planted with a north-south row orientation on 25 April\
    \ 2016 (day of year\n(DOY) 116) and 18 April 2017 (DOY 108).\nOf highest relevance\
    \ to the present study, Experiment #1 incorporated weekly soil water content\n\
    measurements via a ﬁeld-calibrated neutron moisture meter (model 503, Campbell\
    \ Paciﬁc Nuclear,\nMartinez, CA, USA). After crop emergence, steel access tubes\
    \ were installed at the center of each\ntreatment plot (Figure 1) using the tractor-mounted\
    \ soil sampler. From mid-May to early October,\nthe neutron moisture meter was\
    \ deployed on a weekly basis (approximately 20 times per growing\nseason) to measure\
    \ soil water content from 0.1 to 1.9 m in 0.2-m incremental depths at each access\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n5 of 19\ntube. Soil water content data were used\
    \ to estimate ET and deep seepage (DS) between successive\nmeasurement events\
    \ using the soil water balance approach described by Hunsaker et al. [29]:\nET\
    \ =\n7\n∑\ni=1\n(Di,1 − Di,n−1) +\nn−1\n∑\nj=1\n(Rj + Ij) − DS,\n(1)\nDS = max\
    \ (0.0,\n10\n∑\ni=8\n(Di,1 − Di,n−1)),\n(2)\nwhere ET is the total evapotranspiration\
    \ and DS is the total deep seepage occurring from the\nbeginning of a given measurement\
    \ day (denoted as day j = 1) to the end of the day before the\nsuccessive measurement\
    \ date (denoted as j = n − 1), Di,1 and Di,n−1 are respectively the water depth\n\
    measurements at soil depth increment i at the beginning of day 1 and at the end\
    \ of day n − 1, and Rj\nand Ij are respectively the precipitation and net irrigation\
    \ depths received on day j. For the sake\nof practicality, soil water content\
    \ measurements collected on the morning of day n were used to\napproximate soil\
    \ water content at the end of day n − 1. Deep seepage was not permitted to be\
    \ negative,\nmeaning upﬂux from below the neutron access tube was considered negligible.\
    \ The seasonal ET\nestimates from neutron moisture meter data provided important\
    \ veriﬁcation that the ET estimation\nmethodology (discussed below) provided reasonably\
    \ accurate results.\nExperiment #2 was a breeding trial that tested the responses\
    \ of eight cotton cultivars (Table 1) to\ntwo planting dates and four irrigation\
    \ rates (Figure 1). The experimental design was a randomized\ncomplete block design\
    \ with planting date as the block and irrigation rate treatments nested within\n\
    the blocks. Each cultivar was replicated three times for each irrigation treatment,\
    \ totaling 96 plots\nper block. The first planting date treatment was sown on\
    \ 26 April 2016 (DOY 117) and 19 April 2017\n(DOY 109), and the second planting\
    \ date treatment was sown on 18 May 2016 (DOY 139) and 10 May\n2017 (DOY 130).\
    \ The four irrigation rates were 60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% of the recommendation\n\
    provided by a simulation tool for irrigation scheduling [28] and were administered\
    \ consistently from\nfirst square (early June) to 90% open boll (early September).\
    \ Irrigation rates were administered uniformly\nwithin spatial areas containing\
    \ 24 treatment plots (8 cultivars × 3 replications). Buffer areas with width\n\
    of 6.0 m (six cotton rows) and planted to a single commercial cotton variety were\
    \ incorporated centrally\nalong the boundaries of irrigation treatments to prevent\
    \ spatial error in the variable-rate irrigation\napplication from affecting cultivar\
    \ treatments. In 2016, the plot dimensions for cultivar treatments\nwere 3.0 m\
    \ (three cotton rows) × 4.6 m with a 1.5 m buffer area between plots. In 2017,\
    \ the plot size\nwas reduced to 2.0 m (two cotton rows) × 4.6 m, and the buffer\
    \ area between plots remained 1.5 m.\nDue to the relatively small size and large\
    \ number of treatment plots (i.e., 192 per growing season),\nplot-level ET estimation\
    \ via neutron moisture meter measurements and other common ET measurement\nmethodologies\
    \ was impractical. Thus, this study aimed to estimate ET by integrating plot-specific\n\
    remote sensing data and an ET-based soil water balance model with site-specific\
    \ soil parameterization,\nproviding an approach for high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of cotton water use in this breeding trial.\nTable 1. Summary of eight cotton\

    \ with a two-row picker on 1 November 2016\n(DOY 306) and 8 November 2017 (DOY\
    \ 312). Samples from each plot were bagged and weighed\nseparately in the ﬁeld.\
    \ Prior to the harvest date, 25 mature bolls were sampled from each plot and\n\
    ginned on a small research-scale cotton gin. Harvest weight, ﬁber turnout percentage,\
    \ and plot area\nwere used to compute cotton ﬁber yield (kg ha−1) for each plot.\
    \ Additionally, cotton ﬁber from the\n25 mature boll samples was sent to Cotton\
    \ Incorporated (Cary, NC, USA) for analysis of ﬁber quality\nvia High Volume Instrument\
    \ (HVI) methods.\n2.2. Multispectral Imaging\nRemote sensing surveys from an autopiloted\
    \ drone were conducted over the ﬁeld site on multiple\noccasions in 2016 and 2017\
    \ (Table 2). Images were collected either via a ﬁve-band multispectral\ncamera\
    \ (RedEdge, MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA) aboard a custom-built hexacopter or a\
    \ four-band\nmultispectral camera (Sequoia, Parrot, Paris, France) aboard a ﬁxed-wing\
    \ drone (eBee, SenseFly,\nCheseaux-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland). The bandwidths\
    \ and central wavelengths for the ﬁve-band\nRedEdge camera were 20 nm at 475 nm\
    \ (blue), 20 nm at 560 nm (green), 10 nm at 668 nm (red),\n10 nm at 717 nm (red\
    \ edge), and 40 nm at 840 nm (near infrared). For the four-band Sequoia camera,\n\
    bandwidths and central wavelengths were 40 nm at 550 nm (green), 40 nm at 660\
    \ nm (red), 10 nm\nat 735 nm (red edge), and 40 nm at 790 nm (near infrared).\
    \ Both cameras featured a global shutter\nfor multispectral image capture and\
    \ an upward facing sensor for solar irradiance characterization\nduring overﬂight.\
    \ The bit depth of images was 10 and 12 bits per channel for the Sequoia and\n\
    RedEdge cameras, respectively. Flight plans were designed for 80% image overlap\
    \ along ﬂight paths.\nImage spatial resolution at the ﬂight altitude of 75 m was\
    \ approximately 5 cm per pixel.\nTable 2. Multispectral image reconnaissance from\

    \ surveys, four 8-m × 8-m calibration tarps (Group VIII\nTechnologies, Provo,\
    \ UT, USA) were positioned near the cotton ﬁeld. Concurrently with drone\nimage\
    \ acquisition, ground-based radiometric measurements of each calibration tarp\
    \ were collected\nwith a portable ﬁeld spectroradiometer (FieldSpec 3, Analytical\
    \ Spectral Devices, Inc., Boulder,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n7 of 19\nCO,\
    \ USA), which was sensitive to wavelengths between 350 and 2500 nm. Additional\
    \ radiometric\nmeasurements over a calibrated, 99% Spectralon panel (Labsphere,\
    \ Inc., North Sutton, NH, USA) were\nused to characterize incoming solar irradiance\
    \ and to compute spectral reﬂectance factors of each tarp\nduring overﬂight. Based\
    \ on the quantum efﬁciency and ﬁlter functions for the multispectral cameras,\n\
    the tarp spectral reﬂectance data were ﬁltered to provide singular reﬂectance\
    \ factors for each tarp,\ncorresponding to each channel of the multispectral cameras.\
    \ The ﬁltered tarp reﬂectance data were\nused for image calibration efforts.\n\
    A commercial photogrammetry software (Pix4DMapperPro, Pix4D S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland)\n\
    was used to stitch images for each channel of the multispectral cameras. Geographic\
    \ coordinates from\n21 ground control points around the ﬁeld area were surveyed\
    \ with a real-time kinematic (RTK) global\npositioning receiver and were incorporated\
    \ into the image processing for georeferencing purposes.\nThe Pix4D software was\
    \ set to use camera calibration information and measurements from the upward\n\
    facing solar irradiance sensor for initial image calibration. Additionally, the\
    \ software provided an\noption to input the known reﬂectance of one calibration\
    \ target. Because reﬂectance measurements\nwere available for the calibration\
    \ tarps, the darkest calibration tarp was used for the known reﬂectance\ninput,\
    \ instead of the typical reﬂectance panel supplied by the camera manufacturer.\n\
    Comparisons of the measured tarp reﬂectance data with the values from tarp pixels\
    \ in the\northomosaic suggested that additional image calibration was needed following\
    \ Pix4D image processing.\nFor each multispectral image band, linear regression\
    \ equations were developed to relate the measured\nreﬂectance of all four calibration\
    \ targets to the average pixel value of each target in the images.\nUsing the\
    \ band math function in a commercial remote sensing software (Environment for\
    \ Visualizing\nImages (ENVI), Version 5.5, Exelis Visual Information Solutions,\
    \ Boulder, CO, USA), the linear\nregression equations were applied to compute\
    \ reﬂectance for all pixels in the image. The set of four\n(Sequoia) or ﬁve (RedEdge)\
    \ calibrated multispectral image bands were then layer stacked, such that\nfalse\
    \ color composite images (e.g., Figure 1) could be inspected for accuracy of image\
    \ calibration\nand georeferencing.\nBased on spectral information in all image\
    \ channels, a supervised maximum likelihood classiﬁer\nwithin the ENVI software\
    \ was used to segment the composite images into bare soil and vegetation\ncomponents.\
    \ The classiﬁer was trained by manually selecting regions of interest associated\
    \ with the\ntwo classes. Due to the relatively high spatial resolution from drone-based\
    \ images, it was generally\nsimple to select multiple regions of interest that,\
    \ with high certainty, represented pure spectral data\nfor each class. The image\
    \ classiﬁcation result was used to produce a binary image with values of\n0 for\
    \ bare soil and 1 for vegetation. The binary image was loaded into a geographic\
    \ information\nsystem (QGIS, www.qgis.org) for calculation of zonal statistics\
    \ within the boundaries of each ﬁeld\nplot, as delineated with shapeﬁle polygons\
    \ (Figure 1). Based on the total vegetation pixels within\neach polygon, the fractional\
    \ vegetation cover (fc) of each ﬁeld plot was computed for each ﬂight date\n(Table\
    \ 2).\n2.3. Fractional Cover Modeling\nTo facilitate calculations of cotton water\
    \ use for each ﬁeld plot (discussed below), daily fc estimates\nwere obtained\
    \ using a Kalman smoothing algorithm [30] to integrate drone-based fc measurements\n\
    with fc from a daily logistic growth model:\ndfc\ndt = r fc\n\x12\n1 −\nfc\nfc,max\n\
    \x13\n,\n(3)\nwhere r describes the growth rate (d−1) and fc,max is the maximum\
    \ value that fc attains. This differential\nequation has an analytical solution:\n\
    fc =\n \ncer(t−t0)\n1 +\nc\nfc,max er(t−t0)\n!\n,\n(4)\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10,\
    \ 1682\n8 of 19\nwhere\nc =\nfc,max fc,0\nfc,max − fc,0\n(5)\nand fc,0 is fc at\
    \ the initial time (t0). The model was parameterized for each ﬁeld plot by adjusting\
    \ r,\nfc,0, and fc,max to minimize error between modeled fc and the drone-based\
    \ fc measurements. The t0\nterm was ﬁxed as the DOY for planting each plot. Subsequently,\
    \ Equation (3) with ﬁtted parameters\nwas incorporated into an unscented Kalman\
    \ smoothing algorithm to develop daily fc time series that\nconsidered uncertainty\
    \ in both the measured and modeled fc data. Kalman smoothing was especially\n\
    important for characterizing fc in plots where the imposed treatments caused atypical\
    \ growth patterns\n(Figure 2). To achieve reasonable time series as assessed visually,\
    \ the fc state transition variance was\nset to 0.0002 while the measurement variance\
    \ was set ﬁve times higher at 0.001. A Python script was\ndeveloped to conduct\
    \ this analysis, which incorporated a Nelder–Mead optimizer within the “scipy”\n\
    package for parameter ﬁtting and the “pykalman” package for unscented Kalman smoothing.\n\

    the 2017 growing season at Maricopa, AZ, USA.\n2.4. Crop Water Use Estimation\n\
    The daily fc time series from Kalman smoothing were rescaled to formulate basal\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\n(Kcb) time series, which were used to drive an ET-based daily\
    \ soil water balance model as described\nin the Food and Agriculture Organization\
    \ of the United Nations Paper No. 56 (FAO-56) [17]. Brieﬂy,\ndaily crop water\
    \ use (ETc) was calculated with the following equation:\nETc = (KcbKs + Ke) ETos,\n\
    (6)\nwhere ETos is the standardized short crop reference evapotranspiration [31],\
    \ Ke is the soil water\nevaporation coefﬁcient, and Ks describes the effect of\
    \ water stress on transpiration. Daily ETos was\ncomputed using data from an Arizona\
    \ Meteorological Network station (AZMET) approximately 1.2 km\nfrom the ﬁeld site.\
    \ Required meteorological measurements included the daily minimum and maximum\n\
    air temperature, dew point temperature, solar irradiance, and wind speed. Based\
    \ on recommended\ncomputations for maximum Kcb given environmental data for Maricopa,\
    \ the Kcb time series were\nrescaled from fc with a minimum value of 0.15 and\
    \ maximum value of 1.225. The coefﬁcients Ke and\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n\
    9 of 19\nKs were calculated as described in FAO-56. For Ks in particular, calculations\
    \ were based on a daily\nsoil water balance methodology, where soil water holding\
    \ limits deﬁne the total plant available water.\nUnder non-stressed conditions\
    \ with root zone soil water at the drained upper limit, Ks is 1.0 and has\nno\
    \ effect on ETc calculations (Equation (6)). As soil water is depleted, reductions\
    \ in Ks are calculated,\nwhich lead to decreased ETc from plant transpiration.\
    \ As mentioned above, the soil water holding\nlimits were speciﬁed uniquely for\
    \ each treatment plot based on soil sampling, soil texture analysis,\npedotransfer\
    \ function evaluations, and geostatistical calculations at the ﬁeld site. Thus,\
    \ the crop water\nuse calculations were based on plot-level, site-speciﬁc information\
    \ for both the soil water holding\nproperties and the plant growth impacts on\
    \ Kcb as characterized through drone-based fc. The soil\nwater status on day i\
    \ was calculated as follows:\nDi = Di−1 − Pi − Ii + ETci + DSi,\n(7)\nwhere D\
    \ is the depth of root zone soil water depletion from the drained upper limit\
    \ at the end of the\nday, P and I are the precipitation and irrigation received\
    \ on the day, ETc is the daily crop water use\nfrom Equation (6), and DS is the\
    \ water lost to deep seepage, which is calculated when water inputs\nexceed the\
    \ root zone soil water storage capacity. This ET-based soil water balance model,\
    \ as described\nin FAO-56 [17], was coded as a Python script for use in all cotton\
    \ water use calculations in this study.\nFor each treatment plot in both ﬁeld\
    \ experiments in both growing seasons, ETc calculations were\ninitiated on the\
    \ day of planting and terminated after crop maturity in the ﬁrst week of October.\n\
    To summarize the seasonal crop water use, daily ETc calculations were aggregated\
    \ over time.\nFor comparison to measured ETc data in the irrigation management\
    \ study (Equation (1)), daily ETc\ncalculations were aggregated from the ﬁrst\
    \ to the last neutron moisture meter measurement dates in\neach growing season.\
    \ For the cotton breeding trial, ETc data were aggregated over the entire calculation\n\
    period from planting to crop maturity. Furthermore, seasonal CWUE (kg m−3) was\
    \ calculated from\nthe ratio of measured cotton ﬁber yield and modeled seasonal\
    \ cotton ET. To eliminate the effect of\nsurface soil water evaporation, seasonal\
    \ water use efﬁciency was also computed considering only the\ntranspiration component\
    \ of ET (TWUE, kg m−3).\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical software (SAS\
    \ for Windows, ver. 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to ﬁt a\nlinear\
    \ model for each of eleven cotton traits in response to the experimental treatments\
    \ in the breeding\ntrial. The eleven cotton traits were ﬁber yield (FY, kg ha−1),\
    \ seasonal evapotranspiration (ET, mm),\ncrop water use efﬁciency (CWUE = FY:ET,\
    \ kg m−3), seasonal transpiration (T, mm), transpiration water\nuse efﬁciency\
    \ (TWUE = FY:T, kg m−3), micronaire (MIC, unitless), upper half mean ﬁber length\
    \ (UHM,\nmm), uniformity index (UI, mm mm−1), ﬁber strength (STR, HVI g tex−1),\
    \ ﬁber elongation at failure\n(ELO, %), and short ﬁber content (SFC, %). Mixed\
    \ model analysis of variance was conducted for each\ntrait using the SAS MIXED\
    \ procedure with the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method. In the\ncase\
    \ that more than one trait estimate was available per plot, the plot mean was\
    \ used as the dependent\nvariable. The statistical model for each trait (Y) was\n\
    Yijklmn = µ + αi + βj + γk + δl(k) + (αβ)ij + (αγ)ik + (βγ)jk + (αδ)il(k) + (βδ)jl(k)\n\
    +(αβγ)ijk + (αβδ)ijl(k) + ζm + (αζ)im + ϵn(ijklm),\n(8)\nwhere experimental year\
    \ (αi), cotton cultivar (βj), planting date (γk), irrigation treatment nested\
    \ within\nplanting date (δl(k)), and corresponding interaction terms were ﬁtted\
    \ as ﬁxed effects, and the replicate\n(ζm) and year by replicate interaction ((αζ)im)\
    \ were ﬁtted as random effects. To examine associations\namong traits, Pearson’s\
    \ correlation coefﬁcients (r) were determined using the SAS CORR procedure.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n10 of 19\n3. Results\n3.1. Crop Water Use Evaluation\n\
    Evaluation of seasonal cotton water use estimates from the drone-based ET modeling\
    \ approach as\ncompared to ET measurements from neutron moisture meters demonstrated\
    \ reasonable performance\nwith the modeling technique (Figure 3). The root mean\
    \ squared errors (RMSE) between measured and\nmodeled seasonal ET among 64 treatment\
    \ plots in the irrigation management study were less than 5%.\nIn both seasons,\
    \ the model underestimated ET for the four treatment plots with the highest ET\
    \ amounts.\nThese treatment plots received 120% of the recommended irrigation\
    \ rate over the whole season and\nwere therefore overwatered. One possibility\
    \ is that measured ET from the neutron moisture meters\nwas overestimated, which\
    \ is likely considering that deep seepage was estimated from soil moisture\nstates\
    \ typically one week apart (Equation (2)). In actuality, more water ﬂux to deep\
    \ seepage may have\noccurred for the overwatered plots, which would reduce estimates\
    \ for measured ET (Equation (1))\nif it could be accurately measured. For other\
    \ treatment plots, which were not overwatered for the\nentire season, the agreement\
    \ between measured and modeled ET was very good. In 2016 and 2017,\nmeasured deep\
    \ seepage ranged from 45 to 97 mm and from 21 to 63 mm, respectively (not shown).\n\
    Modeled deep seepage in both years ranged from 0 to 146 mm with a majority of\
    \ plots modeled as\nhaving zero seepage. On average, measured deep seepage was\
    \ less than 7% and 4% of ET in 2016 and\n2017, respectively, which demonstrates\
    \ the high importance of crop water use as a pathway for water\nloss from the\
    \ agroecosystem. Overall, the results show that the drone-based fc and soil water\
    \ balance\nmodeling approach could effectively estimate seasonal cotton water\
    \ use at this ﬁeld site.\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\nMeasured ET (m)\n\

    \ in 2017 at Maricopa, AZ, USA.\n3.2. Basal Crop Coefﬁcients\nThe basal crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kcb) time series for each plot in the breeding trial were variable\naccording\
    \ to the combined effect of planting date, irrigation rate, and cotton cultivar\
    \ on fc, as measured\nusing drone-based images (Figure 4). For example on DOY\
    \ 184 in 2016, which is approximately the\ndate of ﬁrst ﬂower, the Kcb among plots\
    \ in the ﬁrst planting varied from 0.40 to 1.09 (Figure 4a).\nThis means that\
    \ some plots were transpiring as low as 23% of full transpiration capacity on\
    \ this day,\nwhile others were transpiring as high as 88% of full capacity. As\
    \ compared to the standard trapezoidal\nKcb time series, which were computed based\
    \ on days after planting as recommended in FAO-56,\nmany plots reached full transpiration\
    \ capacity earlier than the standard, while others never reached\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2018, 10, 1682\n11 of 19\nfull transpiration capacity. The drone-based fc data\
    \ also suggested that late season Kcb remained\nhigher than the standard Kcb recommendation,\
    \ which may be true because cotton was traditionally a\nperennial plant and for\
    \ agronomic purposes requires defoliation by desiccant application to terminate\n\
    leaf growth and transpiration. Overall, to the extent that Kcb via drone-based\
    \ fc correlates to plant\ntranspiration rates, the data suggest highly variable\
    \ water use patterns among the treatments imposed\nin the cotton breeding trial.\n\

    \ indicating that some plots used up to twice as much water as others.\nEstimates\
    \ of the seasonal transpiration component of ET ranged from 389 to 1069 mm. On\
    \ average,\n0.19 kg of cotton ﬁber was produced per m3 of water consumed (i.e.,\
    \ CWUE). Considering only\nthe transpiration component of ET, mean TWUE was 0.25\
    \ kg m−3, a 26% increase as compared to\ncalculations that included surface evaporation.\
    \ This establishes an upper limit on the potential for\nCWUE improvements through\
    \ management practices that reduce surface evaporation.\nThe ﬁber quality measurements\
    \ suggested desirable ﬁber characteristics in some cases and less\ndesirable characteristics\
    \ in others. With micronaire values above 4.3, none of the plots produced ﬁber\n\
    with micronaire in the range required for premium pricing (i.e., 3.7 to 4.2).\
    \ Upper half mean length\nranged from 26 to 32 mm, indicating medium to long ﬁber\
    \ lengths. Uniformity indices ranged from 79\nto 86 mm mm−1, indicating average\
    \ to high ﬁber length uniformity. Fiber strength ranged from 27 to\n40 HVI g tex−1,\
    \ indicating average to very strong ﬁbers. Elongation at failure ranged from 4.0%\
    \ to 7.6%,\nindicating very low to high ﬁber elongation and an overall wide range\
    \ for this study. With r equal to\n0.31 and 0.33 (not shown), CWUE and TWUE, respectively,\
    \ were correlated with ﬁber elongation at\nfailure. Thus, the plots with higher\
    \ water use efﬁciency tended to produce ﬁbers that could stretch\nmore before\
    \ breaking. In addition, with r equal to 0.30 and 0.34, seasonal ET and T, respectively,\
    \ were\ncorrelated with upper half mean ﬁber length. Thus, plots with higher water\
    \ use generally produced\nlonger ﬁbers. Fiber yield did not correlate with any\
    \ ﬁber quality metrics with r greater than 0.24. Thus,\nCWUE and TWUE were better\
    \ estimators of ﬁber quality metrics than ﬁber yield in some cases.\nTable 3.\

    0.0006\n3.4. Relevance to Breeding\nImproving CWUE via plant breeding requires\
    \ the identiﬁcation of cultivars that yield highly\nbut with reduced transpiration.\
    \ An important aspect of the modeling methodology is that the crop\ncoefﬁcients\
    \ (Equation (6)) permit partitioning of water use among plant transpiration and\
    \ surface\nevaporation components. Thus, for purposes of breeding, the results\
    \ can be discussed in terms of\nTWUE, the crop yield per volume of water transpired\
    \ because breeding will primarily improve CWUE\nthrough the transpiration component\
    \ of ET.\nPlots of ﬁber yield versus seasonal transpiration demonstrated a positive\
    \ correlation for all\ngrowing season and planting date combinations (Figure 5),\
    \ generally equating higher yield with higher\nwater use as commonly shown in\
    \ crop water production functions [3]. Coefﬁcients of determination (r2)\nbetween\
    \ ﬁber yield and seasonal transpiration were higher with the second planting than\
    \ with the ﬁrst\nplanting, indicating water management was a stronger driver of\
    \ yield variability with later planting.\nBoth ﬁber yield and seasonal transpiration\
    \ were reduced with the second planting as compared to the\nﬁrst planting. The\
    \ effect was due in part to a shorter growing season for the second planting because\
    \ it\nwas planted approximately one month later than the ﬁrst planting while irrigation\
    \ for both planting\ndate treatments was terminated at the same time in early\
    \ September. Extending the irrigation period\nlater into September may have increased\
    \ ﬁber yield and transpiration for the second planting.\nReduction in seasonal\
    \ transpiration for the second planting may also be due to environmental\ndifferences.\
    \ In central Arizona, the month of June (DOY 152 to 181) typically has high ambient\n\
    temperatures and low humidity, which leads to increased evaporative demand (i.e.,\
    \ ETos). In addition,\nas seen in Figure 4, the Kcb (i.e., transpiration rate)\
    \ during this period was much higher for the ﬁrst\nplanting than for the second\
    \ planting due to higher fc. Thus, water use in the month of June was\nmuch greater\
    \ for the ﬁrst planting (Equation (6)). With the second planting, the hot and\
    \ dry period in\nJune was largely avoided, and maximum Kcb was not attained until\
    \ July when the Arizona monsoon\nseason brought higher humidity, reduced ambient\
    \ air temperatures, and lower evaporative demand.\nThus, improvements in CWUE\
    \ may come from better timing of the maximum Kcb period with the\nArizona monsoon\
    \ season. Furthermore, because r2 between ﬁber yield and transpiration was greater\n\
    for the second planting, the Arizona monsoon season may provide a better environment\
    \ for selecting\nheritable traits that improve yield and CWUE and increase genetic\
    \ gain in breeding populations.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n14 of 19\n0.0\n\

    Data were collected as part of a cotton breeding trial conducted at Maricopa,\

    \ showed signiﬁcant variation\namong planting dates and irrigation rates (Figure\
    \ 6). The TWUE for the ﬁrst 2017 planting at the\n60% irrigation rate was unreasonably\
    \ high (Figure 6c). This was likely due to errant irrigation\napplications to\
    \ those plots, which was supported by soil moisture measurements (data not shown).\n\
    After removing this treatment from consideration, DP1044B2RF (C3) and Arkot9704\
    \ (C2) demonstrated\nthe most consistent TWUE across years, planting dates, and\
    \ irrigation treatments. Furthermore, C3 was\nranked as the second highest yielding\
    \ line and also had consistent ﬁber quality traits across years\nand treatments.\
    \ This means producers should expect consistent yields with C3 and C2 over a range\n\
    of soil water status conditions. However, selecting on yield stability alone can\
    \ be unreliable due to\nthe effects of environmental variation across growing\
    \ seasons. Calculated TWUE may provide an\nalternative phenotype for selection\
    \ because aggregated environmental conditions are included in the\nestimate, thus\
    \ reducing selection error caused by environment or management variation. For\
    \ example,\nDP1044B2RF (C3) and FM958 (C5) consistently achieved higher TWUE at\

    A main advantage of the ET-based soil water balance model (Equations (6) and (7))\
    \ is its\npartitioning of crop water use into surface evaporation and plant transpiration\
    \ components via\ncrop coefﬁcients (Kcb, Ks, and Ke). As dictated by the model\
    \ equations [17], Ks and Ke are mainly\ninﬂuenced by soil water holding characteristics,\
    \ and Ke is additionally inﬂuenced by the irrigation\nsystem and ground cover.\
    \ Thus, reductions in crop water use via changes to these coefﬁcients can\nbe\
    \ achieved only through adjustments in management practices. Some options include\
    \ switching to\nsubsurface drip irrigation to limit surface evaporation, adopting\
    \ conservation tillage to increase ground\ncover, or using variable-rate irrigation\
    \ to adjust irrigation rates based on the site-speciﬁc soil water\nholding characteristics.\
    \ The remaining coefﬁcient, Kcb, is the primary driver of plant transpiration\
    \ in\nthe model. As such, reductions in crop water use via changes to Kcb can\
    \ be achieved mainly through\nplant breeding. The goal for breeding should be\
    \ to select varieties that yield highly while exhibiting\nKcb time series (Figure\
    \ 4) that reduce water use through transpiration. By incorporating models of\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n16 of 19\ncropping system processes into crop breeding\
    \ and management efforts, the improvements offered by\nmanagement versus breeding\
    \ can be better quantiﬁed.\nThe present study achieved high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of crop water use efﬁciency using\nrelatively simple imaging and modeling technologies.\
    \ Obviously, plant transpiration is dictated by\nprocesses with higher complexity\
    \ than can be described through fc time series alone. For example,\nthe processes\
    \ of root water uptake, water transport through the plant, leaf stomatal conductance,\n\
    and other plant water regulatory mechanisms are not considered in this study.\
    \ Incorporation of more\ncomplex models that consider plant water status in greater\
    \ detail may improve transpiration estimates,\nalthough models with higher complexity\
    \ often also increase the model parameterization requirements.\nTo be effective,\
    \ the model parameters would need to be accurately estimated, or perhaps phenotyped,\n\
    for each variety, which could be the subject of future studies. In this study,\
    \ a simpler model was\nchosen due to the relative ease of driving the model with\
    \ basic fc measurements from drone-based\nmultispectral imaging. A main contribution\
    \ is the use of time-series fc estimates with a simple soil\nwater balance model\
    \ to provide seasonal transpiration estimates for breeding trials at the plot-level.\n\
    As such, the relatively simple methodology provides a practical way to incorporate\
    \ information on\ncrop water use into decisions on breeding selection and may\
    \ be especially useful when the goal is to\nsimply determine which varieties to\
    \ keep in the breeding program.\nAs this study represents one of several initial\
    \ efforts with drone-based imaging at the Maricopa\nresearch station, much has\
    \ been learned over the duration of the study. Regarding the choice of\nsensors,\
    \ the commercial multispectral cameras (i.e., Micasense RedEdge and Parrot Sequoia)\
    \ were\npopular products marketed for the agricultural sector at the time of the\
    \ study, and they were therefore\ngiven primary focus for ﬂight hours. As such,\
    \ the data from these sensors more fully covered the\ngrowing season as required\
    \ for time-series fc estimates herein. An astute reader will note that fc time\n\
    series could perhaps be more easily attained from digital color (RGB) cameras,\
    \ which is a simpler\nand more pervasive imaging technology with greater commercial\
    \ options for choices of camera and\ndrone platform. Additionally, the image spatial\
    \ resolution is often higher for RGB cameras, and image\ncalibration methods are\
    \ simpler as compared to multispectral image calibration. Data from RGB\ncameras\
    \ were also collected over the ﬁeld site but with less frequency and consistency,\
    \ which made\nthese data less useful for the study. Because the Parrot Sequoia\
    \ camera collected both RGB and\nmultispectral data, efforts with this camera\
    \ in 2017 (Table 2) aimed to collect both types of data in\na single drone ﬂight.\
    \ However, the success of this approach was reduced by data reliability issues\n\
    with the camera and multiple crashes of the ﬁxed-wing drone for which the camera\
    \ was designed.\nHence, the MicaSense RedEdge camera on a custom hexacopter drone\
    \ was the favored conﬁguration\nherein. For future efforts to map fc time series,\
    \ an even better conﬁguration may be an RGB camera\non a copter-style drone, for\
    \ which there are now many commercial options. However, future studies\nshould\
    \ also further contrast the advantages and disadvantages of multispectral versus\
    \ RGB imaging\nfrom drone platforms.\nMissing from this study is the use of thermal\
    \ cameras to quantify differences in plant water status\namong varieties, which\
    \ again was related to giving primary focus for ﬂight hours to the multispectral\n\
    cameras. Incorporating canopy temperature information from thermal cameras into\
    \ the methodology\nhas great potential to improve transpiration estimates among\
    \ varieties. For example, Kullberg et al. [32]\nrecently described the use of\
    \ stationary infrared thermometry to adjust Ks in the ET-based soil water\nbalance\
    \ model (Equation (6)), applied to maize. Although their data was collected from\
    \ ground-based\nsystems rather than drones, their approach demonstrates the integration\
    \ of Kcb from RGB data and\nKs from thermal data into the ET-based soil water\
    \ balance model for quantifying maize water use.\nFuture efforts should evaluate\
    \ this data fusion technique for improved high-throughput phenotyping\nof crop\
    \ water use among crop varieties, likely using RGB and thermal data from drone-based\
    \ images\nor sensors mounted on ground-based phenotyping vehicles [25].\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n17 of 19\n5. Conclusions\nHigh-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of water use in 192 cotton breeding plots was achieved using\napproximately\
    \ weekly vegetation cover estimates from drone-based multispectral cameras to\
    \ drive\nbasal crop coefﬁcients in a daily soil water balance model. Differences\
    \ in water use estimates among\neight cotton cultivars were found via linear mixed\
    \ modeling, indicating that the approach can assist\nbreeders in the identiﬁcation\
    \ of cultivars with favorable water use characteristics. Combining the\nwater\
    \ use estimates with crop yield can quantify crop water use efﬁciency, allowing\
    \ breeders to\nselect varieties that maximize crop production per volume of water\
    \ used. Options for improving\nthe methodology include considering models with\
    \ greater complexity in crop water use processes,\nassessing alternative options\
    \ for drone-based image data collection, and incorporating other crop\nphenotypes\
    \ such as canopy temperature. Taken together, the study demonstrates a methodology\
    \ for\nhigh-throughput phenotyping of crop water use, providing breeders a tool\
    \ for water use quantiﬁcation\nand additional traits for consideration in selective\
    \ breeding.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.R.T. and A.L.T.; Methodology,\

    Water pumping is tremendously utilized in irrigation systems by many farmers worldwide.
    Irrigation technologies change rapidly from traditional irrigation activities
    that mainly depend on farmers to modern farm machinery that utilizes various machines
    and systems for water pumping and plantation process [1]. The water pump is primarily
    used for irrigation and livestock watering. Irrigation is a wide field focusing
    on water supply for growing plants and maintaining landscaping features, including
    trees, shrubs, grass, and flowers [[2], [3], [4]]. Water pumping is the key player
    in irrigation systems to supply the required water capacity at a specific area
    with adequate pressure and flow rate [5]. In conventional irrigation systems,
    farmers mainly depend on either diesel/fossil fuel-based pumps or electric-based
    pumps. However, fossil fuel and diesel-based water pumps are not environmental-friendly
    since they cause air pollution and contribute to climate change which is one of
    the serious problems in our world [[6], [7], [8]]. This is because the combustion
    of the diesel and fossil fuel release carbon dioxide which contributes in generating
    greenhouse effect and global warming and cause a risk toward human [9]. Also,
    the demand for electricity keeps increasing due to the faster development of agriculture
    in rural areas [10]. In other words, electricity deficit, fuel cost, air pollution,
    water wastage, and lack of new technologies utilization in agriculture pose significant
    concerns in conventional irrigation systems. Therefore, there is a real need for
    utilizing renewable energy resources to supply agricultural activities with the
    required energy. Solar energy is among the promising alternatives in irrigation
    systems that can be applied in agricultural activities to reduce electricity usage
    and minimize the consumed fossil fuel, especially for farmers in rural areas [11].
    It is an affordable choice for future energy compared to other renewable energies
    because of its availability in abundance, cost-effectiveness, installation cost,
    and efficiency [12]. Usually, the solar panel is attached to a voltage regulator,
    inverter, and battery to form a Photovoltaic (PV) System. Hence, the water pump
    should be equipped with a PV system to build a solar-powered water pump. In addition,
    in this era of technology, the emerging evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and advanced automation and control systems are being leveraged to realize smart
    irrigation systems with real-time monitoring and automated control. A solar-powered
    water pump with the Internet of Things (IoT) support is a promising alternative
    to overcome constraints in conventional irrigation methods. IoT is a recent paradigm
    of communication technology, where all objects with communication interfaces,
    such as sensors, appliances, smartphones, tablets, and laptops, can connect with
    each other and with the Internet. The main intention of IoT is to form a global
    and smart world using a global network system; thus, it creates a sense for data
    collection from a huge number of devices/sensors/nodes worldwide and makes it
    available over the Internet. IoT applications enhance all areas of our daily lives
    and become more inspiring and pervasive in many emerging domains, including smart
    grid, smart city, home automation, environmental monitoring, smart agriculture,
    healthcare and medical aids, and industrial automation. Consequently, integrating
    the IoT concept to construct a smart irrigation system will help farmers automate
    the water pumping operation and improve the farming and plantation process with
    less effort and cost. Generally, the greater the solar radiation, the greater
    the evapotranspiration, the greater the need for irrigation, and the greater the
    solar energy to supply power for water application. Therefore, in this paper,
    a solar-powered portable water pump is introduced by integrating a PV system with
    an electric water pump for irrigation purposes. The IoT concept is enabled to
    form a smart irrigation system that can update the collected information through
    sensors to the Internet and can be accessed by farmers using a mobile application
    via smartphones. A solar-powered water pump is a water pump that uses energy generated
    by a solar panel, so it is cost-effective and environmental-friendly. The solar
    water pump can run continuously for most of the daytime, directly from solar cells
    and during nighttime using a battery. Besides, this solar water pump is portable
    and free of power lines. It is suited for the farmer where the water resources
    are in remote locations. The system is equipped with nozzles to control the water
    flow rate and a filter for purifying the irrigation water. The portable nature
    of the multi-nozzles of the solar-powered water pump is an add-on feature that
    is required to cover a wider area and different plant kinds using a single pump;
    thus, provides more convenience to the farmers. An IoT-based control system is
    attached to the developed solar-powered water pump to form a smart irrigation
    system for real-time monitoring and remote control. The smart irrigation system
    includes a NodeMCU microcontroller, moisture and temperature/humidity sensors,
    and a relay board. The main contribution of this study is to design and fabricate
    a cost-effective solar-powered water pump with IoT integration for the smart irrigation
    system. To fulfil these requirements, this study adopts the following objectives
    and contributions: (i) Design and fabrication of a solar-powered portable water
    pump (SPWP) to save energy and fuel costs and mitigate air pollution using a renewable
    energy resource. The portability nature of the SPWP makes it easy to transport
    and relocate. (ii) Development of an IoT-based smart irrigation system (IoT-SIS)
    with an integrated algorithm to monitor the condition of the surroundings and
    remotely control the pump over the Internet using the Blynk IoT platform and mobile
    application. (iii) Implementation of the developed smart irrigation system with
    the solar-powered water pump (IoT–SIS–SPWP) in a real environment and conducting
    practical experiments to validate its performance and functionality. The rest
    of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the literature
    review and related studies. Section III presents the methods and materials. The
    system validation and performance testing are explained in Section IV. Finally,
    the article is concluded in Section V. 2. Literature review There are numerous
    areas where the rainwater is not adequate to accomplish this aim, and many of
    these regions face drought for various periods. Irrigation is the precise technology
    to cope with these issues based on several factors related to soil and crops [13].
    Water pumps are widely used in farming and irrigation systems. The normal water
    pump is powered by a diesel or fossil fuel engine to rotate. Several issues are
    rising due to the usage of such water pumps, including fuel price, maintenance
    cost, air pollution, generated noise, efficiency, and lack of remote control and
    monitoring [14]. Such water pumps need fuel or diesel as a supplement; thus, the
    farmer needs to spend extra operation costs for buying these supplements and maintaining
    the continuous operation of pumps that have a short life expectancy. Such add-on
    costs can be challenging, especially for the farmers who own their farms on a
    medium and small scale since their profit is not too much, and they cannot afford
    this high cost. Furthermore, the carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel and
    diesel into the atmosphere may also cause acid rain that can corrode the soil,
    vegetation, and crops [15]. From another perspective, using main grid electricity
    to feed electric water pumps for farming and irrigation in rural areas is another
    challenge [16]. The electricity demand is growing rapidly worldwide with the increase
    in the human population, urbanization, and modernization. About 70% of the population
    is employed in the agriculture sector, which consumed 18% of the total power generated
    compared to other sectors [17]. This is required to produce a considerable amount
    of electricity to support the energy requirements for agriculture field activities
    to secure irrigation water in all rural areas. Governments have to spend a lot
    of money and resources to meet the energy demand in agriculture, particularly
    supplying electrical energy to rural areas, which is not always an easy solution
    [18]. Recently, more attention is dedicated to current studies on real-time monitoring
    and advancement in remote control concepts over the Internet for precision irrigation,
    particularly in rural areas. It is expected that the new IoT paradigm will play
    a crucial role in the agriculture field to improve the remote control of irrigation
    systems and attain real-time information about every aspect related to plantation
    and farming activities. Therefore, smart irrigation systems that utilize various
    microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and wireless technologies to send agriculture
    and irrigation-related data to an IoT platform are necessary. Such an IoT-based
    irrigation system will help farmers to monitor their farms'' conditions over the
    Internet using their smart devices, in addition to switching ON/OFF the water
    pumps remotely via a mobile application. The solar photovoltaic system converts
    sunlight into electric energy directly through the photovoltaic effect. This solar
    photovoltaic system is a valuable and sustainable approach to overcoming the current
    environmental issue and crisis. The smallest element of a PV system is the solar
    cell. Each solar cell has two or more specially prepared layers of semiconductor
    material that produce direct current (DC) electricity when exposed to light. The
    wiring collects this DC in the panel. It is then supplied either to a DC pump,
    which pumps water whenever the sun shines or stored in batteries for later use
    by the pump. This kind of green energy can ensure energy, water, and environmental
    security. The PV system and water pump combination is a necessity, as the solar
    water pump is used widely in agricultural production. PV system does not produce
    any harmful by-products, which cause environmental pollution. Since solar energy
    is not extracted from the earth''s layers, so it will not cause any harmful pollutants
    to the surroundings. The basic working principle of a PV system is that the photovoltaic
    cell converts the solar energy from sunlight to electrical energy that can be
    used to feed loads through the controller, which keeps the battery charging during
    the daytime. The produced energy during the daytime is stored in a battery to
    be used in the nighttime. Solar photovoltaic water pumping system is an ideal
    alternative for electricity, fossil fuel, and diesel-based water pumps. In 1970,
    a study made to explore the economic feasibility and practicality of solar water
    pumps brought some effort. The solar water pump is a combination of a solar photovoltaic
    and pumping system. It involves multidisciplinary areas, including electrical,
    mechanical, electronics, civil, and computer engineering. In the past few decades,
    the world still depends on those limited and non-renewable energy sources which
    take millions of years to replenish. After industrialization, the energy demand
    increased, and the world is facing many environmental problems like acid rain,
    global warming, and greenhouse effects. The global surface temperature is 0.6°
    Celsius higher than the average temperature during 1900–2010 [19]. The main components
    of a solar water pump consist of a solar panel, pump, electric motor, water distribution
    nozzles, water filter, and controller. The electric motor used in the water pump
    is to rotate the pump and manages the AC or DC. Besides, the function of the controller
    in the water pump is to adjust the motor speed and the output power. The solar
    water pump is more efficient and economical than the traditional water pump; it
    is extremely useful for the farmer who works on a small and medium-scale farm.
    This kind of solar water pump is not only used in the crop; it can also be used
    in feeding, gardens, and irrigation. The operation concept of the solar water
    pump is simple, where the solar panel collects the solar energy from the sun and
    converts it into electrical energy through the silicon wafers embedded in the
    solar photovoltaic panel. The electric energy is then transferred to a DC-based
    motor pump system which operates the motor. The motor rotates the shaft, coupled
    to the mono-block pump, and the pump starts lifting the groundwater. There are
    two types of water pumps, which are surface water pumps and submersible water
    pumps. The surface water pump is suitable for lifting and pumping the water from
    a maximum depth of 20 m, while a submersible water pump can be used in an area
    of greater depth of 50 m [20]. In [21], the authors proposed a user-friendly,
    reliable, and automated 3- phase water pump control system based on Wi-Fi to be
    used by farmers. The system includes monitoring electric supply availability,
    the water level inside the reservoir, the water flow rate, and water pump short
    circuit conditions. The NodeMCU ESP8266 is the microcontroller of this system.
    However, system design is very sensitive and should be handled with utmost care
    because the microcontroller is a 5 V device. It is employed to control a high-voltage
    3-phase irrigation pump. Ref. [22] focused on multiple factors that influence
    the PV water pump performance. They claimed that the cell''s temperature, PV module
    degradation, incidence angle, surface dust, and efficiency of the motor pump have
    the most impact on the system performance. In addition, mismatching, self-shading,
    and shadowing are other involved factors that affect the performance of solar-powered
    pumps. In Ref. [23], the authors determined the number of PV modules and the pumping
    power that is required in PV-based water pumps with a battery bank. A comparison
    study between conventional pumps and solar-powered pumps was carried out regarding
    the required cost for installation, operation, maintenance, and total life cycle.
    The results proved that the PV-based water pumps saved a lot of fuel and engine
    oil costs, which results in reducing CO2, air pollution, and noise. The study
    considered other geographical characteristics, flowrate and optimum tilt angle.
    A study in Ref. [24] addressed the simultaneous operation of irrigation areas
    using standalone solar pumps. Such a system entails the direct application of
    the pumped water to the different sectors depending on the reservoir; thus, it
    decreases the total cost and eliminates the evaporation process. The authors developed
    a model based on linear programming. The model operation is based on the required
    water volume and the PV power. The result proved that the simultaneous operation
    of PV-based pumps provided higher efficiency and saved energy compared to the
    individual operation. In Ref. [25], the authors devoted the study to developing
    an IoT-based system for solar water pumping, which can be operated and controlled
    via a vision-based technique using a fuzzy-based algorithm. The system observes
    the soil moisture, temperature, and humidity and runs the pump accordingly. The
    system also supports manual and remote control by the user and controls automatically
    via the Fuzzy-based control mode. Ref. [26] highlighted the design and implementation
    of a water pumping system based on the health of plants. The system model supports
    the automatic start/stop of the electric motor based on water threshold values.
    The study analyzed the sensor data to decide on irrigation time according to plant
    health status with the plant''s threshold value. An emergency notification about
    plant health will be sent to the farmer via email over the IoT platform when needed.
    The farmer also can access information regarding to soil and environment parameters
    including soil pH value and moisture, temperature and flame values through Graphical
    User Interface (GUI) to decide whether the plants need to be irrigated. In this
    regard, PV-based water pumping is among the viable alternatives in irrigation
    systems that have attracted considerable attention and have been deployed in numerous
    remote regions. Such solar-powered pumps can be used in various applications to
    supply water in rural areas ranging from irrigation to livestock. PV-based pumps
    have many features that make them attractive to be a substitute for conventional
    water pumping systems. It is based on green and clean energy without carbon dioxide
    emission (no fossil fuel), eco-friendly, reliable, with no noise, and low cost
    for operation and maintenance. The reported literature proved that solar-powered
    water pumps are more economical and can compete in low pumping capacities than
    conventional fuel-based pumps and wind-powered pumps. Some studies focused on
    the configuration parameters of the water pumping system, and others studied motors
    and pump types based on applications. Some addressed controlling water pumping
    systems, while other studies were devoted to analyzing various economic and environmental
    parameters. Although many solar-powered water pumping systems are already implemented
    in many countries, it still limited to small and medium scales and need to be
    promoted at a large scale. Integration of IoT-control concepts is necessary to
    convince farmers in remote areas to switch their manual/local control pumps with
    the remote IoT-based PV water pumping system. Such an IoT system is required to
    persuade farmers that solar-powered pumps with automation capabilities and real-time
    monitoring are the correct option to reduce production costs, increase irrigation
    efficiency, improve plantation quality, and keep plants safe and healthy. Such
    transformation is necessary for developing nations where agriculture is the main
    activity, and solar irradiance is sufficient throughout the year. Overall, many
    studies instigated solar-powered water pump applications in irrigation systems.
    However, to the best of our knowledge, limited studies focused on developing IoT-based
    smart irrigation using solar-powered water pumping systems. In addition, none
    of the previous studies focused on using a portable PV-based water pump as a standalone
    system in farming activities. Most of the proposed systems were not validated
    in a natural environment, even though they were tested in LABs using simulation
    models or prototypes. Therefore, we developed a portable solar-powered water pump
    with an IoT-enabled controller as an innovative irrigation system in this study.
    The NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller enables users to send commands towards the
    pump according to the collected readings from the sensors. A mobile application
    to monitor the pump and control the system has been created, and it can be used
    from a certain distance with the use of an internet connection. Thus, it can be
    accessed anywhere and anytime when the Internet connection is available. This
    will lessen the burden on the user and increase the efficiency of the water pump.
    For instance, the farmer can start and stop water pumping through the phone without
    being close to the water pump. A mobile application is used to remotely control
    the on-and-off operation of the water pump from smartphones and to monitor the
    surroundings over the Blynk IoT platform. 3. Methods and materials This section
    defines the methods and research activities adopted in this study, including the
    methodical organization of various research phases in conjunction with the detailed
    design and implementation of the proposed solar-powered water pump with the IoT-based
    smart irrigation system. Moreover, the components selection and their integration
    are explained in detail to fulfil the design objectives. A portable solar-powered
    pump for the IoT-based irrigation system was fabricated. The hardware development
    of the IoT-based system was carried out by utilizing the NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi
    module as a microcontroller, and sensors were selected to measure the considered
    parameters. The relay board has been decided to control the switching process
    of the pump. After that, software was developed by integrating the required sensor
    libraries using Arduino IDE as the interface between the NodeMCU and the programming
    device. The arrangement/sequence of the code must be improved according to the
    thought of the entire water pumping system, whether which sensor runs first and
    then followed by the next sensor with each action once the sensors are triggered.
    The Blynk IoT platform was chosen as the IoT cloud to save the collected data
    updated over Wi-Fi to the Internet. A mobile GUI was designed to display the updated
    readings from the sensor and enable the remote control of the water pump using
    smartphones. The detailed research activities are illustrated in the flowchart
    of Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (775KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Flowchart of research activities. 3.1. System modelling The proposed
    system architecture of IoT–SIS–SPWP is described in Fig. 2. In the developed system,
    the sun rays are applied on two solar panels (50 W each) to generate the electrical
    power used to power the high-pressure auto diaphragm water pump with the DC motor
    set. The extra energy will be stored in the 12 V battery through the solar charger
    controller. The battery used is a Panasonic lead-acid 12 V, 7.5 Ah battery that
    copes with the micro diaphragm water pump. The battery capacity can supply electricity
    to the motor for up to 3 h whenever required during night irrigation activities.
    The microcontroller collects the data from the utilized sensors and sends it to
    the Blynk IoT cloud server over the Wi-Fi interface of the NodeMCU and, at the
    same time, forwards the farmer''s switching commands to the SPWP. The NodeMCU
    connects to the Internet via the nearest Wi-Fi access point. The farmer will be
    able to remotely monitor the surrounding conditions in the farm (soil moisture,
    temperature, and humidity) using the GUI based on the Blynk mobile application
    through Internet-connected smartphones. The sensors are connected to the input
    GPIOs of NodeMCU, and a four-channel relay module is connected to the output GPIOs.
    The farmer also can receive notifications for abnormal conditions via the same
    app. when some threshold values are exceeded. Download : Download high-res image

    Accordingly, the farmer can switch ON/OFF the solar-powered water pump for irrigation
    purposes when needed. The DC pump is a water-pressure diaphragm pump of 12 V,
    8 A, and 100 W. The maximum output water pressure is 0.8 MPa with a maximum flow
    rate of 6.5 L per minute. The pump is connected to a hose pipe with multi-nozzles
    to spry the water during the irrigation process at different pressure and flow
    rates. Also, the pump is coupled with a water filter to improve the irrigation
    water quality for keeping plants healthy and in good condition. The mobility support
    of the system allows its movement and reallocation based on demand. 3.2. System
    design The IoT–SIS–SPWP system layout has been designed using NX10, as shown in
    Fig. 3. The parts or components of the SPWP are a polypropylene luggage toolbox
    (the overall body), two solar panels 50 W, a hose pipe''s hook, an extendable
    holder, and a cover box to store electrical components of the IoT-SIS, metal support,
    battery, and water pump. It also shows the dimension of the overall parts of the
    IoT–SIS–SPWP. We aim to build an ergonomic design of a solar water pump to fit
    the people who use this water pump. Proper ergonomic design is necessary to prevent
    repetitive strain injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders. It is relevant
    in designing such things as safe furniture and easy-to-use interfaces. The solar
    water pump is more compactable and lightweight. The luggage design makes this
    water pump portable, and the size is ergonomic and suitable for smallholder irrigation.
    The design of this portable solar water pump is inspired by wheeled travel luggage.

    Fig. 3. System design dimensions. The designed IoT–SIS–SPWP system will be used
    in the area alienated from the electricity grid. The implementation of solar power
    would reduce energy costs such as fuel and electricity. The usage of solar power
    benefits long-term savings, but it also promotes the usage of renewable energy
    and reduces pollution. However, the usage of solar energy has a major challenge
    which is theft. Making the system portable is beneficial as it could be transported
    anywhere and stored safely in storage. The water pump body is made of polypropylene.
    Polypropylene is a rugged and highly chemical-resistant material often used as
    material for toolboxes. It has similar properties to polyethylene but is more
    challenging and more heat resistant. Durable and lightweight making it suitable
    for encasing electrical equipment in a work environment with additional resistance
    to chemicals, making it suitable for usage in the marine environment. It is also
    heat resistant, which makes it suitable for usage under prolonged sunlight. Polypropylene
    seems to be destined to increase its importance as raw material for the production
    of plastics due to its excellent thermal and mechanical properties, low cost,
    and versatility of uses. For the hose, we use Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) garden
    hose with polyester fibre reinforcement. This hose has excellent chemical and
    physical properties, very ideal for conveying water, widely used in construction,
    agriculture, fishery, project, household, and industrial service. It could handle
    temperatures ranging from −10 °C to +65 °C. PVC hose also has good abrasion resistance
    making it suitable for a rugged environment. Since there are many types of hose
    based on oil-resistant elastomers and many specifications for each type, sometimes
    with conflicting requirements, it is impossible to generalize regarding current
    uses or future trends. PVC blends are used in covers when excellent abrasion resistance
    is required. We use a portable water filter with hollow fibre membranes (HFMs)
    as filter material for water filtration. HFM was initially developed in the 1960s
    for reverse osmosis applications; it has become prevalent in water treatment.
    HFM could ensure that no pathogens can slip through removing substances such as
    Bacteria, Protozoa, E. Coli, Giardia, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella Typhi, Leptospirosis,
    and microplastics. The amount of solar energy collected by a solar panel is a
    function of local solar radiation, ground reflection property, and collecting
    a panel''s tilt and orientation. The orientation and the tilt of a solar panel
    strongly affect the amount of the collected yield. Therefore, solar panels must
    be slanted and oriented at optimum angles to collect the maximum solar energy
    available in a specific region. The best method to optimize the tilt and the orientation
    of a solar panel is by applying an active sun tracker. Active sun trackers are
    electromechanical or pure mechanical devices that keep changing the tilt and the
    orientation of a solar panel/solar array periodically during the day. However,
    the capital cost of such a system is high, and it consumes energy during tracking.
    Thus, changing the tilt angle and the orientation monthly, seasonal, or yearly
    for a photovoltaic (PV) panel, as in our system, maybe more feasible than applying
    an active sun tracker. 3.3. System fabrication After the design phase, we started
    the fabrication and installation phase of the portable solar water pump since
    it is the central part of the proposed system. Besides that, the structural analysis
    is compulsory to ensure that this design can support all the load weight. Next,
    the type of material used to build the water pump frame is identified and obtained
    from the supplier. After that, the inspection was conducted immediately after
    the material was received to avoid any defects happening. The overall fabrication
    process sequence is illustrated in Fig. 4. Basic manufacturing processes, including
    welding, grinding, cutting, and many others, have their safety precautions. Extreme
    caution should be exercised when using any tool to prevent injury to personnel.
    While working in a machines room, rules and regulations need to be obeyed for
    our safety. Safety measures need to be taken into account at our workplace are
    likes wearing safety boots, jackets, face shields, and gloves when handling tools
    and machines. The machinist should not wear a watch, jewellery, other accessories,
    or loose clothes that can cause trouble to them when handling the machine. Every
    different type of operation on machines must be conducted followed by the correct
    procedure and tools to avoid accidents happening in the machine room. The floor
    must always dry to avoid slipperiness, and the table must be cleaned repeatedly.
    For metal support, firstly, the mild steel bar is cut into four parts. Then, the
    metal bar edges are ground and polished using a grinder and sander. The metal
    was then welded together and fitted onto the luggage box using a drill and rivet.

    screws and hinges, and a slider is attached on the top and bottom of the solar
    panel. Then, sheet metal is sheared and bent using a shearing machine and press
    brakes. The PV Panels, sheet metal, and luggage box are attached using screws,
    rivets, and L-section. Then, the placements of the filter and pump and the box
    containing microcontrollers, as shown in Fig. 5. Then, the solar controller and
    hose hanger are attached to the solar water pump sides, as shown in Fig. 6. For
    final adjustment, L-section is attached to parts for durability. Latches are added
    to the solar panel to avoid turning when transporting. Fig. 7 depicts the finished
    system product of the solar-powered water pump with the implemented IoT-SIS controller.

    Components selection Hardware and software components are crucial and essential
    in the design of IoT systems. NodeMCU ESP8266 is used in our system as it is a
    single-board microcontroller intended to make the application of interactive objects
    or environments more accessible. It is a cost-effective and open-source physical
    computing platform with an extensible software development environment for board
    programming. It is used to gather data read by the sensors and upload the data
    to the MQTT server. Besides, it also receives commands given by the user to do
    specific tasks via the MQTT server. NodeMCU consists of a physical programmable
    circuit board like any other development board, such as Arduino and Raspberry
    Pi. This microcontroller can be used to develop interactive objects, taking inputs
    from various switches or sensors and controlling a variety of relays, lights,
    motors, and other actuators. We use NodeMCU ESP8266 as the microcontroller to
    enable farmers to observe sensor readings and pass the command towards the water
    pump. The NodeMCU is attached with a Wi-Fi interface to be connected to the Internet
    via a hotspot. NodeMCU has 17 GPIO pins that can be allocated to different functions
    such as I2C, I2S, UART, PWM, IR remote control, LED light, and button programmatically.
    Thus, it is a good candidate for IoT applications with a limited number of sensors
    and actuators like our system. NodeMCU has a ready-to-use structure as it comes
    in a complete package form, including the 5 V regulator, a burner, an oscillator,
    a micro-controller, a serial communication interface, LED, and headers for the
    connections. The programming of the NodeMCU can be done by using Arduino software,
    an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), to write the code of instructions
    and upload it to the microcontroller. For NodeMCU, a beginner would need to learn
    a new programming method different from Arduino but much easier. This is because
    the programming environment is easy to use for beginners yet flexible enough for
    advanced users to take advantage of. The required coding to initiate the connection
    between NodeMCU, sensors, and actuators can be developed via Arduino IDE and uploaded
    to the NodeMCU memory. It represents the heart of IoT systems since it acts as
    a sensing node and a gateway simultaneously. We have used the Wi-Fi module to
    create a mobile application to remotely control the water pump on and off operation
    from smartphones. A mobile application to monitor and control the system has been
    created. It can be used from anywhere and anytime over an internet connection.
    The real-time monitoring and control will lessen the user''s burden and increase
    the efficiency of the water pump. Soil moisture sensor measures the water content
    in the soil. The relation between the measured property and soil moisture must
    be calibrated and may vary on environmental factors such as soil type, temperature,
    or electric conductivity. Reflected microwave radiation is affected by soil moisture
    and is used for remote sensing in hydrology and agriculture. Farmers or gardeners
    can use portable probe instruments. Soil moisture sensors typically refer to sensors
    that estimate volumetric water content. Another class of sensors measures another
    property of moisture in soils called water potential. The FC-28 soil moisture
    sensor is mounted at the side of the system to measure the soil moisture at the
    farm. This module also includes a potentiometer that will fix the threshold value,
    & the comparator-LM393 can evaluate the value. The LED will turn on/off based
    on the threshold value. The sensor needs to be placed into the soil, and the measurement
    of the soil moisture will be exposed and then data uploaded to the Blynk application.
    DHT11 is a primary, ultra-low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It
    uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding
    air and spits a digital signal on the data pin (no analogue input pins are needed).
    It is relatively simple to use but requires careful timing to grab data. The only
    real downside of this sensor is that it can only update new data once every 2
    s. The sensor is utilized in our system to measure the surrounding temperature
    and humidity. DHT11 with its jumpers are mounted at the side of the prototype,
    upper the toolbox in a drilled hole. Thus, the DHT11 sensor can be exposed to
    the surrounding temperature and measured to be uploaded to the Blynk application.
    DHT11 sensor has four pins- VCC, GND, Data Pin, and a not connected pin. A pull-up
    resistor of 5 k to 10 k ohms is provided for communication between the sensor
    and the microcontroller. A 4-channel 5 V DC relay module is exploited in this
    study to perform the switching of the pump and any other actuators if necessary.
    It can also be used to control various appliances and equipment with a large current.
    The relay is energized or reenergized based on the received signals from the NodeMCU
    depending on the farmer''s commands. It is equipped with high-current relays that
    work under AC 250 V 10 A or DC 30 V 10 A. It has a standard interface that can
    be controlled directly by the microcontroller. The Arduino IDE is a cross-platform
    application that is written in the C++ programming language. It is used to write
    and upload programs to Arduino-compatible boards, but also with the help of third-party
    cores, and other vendor development boards. It connects to the Arduino and Genuino
    hardware to upload programs and communicate with them. Support for third-party
    hardware can be added to the hardware directory of the sketchbook directory. Platforms
    installed may include board definitions (which appear in the board menu), core
    libraries, bootloaders, and programmer definitions. Coding for this project has
    included all types of sensors, including DHT11 sensors and soil moisture sensors.
    The specific library of all these sensors has been applied to ensure all the sensor
    is working correctly. Next, the ESP8266 NodeMCU''s library has been included in
    the program for the communication feature between the user and the microcontroller
    system. AT command has been used as the tool to send feedback and receive a command
    from the user. 3.5. Circuit design and installation As stated earlier, the proposed
    solar-powered water pump has been fabricated—this phase is devoted to the description
    of hardware and software development of the proposed IoT-SIS system. The selected
    electrical/electronic components need to be connected to form the control circuit
    installed in the controller box of the developed IoT–SIS–SPWP. This control circuit
    will be used to monitor and control the fabricated solar-powered water pump over
    the Internet. The control circuit is installed into the controller box after finishing
    the testing and verification. Before that, all components are connected according
    to the schematic diagram as shown in Fig. 8, which also illustrates the virtual
    connection of electrical components using Fritzing software. Download : Download
    high-res image (287KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Circuit diagram
    of the system. Then the components are installed on the breadboard to confirm
    that the circuit works correctly before finalizing the connections and attaching
    them to the entire system. As shown in Fig. 9, the developed IoT control system
    of the solar-powered DC water pump motor set is equipped with a 5 V power source,
    NodeMCU ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module, soil moisture sensor, temperature/humidity sensor,
    and relays. After successfully testing each component individually, all the components
    were assembled and connected to the NodeMCU. The required coding has been developed
    using Arduino IDE. LED was used as the replacement for the actual pump to check
    sensor functionality. During this phase, many tests have been conducted, and improvements
    have been suggested when necessary. The errors and problems that we faced during
    the testing procedure were identified and fixed. This step was repeated until
    a successful product was obtained. After compiling all the programming codes into
    the NodeMCU, the actuators (relay module and DC motor) were used for the practical
    testing by implementing the circuit to the proposed system, as shown in Fig. 10.
    A GUI based on the Blynk IoT platform has been developed to display the gathered
    information from sensors and allow the farmer to control the water pump using
    a smartphone. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Control circuit with the DC water pump. Download : Download high-res
    image (381KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Installation of all
    components in the controller box. As an example of the improvement and optimization
    process, initially, the reading from the sensors was unable to be uploaded to
    the Blynk application server. The reading can only be viewed on the serial monitor
    of the Arduino IDE software. The relay module could only switch on/off by the
    sensors themselves when a certain requirement was triggered. After some reconstruction
    of the coding, the reading obtained from the sensors could be updated on the IoT
    server. The problem of uploading and fetching the data was solved, but the relays
    were acting the opposite way from the user''s command. When the user remoted the
    relay to turn on via mobile apps or pc, the relay was turned off instead. Hence,
    the coding for receiving the command from the server for turning on/off the relay
    was remodified. The portable solar water pump was placed in the direction that
    sunlight incident directly on the solar panel. The solar water pump was connected
    and controlled by the application on the mobile phone. 3.6. System operational
    procedure The temperature and humidity sensor and soil moisture sensor send the
    collected data directly to the microcontroller via the connected wires. The NodeMCU
    receives and uploads data to the Blynk server using the Wi-Fi module. After the
    program coding was uploaded in the NodeMCU, the data can be accessed using any
    device, mainly smartphones with Internet access in this case. In our coding, we
    have developed an algorithm to gather the information from the sensors and passed
    to the cloud as in Algorithm 1. The system operates based on the developed coding
    in the microcontroller. The water pump is set to turn on using Blynk mobile application.
    The sensor readings would be detected and set up in the coding to measure the
    surrounding of the farm and the operation hour of the water pump. According to
    the Blynk application, the readings of moisture, temperature, and humidity will
    be displayed based on the unit decided by the user. The farmer will observe the
    sensors'' readings in real-time, and according to predefined threshold values,
    he will be able to decide whether to switch on/off the water pump. The IoT server
    will receive the command from the Blynk GUI on the farmer''s smartphone or the
    Blynk homepage and send the command to the microcontroller to switch on/off the
    water pump using the application. It will be sent to the microcontroller to switch
    on the relays. Thus, the water pump status and the reading of sensors are displayed
    on the application to check the farm''s surroundings or where the testing took
    place. If the relay is energized, the water pump will be switched on. Then, the
    water flow starts from the pump to the filter and next to the irrigation system
    as planned. When the user presses the switch-off button on the GUI, the water
    pump will be turned off. Algorithm 1 Monitoring and control algorithm for IoT–SIS–SPWP

    4. Experimental results and validation The SPWP-IoT-SIS system has been designed
    and fabricated, as stated in the previous section. In this section, the system''s
    functionality and performance will be tested and evaluated. We have conducted
    practical experiments in two different environments to evaluate multiple criteria,
    including water quality, flow rate, energy consumption, and IoT system functionality.
    We have successfully tested the developed system in both offsite and onsite testing
    in this context. The offsite testing was held at the LAB and workshop, while the
    onsite testing was held at UMP Pilot Fertigation Farm. Before starting the system
    development, a site visit was conducted to obtain information regarding the farm.
    Our system prototype could be deployed at the farm to check its applicability
    and compatibility in real environments. From the site visit, we get information
    on the coverage area of the farm, the fertigation way that is used at the farm,
    the quantity of the plants on the farm, the type of water pumping system used
    in the farm, and the system operation hour. Since our system composes several
    main components including a solar panel, DC motor, water pump, water filter, irrigation
    nozzles, and IoT-system components, several tests were conducted. 4.1. Experimental
    setup The proposed SPWP-IoT-SIS system was placed at the UMP Pilot Fertigation
    Farm during the onsite testing phase, as shown in Fig. 11. The University Malaysia
    Pahang (Gambang area) latitude is 3°43′23 North, and the longitude is 103°7′16
    East. The system is powered on and connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi access
    point. The DC water pump was connected to the solar panel. After attaching the
    inlet port of the pump with a suction pipe, priming was done. The inlet port of
    the solar water pump was connected to the water pump in the irrigation system
    of the Fertigation Farm. Another hose pipe was attached to the end of the outlet
    of the water pump. After that, the solar water pump was switched on via the Blynk
    GUI by using the mobile phone. Download : Download high-res image (757KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Onsite system setup. 4.2. Power and water
    flow rate comparison In the first step, we have devoted our focus to determining
    and comparing the generated power from the solar panel with respect to irradiance
    for different water flow rates of the pump. The system has two solar panels with
    50 Watts per panel. In the onsite testing and offsite system testing, the proposed
    solar water pump performance has been observed, measured, and evaluated. The voltage,
    current, and power consumed by the water pump and the flow rate of the water pump
    were measured and recorded. The DC water pump is designed on the basic requirement
    of the agriculture product. The power of the pump is obtained from Eq. (1): (1)
    where V is the DC voltage, I is the current, and P is the power of the water pump.
    As stated earlier, our SPWP is attached with multi-nozzles to control the water
    flow rate and a filter for purifying the irrigation water. Such features enable
    our system to conveniently cover a wider area and diverse plants using a portable
    pump. The system can pump the water at different flow rates using six nozzles:
    cone, quad, fan, flat, soaker, and jet. Each nozzle type has a different water
    flow rate and required a specific amount of power. Water was discharged, and its
    volume was measured to determine the water flow rate according to Eq. (2), where
    6 L of water are collected, and the time taken to collect the water is estimated.
    (2) The six types of nozzles'' performance are analyzed in terms of flow rate,
    voltage, and power. The data is collected and tabulated to compare the voltage,
    power, irradiance, and flow rate of six different types of nozzles, as listed
    in Table 1. The obtained results for the voltage measurements are between 11.0
    V and 11.8 V, while the current is between 6.8 and 7.3 A. The power is roughly
    between 74.8 W and 86 Watts. The difference between the highest value and the
    lowest value for the voltage, current, and power readings is typically based on
    the different irradiance received by the panel during each nozzle type and the
    impact of the flow rate of each nozzle. From the table, it can be seen that the
    voltage and the power for the cone nozzle are the highest compared to the other
    five nozzles. The voltage, current, and power for the cone nozzle are 11.8 V,
    7.3 A, and 86.14 W, respectively. This data proves that the solar panel absorbs
    more sunlight irradiance, thus providing more voltage, current, and power than
    the other five nozzles. While for the jet nozzle, the electrical parameters have
    the lowest readings compared to the other nozzles. The voltage, current, and power
    readings are 11.0 V, 6.8 A, and 74.8 W. This data proves that the solar panel
    absorbs less sunlight and provides less voltage, current, and power compared to
    the other five nozzles, as shown clearly in Fig. 12. Table 1. Data for each nozzle.

    parameters. Based on the trend of the growth data of the irradiance reading, as
    the solar irradiance increases, the power generated by the solar panel will be
    higher and more power will be supplied to the water pump with different nozzles.

    of the water pump is measured in L/min. The water pump''s discharge was measured
    by a volumetric method by collecting 6 L of water in a container. The subsequent
    time taken to fill up the container was recorded using a stopwatch. The same was
    repeated for the other five nozzles, and the average of all the nozzles was considered.
    As shown in the figure, the maximum flow rate has occurred with the cone nozzle,
    which is 4.20 L/min due to the highest generated voltage by the panel, 11.8 V.
    The cone nozzle required 1.43 min to discharge 6-Liter water. This flow rate indicates
    that the solar panel supplied more power to the cone nozzle causing the cone nozzle
    to have the highest flow rate. However, the jet nozzle has the minimum flow rate
    among the six nozzles, due to there being slightly unstable voltage causing less
    power to be used by the jet nozzle. The jet nozzle required 2.00 min to discharge
    6 L of water. Hence, the flow rate for the jet nozzle is 3.00 L/min. From the
    graph, it can be concluded that the higher the power supplied to each type of
    nozzle, the lesser time is used to discharge the water, and the higher the flow
    rate can be achieved. The second highest flow rate occurred with the soaker nozzle,
    which required 1.45 min to discharge the 6 L of water. Hence the flow rate for
    the soaker nozzle is 4.14 L/min. The flow rate for the soaker nozzle is very close
    to the cone nozzle. These values prove that the power supplied to both the cone
    nozzle and soaker nozzle is almost the same. The supplied power is stable for
    the cone nozzle and soaker nozzle. 4.3. IoT–SIS–SPWP validation The IoT–SIS–SPWP
    system allows the user to remotely control the solar-powered water pump for irrigation
    using an Internet-connected smartphone. The Blynk IoT platform has been integrated
    into the mobile irrigation application, and a developed dashboard can be used
    to monitor and control the proposed system. The Blynk application allows the user
    to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. It also enables the remote
    control of the SPWP over the Internet at any time from anywhere. Fig. 14 depicts
    the developed GUI that we initially used to control the water pump over IoT and
    monitor the surroundings in the farm during the onsite testing. Download : Download

    dashboard. This GUI has been developed and integrated into the Arduino IDE coding
    uploaded to the t NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller. Such GUI can be improved and
    expanded by including more widgets and indicators for any suggested improvements
    like adding more sensors for monitoring (raindrop and flow rate) or more actuators
    to control the solenoid valve. The data measured from the soil moisture sensor
    and temperature & humidity sensor can be obtained in the Blynk application. The
    application is synchronized and displays readings that are uploaded by the NodeMCU
    microcontroller in the IoT–SIS–SPWP system. The soil moisture sensor will detect
    the soil moisture on the farm to notify the user to turn on the water pump according
    to the soil moisture condition. The same goes for the temperature & humidity sensor
    to detect the surrounding places for the user to turn on and off the water pump
    at the farm. The data readings of the sensors are displayed in real-time. The
    user needs to install the Blynk App. which is compatible with Android and iOS
    operating systems of smartphones. It can be downloaded from the Apps stores of
    any mobile phone. The application''s name is “Blynk,” which is synchronized with
    the IoT server Blynk account. During the synchronization process, the targeted
    server address is required, followed by the host port, the username, and the specified
    authentication token given by the server. Onetime information regarding the hotspot
    will be configured in the coding to connect the system to the Internet. As the
    device is connected to the Internet, the Blynk application is started up. All
    the readings and buttons of the GUI could be viewed and activated. The water pump
    switch icons would turn green whenever the system was turned on, while the icon
    turned black would indicate the water pump was off. From the figure, three displayed
    blocks could be found with some values. Those blocks were the place where the
    data from the sensors would be uploaded. The humidity and soil moisture value
    displayed is in percentage while the temperature is in . The system functionality
    and performance have been validated. After completing the onsite testing of our
    system, we have done some improvements and optimization based on the recommendation
    and suggestions by UMP Pilot Fertigation Farm management. We have implemented
    one more sensor for raindrop detection in our system, and we have modified the
    coding and Blynk GUI accordingly. Implementing such a sensor is to increase the
    data reliability of other sensors that are almost related to each other, including
    moisture, raindrop, temperature, and humidity. Since our system is a part of an
    ongoing research project, the expansion and improvements based on feedback from
    the industry and society are considered. The current version of our system is
    still being improved to be implemented in a Palm Oil Farm in collaboration with
    the industry. The updated Blynk GUI is shown in Fig. 15. We can monitor more surrounding
    conditions, and notification functionality has been enabled. Download : Download

    a solar-powered and portable water pump with an IoT-controlled irrigation system,
    where sensors collect information about moisture, humidity, and temperature together
    for efficient monitoring and water pumping via a mobile application. We have considered
    several limitations in the conventional water pump to be solved in the proposed
    system: cost-effectiveness, saving energy, supporting pump mobility, facilitating
    remote monitoring and operation, and enabling IoT solutions in agriculture. For
    the coexistence of different microcontrollers used by various applications, we
    have selected the NodeMCU due to its low price, small size, low energy consumption,
    and good performance with Wi-Fi support. In addition, select the open-source Blynk
    IoT platform with a mobile application to receive the collected data from sensors
    and store it in the cloud. The developed portable solar water pump can efficiently
    use a renewable energy resource and be controlled remotely using smartphones.
    Six types of nozzles have been tested and evaluated regarding the implemented
    system''s consumed energy and flow rate in a real environment. The cone nozzle
    has the highest power and flow rate among the six nozzles, while the jet nozzle
    has the lowest power and flow rate. Furthermore, the exploited water filter succeeds
    in filtering the pumped water for irrigation purposes. Since this paper is a part
    of an ongoing project, in the future, more functionalities will be enabled, such
    as pump automation based on the sensor readings. More sensors can be added to
    monitor more irrigation-related parameters, such as water quality sensors, GPS,
    flow rate, and light sensors. Furthermore, the developed Blynk-based dashboard
    can be extended by adding more gadgets and indicators. In this project, there
    are some limitations found during the testing phase. The circuit system requires
    a stable network connection. Whenever NodeMCU is disconnected from the network,
    it will try to reconnect the network. However, if the network is disconnected,
    the system will not be functioning. Thus, the utilization of long-range communication
    technology is among the considered improvements in our system in the nearest future.
    Besides that, the prototype''s weight is unfulfilled to the target. The heavyweight
    could be due to the implemented two solar panels to supply more power to the system
    during the day activities and store some energy in the battery. However, the system''s
    portability has decreased the weight effects and can be easily moved within the
    deployment site. Other than that, the system needs to be more automated to switch
    on/off the pump and the valve based on threshold values rather than remote control
    by the farmer. For example, we did not set a specific range of optimum temperature
    and humidity values of the surrounding; thus, we would not receive any notifications
    via the mobile application to activate the water pumping system. Therefore, a
    fully automated irrigation system with a minimum of manual requirements will be
    among our future works. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare

    wireless sensor network system shows a data analysis approach within greenhouses
    in short cycle crops. This research, on the one hand, is carried out to reduce
    water consumption and improve the product by predicting the right moment of the
    irrigation cycle through the evapotranspiration criterion. On the other hand,
    an efficient electronic system is designed under the electronic standard. To define
    the best model to define the next irrigation in the crops in base to ground humidity,
    the algorithms are compared for continuous and discontinuous multivariate regressions.
    The results are evaluated with different criteria of prediction errors. As a result,
    the linear regression with Support Vector Machine model is chosen for counting
    an average deviation error of 7.89% and an error variability of 4.48%. In addition,
    water consumption is reduced by 20%, achieving better quality products. Published

    SECTION I. Introduction Agricultural production is one of the pillars of rural
    development and food security worldwide. Some of the most important agricultural
    productions are cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. For instance, approximately
    70 million tons of cabbage are produced every year worldwide covering an area
    of 3.8 million of acres in almost 150 countries. China and India are the main
    producers with 8.9 and 7.7 million of tons per year respectively which represents
    the 74% of global production [9] . Additionally, 20 millions of tons of broccoli
    and cauliflower are produced in an area of 1.6 million of acres worldwide. Due
    to population growing and changes in diet customs, production of vegetables has
    increased in 20% in the last five years. According this, global imports of vegetables
    in 2014 were around 29,500 million of dollars which represents 3.6 % of global
    production using a price of 0.67 USD per kg [4] . The demand of water supply for
    agriculture and livestock is increasing according population and economic growth
    worldwide; in fact, water consume represents the 70% of total consume and in some
    cases, like developed countries, this consume reaches up to 95%. This tendency
    is also influenced by the constant growing of food demand which will cause that
    to satisfy these global requirements, more water is needed every year [5] . In
    order to reduce water consumption and improve the quality of production, in early
    90s the precision agriculture system was developed as a promising technique and
    it was applied in several countries. At the beginning, the efficiency of the technique
    depended of the knowledge and technology available at that time; however, years
    later, the precision agriculture was combined with techniques used in process
    automation. This approach allowed to use electronics to collect, process, and
    analyze several data simultaneously for decision making [12] . The most common
    electronic systems used in greenhouses are the wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    which can be defined as an electronic system composed of memory blocks, data input/output
    blocks, communication ports, and a battery. For this reason, a WSN is mainly used
    for data acquisition in environments where traditional systems are inefficient
    or costly. Moreover, an advantage of a WSN is the integration of several sensors
    which work together and allow the conversion from physical signals to electrical
    ones that can be sent to a remote destiny, like a server, making use of protocols
    and wireless technologies. A WSN has still several challenges in both hardware
    and software to overcome; for instance, in greenhouses these challenges are focus
    on data confidentiality, sensors reliability, storage capacity, and availability
    [6] . Additionally, from hardware point of view there are challenges such as electrical
    cost, execution time, code size, battery time-life, and sensor calibration. In
    order to define whether a system is efficient or not, several authors have proposed
    a well-defined design process for an embedded system which follow (i) a functional
    specification, (ii) set of properties that the design must satisfy, (iii) define
    requirements for design evaluation, (iv) and define to analyze the performance
    of the embedded system. Due to the use of water for traditional irrigation represents
    a high impact for water consumption worldwide, precision irrigation provides a
    mean to evaluate water requirements of a crop and supply the right amount of water
    in the right time without wasting a single drop of water. Precision irrigation
    is the most efficient technique for greenhouses irrigation where saving of money
    and resources is more than mandatory; therefore, the use of WSN is very important
    for monitoring all the tasks conducted in a greenhouse. For this reason, it is
    significant to take into account the location, amount, and deployment of sensors
    to minimize the errors and maximize the quality of data. Since a WSN plays an
    important role in the cultivation of vegetables, this article presents a design
    of a WSN taking into account the following aspects. First, data collection of
    the most relevant variables related to vegetables cultivation. Second, correlation
    analysis of data to determine their relation with soil humidity and therefore
    estimating the amount of water that a crop may need in the next irrigation. The
    rest of the document is organized as follow. Section II shows the design requirements
    for data acquisition and greenhouse features. section III talks about the propose
    methodology to minimize problems such as reading errors or redundancy. Section
    IV explains and performs different analysis using different techniques of machine
    learning to data representation. Section V sums up the results of the research
    and their interpretation. Finally, section VI presents conclusions and future
    work. SECTION II. Materials and Methods This sections shows the following: (i)
    data acquisition vegetable production of greenhouse, (ii) design of an electronic
    system to collect the generated data by the sensor network, and (iii) data analysis.
    A. Greenhouse Crops Data Acquisition Current agricultural production depends on
    the efficiency of electronic systems used to control and monitor several variables
    in a greenhouse [1] . To get a better final product in short-cycle productions,
    less than one year, smart greenhouses are used to control the different environmental
    variables involved in this activity. In this work, we take into account the evapotranspiration
    criterion ( ET c ) which can be defined as the vaporization of liquid water contained
    in tissue of plants. In addition to, the evapotranspiration of reference ( ET
    o ) works as a baseline index for suitable condition of plants growing under a
    correct water irrigation level. Moreover, crop coefficient ( K c ) using the equation
    1 [2] . That means the difference between the production in a greenhouse and the
    production in an ideal environment. By this way, it is possible to know the relation
    between growth stages and maturation of a crop. del mismo [3] . K c = (E T o )
    (E T c ) (1) View Source In a greenhouse, the parameters to evaluate in this study
    are soil moisture, relative humidity, air temperature, amount of ( CO 2 ), and
    luminosity. Additionally, both ( K c )and ( ET o ) are parameters related to the
    water irrigated amount to a crop. Short cycle crops are those crops whose vegetative
    cycle is less than a year, even of only a few months. For this reason, they can
    be planted immediately after they are harvested. Some of these crops are cereals
    (corn, wheat, barley, rice), tubers (potatoes), oil seeds (sesame and cotton),
    vegetables (tomatoes, onions, broccoli, carrots, beets) and some species of flowers
    open sky. [8] Indicates that an optimal strategy is the rotation of short cycle
    crops. The same ones that can be (i) gramineous plants that demand much of the
    soil and (ii) legume plants that contribute nitrogen to the soil through the fixation
    of nitrogen in the air. In the rotation of crops the crops of the two groups alternate,
    thus after a crop that demands a lot of soil, we sow another one that will provide
    nutrients. The most significant parameters for short cycle crops are:soil moisture,
    relative humidity, ambient temperature, amount of CO 2 and luminosity [4] . B.
    Electronic Design Fig. 1 Greenhouse measures Show All To guarantee quality in
    the design electronic system process, we use the V model. It has well-defined
    stages which allows the designers to get a feedback in each of them. Additionally,
    using the IEEE 29148 standard, requirements can be obtained easier, they will
    be focus in the problem, and they can be validated without drawbacks, the stages
    are: Analysis: This is the very first stage which involves the verification of
    the greenhouse dimensions and the kind of crop. For the former, they are 19 ×
    17 × 4 meters and it is shown in Fig. 1 . For the latter, crops are lettuce, beetroot,
    and green cabbage which belong to the short cycle production and have similar
    irrigation needs. Requirements: It allows to identify the functionality and constrains
    that the system must have in order to it can operate correctly. The most relevant
    requirements are shown in table I . Design: Due to there are a huge variety of
    sensors to measure environment variables and the convert them into electrical
    signals, we have selected the sensors whose error is very low, according their
    data-sheet. The electronic sensors list are: DHT11 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor
    complex with a calibrated digital signal output), BH1750 (Digital sensor that
    measures brightness, 16 bits CAD), MQ135 (Allows air quality control), YL69 (moisture
    sensor), Xbee (802.15.4 IEEE standard), Arduino (Microncontroller with 14 in/out
    pin and 6 analog conversors) TABLE I System Requeiremts Once electronics have
    been selected, we have to define the interconnection between microcontroller,
    sensors, and actuators. We use the 802.15.1 standard to send the information from
    the WSN to the management server due to this standard offers several advantages
    such as relative long-range coverage, high data reliability, and high data rate.
    At figure 2 details the electronic circuit designed [13] . To cover all the space
    inside the greenhouse, 3 nodes of WSN with the same kind of sensors are used and
    data collected here is sent to a main server three times per day, morning, afternoon,
    and night. Fig. 2 WSN Electronic Desing Show All C. Data Analysis The multidimensional
    matrix collected is Y ∈ ℝ (m×n) , where m = 1200 and n = 8. In the matrix, the
    last 3 columns represents the mechanism used for irrigation, i.e. hose, drip,
    or groove. With the purpose of avoid the dummy variable trap, we delete one of
    the variables of water irrigation. Moreover, to facilitate the analysis, data
    contained in the matrix is divided in two portions, the 80% for model training
    and the rest for validation of the model. As a result, the dimension of the final
    matrix X ∈ ℝ (p×q) , where p= 936 and q = 7. To use a multivariate regression
    model, it is mandatory first to take into account the correlation between all
    the variables; by this way, the mathematical model will use only the most significant
    variables, soil moisture, and the others will be rejected. In this analysis, we
    use the backward elimination technique for this purpose. At the beginning, this
    technique uses all the training variables and then the less significant ones are
    rejected according the results gotten from a descriptive statistical analysis.
    The feature to analyze and compare is p-value with all the variables included
    in the analysis [7] . Using matrix X . The first model corresponding to equation:
    Y= b 0 + ∑ i=1 7 x i b i (2) View Source Where x 1 =Temperature, x 2 = Relative
    humidity, x 3 = Ligh level, x 4 = C O 2 , x 5 = Ground humidity, x 6 = Drip irrigation
    and x 7 = irrigation by hose. The results of the statistical analysis shows that
    according the p-value, temperature does not have any direct relation with soil
    moisture. This is because temperature inside the greenhouse does not suffer dramatic
    changes by Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 Equation model ( equation 2 ) and statistical summary
    Show All After this first approach, the equation is reduced because of the less
    related variable is deleted as well. This is possible because the p-value shows
    up which of the variables are and are not closely related to the dependent variable.
    Additionally, we can see that R square and R adjusted are not closely to 1 which
    can help us to suppose that data do not follow a normal distribution. The new
    statistical model is showed in Fig. 4 . In order to figure out the data distribution
    and model validation, it is necessary to validate the statistical assumptions
    of linearity, independency, homocedasticity, and the normality of residual data.
    For instance, the independency of the residuals is 0.0949815; however, it should
    be between 1.5 and 2.5. In Fig. 5 shows the homocedasticity and the normality
    of the residuals. As a analysis results, we identify that the multivariate data
    does not represent linearity; for this reason, it is necessary to explore new
    models and criteria to find the most efficient one for this work. This exploration
    has led to identify that dimension reduction technique (DR) is the most suitable
    for data visualization because it allows to have a better perception and understanding
    of the proposed approaches [10] [11] . In Fig. 6 we see that a portion of data
    is out of the normal range (Q1 Q3 quartiles), so they can be considered as atypical.
    Fig. 4 Equation model statistical summary without Temperature variable Show All
    Fig. 5 Linearity assumptions Show All With the analysis previously described,
    the atypical data could be eliminated (data outside the interquartile range).
    Subsequently, the linear multivariate model is generated again with the training
    matrix V ∈ ℝ (r×q) where r is less than p with 835. At the figure 7 swith a value
    of 835. The figure 7 shows the new model presented with the eliminated out layers
    and the box plot without errors. According to this analysis, it was possible to
    remove atypical data. With this new information, the multivariate linear model
    is used again with a training matrix V ∈ ℝ (r×q) where r is less than p and it
    worth 835. In 7 details the result of the new analysis using the new model. The
    new results states that the new model used is not perfectly suitable for this
    study because the data obtained do not have linearity. For this reason, we propose
    the following regression models to solve the original problem: (i) Regresion polinomial
    y= b 0 + ∑ i=1 4 ∑ j=1 7 ( b j ∗ x i j ) (3) View Source Fig. 6 Data outlayers

    (iii) Decision support machines f(x,ω)= ∑ j=1 m ω j g j (x)+b,where, g j (x),j=1,..,m.
    (5) View Source SECTION III. Results The software used for data analysis is software
    R and it was chosen because it offers representation of (i) nonlinear continuous
    models and (ii) non-continuous models. The standard configuration of the models
    has not been modified to do not infer in the preference to choose any of them.
    Algorithms were drawn using DR to offer a better visualization and the results
    appears in Fig. 8 using matrix V . Fig. 8 Regression Models with WSN data set
    Show All Once models have been implemented, a simulation gives the forecast error
    which allows to figure out which model represents better the data distribution.
    For this reason it is analyzed first the cumulative sum of forecast errors (CFE)
    which provides additional information such as the forecast deviation. Second,
    mean error deviation (MAD) which gives the absolute value of the difference between
    real and estimated data. Third, mean square error (MSE) which gives the dispersion
    of the predicted error. Finally, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) which provides
    the error in percentage given by the model and related to the real data. Additionally,
    to know the precision of the results given by each model, the most precise and
    the less precise predicted result is showed. Table 3 offers a summary of these
    results. TABLE II Error analysis by each model Analyzing the results SVR has an
    error of 7.12% which can be considered as acceptable. Another very important factor
    to take into account is that the variability of the error versus real data is
    30.499 which is measured in a scale from 0 to 1023. This confirms that SVR is
    so robust for atypical data. As result, we state that SVR has better predictions
    compared to other models. For this reason, we try improve its performance modifying
    certain parameters in the equation in order to the model becomes interactive.
    The Fig. 9 presents both the estimated model with standard values and the model
    with the modification of C-constant attribute. Fig. 9 SVR Regression Models with
    WSN data set Show All As final results, in the regression SVR standard we got
    a MAD of 31.6% between 0 to 1023 and a MAPE of 7.89%. On the other hand, with
    SVR modified we got a MAD of 23.08 in the same range of variability and a 4.48%
    of estimated error. This analysis clearly states that the prediction SVR modified
    offers a better performance in the system and for the crop coefficient ( K c ).
    Fig. 10 Comparison between WSN analysis and without them in lettuce growing Show
    All Performing tests with specialized equipment and under the supervision of experienced
    agronomists, we determine that for the proper growth of plants, soil moisture
    in analog values should range from 400 to 520; therefore, when this value drops
    to 400 or less, the electronic system must turn on the irrigation system until
    the soil moisture becomes 520. To try the system, we performed two tests one with
    a WSN with a prediction system and the other with systematic irrigation without
    any feedback. The crop chosen for this purpose was lettuce due to it requires
    a lot of water for a proper growth. As a remarkable result, the growth of the
    plants was totally different; indeed, the most relevant differences were the color,
    the quality of the product, and the amount of water used in each scenario (4 liters
    for the former and 5 liters for the latter). It shows in Fig. 10 to notice the
    difference. SECTION IV. Conclusions and Future work The use of a WSN for prediction
    purposes allows farmers to control their crops more efficiently. By this way,
    products have a better growth cycle due to plants are irrigated when they really
    need and using the proper amount of water for that. In South America where the
    use of technology in agriculture is still very limited, WSN finds a great chance
    to be implemented. Additionally, the regression model SVR enabled to estimate
    the soil moisture with high precision and low computational cost for the local
    server; in fact, with an error of 5% for the former. Moreover, the error prediction
    analysis allowed to figure out what was the best model that offered the best interpretation
    for data distribution. Finally, using DR for graph representation give us a better
    understanding of how different models used to predict data. In the near future,
    these algorithms should be implemented in every single node to improve the communication
    in terms of data rate from sensors to a main node. Furthermore, it is plausible
    that the main node has connection to the cloud to save data and get them from
    everywhere. Finally, we hope to develop a new system that allows to determine
    the water evotranspiration in real time to validate the linear regression model.

    A case study of a real‑time internet \nof things system for site‑specific \npotato\
    \ crop management \nin El‑Salhia Area‑Egypt\nBasma M. Mohammad EL‑Basioni1*, Elsayed\
    \ Said Mohamed2, AA. Belal2, \nMohamed E. M. Jalhoum2, Sherine M. Abd EL‑Kader1\
    \ & Mohamed B. Zahran2\nThe site‑specific management is the technology that considers\
    \ the natural variability within the \nsame field of factors related to crop growth\
    \ to improve its management practices such that \nthe agricultural treatments\
    \ are varied for field’s small production zones saving resources and \nenvironment,\
    \ and improving crop quality and size. Since site‑specific decisions are not far\
    \ from \nthe Fourth Industrial Revolution and the concept of processes automation,\
    \ this work addresses \nimproving the process of spatial variability analysis\
    \ and thus supporting management decisions \nby developing a system—entitled EGYPADS—based\
    \ on the Internet of Things and its enabling \ntechnologies. EGYPADS automates\
    \ data collection, zones delineation according to their land \nsuitability evaluation,\
    \ and maps generation. The paper addresses a case study of potato crop \nin a\
    \ specific area in Egypt, El‑Salhia, in which eighty‑five sites were chosen as\
    \ main dataset for \nthe modeling process during different stages of crop growth.\
    \ Three management zones were \nrecognized of the selected field based on the\
    \ differentiation in their land suitability characteristics, \nrepresenting about\
    \ 5%, 65%, and 30% of the total area, respectively. The structure, screens, and\
    \ \nservices of EGYPADS are described in this paper. EGYPADS offered services\
    \ include: management \nzones delineation using absolute and virtual coordinates,\
    \ Land Suitability Assessment (LSA), data \nentry from field in real‑time as well\
    \ as from excel sheets, saving maps in suitable format for variable \nrate application,\
    \ real‑time and historical data processing, centralized management, and flexible\
    \ \nformulation of events and related actions. The implementation of EGYPADS was\
    \ verified. The system \ndynamically produces non‑contiguous isobands, each representing\
    \ a specific range of parameter \nvalues, and can be properly exported for use\
    \ by other programs or smart machinery. It was proven \nthat EGYPADS supports\
    \ more than one land with different geometry, area, location, and number of \n\
    nodes. EGYPADS was compared with the traditional LSA method, and was found to\
    \ produce similar \nmanagement zones.\nThe agricultural sector contributes about\
    \ 16% of the Egyptian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in addition it \nprovides\
    \ about 30% of job opportunities for  youth1. Therefore, the interest in developing\
    \ the agricultural sector is \nvery important for growing the Egyptian  economy2,3.\
    \ There are many challenges that hinder agricultural produc-\ntion in Egypt, for\
    \ example, the reduction of agricultural ownership, soil loosed due to increasing\
    \ urban sprawl, \netc.4–6, where it has been observed that approximately 50% of\
    \ the farms in the Nile Delta have an area less than \none  acre7. Other challenges\
    \ that are facing the agricultural production in Egypt include: reliance of most\
    \ farmers \non traditional agricultural methods, climate change, deficiency of\
    \ irrigation water, determining the proper time \nfor fertilization and pest resistance,\
    \ etc. Most of these challenges may be due to a lack of understanding of the \n\
    spatial distribution of soil characteristics, LSA and their relationship to the\
    \  crop8.\nThe potato is considered one of the essential crops for most people\
    \ around the world, the total global pro-\nduction of about 360 million metric\
    \ meters. Annual production of fruits and vegetables in Egypt was about 35 \n\
    million tons in 2018 according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in\
    \ addition potato is one of the \nhighest production crops among vegetables. Statistics\
    \ indicate that Egyptian potato exports reached 205 mil-\nlion US dollars in 2018.\
    \ Egypt exported more than 724,200 thousand tons of potatoes in 2018 and became\

    www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfifth largest exporter of potatoes, mainly\
    \ to Russia and the European  Union9. Potato crop is not far from the \nchallenges\
    \ that face the Egyptian agricultural production; thus due to its extreme importance\
    \ with the great \nchallenge and problems facing its production and export, the\
    \ study in this paper was chosen to mainly revolve \naround the potato crop and\
    \ specifically addresses the agricultural practice related to assessing the suitability\
    \ of \nthe land for its production.\nDuring the past two decades, Precision Agriculture\
    \ (PA) techniques have proven successful in improving the \nfarm management and\
    \ contributing to addressing the agricultural problems, on the other hand increasing\
    \ the \nagricultural profitability benefit based on more accurate information\
    \ on the agricultural  processes10,11. Reducing \nthe cost of farming while increasing\
    \ productivity is often seen as a win-win strategy for managing resources and\
    \ \nsustainable agricultural  production12. During the agricultural process, farmers\
    \ need help in making the right \ndecision to manage their farm during the crop\
    \ growth stages.\nPA allows monitoring and tracking plant growth in different\
    \ stages, monitoring the change in climate fac-\ntors, as well as monitoring the\
    \ change in soil moisture status to determine the appropriate time for irrigation\
    \ \nand irrigation  scheme13–15. Soil type, salinity, moisture, pH, depth, and\
    \ drainage characteristics, as well as their \ndistribution influence farm production,\
    \ thus, understanding the dynamic availability of soil resources is a key to \n\
    soil  management14,16–18. The precision control of soil resources within the farm\
    \ can either ensure sustainability \nor enhance the cropping intensity with appropriate\
    \ interventions.\nSince the appearance of PA concept in the early 1980s, a lot\
    \ of related technologies and  methods19 have \nbeen developed and evolved over\
    \ time. Perhaps the most prominent technologies used in PA, which clearly \nappeared\
    \ in its proposed solutions, are: the remote sensing which is a geospatial technology\
    \ used for monitor-\ning the physical characteristics of an agricultural field\
    \ on the earth from a distance by acquiring its emitted or \nreflected electromagnetic\
    \ radiation via sensors deployed on satellites or aircrafts; the Global Positioning\
    \ System \n(GPS) which is a satellite-based radio-navigation system in which the\
    \ agricultural data collection devices are \nequipped with GPS receiver calculates\
    \ its distance from at least four satellites via the time taken by radio signals\
    \ \nto propagate from each one, and from this it calculates the device real location\
    \ on the earth; the Geographic \nInformation Systems (GIS) which is the software\
    \ tool used to manage and analyze the acquired spatial data to \ndeduce important\
    \ implicit  conclusion20–23; spatial analysis and mapping techniques; Decision\
    \ Support System \n(DSS) which represents a software technique utilizes a provided\
    \ data to produce conclusions and guidance sup-\nports decision-makers in specific\
    \ agricultural practice.\nThe DSS for the agricultural management is quite complex;\
    \ it needs specific information about agricultural \nprocesses, such as climate\
    \ conditions, many variables affect crop growth where each crop requires a different\
    \ \noptimum value for  growth20,21. The success of DSS decisions in managing the\
    \ agricultural process depends on \nthe quality of information about the stages\
    \ of growth of agricultural crops, while the traditional data acquisi-\ntion technologies\
    \ such as remote sensing and the GPS-equipped handheld data collection devices\
    \ suffer from \nsome limitations affect its accuracy such as the low temporal\
    \ and spatial resolution, limited variety of available \nsoil and plant data,\
    \ and impossibility of implementing automation. Therefore, the recent technologies\
    \ Wireless \nSensor Network (WSN) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are introduced\
    \ as PA-enabling technologies for \ndata acquisition solving a lot of their past\
    \ technologies limitations and  problems22–25.\nA WSN comprises wireless nodes\
    \ contain sensors with variety of sensing modalities; these sensor nodes are \n\
    deployed in the field to sense and send its related real-time data continuously\
    \ to the software system where it is \nstored and utilized. These devices also\
    \ can receive commands from the software application control its integrated \n\
    actuators achieving a closed- or open-loop control system for the farm. The UAVs\
    \ or the agriculture drones can \nbe regarded as a sensor/actuator node has the\
    \ ability to fly at low altitude from the crop which aid in producing \nhigh spatial\
    \ resolution imagery and detect tiny crop details that can be used for example\
    \ to distinguish between \ncrop diseases. Thus, UAVs can be used to produce accurate\
    \ field mapping, along with other applications such \nas crop spraying.\nWhen\
    \ talking about the recent PA systems which is based on WSN and emerging information\
    \ technology, the \nIoT technology should be a key component in such PA  systems26.\
    \ It enables the remote access of the deployed \nsensing devices on the field\
    \ which adds flexibility in the system usage and increases its scalability. A\
    \ complete \nIoT system is composed of three tiers: the things tier, the IoT connection\
    \ tier, and the application tier. The things \ntier includes the IoT devices and\
    \ the monitored/controlled things. The IoT device is an embedded device has \n\
    support for internet connectivity; it can be connected to the thing it monitors/controls\
    \ or a standalone device; \nit can be a sensor node or a base station just works\
    \ as forwarder to the data of a WSN through the Internet. The \nIoT connection\
    \ tier is implemented by the IoT messaging protocols which define the rules, formats\
    \ and func-\ntions for transferring messages between IoT clients over the Internet.\
    \ The application tier contains the back- and \nfront-end services that implement\
    \ the functions of a specific IoT use case and represent the real benefit of the\
    \ \ncollected IoT data.\nThe proposed work in this paper belongs to these recent\
    \ PA systems. EGYPADS can be regarded as an IoT-\nenabled PA application which\
    \ is a software system does PA function(s) and equipped to receive data directly\
    \ from \nthe field devices, on the other hand, it can be viewed as an IoT system\
    \ dedicated to a specific use case related to \nthe agriculture field concentrates\
    \ in its current version with the implementation of the second and third IoT tiers.\n\
    As an IoT use case, the case in question is the automation of site-specific management\
    \ and LSA processes for \nsupporting potato crop cultivation management decisions.\
    \ As a PA software platform it exploits the underlying \ntechnologies to add more\
    \ improved smart agriculture functions and services.\nAs mentioned earlier EGYPADS\
    \ implements mainly the second and third IoT tiers. The application tier is \n\
    web-based controlled by a JavaScript back-end application manages the database,\
    \ data processing and analysis, \nweb hosting, communication with the front-end,\
    \ and the IoT communication tier. The IoT tier is implemented \nusing a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging  pattern27 to support asynchronous broadcasting, event-driven opera-\n\
    tions, and near real-time communication; and generally reaching decoupled components\
    \ in time, space, and \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports |        (2022)\

    synchronization, thus increasing the system maintainability, reliability, and\
    \ scalability. The parameters used in \nthe analysis are related to chemical,\
    \ physical, and fertility characteristics of the soil, as well as some parameters\
    \ \nrelated to weather conditions and plant characteristics. The EGYPADS front-end\
    \ allows system users to access the \nsystem services which are: Spatial Analysis\
    \ (Mapping Service) using absolute and virtual coordinates; Real-time \nData Visualization\
    \ which includes Climate and Plant Parameters Visualization, Soil Parameters Visualization,\
    \ \nand Nodes Status Monitoring Panel; Historical Data Visualization, Events and\
    \ Actions Settings, and Adminis-\ntrative Settings.\nDue to its modularity and\
    \ by selecting a lightweight messaging protocol suitable for major embedded and\
    \ \nnon-embedded platforms, EGYPADS exposes API to connect any IoT device by small\
    \ settings to its IoT client \nsoftware and the format of the IoT message payload.\
    \ The current version of EGYPADS also considers a real \nimplementation of the\
    \ things tier but without full support for the system abilities; it is used only\
    \ for testing and \nverification purposes. This tier contains a WSN comprises\
    \ a base station and sensor nodes forming star topology.\nA complete LSA process\
    \ for potato crop was conducted in an agriculture land in El-Salhia region using\
    \ the \ntraditional method currently in use, which entails frequent field visits.\
    \ The conducted field trips and analysis \nhelped in determining the pitfalls\
    \ of the traditional method, highlighting the need to automate this method, \n\
    reaching the land assessment criteria and model, setting the values of weights\
    \ and scores, shaping the require-\nments of the automated process, and putting\
    \ the specification of its real-time decision support system and \nrequired output.\
    \ These field trips were also needed to collect soil samples for laboratory analysis\
    \ to determine \nthe values of some parameters of the assessment model that could\
    \ not be given as direct readings from devices. \nThirteen parameters and three\
    \ thematic indicators were used in the assessment; their values were interpolated\
    \ \nfor spatial analysis and their maps were produced.\nFrom the foregoing, it\
    \ is clear that there is a gap between the method currently used for Management\
    \ Zone \n(MZ) delineation especially the LSA practice and the technological advances\
    \ in electronics, communication, and \ninformation management that are invading\
    \ the field of agriculture today. At the same time, the available smart \nagriculture\
    \ solutions miss addressing the automation of this practice. The proposed work\
    \ was keen to fill this \ngap, therefore its objectives focused on automating\
    \ the LSA process and generally providing an enhanced spatial \nanalysis functionality\
    \ backed by IoT capabilities to facilitate the agricultural management practices\
    \ and obtain \nhighly accurate results by producing such maps with higher temporal\
    \ resolution using the real-time field data. \nThe research work in this paper\
    \ describes the details of designing a novel smart agriculture solution that sup-\n\
    ports LSA process automation, and combines other smart agriculture services not\
    \ present in any other systems, \nor at least they do not exist together in one\
    \ other system, and presents them in a different form and with greater \ncapabilities.\
    \ The proposed system—EGYPADS -is characterized by:\n• Exploiting the new technologies\
    \ of IoT communication system, web development, database, and digital \nmapping\
    \ to automate the construction of MZ maps directly from the data sent by the infield\
    \ sensing devices.\n• This automation would help reduce expenses, time, and effort\
    \ consumed in repetitive field visits to collect \nfield data that are used in\
    \ mapping, and it would also help avoid human error in taking or recording readings\
    \ \nand increase the temporal accuracy of mapping.\n• The spatial modeling and\
    \ analysis of the phenomena is based on the standard and common methods.\n• Producing\
    \ thematic maps of soil properties such as soil salinity, soil depth, etc., from\
    \ real-time as well as \nhistorical data.\n• LSA and construction of soil MZs\
    \ of any selected farm using real-time as well as historical data.\n• Facilitation\
    \ to construct maps through both methods: the ordinary used method which requires\
    \ the data \ncollected from the field trips to be entered manually into the application\
    \ through sheets, and automatically \nfrom the data sent by infield devices.\n\
    • Ability to export maps in standard formats.\n• Facilitation and flexibility\
    \ to formulate a complete complex event to be tested such that any critical condition\
    \ \ncan be detected and dealt early.\n• Ability to use virtual coordinates for\
    \ spatial analysis if Global Positioning System (GPS) is not available and \n\
    the area is not large.\n• Ability to register any land having any geometrical\
    \ shape with the system and facility for remote central \nmonitoring.\nThis paper\
    \ explains activities of the field trips; the architecture, requirements, screens,\
    \ functions, and services \nof the proposed system; and its functionality verification.\
    \ The rest of this paper is organized as follows, “Literature \nreview” section\
    \ reviews the related work, “Materials and methodology” section introduces the\
    \ spatial modeling \nand the proposed system architecture. “Results” section shows\
    \ the results of the system implementation and \nvalidation. “Discussion” section\
    \ is a discussion of the work presented in this paper taking the character of\
    \ com-\nparison between using the system and using the current used method for\
    \ spatial analysis. Finally, “Conclusion \nand future work” section concludes\
    \ the paper.\nLiterature review\nA large number of uncountable research and commercial\
    \ solutions have been proposed for each PA technology \nhighlighted in the previous\
    \ section or a combination of them. This section will shed the light on some examples\
    \ \nof them.\nWSN and UAV are used in a lot of applications such as soil sampling,\
    \ field mapping, tractor guidance, crop \nscouting, variable rate applications,\
    \ etc.  In28, the images taken by three different types of camera (multispectral,\
    \ \nthermal, and RGB) loaded on a UAV were exploited for characterizing vineyard\
    \ spatial variability based on \n4\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports |  \

    vegetative vigor, water stress and missing plant detection, respectively. A ground\
    \ station receives the real-time \nvideo data from the UAV through a WiFi connection,\
    \ and it controls it using a duplex transmitter. After per-\nforming image processing\
    \ and some calculations, maps of different indices were elaborated and classification\
    \ \nwere performed.The system was tested for real lands in clear sky conditions\
    \ and proved good performance \nand ability to aid in giving precision irrigation\
    \ recommendations, but this is not without some flaws such as \nnegative performance\
    \ indicators with respect to missing plants detection, and lack of a precise monitoring\
    \ of \nother descriptive ground parameters related to plant status, soil, microclimate,\
    \ yield and quality. In addition, \nit is appropriate for small and medium scale\
    \ agricultural lands; the monitoring operational time of the UAV is \ndetermined\
    \ to be 15 min.\nA huge number of smart farming applications based on WSN were\
    \ presented in the literature.  In29, the solu-\ntion is presented to improve\
    \ water consumption and at the same time improve crop size by making available\
    \ \nthe information by which cultivation, harvesting, irrigation, and fertilization\
    \ can be efficiently scheduled. It \nmonitors temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ and soil moisture, and formulates a report of them contains also a \n10-day\
    \ weather forecast.\nSome of the proposed applications were suitable to only one\
    \ farm or some adjacent farms, and for small to \nmedium farms scale, a local\
    \ laptop or personal digital assistant was employed to run the application and\
    \ monitor \nthe farm. To be able to monitor and control more than one land from\
    \ anywhere, the concept of IoT becomes in \nperfect tandem with the PA applications.\n\
    In30, an IoT-based mobile application called LandPKS was introduced as an estimator\
    \ to land potential and \nresilience by combining user inputs including land geographical\
    \ location and his answer to specific questions \nconcerning his land with cloud-based\
    \ knowledge and similar potential information to help in selecting sustain-\n\
    able land management practices against the climate change effects. The system\
    \ is point-based estimator, relays \non simple user inputs and only on relatively\
    \ static soil properties, such as soil texture and depth.\nA monitoring tool called\
    \ PETEFA is proposed  in31, it exploits the data received from a meteorological\
    \ sta-\ntion sensors, weather station sensors, and images from satellites such\
    \ as LandSat 8, Spot 6 and 7, WorldView 2, \nPERUSAT-1 and from UAVs, to provide\
    \ three types of information and spatial data for the yellow corn crops \n(Zea\
    \ Mays) for the sake of the National Institute of Agrarian Innovation (INIA):\
    \ the crop temperature and health \nstatus throughout its lifecycle, the soil\
    \ state, and information on crop evapotranspiration with different Privileges\
    \ \nfor INIA and the farmers.\nThe work  in32 proposes for irrigation control.\
    \ It includes a web application visualizes the data comes from \nthe field, allows\
    \ for manipulating the irrigation conditions, analyzing the data to forecast the\
    \ future water need \nusing data mining. The control is automatically driven by\
    \ the field data or manually through a mobile application.\nAn IoT-based decision\
    \ support system was proposed  in33 for mitigating the potato late blight disease\
    \ and \nsupport its management. The real-time data received from the field sensors\
    \ is utilized to compute the per day \naverage temperature and number of successive\
    \ hours where the humidity exceeds 90%, then these values are input \nto an implemented\
    \ disease forecast model which computes a blight units parameter and test some\
    \ conditions \nto send an SMS warning to the farmer when he should begin the treatment\
    \ against the disease. The dashboard \nof the system also displays the deployed\
    \ nodes in their real locations and some information about them with \ntheir real-time\
    \ sensed values.\nSome of the systems use a ready-to-use IoT platform as a basis\
    \ for their development, some others are built \nfrom scratch; each one of these\
    \ approaches has its pros and cons. While using IoT platform reduces time to \n\
    market and may facilitate the IoT application development, in addition to the\
    \ security issue, selecting the most \nsuitable platform for the solution at hand\
    \ is a complex task may result in inappropriate choice especially that the \n\
    platform may be hard to be learnt and debugged for simple errors. In the presented\
    \ solution, it is preferred to \nhave full control and customization over its\
    \ whole design, debug, update, and maintenance.\nA lot of the commercial precision\
    \ agriculture software programs have addressed the spatial variability analysis\
    \ \nusing the site-specific MZ approach, some of them are specialized software\
    \ and some others represent integrated \nfarm management solutions, such as the\
    \ famous  Trimble34,  AgStudio35,  AgroSense36, and Topcon IoT Farm \nManagement\
    \ Information  System37. These programs depend on manually drawn zones or importing\
    \ existing \nzones, also they enter the field data as files into the program,\
    \ and may be compatible with certain type of hard-\nware sensing devices.\nSome\
    \ software tools for land assessment were proposed for land use planning such\
    \ as Automated Land Evalu-\nation System (ALES)38 and Land Suitability Evaluation\
    \ (LSE)39. The LSE executes on raster data not on text data, \ndefines the land\
    \ suitability classes by multi-criteria analysis and directly provides the analysis\
    \ output through a \nmap; it is flexible, supports defining and changing the values\
    \ of the input variables. However, the data is entered \nand uploaded to these\
    \ tools manually by the users, and accordingly is updated manually.\nFrom the\
    \ above, we can find that the IoT should be a key component in a PA system, and\
    \ this is realized in \nour PA software system. The developed system is an IoT\
    \ use case in the field of agriculture provides software \nsolution for land suitability\
    \ assessment, but it is concerned with temporal and spatial analysis of soil,\
    \ climate and \nplant data. It was designed to retain some features and functions\
    \ of existing solution, improve, and add to them, \nwhile addressing their flaws;\
    \ this is such as different users with different privileges, real-time update\
    \ and detec-\ntions, flexibility in data entry methods, suitability to more than\
    \ one small to large scale land with any geometric \nshape, extendibility, warnings\
    \ and possibility of remote control, and more. A classification represents the\
    \ above \nmentioned PA solutions variations is depicted in Fig. 1. To the best\
    \ of our knowledge, the class of EGYPADS \nand generally the classes of IoT-based\
    \ MZ mapping and spatial analysis DSS have no outstanding agriculture-\ndedicated\
    \ solutions examples implemented and  tested40–43.\nThe features of EGYPADS are\
    \ compared with a sample of PA software applications characterized by offering\
    \ \nspatial analysis and MZs delineation services in Table 1. From this comparison,\
    \ it could be noticed that LSA is \nnot supported by the other applications or\
    \ its support lacks the IoT advantages, they rely on global data sources \n5\n\

    \ and the 3D virtual coordinates spatial analysis for small farms \nwhen GPS is\
    \ not available.\nFew other programs have some of the EGYPADS features such as\
    \ the flexibility in formulating complete events \nwith logical, relational, arithmetic\
    \ operations and with different types of alerts and actions regarding any land\
    \ \nregistered on the system, any deployed nodes, and any phenomena, with timing\
    \ constraints. Also, few sample \nprograms offer remote monitoring of the field\
    \ sensing devices status.\nThe presence of some common characteristics between\
    \ EGYPADS and other programs does not mean that \nthey provide them in the same\
    \ way and capabilities, for example, in EGYPADS, we can easily register/unregister\
    \ \nany land of any area or geometry so that it takes advantage of all the provided\
    \ system services, easily navigate to \nthem, and visually compare the adjacent\
    \ lands and their updates in real-time, without having to create different \n\
    project for each land or thematic map.\nEGYPADS is not limited to certain devices\
    \ like other commercial software programs, it exposes interfaces \nto devices\
    \ that have all or some of its supported sensing modalities. These devices can\
    \ communicate with the \napplication, if these devices use the appropriate IoT\
    \ client library and settings, use the secret land code dedicated \nto the farm\
    \ that contains them, adhere to the employed topic tree naming conventions, and\
    \ use the application \npayload structure. The LSA function of the EGYPADS current\
    \ version is developed for the potato crop, there-\nfore it needs to be enhanced\
    \ with a support for different crops; also forecasts is a service offered by some\
    \ other \nprograms but missed in EGYPADS.\nTable 1 also mentions the MZs accuracy\
    \ measures of the systems in terms of spatial information quality, zon-\ning efficiency,\
    \ freshness of data, and spatial resolution. The spatial data quality is determined\
    \ by the use of spatial \ndataset filtering to eliminate noisy data and outliers.\
    \ Some software applications include filtering as a function \nprecedes data interpolation;\
    \ some of them implements the global outliers elimination without consideration\
    \ of \nlocal outliers. The systems that depend on acquiring data from infield\
    \ sensing devices through periodic sensing \napplication, such as EGYPADS, can\
    \ implement filtering at the field data sources, and may be through different\
    \ \nlevels of aggregation or forwarding.\nThe location accuracy, defined as the\
    \ closeness of the information on maps to the values in the real world, \nis also\
    \ an important determinant of the spatial data quality. The potential gross error\
    \ caused by the human fac-\ntor in taking and recording the geospatial readings\
    \ using handheld devices threatens the location accuracy of \nsystems that relay\
    \ on this for dataset collection; whereas calibrated infield sensor nodes in IoT-enabled\
    \ systems, \nsuch as EGYPADS, is free from this error, and an estimated redundancy\
    \ of sensor nodes can compensate for any \nenvironmental or instrumental errors\
    \ and increase data reliability. A system in Table 1 is marked as having good\
    \ \nspatial information quality if it incorporates filtering procedures or location\
    \ accuracy ingredients.\nThe zoning efficiency or spatial analysis efficiency\
    \ lies in the interpolation process and the aggregation of \nmultiple layers of\
    \ information to produce the management zones that incorporate experts knowledge.\
    \ The spatial \ninterpolation of data before MZ delineation is a required step\
    \ for improving isolines smoothness and for variance \nreduction. The most commonly\
    \ used methods for interpolation are the deterministic Inverse Distance Weighting\
    \ \n(IDW) and the geostatistical kriging methods. Kriging is more suitable for\
    \ large datasets, but causes problems \nwith the presence of outliers. IDW is\
    \ more suitable and gives better accuracy for homogenously distributed \nsmall\
    \ digitized datasets, as in EGYPADS. The system is marked in Table 1 as producing\
    \ efficient zones when it \nemploys interpolation and layers aggregation procedures.\
    \ Freshness of data as well as the temporal resolution \nis intuitively better\
    \ in IoT-enabled systems. In the same systems, the required level of spatial resolution\
    \ can be \ncontrolled by adjusting the number and distribution of active sensor\
    \ nodes.\nMaterials and methodology\nThe field management is a complex process\
    \ related to several factors such as soil conditions, crop types, climate \nconditions,\
    \ and water quality. The current case study is related specifically to soil suitability\
    \ evaluation for potato \ncrop. However, the study generally addresses the spatial\
    \ analysis of the agricultural phenomena, such as the chlo-\nrophyll content index\
    \ (CCI) and the atmospheric temperature, as well as the generation of their corresponding\
    \ \nmanagement zones maps. This section describes the study area, EGYPADS system\
    \ architecture, and its spatial \nanalysis and land suitability evaluation models\
    \ that are used to delineate the management zones.\nThe description of study area.\
    \ \nThe study area is located among the soil of Sixths of October Company \nfor\
    \ Agricultural Projects (SOAP) which is located in El-Salhia Area, south west\
    \ of Ismailia city and to the East \nsouth of El-Kassaseen city. It is bounded\
    \ by 30° 28′ 11.93’’ and 30° 28′ 41.63’’ latitudes and 31° 59′ 25.31’’ and 31°\
    \ \n59′ 59.45’’ longitudes as shown in Fig. 2.\nField trips and laboratory analysis.\
    \ \nA number of five field trips include on-site field measurements were \nconducted\
    \ for different crop growth stages: during five stages after 30, 45, 60, 80, and\
    \ 90 days from planting. \nThe field trips post-activities include laboratory\
    \ analysis for collected soil profiles, and spatial analysis for the \nstudy parameters.\
    \ Twenty soil profile were carried out as they represent the variation of soil\
    \ characteristics of \nthe selected farm, the study area was divided into equal\
    \ cells based on grid system decided by the research team. \nEighty-five sites\
    \ were chosen as the main dataset for the modeling process during different growing\
    \ stages of \npotato crop. These sites represent all possible variations in soil\
    \ conditions and agricultural practices which may \noccur within the experimental\
    \ fields. The grid system and the location of the check points are explained in\
    \ Fig. 3.\nA total of 155 soil samples were collected from soil profiles and surface\
    \ samples. In addition to 425 plant \nsamples were collected during growing stages\
    \ of potato crop (5 stage × 85 samples) and analyzed for physical \nand chemical\
    \ characteristics using the standard analytical methods as indicated  by51.\n\

    sodium percentage (ESP), CaCO3, and pH (PH). The values of some of the soil parameters\
    \ are only deduced \nthrough laboratory analysis of soil samples, therefore the\
    \ system allows for entering the values of the laboratory \nparameter of each\
    \ land via an excel sheet of an application accepted format. A sensor node may\
    \ contain all the \nmentioned sensing modalities, or the land may contain different\
    \ types of sensor nodes according to sensing \nmodalities incorporated into each\
    \ type. It is also worth noting that it is not necessary to include all the scores\
    \ of \nthree soil quality indices, but some soil parameters can be neglected and\
    \ accordingly their scores omitted from \nthe index equation with modifying the\
    \ equation exponent (omitting a parameter score from the equation entails \nreducing\
    \ the denominator of the exponent by one).\nEGYPADS expects values for all parameters\
    \ in the message payload: the sensed parameters’ values, other-\nwise NULL, however\
    \ the value is retrieved from the database if it is a laboratory parameter. The\
    \ payload JSON \ncontent contains the identification of a land and a node together\
    \ with the node real coordinates and sensed data.\nThe sensor node may contain\
    \ actuators to actuate field equipments such as sprinklers. The sensor node may\
    \ \nnot contain GPS and thus uses the Virtual Coordinates Mapping Service as will\
    \ be illustrated later. The soil mois-\nture sensors can be used to measure the\
    \ WHC, acoustic sensors can be used to measure T and D, ring infiltrom-\neter\
    \ can be used to measure hydraulic conductivity G, electromagnetic sensors measure\
    \ various soil properties \nthat, such as T, R, OM, S. The red and infrared LEDs\
    \ together with the two corresponding spectrometers can be \nused to measure the\
    \ CCI. The back-end JavaScript application manages all the system operations and\
    \ performs \nbehind-the-scenes functionality that offers EGYPADS services to the\
    \ users and allows them to interact with the \nsystem. An overview of EGYPADS\
    \ functionality is depicted in Fig. 5 flowchart.\nEGYPADS back-end application\
    \ starts with the required configurations, initializations, access to modules,\
    \ \nURI Routing settings, subscription to the MQTT topics of fields data; then,\
    \ it starts its parallel operations. It \nperforms the periodic operations of\
    \ checking nodes status, checking for the occurrence of specified events, and\
    \ \nperforming calculations for the 3D virtual coordinates data charts. In flowchart\
    \ of Fig. 5, the \"Loop limit\" shape \nand the associated inverted one indicate\
    \ the start and end of a loop containing the procedures of an operation, \nrespectively.\
    \ The back-end application always listens for incoming requests to display HTTP\
    \ URLs, or incoming \ndata through the POST method to handle it appropriately\
    \ whether it is data for updating the virtual coordinates \nchart settings, a\
    \ request to retrieve stored data, a syntax of a specific event to be registered,\
    \ etc.\nLikewise, the back-end application always listens for incoming data messages\
    \ from the fields. Once a data \nmessage is received, it is parsed, the real-time\
    \ values of parameters are issued to be displayed in the system \nscreens, the\
    \ sending node record is added to the database or updated if already exists, and\
    \ the geographical file \ndata is updated to be ready to be fetched by the mapping\
    \ services.\nWhile that the server tier of the system starts and performs its\
    \ operations, as shown in Fig. 5, the MQTT \nclients of the fields also start\
    \ and perform their operation by subscribing to command topics, publishing periodi-\n\
    cally to fields data topics, and listening for incoming command messages.\nLand\
    \ management zones delineation using EGYPADS. \nThe land management zones were\
    \ deline-\nated based on land suitability criteria of the potato crop according\
    \  to51. Thirteen parameter have been used in \nthis work to study land suitability\
    \ for potato. These parameters are OM, N, P, K, Zn, R, T, D, G, S, ESP,  CaCO3\
    \ and \nPH. Three thematic indicators were used in assessing land suitability:\
    \ soil fertility, chemical and physical quality \nindices according to the following\
    \  equations58. Equation (1) was used to calculate land suitability spatial model:\n\
    where LS is land suitability, FQI is fertility quality index, CQI is chemical\
    \ properties quality index and PQI is \nphysical properties quality index. The\
    \ physical properties quality index was calculated using Eq. (2):\nwhere  SR is\
    \ the score of drainage,  ST is the score of Texture,  SD is the score of soil\
    \ depth, and  SG the score of Bulk \ndensity. The chemical quality index was calculated\
    \ using Eq. (3):\nwhere  SS is the score of soil salinity,  SE is the score of\
    \ ESP,  SK is the score of  CaCO3 content and  SH is the score of \nsoil pH. The\
    \ fertility quality index was calculated using Eq. (4):\nwhere  SN is the score\
    \ of available nitrogen,  SP is the score of available phosphorous,  SK is the\
    \ score of available \npotassium,  Szn is the score of available zinc,  SOM is\
    \ the score of organic matter content and Sc/n is the score of \nratios of carbon\
    \ to nitrogen.\nMapping spatial analysis of soil characteristics. \nData was gathered,\
    \ entered, stored, manipulated, \nanalyzed, and output by a decision support system\
    \ program. The locations of soil profiles were digitized in order \nto know the\
    \ geographic coordinates and the weighted average value for each parameter belonging\
    \ to each soil \nprofile (soil depth, saturation percent (SP), pH, EC, OM,  CaCO3,\
    \ Gypsum, CEC, sand, silt, clay and texture) \nand to carry out interpolation\
    \ for soil properties using the program. The weight values of selected parameters\
    \ \ncalculated in Analytic Hierarchy Process and designated scores for physical\
    \ and chemical quality assessment as \nfollowing in Tables 2 and 3. The same calculations\
    \ of weights and scores for soil parameters, evaluation criteria, \nquality classes\
    \ were employed in EGYPADS.\n(1)\nLS = (FQI × CQI × PQI)1/3\n(2)\nPQI = (SR ×\

    Preparation for implementation and validation. \nThe system implementation was\
    \ preceded by using \nthe current traditional method of performing LSA and spatial\
    \ analysis, including recursive field trips, on-site \ndata collection, and utilizing\
    \ the desktop programs used to draw the analysis maps. Generating and updating\
    \ \nthese maps in real-time from the data comes directly from the field were taken\
    \ as the main objectives of the pro-\nposed system. A schematic represents the\
    \ main activities of using both EGYPADS and the traditional method \nand a relation\
    \ between them is depicted in Fig. 6. The field trips were important to: know\

    design, and practically understand the real benefit of the system. In addition,\
    \ a field trip is essential to determine \nthe values of the laboratory parameters.\n\
    To test and validate the EGYPADS system functioning, the IoT connectivity was\
    \ implemented using a \nCC3100-TM4C123G base station connected in a star topology\
    \ to three sensor nodes contain DHT22 tempera-\nture sensors and LM393 soil moisture\
    \ sensors (Fig. 7). At the same time, in order to include different lands in \n\
    the validation, the IoT connectivity was also emulated by employing a real MQTT\
    \ connection, can run on dif-\nferent computers (work as the field devices), and\
    \ sends its packets to the application over the Internet; while the \nfunctionality\
    \ of these virtual field devices is simulated by MATLAB software coding with programs\
    \ represent a \nlight-emitting diode (LED) component on the devices (shown in\
    \ Fig. 8). This LED coloring is used as an indica-\ntion to the reception of a\
    \ remote command from the application to this device.\nEach of these virtual devices\
    \ can work as an IoT-enabled node deployed on the field sends its data directly\
    \ \nto the system through the Internet or an IoT-enabled base station sends the\
    \ data of the field devices on behalf of \nthem, each node data in a separate\
    \ packet. The payload of the published data packet is a JSON object contains \n\
    the name/value pairs the system is familiar with which contains the land code,\
    \ the device identification, the GPS \nlatitude and longitude coordinates of the\
    \ device, and the values of the sensed phenomena. At the transmission \ntime,\
    \ each virtual device picks a random value of each sensed phenomenon within its\
    \ acceptable range, and sets \nthe value of the unsensed phenomenon to null.\n\
    The validation tests includes validating the system IoT connection, making sure\
    \ that the system functions \nreally work focusing on its two most important functions:\
    \ the Mapping service and Events and Actions service, \nand emphasizing that these\
    \ functions produce their required output.\nThe previously mentioned setup for\
    \ validation is illustrated in more detail in Fig. 9. The MQTT client is imple-\n\
    mented in the IoT devices used in the testing whether it is the embedded base\
    \ station (Eclipse Paho Embedded \nMQTT C client) or the laptops acting as virtual\
    \ base stations (Eclipse Paho MQTT C client). Two laptops were \nused; each laptop\
    \ runs more than one virtual base station program send periodically messages of\
    \ nodes data \nand assign random values for their parameters. The MQTT.js client\
    \ library is used in Node.js back-end applica-\ntion.The Mosca MQTT  broker59\
    \ is used to implement the MQTT server in a localhost machine, but to use real\
    \ \nInternet connections between the back-end and the IoT devices, a public MQTT\
    \ Server: mqtt://broker.hivemq.\ncom is employed for the purpose of testing and\
    \ validation.\nResults\nBased on the analysis of the field trips data, the management\
    \ zone maps were produced and the spatial distribu-\ntion analysis was conducted.\
    \ The analysis results can be used to decide the appropriate land use and the\
    \ appropri-\nate site-specific land management. Three zones were recognized of\
    \ the study area as follows:\nZone (I) They represent highly suitable areas. It\
    \ has very good and suitable for the potato crop. This zone is \ncharacterized\
    \ by a flat area, light texture and deep soil. Their contents of salinity, carbonate,\
    \ and gypsum are very \nlow with slopes < 1%. This zone is covering about 5% of\
    \ the total area. These results agree with some researches \non the same  area60\n\

    www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nZone (III) They represent moderately suitable\
    \ areas for some crops. It has one or more severe limitation that \nexcludes the\
    \ use of the land that require special management practices or severely restrict\
    \ the range of crops \nsuch as salinity, where the electric conductivity values\
    \ range between moderate-high to moderate, and content \nof clay is low to very\
    \ low where texture for this zone range from sand to loamy sand. This zone is\
    \ characterized \nby moderately deep. This zone is covering about 30% of the total\
    \ area).\nThe proposed system implementation allows to generate these maps and\
    \ make such analysis continuously \nbased on the near-real-time data sent by the\
    \ devices deployed in the field, in addition to the system providing \nother services.\
    \ The following subsections show the results of the system implementation and\
    \ validation.\nThe system services screens. \nThis section describes the result\
    \ of the system implementation from the \nthree different views of internet users,\
    \ normal users, and administrator.\nThe internet users view. EGYPADS website contains\
    \ a landing page available to all Internet users who can navi-\ngate through its\
    \ public pages such as \" About us\" and \"Contact us” and know about the application\
    \ features and \nthe sponsoring organizations. The application services and features\
    \ reside under the \"EGYPADS App\" tab in the \ntop menu. The sub-menus’ links\
    \ appear dimmed unclickable to the Internet user and request from him to login\
    \ \nas Administrator or Normal user by clicking the \"Sign in\" tab, see Fig. 10.\n\
    The normal users view. After the user signed in, all the links become active to\
    \ the Administrator account, but \nthe Normal user account is unauthorized to\
    \ open the \"Events and Actions Settings\" service pages.\nThe spatial analysis\
    \ of different field phenomena and parameters can be achieved in two forms: using\
    \ a \ngeographic coordinate system through the Mapping Service or using virtual\
    \ coordinates. The Mapping Service \npage is shown in Fig. 11. Number 1 in Fig. 11\
    \ symbolizes the real earth map. The hoverable side navigation \nmenu, represented\
    \ by Number 3, contains buttons—from top to bottom—for adding lands, adjusting\
    \ the system \ncontrollable parameters values such as interpolation parameters,\
    \ input all the data to be drawn from excel sheet \ninstead of real-time field\
    \ data, draw maps from historical data, and deleting land.\nNumber 4 and Number\
    \ 5 are used for navigation. Number 4 allows the selection of a particular registered\
    \ \nland to navigate to. Number 6 is used to select the analysis phenomena or\
    \ index. Number 7 are toggle buttons to \nchange zones opacity-level to transparent/nontransparent\
    \ and to show/hide nodes positions on the map, Number \n9 represents two buttons\
    \ used to export maps in GeoJSON and Shapefile format. Number 10 is a set of drawing\
    \ \ntools related to Add land button as described in the following.\nBy clicking\
    \ the Add land button, the side screen shown in Fig. 12 appears. Through this\
    \ screen, we can enter \nthe data of the lands to be registered with the system.\
    \ The land data include: a mandatory Land name which is any \nname selected to\
    \ easily identify and discriminate lands, a mandatory Land code which should be\
    \ the same as the \nland code included in the data messages received from the\
    \ devices of this land, and the navigation information \nwhich can be the bounding\
    \ minimum and maximum Longitude and Latitude coordinates or instead just the \n\
    Longitude and Latitude coordinates of a certain point in the land whether known\
    \ or determined by the point \nmarker tool, and the laboratory parameter values\
    \ entered by browsing to select a fixed-structure excel file. The \nLand area\
    \ is computed automatically, this needs navigation to the land and specification\
    \ of its perimeter using the \ndrawing tools, Number 10, by moving the polygon\
    \ tool on the polygonal land perimeter, Fig. 12a, or by drawing \na line representing\
    \ a circle radius starting from the center of a circular land using the LineString\
    \ tool, Fig. 12b.\nThe spatial analysis using virtual coordinates system, where\
    \ an origin point (0,0) is specified on one of the field \ncorners and the x-axis\
    \ and y-axis are determined, is useful in case of the GPS is not available and\
    \ the field area is \nnot very large and doesn’t use smart equipments. This Virtual\
    \ Coordinates service uses this relative coordinate \nFigure 8.  Virtual node\

    \ Then the result of the \nanalysis is visualized using surface or bar plots or\
    \ other 3D plots as shown in Fig. 13.\nThe Real-time Data Visualization service\
    \ opens on the monitoring panel of the nodes’ current status. This \npanel is\
    \ automatically populated with the nodes of the selected land as they are deployed\
    \ in the field and start \nsending their data. The node is represented by a colored\

    \ services in addition to add/delete normal \nusers, change passwords, update\
    \ some of the system parameters, and use the Events and Actions service.\nThis\
    \ service, shown in Fig. 16, aids the administrator in the formulation of complete\
    \ events with test condi-\ntions, timing constraints, and actions. The system\

    The validation test1 scenario. Suppose a scenario incorporates two lands, in each\
    \ land there is a base station \nsends the data of the deployed sensor and actuator\
    \ nodes on behalf of them to the system server. Table 4 shows \nsome descriptive\
    \ parameters of the two lands and the test.\nThe validation test1 steps. The following\
    \ steps and analysis are used to validate the system IoT connection \nincluding\
    \ the publish and subscribe functions, ensure the work of system functions focusing\
    \ on the Mapping \nservice and Events and Actions service, and ensure the correctness\
    \ of the functionality.\n• Validation of IoT connectivity and system functionality\
    \ for different lands\nStep 1 Register Salhia land1 by submitting its information\
    \ with the system using the \"Add land\" button.\nStep 2 Register Salhia land2\
    \ by submitting its information with the system using the \"Add land\" button.\n\

    \ the base station of Salhia land2 from another computer with \ndifferent internet\
    \ connection.\nStep 5 Open Events and Actions page, delete any existing event,\
    \ formulate the following hypothetical events:\nFor Salhia land1 and Salhia land2\
    \ if half of the Nitrogen value minus 0.02 is greater than or equal the potas-\n\
    sium value multiplied by 1.2 and the organic matter is less than 0.5 for Node1\
    \ and Node6 and Node10, in the first \nhalf of the day for Salhia land1 and in\
    \ the second half of the day for Salhia land2, send immediately command \nclose\
    \ valve to Salhia land1 base station and command open valve to Salhia land2 base\
    \ station.\nFor Salhia land2 if temperature value of any node happens to be smaller\
    \ than 10 °C and remains the same for \n1 min in any time of the day, issue on-screen\
    \ text alert together with email alert message.\n• Functionality correctness validation\n\

    Step 8 Construct tables for computing CQI, PQI, FQI, LS for each node and compare\
    \ the result with their \nvalues in the GeoJSON.\nStep 9 Increase the interpolation\

    The IoT subscriptions and publications were validated by Steps 3 and 4. Just after\
    \ the first message from a \nnode in Salhia land1 was received, an icon representing\
    \ its real position appears.\nIn the same fashion, the remaining deployed nodes\
    \ gradually appear, and gradually the zones map is con-\nstructed in the region\
    \ encloses the nodes sent data until the map of the whole land is constructed\
    \ for the currently \nselected parameter, see Fig. 19. The zones are drawn with\
    \ low level opacity colors, when we hover with the mouse \ncursor on a zone, it\
    \ is highlighted, the values range it represents and also its area in square meter\
    \ appear. The \nzones map that depends on a real-time parameter is continuously\
    \ updated once a new real-time value is received.\nThe same gradual construction\
    \ happened for Salhia land2 as a result of Step4 until the complete construction.\
    \ \nThe selected parameter for analysis can be changed, see Fig. 20.\nAccording\
    \ to Step6, a map for Salhia land2 salinity is exported as GeoJSON and then Shapefile,\
    \ and opened \nusing Mapshaper which is a software for editing GeoJSON and Shapefile.\
    \ Figure 21a shows the exported map \nand Fig. 21b shows it in the Mapshaper.\n\
    Tables 5 and 6 show the result of Steps 7 and 8. Node1 is randomly selected for\
    \ the validation calculations. \nThe manually calculated indices are the same\
    \ as the system-calculated values.\nThe result of Step 9 for the LS index is shown\
    \ in Fig. 22a where the grid of LS interpolation values that is \nproduced by\
    \ turf interpolate and the LS classes isobands which are generated by turf isobands\
    \ are shown. We \ncan zoom in specific boundary to see more values constructing\
    \ the two isobands [0–0.4] and [0.4–0.7], Fig. 22b.\nFor Steps 5 and 10, first,\
    \ all the existing events were ignored, then the required events were formulated\
    \ and \nsubmitted, Fig. 23 shows the translation of the events required to be\
    \ tested for Salhia land2.\nNode6 in Salhia land2 is selected to fire the temperature\
    \ event, accordingly its temperature readings are \nadjusted to take this sequence:\
    \ {19, 18.5, 9, 9, 9.5, 9.8, 9, 9, 8, 8, ………}. It is evident from this that the\
    \ third \nreading fulfills the temperature condition, but the event will fire\
    \ only if it remains less than 10 for a period of \nFigure 19.  Gradual construction\

    \ after the 9 °C temperature value of Node6 was received by the server, \nthe\
    \ event was fired after that by 1 min and its associated actions were taken: the\
    \ on-screen text alert message and \nthe email messages to the event’s registered\
    \ email addresses.\nThe condition of the remaining two events for Salhia land1\
    \ and Salhia land2 is composed of six sub-condi-\ntions. The first three sub-conditions\
    \ are related to the N and K of the three nodes which are laboratory parameters\
    \ \nentered by the excel sheet and their values are adjusted to make these sub-conditions\
    \ true. The remaining three \nsub-conditions depend on the value of the OM readings\
    \ sent by the three nodes; they are adjusted to take these \nvalues for Salhia\
    \ land1: Node1{0.4}, Node6{0.48}, Node10{0.3}, and take this sequence for Salhia\
    \ land2: Node1{ \n0.5, 0.48,0.55, 2, 1.5, ……….}, Node6{ 0.3, 0.47,0.5, 0.55, 0.5,\
    \ ……….}, Node10{ 0.47, 0.47, 1,0.5,0.5, ……….}. \nFor Salhia land1, just after\
    \ the reading of Node10 was received at 1:06, the second three sub-conditions\
    \ were \nsatisfied and the command Close was sent to Salhia land1 base station\
    \ where it blinked the LED with the green \ncolor to indicate the reception of\
    \ Close command, see Fig. 25a. For Salhia land2, the first three readings of the\
    \ \nthree nodes satisfies only the sub-conditions of Node6 and Node10, just after\
    \ Node1 sent its second reading at \n21:47:32, its sub-conditions also became\
    \ true, therefore an Open command was sent to Salhia land2 base station \nwhere\
    \ it blinked the LED with the red color to indicate the reception of Open command,\
    \ see Fig. 25b.\nThe validation test2 scenario. This test is related to the land\
    \ of the field trips, Salhia land1 in test1 with the same \nsettings of system\
    \ parameters. This test aims at producing maps of parameters using both the traditional\
    \ method \nand EGYPADS. The function of EGYPADS Mapping service, which allows\
    \ for entering all nodes data manually \nthrough a specific format excel sheet,\
    \ is employed in this test. The 85 sample values of three parameters (P, N, and\
    \ \nPH), which were measured/estimated and analyzed in the field trips, were entered\
    \ into EGYPADS representing \nFigure 22.  The generated LS interpolation grid\
    \ and isobands, (a) the grid and isobands of the whole area, (b) a \nzoom in specific\

    nodes readings, and their spatial analysis maps were generated. The acceptable\
    \ format of the excel sheet is shown \nin Fig. 26.\nThe validation test2 results.\
    \ Figure 27 and 28 show the management zones maps of P, N, and PH generated \n\
    from the GIS used in the traditional method and the EGYPADS, respectively. It\
    \ is noticed that, in case of EGY-\nPADS, there are small areas at the four horizontal\
    \ and vertical borders of the land don’t belong to any zone. This \nis because\
    \ that EGYPADS requires putting at least one sensor node at each of the farthest\
    \ four ends of the land \nin order to divide the whole area of the region into\
    \ management zones, and this not satisfied by the grid system \nused to collect\
    \ the data in the field visits. This causes the total area of the EGYPADS management\
    \ zones to be \nless than GIS zones total area by about 5.6%. Also, it is noticed\
    \ that EGYPADS produces the same zones of the \nparameters with slight difference\
    \ in zones shape and area accordingly.\nThe values of zones areas using the two\
    \ methods are given in Table 7. Generally, there is a reduction in the \nEGYPADS\
    \ zones areas than the GIS due to the just mentioned reason and of course due\
    \ to different implementa-\ntion of methods in the two approaches. The average\
    \ difference in the zones area is estimated to be approximately \n24.77%.\nFigure 23.\

    The validation test3. This test validates the ability of the system to support\
    \ more than one land with different \ngeometry, area, location, and number of\
    \ nodes. Different lands satisfy these characteristics were registered in the\
    \ \nsystem. Figure 29, shows some of the lands, including the land in Fig. 29c\
    \ which receives the three nodes read-\ning from the real base station. Since\
    \ the three sensor nodes don’t have GPS, certain coordinates were assigned to\
    \ \nthem. The temperature readings of the three nodes at the test time had very\
    \ little variation, all of their readings \nfell in the 30–40 temperature range.\
    \ From the test it is concluded that the lower the rates of maps update and data\

    Discussion\nLSA for land-use planning and management is the core of the implemented\
    \ IoT-based PA system use case. It \nis a multi-criteria decision support problem,\
    \ and the research in this paper includes the conventional method \nused to solve\
    \ this problem besides the implemented automated DSS. The conventional method\
    \ requires per-\nforming a field trip may include travels to distant places, a\
    \ considerable number of labors to take the readings \nin the predefined sampling\
    \ points and record them, using PC-based programs for data analysis which may\
    \ not \nbe user friendly and require skilled person to use it. This is for one-time\
    \ field sampling which doesn’t represent \nthe temporal distribution of phenomena\
    \ and entails other trips. The implemented system allows sensing and \nactuation\
    \ nodes to work as the data collection labors distributed in the field in a way\
    \ that satisfies the required \nspatial distribution of the phenomena, and remain\
    \ in the field sending data from their places in real-time with \nany required\
    \ rate. All received data is stored by the system, and just after the data reception,\
    \ it automatically \nperforms the spatial analysis and displays the results; in\
    \ this way if a critical condition occurs to the field, it \nwill be detected\
    \ early. The system doesn’t require its user to do specialized commands. EGYPADS\
    \ provides a \nmodernization of the LSA activity.\nConclusion and future work\n\
    Proper agricultural management requires evaluating different soil properties.\
    \ Also, the characteristics of the soil \ndiffer from one site to another within\
    \ the same farm. Real-time monitoring of soil properties especially, moisture\
    \ \nand temperature are important for the success of the agricultural process.\
    \ The proposed system, EGYPADS, \nallows for continuous monitoring of soil properties,\
    \ and utilizes this in building a novel feature gives a facility \nto classify\
    \ the farm into different zones for proper management in real-time as well as\
    \ from historical data with \nhigh temporal resolution. To the best of our knowledge,\
    \ this is the first smart agriculture system that automates \nthe practice of\
    \ land suitability assessment in order to facilitate it and increase its efficiency\
    \ in terms of accuracy \nof decision-making, need for manpower, time and effort\
    \ wasted on repeated field visits. As a smart agriculture \napplication, EGYPADS\
    \ is designed to take into account the important smart agriculture services, adding\
    \ new \nservices, and improving the services functionality. EGYPADS has the advantages\
    \ of providing the facility to \nenter the data manually along with its inherent\
    \ feature of reading directly from field sensor nodes. Although \nthe proposed\
    \ software gave reasonable results for soil management zones of the potato crops,\
    \ it needs to include \nFigure 28.  The EGYPADS-generated maps.\nTable 7.  Management\

    Smart agriculture concept uses innovative solutions including IoT and Cloud storage\
    \ \nfeatures, dedicated sensors for monitoring basic agricultural parameters,\
    \ new \ncommunications protocols, etc. SmartAgro architecture comprises a telemetry\
    \ system for \nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as air & soil temperature,\
    \ air & soil relative \nhumidity, leaf wetness, etc. The current paper outlines\
    \ the reliability of the implemented \nsystem by comparing and analyzing data\
    \ collected in spring 2019 and spring 2020. The \nrelevance of this season consists\
    \ in great air variations due to the transition from winter to \nsummer. Being\
    \ monitored in a vine area near Bucharest, these data may be useful for \ndifferent\
    \ statistics related to grapes culture in this season and can be used by interested\
    \ \nparties for future predictions related to vine crops. Moreover, in this paper,\
    \ data fusion will \nallow advanced data management and coherence achievement\
    \ among collected data.  \nKeywords:  \nPrecision Agriculture \nData Fusion \n\
    Reliability \nSensors \n \n \n \n1. Introduction  \nThis paper is an extension\
    \ of work originally presented in \nSIITME’19 conference [1]. In [1] the authors\
    \ presented the \ntelemetry system with its main advantages consisting in solar\
    \ panel \nsupply and data reliability. The current work extends the \ndemonstration\
    \ of the system’s reliability by processing data from \nSpring 2019 and Spring\
    \ 2020. In addition to the previous work, \ndata fusion will be used to fill the\
    \ gaps between the recorded data \nand to ensure a proper system’s management.\
    \ \nConsidering all climate changes, the evolution of the \nagriculture plays\
    \ an important role in the lives and well-being of \npeople, since it represents\
    \ a source of food for population and, \nrespectively for domestic animals. Climate\
    \ change influences \nagriculture in different ways. Changes in temperature and\
    \ \nprecipitation are already affecting crop yields [2]. Consequently, \npeople\
    \ must adapt to and implicitly adjust the solutions used to \nensure food or water\
    \ quality, for irrigation and daily use [3]. The \nhealth of soils and crop, also,\
    \ is very important, as it affects the \nquality and quantity of agricultural\
    \ crops [4, 5]. \nWhen required to evaluate successful analysed crops, the key\
    \ \nperformance indicators (KPIs) must be considered since they are \nquantitative,\
    \ practical, directional, and actionable. Depending on \nthe analysed corps, KPIs\
    \ differ. For example, based on KPIs crop \nusage can be tracked to evaluate the\
    \ production and to monitor the \noverall costs. The most significant impacts\
    \ of KPIs on agriculture \nare increased productivity, profit and time save [6].\
    \ \nAn important role in the precision agriculture is played by IoT \nplatforms.\
    \ Using them, the quality of the crops can be enhanced by \nreal time data acquisition,\
    \ processing and decision making. These \ndata are converted, thus, in useful\
    \ information for farmers, and, \nalso, in a facile understandable manner [7].\
    \ Capturing, \ntransmitting, storing and processing the volume of information\
    \ \ncollected by sensors connected on the IoT platform, show a \nnumber of challenges,\
    \ in particular, regarding integration \ntechnologies, communications, databases\

    \ the platform can deal with the requirements \nand limitations of different countries,\
    \ climate, soils, and crops, \nwhich require flexibility to adapt to a range of\
    \ deployment \nconfigurations involving mixed technologies [10]. \nData fusion\
    \ techniques applied on data collected by different \nsensors used in agricultural\
    \ area allow a better understanding of \nparameters’ evolution and advanced data\
    \ management, especially \nin cases where the data volume is huge [11], [12].\
    \ Yet, the \napplicability domain is not limited only to agriculture, but it can\
    \ \ncomprise different applications that are sensor-based and that \nimply multiple\
    \ data sources. \nThe current paper aims to emphasize the role of the \nimplemented\
    \ SmartAgro telemetry system in ensuring reliable \ndata for further use in statistics\
    \ and specialized predictions. Data \nfusion methods will allow additional processing\
    \ that will offer a \nglobal perspective of the monitored parameters. The paper\
    \ is \norganized as follows: Section 2 presents the related work on data \nfusion\
    \ solution for key parameters monitored in precision \nagriculture; Section 3\
    \ contains the description of SmartAgro \ntelemetry system and in Section 4 system’s\
    \ setup and relevant \nmonitoring results are presented. Data fusion implications\
    \ are \noutlined in Section 5 and Section 6 comprises Conclusions. \n2. Data Fusion\
    \ for Agricultural Area \nAccording to [13], when acquirred data present high\
    \ and \ndiverse information, data fusion considers the juxtaposition of \nlarge\
    \ set of data to ensure reliable, homogeneously and fair \noverview of the collected\
    \ information. The advantage of data \nfusion of data received from multiple different\
    \ sensors relies in “an \nimproved estimate of physical phenomenon via redundant\
    \ \nobservations” [14]. The efficiency of data fusion was previously \ndemonstrated\
    \ in precision agriculture domain [15-18]. In [15], \nauthors present the benefits\
    \ on crop monitoring of 2D and 3D data \nfusion for a vineyard monitoring and\
    \ use the results in order to \nclassify vines in serveral classes by processing\
    \ data from multiple \nsources (different sensors, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs),\
    \ \netc). In 2012, in [16] different data fusion methods were used (e.g. \nmultiple\
    \ linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression \n(PLSR) and principal\
    \ components analysis combined with \nstepwise multiple linear regression (PCA+SMLR)\
    \ techniques) to \npredict multiple soil properties. Authors’ conclusions indicate\
    \ that \ndata fusion techniques are more relevant in clayey field and worse \n\
    in sandy field and, in addition, these methods can improve the \nquality of soil\
    \ sensing in precision agriculture if appropriate \nsensors are selected. Later,\
    \ in 2017, sensor data fusion for soil \nhealth assessment was applied in [17]\
    \ and, as a result, faster \ndetermination of soil health was achieved by merging\
    \ data \ngathered from all sensors. In a more advanced manner, in [18] \nsensing\
    \ data fusion methods are involved in crop detection. \nAuthors use an efficient\
    \  method  of fusing multi-source remote \nsensing images with a convolution neural\
    \ networks (CNN) for  \nsemantic  segmentation to identify crops (93% succesful\
    \ rate) in \ndetecting and identifying crops. \nIn this paper we use data fusion\
    \ technique on agricultural KPIs \nto fill the gaps and to create a complete picture\
    \ of their variation \neven in the absence of their recording by the telemetry\
    \ system. \n3. ADCON-based Architecture of Telemetry System \nMonitoring of KPIs\
    \ (such as air and soil temperature, crop \nstate, air and soil relative humidity)\
    \ for a vine located in a \nresidential area close to Bucharest was performed\
    \ using an \nADCON-based telemetry system (called SmartAgro). The selected \n\
    season was spring since it is a season in which high variations may \nbe observed\
    \ because of the transition from winter to summer (two \nseasons with extreme\
    \ temperatures). Figure 1 illustrates the new \nconcept of SmartAgro telemetry\
    \ system in which different \ndedicated agricultural sensors are interconnected\
    \ for main \nparameter’s monitoring.  \nFigure 1: SmartAgro innovative architecture\
    \ [19] \nThe data acquired from the agricultural sensors were \ncentralized into\
    \ a database and were used to highlight the impact \nof measured parameters on\
    \ crops [19]. The architecture differs \nfrom the traditional ones by introducing\
    \ two new levels consisting \nin: The Edge level: at this level telemetry data\

    \ monitoring. This determines the optimization \nof communication, in terms of\
    \ traffic and energy consumption. \nLoRa technology is proposed for monitoring\

    \ of the \nproposed telemetry system are given in [19]. \n4. Extended monitoring\
    \ results \nTo demonstrate the reliability of the system, extended \nmonitoring\
    \ results are presented. The measurements were \nperformed in 2019 and 2020 and\
    \ the data were acquired each 6 \nhours per day, starting with 8 a.m. \n4.1. Air\
    \ temperature monitoring  \n \nFigure 2 illustrates the variation of air temperature\
    \ during \nSpring of 2019 and 2020. \n \n \nFigure 2: Air temperature variation\
    \ in Spring 2019 (up), Spring 2020 (down) \n \nBased on results in Figure 2, it\
    \ can be seen the patterns of the \nday-night air temperature variation, also\
    \ called Day/Night \nDifferential (DIF). Higher temperature peaks can be observed\
    \ in \nFigure 3. DIF value has multiple significances: firstly, DIF values \n\
    were related to plant growth. Moreover, values of DIF around 8°C \nwere proved\
    \ to provide the best plant growth, whereas DIF values \nbetween 12°C and 22°C\
    \ showed a low correlation to the predicted \nresults in [20] for Chrysanthemum.\
    \  \n \nFrom the air temperature data provided by SmartAgro platform \nin the\
    \ two seasons (Spring 2019 and Spring 2020), we can state \nthat in Spring 2019\
    \ the plant growing should have been more \npronounced, as the DIF was lower than\
    \ 12°C. \n \n \nFigure 3: Soil temperature variation in Spring 2019 (up), Spring\
    \ 2020 (down) \n4.2. Soil temperature monitoring  \n \nFrom Figure 3, which outline\
    \ the variation of soil temperature \nfor Spring 2019 and Spring 2020, there can\
    \ be observed that the \npatterns are identical with their correspondent air temperature\
    \ data \nin Spring 2019 and, respectively, in Spring 2020, with the \nexception\
    \ of a temperature offset of -5°C for both Spring 2019 and \nfor Spring 2020.\
    \  \n4.3. Relative air humidity monitoring  \n \nFrom Figure 4, which depicts\
    \ the variation of relative air \nhumidity for Spring 2019 and Spring 2020, it\
    \ can be observed that \nthe supersaturation phenomenon was similarly frequent\
    \ in both \nyears. This is related to the prediction of the rainfall and appears\
    \ \nwhen the air humidity reaches 100%.  \n \n \nFigure 4: Relative air humidity\

    \ follows the same \npattern, with an offset of -15% both in Spring 2019 and in\
    \ Spring \n2020. \n4.5. Leaf wetness monitoring  \n \nFigure 6 presents the leaf\

    \ graphical representations did not reveal the \nabsence of some data or the heterogeneity\
    \ of the data. For example, \nfrom the previous graphs there cannot be noticed\
    \ the absence of \nthe samples for certain moments of the day or even the fact\
    \ that \nthe samples were not acquired at the same moment every day. \nMoreover,\
    \ the data were not acquired each day. \nThe time intervals for data collection\
    \ are March 4th, 2019 and \nMay 31st, 2019 (Spring 2019) and March 1st, 2020 and\
    \ May 28th, \n2020 (Spring 2020), respectively. Analysing data of a real \nacquisition,\
    \ it can be remarked that the samples were collected at \nthe time moments given\
    \ in Table 1. \nTable 1: Classification of the samples based on the moment of\
    \ acquisition \nHours (0-\n24) \nNo. of \nDays \n(ND) \nND \n(2019) \nND \n(2020)\

    \ issues \nconcerning the predictions and forecasts or the decisions taken by\
    \ \nthe support decision systems integrated in the overall architecture. \nNevertheless,\
    \ sensor data fusion techniques can bring many \nbenefits such that the faults\
    \ triggered by the data gaps can be \nmitigated. For exemplification, two variables\
    \ are considered: air \ntemperature and soil temperature. They were chosen after\
    \ the \nanalysis of the samples acquired because the vectors storing their \n\
    values comprise NaN values, that is, there are missing samples in \nair temperature\
    \ and soil temperature data because of system \nfailures. \nIn Figure 7, it is\
    \ illustrated the graphical representation of the \nair temperature variation\
    \ at 3 a.m. and 2 a.m. for each of the days \nin which the data were collected,\
    \ more precisely, in the intervals \nMarch 4th, 2019 and May 31st, 2019 (88 days)\
    \ and March 1st, 2020 \nand May 28th, 2020 (88 days). Figure 7 highlights small,\
    \ but \nimportant, data gaps. \n \nFigure 7: Air temperature measured at 2am and\
    \ 3am in Spring 2019  \nand Spring 2020 \nIn Figure 8, it is highlighted the soil\
    \ temperature variation \nduring the same seasons, and it can be noticed that\
    \ also soil \ntemperature data is missing. In addition, as previously mentioned,\
    \ \nthe soil temperature follows the same variation pattern as in the \ncase of\
    \ air temperature and, by computing the difference between \nair and soil temperature,\
    \ a constant value of 5°C is determined. \nTherefore, finding a method to determine\
    \ an approximate value \nfor air temperature will also succeed in determining\
    \ the \napproximate value for soil temperature, too, and vice versa. \n \nFigure\
    \ 8: Soil temperature measured at 2am and 3am in Spring 2019 \nand Spring 2020\
    \ \nFurther, the choice of soil temperature and air temperature \nvariables will\
    \ be justified with respect to the variation of the other \nparameters. Analyzing\
    \ the graphical representation of air relative \nhumidity (Figure 9), soil humidity\
    \ (Figure 10) and leaf wetness \n(Figure 11) variations, missing data can be also\
    \ observed (samples \nmissing before and after March 13, 2019), but the data gaps\
    \ are \naffecting all variables. The only variables that experience isolated \n\
    data gaps when all the other parameters are represented are soil \ntemperature\
    \ and air temperature. \nIn Figure 9, air relative humidity variation for the\
    \ same moment \nof day for Spring 2019 and Spring 2020 is represented. It can\
    \ be \nobserved that the minimum air relative humidity recorded in \nSpring 2019,\
    \ at 2 a.m., is 37.78 % and it was recorded on March \n24th, 2019, while the maximum\
    \ value of 100% was reached 7 \ntimes (March 11-12, 2019; March 15, 2019; April\
    \ 11th-12,2019; \nMay 11th-12,2019).   \nRegarding the air relative humidity measured\
    \ at 3 a.m., in \nSpring 2019, the minimum value was 55.74% on March 9th, 2019,\
    \ \nI. Marcu et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems\

    \ the maximum value (100%) was reached 10 times (10% in \nMarch, 40% in April,\
    \ 50% in May). \n \nFigure 9: Air relative humidity measured at 2am and 3am in\
    \ Spring 2019 and \nSpring 2020 \nIn Spring 2020, the minimum value of the air\
    \ relative humidity \nmeasured at 2 am was 47.45% on March 16, 2020, whereas the\
    \ \nmaximum value (100%) recorded at 2 a.m. was reached 10 times \n(40% in March,\
    \ 30% in April and 30% in May). \nConcerning the samples acquired at 3 a.m. in\
    \ Spring 2020, the \nminimum value of air relative humidity was recorded on \n\
    13.04.2020 (48.57%), whereas the maximum value of 100% was \nreached 9 times (22.2\
    \ % in March, 11.1% in April and 66.7% in \nMay). \nComputing the difference between\
    \ soil humidity and air \nhumidity, a constant difference of 15% is achieved and\
    \ it can be \nseen that the variations patterns are identical (Figure 10). This\
    \ can \nbe proven also by computing the standard deviation (SD) for each \nseason\
    \ for the two possible time moments of acquisition (2 a.m. \nand 3 a.m.) for both\
    \ variables. For both soil and air humidity \nvariables, the values of the standard\
    \ deviation coincide and are \ngiven in Table 2. \nTable 2:  Standard deviation\

    \ \nAgriculture is an on-going evolving domain since worldwide \nsurvival depends\
    \ in on it a great manner. Telemetry systems \ndeveloped for crop and field monitoring\
    \ (such as SmartAgro) play \nimportant roles in providing crucial KPIs related\
    \ to air & soil \ntemperature and/or air & soil humidity, as well as crop diseases\
    \ \ndetection. The architecture of the implemented SmartAgro system \nis highlighted\
    \ by two relevant levels: The Edge level and the \nLocal Storage level. They enable\
    \ data classification and use \nparameters improvement in various cases such as\
    \ alert scenarios \nand for applications. on-field, off-line. \n Being equipped\
    \ with multiple different, SmartAgro provides \nmassive quantity of data for the\
    \ monitored parameters. In this \npaper, the reliability of the recorded data\
    \ provided by the \ntelemetry system is outlined by performing measurements in\
    \ 2 \nconsecutive years (2019 and 2020) with a frequency of 6h/ day. \nBased on\
    \ the collected data related to the air temperature in \nSpring 2019 and Spring\
    \ 2020, it can be noticed that Spring 2019 \nwas a more favourable season for\
    \ plant growing since the DIF was \nlower than 12°C. The variation of soil temperature\
    \ led to the \nobservation that the patterns are identical with their correspondent\
    \ \nair temperature data in both seasons (Spring 2019 and Spring \n2020). Further,\
    \ by recording data on relative soil humidity and \nleaf wetness there was observed\
    \ that there is no evidence of \ncorrelation between the monitored parameters.\
    \ Yet, the \nsimilarities in variations during Spring 2019 and Spring 2020 \n\
    demonstrates the reliability of the data recorded using SmartAgro \ntelemetry\
    \ system. \nSince it was noticed that the monitored parameters have not \nbeen\
    \ collected at the same moment in time with regularity, data \nfusion technique\
    \ was used to fill the gaps and to provide a global \noverview on the behaviour\
    \ of the system. Two KPIs have been \nconsidered: air temperature and soil temperature.\
    \ Using data \nfusion, it was proven that: \n- \nBy finding a method to determine\
    \ an approximate value for \nair temperature will also succeed in determining\
    \ the \napproximate value for soil temperature, too, and vice versa. \n- \nBy\
    \ finding the approximate value of the air relative humidity, \nthe approximate\
    \ value of the soil humidity can also be \ndetermined. \nAs conclusion, the goals\
    \ of data fusion referring to advanced \ndata management and coherence achievement\
    \ among collected \ndata were achieved within this research. \n \nConflict of\

    \ context of smart city construction, the changes brought by the smart system\
    \ to the city are not only material\nintelligence, but also because the smart\
    \ system is completed by the cooperation of human wisdom and the wisdom of things,\
    \ it\nis even more enhanced. There are various connections between people and\
    \ people and cities. In this paper, the construction of\nurban parks, its management,\
    \ and service requirements also show a trend of diversiﬁed development. However,\
    \ some\ntraditional urban parks cannot meet the new social needs. The application\
    \ of smart park systems in their renovation is an\nimportant way for urban parks\
    \ to rejuvenate and is an indispensable part of smart city construction. For urban\
    \ parks, the\nupgrade of smartization in the traditional park model is not only\
    \ an inevitable trend in the development of information\ntechnology but also an\
    \ important direction for the future construction of parks. The purpose of this\
    \ paper is to study and\ndiscuss the systematic methods applied by the smart park\
    \ system in the renovation and renewal of urban parks, to discuss the\ncommon\
    \ problems and solutions faced in the renovation and renewal of urban parks today,\
    \ and to realize the renovation of\nthe smart park system of urban parks. And\
    \ by studying the application background, ways, and needs of the smart park system,\n\
    it will carry out practical exploration on the renovation and renewal of Wuhan\
    \ Jiefang Park. Through the analysis of the\ncurrent situation of the Jiefang\
    \ Park and the interpretation of the existing problems, special transformation\
    \ is carried out under\nthe guidance of the smart park system according to the\
    \ existing problems, and the methods and systems of the application of\nthe smart\
    \ park system are summarized through practice. From a practical point of view,\
    \ the update design strategy proposed\nin this paper is tested.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Many cities take the construction of smart cities as a strate-\ngic choice for\
    \ transformation and development, setting oﬀ a\nboom in the construction of smart\
    \ cities [1]. With the rapid\ndevelopment of new-generation information technologies\n\
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and cloud\ncomputing, as well\
    \ as their wide application in smart city\nconstruction, the management and service\
    \ needs of urban\nparks also show a trend of diversiﬁed development. The\nfunctional\
    \ layout, management methods, and service activi-\nties of many traditional urban\
    \ parks today cannot fully meet\nthe various needs of the current information\
    \ age [2]. How to\nmaintain urban green space such as urban parks can adapt\n\
    to the development of the age of wisdom, meet the current\nneeds of urban managers\
    \ and residents, and exert greater\necological beneﬁts are issues that need special\
    \ attention in\nthe development of urban parks. To become an indispens-\nable\
    \ part of smart city construction, the construction of\nurban parks must rely\
    \ on scientiﬁc and technological means\nto realize smart management and smart\
    \ services through the\nconstruction of smart park systems [3]. The goal of smart\n\
    operation and smart facilities is to lay a solid foundation\nfor the sustainable\
    \ development of urban parks.\nDue to changes in the society and environment,\
    \ our\nlandscape types have also become complex and diverse.\nHowever, because\
    \ the development of landscape architecture\ninformation technology in China is\
    \ relatively backward, the\ntheoretical system of digital chemistry has not yet\
    \ been\nformed, and the platform is weak, resulting in a lower\nHindawi\nJournal\
    \ of Sensors\nVolume 2023, Article ID 9188907, 13 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2023/9188907\n\
    threshold for the landscape architecture industry [4]. The\nmastery level is uneven,\
    \ the theory is not solid, the practical\nexperience is not rich enough, and there\
    \ is a lack of software\ntechnical talents. In addition, the project construction\
    \ period\nis generally shortened, and the designers cannot be like the\nancient\
    \ gardeners [5]. After the garden is completed and\nlanded, it will be continuously\
    \ adjusted through long-term\nobservation experience, so that the garden landscape\
    \ will\nreach a near-perfect state. Therefore, if we want to make\ngood use of\
    \ the beneﬁts of the development of the times\nand follow the pace of the times,\
    \ we should give priority to\nthe use of digital technology and the participation\
    \ of multi-\ndisciplinary professionals to help designers optimize the\ndesign\
    \ and make the landscape more scientiﬁc and ecologi-\ncal. The application of\
    \ smart park systems can greatly satisfy\nurban residents’ [6] travel needs. The\
    \ application of the\nsmart park system enables urban parks not only to better\n\
    play traditional functions such as ecological protection and\nscientiﬁc propaganda\
    \ and education but also to enhance\nthe landscape interaction of urban parks,\
    \ to use digital infor-\nmation technology to make the relationship between urban\n\
    parks and urban residents closer, to achieve the harmonious\ncoexistence of man\
    \ and nature, and to enhance the image of\nthe city and the happiness of residents’\
    \ life.\nThe connection between urban parks and urban resi-\ndents is very close,\
    \ and excellent urban parks can greatly\nimprove the quality of life of urban\
    \ residents. After decades\nof construction, development, management, and operation,\n\
    many urban parks have become indispensable green spaces\nin cities [7]. In view\
    \ of the problem that some traditional\nurban parks cannot meet the needs of current\
    \ urban resi-\ndents in a timely manner, these urban parks need to be\nupgraded\
    \ and updated intelligently to enhance the vitality\nof urban parks and to create\
    \ smart parks that meet the back-\nground of smart city construction. By applying\
    \ the smart\npark system to the renovation and reconstruction of some\ntraditional\
    \ urban parks, the image and service level of urban\nparks can be greatly improved\
    \ [8]. Therefore, this paper is\ndevoted to the research on the speciﬁc application\
    \ and\napproach of smart park system in the process of urban park\nrenovation\
    \ and renewal and to design smart garden system\nbased on wireless sensor technology\
    \ [9]. Introduce the smart\npark system into the development process of the renovation\n\
    and reconstruction of the park and build an urban smart\npark that provides residents\
    \ with a comfortable green space\nexperience and provides an intelligent operation\
    \ and man-\nagement model for the city park management department.\n2. Related\
    \ Works\nAt present, with the eﬀective development and continuous\nprogress of\
    \ social economy, modern science and technology\nhave made more achievements,\
    \ and the development of\nwireless sensor networks has become more mature. Because\n\
    the wireless sensor network itself has many advantages such\nas low cost and low\
    \ energy consumption, its application\nscope in the ﬁeld of environmental monitoring\
    \ is gradually\nexpanding, and good application results have been achieved.\n\
    Cheng and Wu proposed that through the investigation and\nanalysis of the actual\
    \ application of wireless sensor networks\nin environmental monitoring, it is\
    \ found that the hardware\nresources of wireless sensor networks are limited,\
    \ and the\nwireless sensor nodes will be aﬀected by the energy con-\nsumption\
    \ of the body and the storage space in the process\nof environmental monitoring\
    \ [10]. The power consumption\nof related equipment is relatively large. If the\
    \ wireless sensor\nresources are limited and the battery cannot be replaced in\n\
    time, the overall eﬀect of environmental monitoring will be\naﬀected. Harfouche\
    \ et al. pointed out that the improvement\nof network monitoring data reliability\
    \ provides a guarantee.\nIn such systems, the construction of the system generally\n\
    includes sensor nodes, routers, gateways, and supervision\ncenters [11]. Among\
    \ them, the sensor nodes include data\nmonitoring nodes and aggregation nodes,\
    \ which are mainly\nresponsible for the data collection and transmission. The\n\
    router is responsible for the communication gateway\nbetween the supervision center\
    \ and the information collec-\ntion point based on a speciﬁc routing protocol\
    \ and is respon-\nsible for transmitting the received data to the supervision\n\
    center. The data storage center and the remote control cen-\nter are responsible\
    \ for storing monitoring data and sending\ncontrol commands, respectively. Overall,\
    \ the wireless sensor\nnetwork is a dynamic network system. The sensor nodes can\n\
    move freely. When the battery energy is used up or the node\nis disconnected from\
    \ the network due to the failure of the\nnode, it will also join the network due\
    \ to the needs of net-\nwork work. Bredikhin et al. pointed out that the network\n\
    can carry out eﬀective analysis and processing under certain\nlimited conditions\
    \ and clarify its speciﬁc request quantity,\nwhich is the energy eﬃciency of the\
    \ wireless sensor network.\nThe energy eﬃciency of wireless sensor networks is\
    \ also one\nof the most important and critical performance criteria in\nwireless\
    \ sensor networks [12].\nThe research on smart gardens is mainly divided into\n\
    two parts: theoretical research and applied research. In terms\nof theoretical\
    \ research, Bakshi and Charles proposed that the\ncurrent main digital design\
    \ methods are sorted out, and a\npreliminary and relatively accurate concept of\
    \ digital plan-\nning and design of landscape architecture is made [13]. In\n\
    the lineage delineation, the ﬁrst is the computer-aided design\nlineage, the second\
    \ is the digital design media and informa-\ntion management lineage, and the third\
    \ is the digital infor-\nmation model of landscape architecture. The computer-\n\
    aided design spectrum includes computer-aided design and\nanalysis, computer-generated\
    \ design, and parametric design.\nComputer-aided design is to carry out targeted\
    \ analysis of\nsite conditions and project requirements at the beginning\nof the\
    \ design according to the results of investigation and\ninspection and convert\
    \ this information into computer-\nidentiﬁable digital information for further\
    \ processing in\nother computer-aided design tools. Computer-aided evalua-\ntion\
    \ is to evaluate and judge the plan according to speciﬁc\nstandards after the\
    \ preliminary design plan is formed, ana-\nlyze the advantages and disadvantages,\
    \ and provide possible\ndirections for the modiﬁcation of the plan. Monteiro et\
    \ al.\npointed out that computer-generated design, using compu-\ntational geometry\
    \ and algorithm generation technology,\ngenerates dynamic and beautiful formal\
    \ structures, analyzes\n2\nJournal of Sensors\nthe dynamic evolution of landscape\
    \ architecture, analyzes\nthe spatial activities of creatures in the habitat,\
    \ including\nhuman beings, and is also used to predict the changing trend\nof\
    \ ecological environment metabolism [14]. It can also per-\nform architectural\
    \ and spatial scale layout, road generation,\nand sculpture creation. Parametric\
    \ design can temporarily\nbe understood as parametric modeling. A geometric model\n\
    controlled by speciﬁc parameters is established on a software\nplatform with parametric\
    \ functions. After the geometric\nmodel passes the design evaluation stage, the\
    \ evaluation\ninformation is fed back to the parameterization in the form\nof\
    \ parameters. The software platform is further optimized.\nIn the application\
    \ research section, A. Atilgan and C. Atilgan\npointed out that the application\
    \ content of landscape digital\ntechnology includes digital analysis, digital\
    \ aided design, dig-\nital modeling, digital media, and virtual visualization\
    \ tech-\nnology; for digital analysis, my country was originally\napplied in the\
    \ ﬁeld of geographic information, using GIS\ntechnology to digitally analyze and\
    \ simulate hydrology, ter-\nrain, climate, ecological suitability, and landscape\
    \ patterns\nand use network multisource data analysis to conduct\nresearch on\
    \ spatial heat, urban spatial distribution, and road\naccessibility [15]. For\
    \ the development of related software,\ndigital aided design is also gradually\
    \ applied to landscape\nplanning and design, using GIS, Sketchup, 3DMax, Photo-\n\
    shop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lumion, and other software for\npreanalysis, establishment\
    \ of 3D models, program text and\nrendering production, and virtual animation\
    \ video [16].\n3. Design of Smart Garden System Based on\nWireless Sensors Network\n\
    3.1. Selection of Wireless Sensors. The wireless sensor net-\nwork architecture\
    \ consists of wireless sensor network proto-\ncols, which are mainly responsible\
    \ for signal modulation and\neﬀective transmission and reception of signals, such\
    \ as infra-\nred and data link layer. The data link layer is responsible for\n\
    the detection of data framing and is responsible for expand-\ning the media for\
    \ strict access to the protocol; it can also\nachieve point-to-point and point-to-multipoint\
    \ communica-\ntion goals without socket control.\nWireless sensor network (WSN)\
    \ is a form of network\nformed by freely organizing and combining tens of thousands\n\
    of sensor nodes through wireless communication technology.\nThe units constituting\
    \ the sensor node are the data acquisition\nunit, data transmission unit, data\
    \ processing unit, and energy\nsupply unit. It is a wireless network composed\
    \ of a large num-\nber of static or mobile sensors in a self-organizing and multi-\n\
    hop manner, which cooperatively senses, collects, processes,\nand transmits information\
    \ about sensed objects within a geo-\ngraphic area covered by the network and\
    \ ultimately sends this\ninformation to the network owner.\nWireless sensor networks\
    \ have many types of sensors\nthat can detect a variety of phenomena in the surrounding\n\
    environment,\nincluding\nearthquakes,\nelectromagnetism,\ntemperature, humidity,\
    \ noise, light intensity, pressure, soil\ncomposition, size, speed, and direction\
    \ of moving objects.\nThe soil moisture sensor is mainly used to measure the\n\
    moisture content in the soil, which plays an important role\nin understanding\
    \ soil moisture and realizing scientiﬁc and\nprecise irrigation. According to\
    \ the needs of the automatic\ncontrol system for precision irrigation of sunken\
    \ gardens\nof Beijing Forestry University for soil moisture measure-\nment, the\
    \ HYSWR-ARC soil moisture sensor independently\ndeveloped by the Precision Water-Saving\
    \ Irrigation Control\nLaboratory of the School of Engineering, Beijing Forestry\n\
    University, was selected to monitor the sunken gardens. Soil\nmoisture content\
    \ provides important data parameters for\nprecise irrigation decision theory.\
    \ The principle of the\nHYSWR-ARC soil moisture sensor is to use a signal source\n\
    with a frequency of 100 MHz to send out a wireless wave sig-\nnal, and the wireless\
    \ wave signal is transmitted to the probe\ncomposed of four stainless steel probes\
    \ through a coaxial\ntransmission line. When the impedance is diﬀerent, the volt-\n\
    age amplitudes of the incident wave and the reﬂected wave\nare diﬀerent when the\
    \ signal propagates on the transmission\nline. The superposition forms a standing\
    \ wave, and the volt-\nage at each point on the transmission line changes. The\
    \ ana-\nlog acquisition module can convert the value of soil moisture\ncontent\
    \ by collecting the voltage value of the sensor signal\nline, and its performance\
    \ indicators are shown in Table 1.\nThe sensor measures soil water content based\
    \ on the\nprinciple of standing wave rate. The product has the func-\ntions of\
    \ analog signal output (0~2.5 V) and RS232 digital sig-\nnal. It has the advantages\
    \ of convenient use, accurate\nmeasurement, and rapid response. It is widely used\
    \ in scien-\ntiﬁc experiments, water saving irrigation, greenhouses, and\nother\
    \ water content measurement.\nIn this project, the soil moisture sensor is buried\
    \ in the\narea where soil moisture content needs to be detected as\nshown in Figure\
    \ 1, and the soil moisture content is moni-\ntored in real time to provide important\
    \ data parameters for\nirrigation decision-making.\nInstallation diagram of soil\
    \ moisture sensor air tempera-\nture and humidity, carbon dioxide sensor monitoring\
    \ air\ntemperature, humidity and carbon dioxide content, and\nother microenvironmental\
    \ information can be displayed in\ndigital form to understand the current environmental\
    \ infor-\nmation more intuitively. It can provide data parameter guid-\nance for\
    \ future analysis of plant growth status by detecting\ncarbon dioxide content.\n\

    \ is 1°C. The carbon\ndioxide sensor selects the SenseAir S80053 sensor imported\n\
    from Sweden, which has high precision in measuring carbon\ndioxide. In the case\
    \ of good environmental conditions, the\nmeasured value is generally 400 ppm.\n\
    3.2. Theoretical Research on Smart Gardens. “Smart gardens”\nare modern smart\
    \ landscape gardens with smart service sys-\ntems that meet the new requirements\
    \ of the new era. In\naddition, the concept of smart garden in a broad sense is\n\
    deﬁned as follows: based on “the Internet of Things” tech-\nnology, combined with\
    \ many advanced science and technol-\nogy such as big data, cloud computing, mobile\
    \ Internet, and\nspatial geographic information system (GIS), in the planning\n\
    and design of landscape gardens. In the construction, pro-\nduction, research,\
    \ and management of garden and landscape\nfacilities, many facilities and functions\
    \ within the garden are\nconnected with each other with high-tech hands, forming\
    \ an\nintelligent unity of information collection, sharing, and feed-\nback, while\
    \ fully respecting the wisdom of nature, to further\nsublimate humanistic wisdom.\
    \ In addition, it is necessary to\nuse\nadvanced\nscientiﬁc\nand technological\n\
    wisdom\nto\nenhance and improve various functions of garden landscape,\necology,\
    \ recreation, and so on from multiple angles, levels,\nand aspects, in order to\
    \ achieve eﬃcient garden intelligent\nservice and management.\nThe technical level\
    \ of the system architecture is divided\ninto ﬁve layers: perception layer, network\
    \ layer, data layer,\nplatform layer, and application layer, which is shown in\n\
    Figure 2. The perception layer is the foundation of the entire\narchitecture and\
    \ the main way to obtain and transmit data\nand information. Aerial survey, remote\
    \ sensing, GPS, satel-\nlite positioning, and digital map technologies are used\
    \ to col-\nlect various data in the park. The network layer is a bridge\nfor information\
    \ and data transmission, which can transmit\nvarious data information collected\
    \ and realize the eﬃciency\nof data transmission based on the “5G network” and\
    \ “Inter-\nnet of Things.” The data layer has a storage function. It can\nadd\
    \ and subtract, store, and analyze a large amount of data\nand at the same time\
    \ make intelligent decision-making and\nintuitively display real-time data and\
    \ decision-making\nprompts in the platform layer to achieve deep data sorting\n\

    application. The intelligent management system is oriented to\npark managers,\
    \ making intelligent decisions or artiﬁcial deci-\nsions through the collected\
    \ real-time data and feedback to\nadjust the park intelligent management facilities\
    \ such as park\nintelligent sprinkler irrigation facilities; the intelligent service\n\
    system is oriented to park tourists, through big data analysis,\ninformation transmission\
    \ feedback, application of intelligent\nservice facilities, and other means to\
    \ provide tourists with a\nvariety of intelligent services.\n3.3. Research on\
    \ Smart Garden Facilities\n3.3.1. Smart Management System Facilities. The smart\
    \ man-\nagement system is a system in the smart park system for\npark managers\
    \ to manage the park intelligently through\nanalysis,\nprocessing,\nand\ntimely\n\
    feedback\nadjustment\nthrough the park intelligent management facilities, in order\n\
    to realize the intelligent management of the park as a whole.\nThe perception\
    \ layer, network layer, data layer, and platform\nlayer in the ﬁve systems of\
    \ the smart garden architecture\nserve for the intelligent practice of the management\
    \ system,\nand the application layer is the goal and realization form of\nthe\
    \ intelligent management system.\nThe\napplication\nof\nintelligent\nmanagement\n\
    system\nincludes environmental monitoring system (environmental\nquality monitoring,\
    \ water quality monitoring, and biodiversity\nmonitoring), intelligent irrigation\
    \ system (automatic sprinkler\nirrigation system and remote control system), intelligent\
    \ light-\ning (automatic induction and remote control and intelligent\ndetection\
    \ of equipment failure), intelligent maintenance\n(intelligent cleaning, protection\
    \ of pests and diseases, protec-\ntion of ancient and famous trees, ﬁre monitoring,\
    \ and equip-\nment management), intelligent security (people and traﬃc\nﬂow monitoring,\
    \ real-time security positioning and schedul-\ning, and emergency warning), intelligent\
    \ transportation (entry\npark population analysis and unmanned vehicle scheduling),\n\
    and smart energy consumption management (water and\npower consumption management\
    \ and rapid fault location).\nThe successful realization of feedback regulation\
    \ of intel-\nligent management system requires the support of intelligent\nmanagement\
    \ facilities. Intelligent management facilities are\nmainly divided into sensor\
    \ devices and intelligent feedback\nadjustment facilities. The intelligent management\
    \ facilities\nin the environmental monitoring system include data collec-\ntion\
    \ devices such as integrated sensors and water quality\nsensors for collecting\
    \ information such as park air and water\nquality. Cooling sprays, smart water\
    \ pumps, etc. are used for\nfeedback regulation facility for park cooling or water\
    \ quality\ncleanup. The intelligent management facilities in the intelli-\ngent\
    \ irrigation system include soil sensors for detecting soil\nconditions in the\
    \ park and intelligent sprinkler irrigation\ndevices for sprinkler irrigation.\
    \ The intelligent management\nfacilities in intelligent lighting are intelligent\
    \ street lamps,\nwhich integrate infrared sensing and intelligent light adjust-\n\
    ment. The intelligent management facilities in intelligent\nmaintenance include\
    \ wireless multimedia sensor network sys-\ntem for monitoring plant diseases and\
    \ insect pests; DHT22,\nAM2302, and HP206C sensors for monitoring the growth sta-\n\
    tus of ancient and famous trees; and ﬁre detection sensors for\nmonitoring ﬁre.\
    \ Intelligent management facilities in smart\nsecurity include smart face recognition\
    \ cameras, which can\nmonitor tourists and road safety in the park in real time.\n\
    The two applications of intelligent transportation and intelli-\ngent energy consumption\
    \ management mainly use the combi-\nnation of intelligent camera monitoring and\
    \ manual rapid\nresponse to realize the intelligent management of parks.\nMost\
    \ of the existing routing protocols use clustering to\noptimize the network, and\
    \ some network protocols preset\nthe number of cluster heads. This algorithm cannot\
    \ achieve\nnetwork energy balance. When the number of cluster heads\nis set too\
    \ small, the distance between the member nodes in\nthe cluster and the cluster\
    \ head node will be too far, causing\nthe member nodes to consume too much energy\
    \ in data\ntransmission, and even some member nodes exceed the reli-\nable communication\
    \ range. Monitoring data loss when the\nnumber of cluster heads is too large will\
    \ also cause excess\nenergy consumption, because the cluster head node under-\n\
    takes the tasks of data reception, forwarding, and fusion pro-\ncessing of the\
    \ member nodes in the cluster. The relationship\nbetween the number of groups\
    \ and network energy con-\nsumption is shown as follows:\nd2\ntoCH =\nð ð\nÀa2\
    \ + b2\nÁρ a, b\nð\nÞⅆaⅆb,\nð1Þ\nd2\ntoCH =\nð ð\nr2ρ r, θ\nð\nÞⅆrⅆθ,\nð2Þ\nd2\n\
    toCH =\nð2π\n0\nð\n0\nM\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\npπNCH\nr3ρ r, θ\nð\nÞdrdθ:\nð3Þ\nThe ﬁnal\
    \ solution is as follows:\nd2\ntoCH =\nM2\n2πNCH\n:\nð4Þ\n3.3.2. Smart Service\
    \ System Facilities. On the other hand, the\nmain application of a smart garden\
    \ is to build a complete\nsmart service system. The smart service system is mainly\
    \ ori-\nented to tourists and applied to the needs of tourists in the\nprocess\
    \ of visiting the park. The application research of\nsmart service system in urban\
    \ park is the research content\nof this paper, and this part of the content will\
    \ be studied in\ndepth in the next paper.\nThe smart service system also has ﬁve\
    \ layers: the percep-\ntion layer, the network layer, the data layer, the platform\n\
    layer, and the application layer. However, compared with\nthe smart management\
    \ system, some smart service facilities\nin the smart service system can basically\
    \ achieve autono-\nmous feedback without going through the park’s AI brain\nand\
    \ performing data processing. Smart service facilities are\nmore often used to\
    \ collect tourist information such as ﬁtness\ninformation or intention to visit\
    \ the park. For example, the\n5\nJournal of Sensors\nsmart ﬁtness system senses\
    \ and collects various real-time\ndata of tourists in the park by establishing\
    \ a perception layer\nwith sensors as the main tool, including exercise kilometers.\n\
    Count, calorie consumption value, body temperature, body\nfat, and other indicators\
    \ display the corresponding data\nfeedback on the platform layer such as the smart\
    \ display\nscreen or the tourist mobile APP terminal. The intelligent\nservice\
    \ system is a set of more intelligent and modernized,\nmore user-friendly and\
    \ convenient, and more precise intelli-\ngent service system in line with the\
    \ concept of people-ori-\nented, built under the concept of smart garden.\nThe\
    \ smart service facilities in the smart service system\ngenerally include multimedia\
    \ touch screen interactive sys-\ntem, mobile APP guide, smart trail, smart AR\
    \ ﬁtness, ﬁtness\npoint system, rain garden interactive display device, interac-\n\
    tive bicycle device, natural soundscape experience device,\nhistorical and cultural\
    \ science, animal and plant science,\nsmart seats, smart conference rooms, and\
    \ smart unmanned\nvehicles.\n3.4. Digital Landscape Garden Design\n3.4.1. Related\
    \ Technical Support. Mobile Internet technology\ncan provide cloud-based services\
    \ and real-time resources\nand have the advantages of sharing and open functions.\n\
    Mobile Internet technology is an important technical sup-\nport foundation for\
    \ the smart upgrade and transformation\nof urban parks. Through its network construction\
    \ in urban\nparks, real-time sharing of various information within the\nparks\
    \ can be achieved to meet the management and use\nneeds of urban parks.\nThe Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) refers to the real-time\nacquisition of any object or process\
    \ that needs to be moni-\ntored, connected, and interacted with through various\n\
    devices and technologies, such as various information sen-\nsors, radio frequency\
    \ identiﬁcation technology, global posi-\ntioning systems, and infrared sensors,\
    \ and through various\npossible network access to collect all kinds of information\n\
    required, to achieve intelligent perception, recognition, and\nmanagement of objects\
    \ and processes. The Internet of\nThings is an information carrier based on the\
    \ Internet, tradi-\ntional telecommunication networks, etc. It enables all com-\n\
    mon physical objects to be addressed independently to\nform an interconnected\
    \ network [2]. Wireless sensor net-\nworks (WSNs) are distributed sensor networks\
    \ that detect\nthe outside world through sensors placed at terminals and\nacquire\
    \ and transmit the required data. The multihop ad\nhoc network composed of wireless\
    \ sensors in a wireless sen-\nsor network is an important technical form of the\
    \ underlying\nnetwork of the Internet of Things. A typical sensor network\nstructure\
    \ includes distributed sensor points (clusters), sink\nnodes, Internet, and user\
    \ interfaces.\nCloud computing is to decompose massive data comput-\ning processing\
    \ programs into countless small applications\nthrough the Internet, process and\
    \ analyze these small appli-\ncations through a system application composed of\
    \ multiple\ninformation processors and servers, and ﬁnally get the result\nand\
    \ return it to the user. Through the application of cloud\ncomputing technology\
    \ in the smart park system, the collec-\ntion and processing of various complex\
    \ information data\nin the park can be completed in a very short period of time,\n\
    providing powerful information technology services for the\npark. Cloud computing\
    \ is a type of distributed computing,\nwhich refers to decomposing huge data computing\
    \ process-\ning programs into countless small programs through the\nnetwork “cloud”\
    \ and then processing and analyzing these\nsmall programs through a system composed\
    \ of multiple\nservers to obtain results and return them to users. In the\nearly\
    \ days of cloud computing, it was simply distributed\ncomputing, which solved\
    \ task distribution and merged com-\nputing results. Therefore, cloud computing\
    \ is also known as\ngrid computing. Through this technology, it is possible to\n\
    complete the processing of tens of thousands of data in a\nvery short time (a\
    \ few seconds), thereby achieving powerful\nnetwork services.\nFor the division\
    \ of various areas involved in the applica-\ntion of wireless sensors in smart\
    \ gardens, the fuzzy clustering\nalgorithm is used. In fuzzy clustering, the sample\
    \ set X is\ndivided into k fuzzy subsets \x01X1, \x01X2, ⋯, \x01Xk, Sk\ni=1 supp\
    \ ð\x01XkÞ\n= X, where supp represents support sets of fuzzy sets. The\nmembership\
    \ function uil of the sample extends from {0, 1}\nbinary to [0, 1] interval, and\
    \ uil ∈ Mf .\nMf = uiljuil ∈ 0, 1\n½\n\x02\nf\n,\n〠\nk\ni=1\nuil = 1,∀l,\n0 <\
    \ 〠\nn\nl=1\nuil < n,∀i:\nð5Þ\nFor a given set of samples, fuzzy clustering analysis\
    \ can\neasily obtain a fuzzy k-partition U = fuilj1 ≤ i ≤ k ; 1 ≤ l ≤ ng.\n3.4.2.\
    \ Basic Architecture. Garden planning ﬁrst needs to\nbuild a perfect smart garden\
    \ system. By establishing a per-\nception layer, BIM information model, 3S (GPS,\
    \ RS, GIS)\nmonitoring system, sensors, etc., it can sense and collect\nthe moisture\
    \ and soil conditions and temperature of the\ngarden; the real-time dynamics of\
    \ information such as envi-\nronment, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration,\n\
    using the Internet of Things; and a 5G network to build a\nnetwork layer to transmit\
    \ real-time information and then\nbuild a data layer through big data intelligent\
    \ analysis to\ncomprehensively process and analyze data and make corre-\nsponding\
    \ intelligent decisions. Create a “one picture” intel-\nligent platform layer\
    \ for intuitive data display and ﬁnally\nbuild a professional application layer\
    \ to implement the cor-\nresponding intelligent decision-making and set up environ-\n\
    mental perception, energy consumption perception, traﬃc\nmanagement, intelligent\
    \ security, maintenance manage-\nment, intelligent irrigation, and lighting. Manage\
    \ seven\nfunctional modules and corresponding smart park facilities,\nwhich are\
    \ shown in Figure 3.\nBy establishing a water quality, soil moisture, air quality,\n\
    illuminance monitoring, and control management system,\nthe\nsmart\ngarden\nsystem\n\
    conducts\ndata\ncollection,\n6\nJournal of Sensors\ntransmission, storage, and\
    \ analysis of parks and tourists;\nrealizes\nremote\nmonitoring,\nprediction,\n\
    control,\nand\nresponse on the PC or mobile phone, disposal, and other\nintelligent\
    \ management; and fundamentally upgrade and\ntransform the technology, reﬁnement,\
    \ and conservation of\nthe daily management of the park. The establishment of\n\
    the garden intelligent system can provide garden managers\nwith an eﬃcient and\
    \ convenient management platform, save\nmanagement resources, and reduce operation\
    \ and mainte-\nnance costs. The system process is shown in Figure 4.\n3.4.3. Model\
    \ Construction. Collect the data information of\nthe research object, select the\
    \ required information, and ana-\nlyze and use it through integrated processing\
    \ and analysis\nresearch. Through the dynamic detection of advanced\nremote sensing\
    \ technology, various kinds of accurate infor-\nmation of garden green space can\
    \ be obtained regularly, so\nthe dynamic monitoring of gardens increasingly relies\
    \ on\nRS remote sensing technology. GIS (geographic information\nsystem) is an\
    \ interdisciplinary subject closely related to mul-\ntiple disciplines. GIS is\
    \ closely related to earth science, infor-\nmation science, and even space science\
    \ and other disciplines.\nGIS is based on geospatial data and uses the support\
    \ of com-\nputer software and hardware technology to collect, store,\nprocess,\
    \ manage, and analyze the required data in space. It\ntakes building a geographic\
    \ model as an analysis method\nand can eﬃciently and conveniently provide the\
    \ required\nspatially related dynamic geographic information data. The\nsmart\
    \ garden GIS monitoring system can complete the cen-\ntralized display of dynamic\
    \ data such as environmental\nmonitoring, garden animal and plant monitoring,\
    \ and gar-\nden park service facilities, hold important events or emer-\ngency\
    \ command, and dispatch assignments in emergencies.\nGPS satellite positioning,\
    \ RS remote sensing and GIS\ngeographic information system (3S) synergy, combined\
    \ with\nsensors to build a smart garden dynamic data receiving net-\nwork, are\
    \ the eyes of the smart garden system, and it is also\nnecessary to build a smart\
    \ garden system, which is an indis-\npensable part.\nIn addition to using the\
    \ 3S monitoring system, the con-\nstruction of the intelligent sensor system also\
    \ needs to build\na complete sensor network in the park, which is diﬀerent\nfrom\
    \ the 3S method of obtaining information in stages. A\nlarge number of smart sensors\
    \ can cooperate to build a com-\nplete smart sensor network.\nThe intelligent\
    \ sensor system mostly uses solar energy as\nthe working energy to create a fully\
    \ automatic working envi-\nronment. At the same time, it can be divided into integrated\n\
    sensors and water quality sensors according to diﬀerent\napplication environments.\
    \ The functions of smart sensors\nunder the smart management system include collecting\n\
    and recording real-time information of more than a dozen\npark environments such\
    \ as soil temperature and humidity,\nnegative oxygen ions, air temperature and\
    \ humidity,\nPM2.5, ultraviolet intensity, light, carbon dioxide concentra-\n\
    tion, air pressure, and noise. The network layer transmits\ndata to the AI intelligent\
    \ brain, and the real-time monitoring\ndata is analyzed and processed in an appropriate\
    \ manner\nand presented to the corresponding modules of the manage-\nment platform,\
    \ providing convenience for park managers\nand improving management eﬃciency.\n\
    In the intelligent management platform, the construc-\ntion of an intelligent\
    \ integrated management platform is\nequivalent to the brain of the park. Various\
    \ real-time infor-\nmation collected by the GIS monitoring system and intelli-\n\
    gent sensors is transmitted to the AI brain central control\nroom through the\
    \ “5G network and Internet of Things” sys-\ntem. After processing, it is displayed\
    \ on the digital twin visu-\nalization\nplatform,\nthat\nis,\nthe\nOne\nMap\n\
    intelligent\nmanagement platform, where the data is stored and visual-\nized.\
    \ Managers can dynamically monitor various data in\nthe park through the visual\
    \ management platform of the sys-\ntem, so as to carry out remote management of\
    \ intelligent\nfacilities in the park green space. The intelligent manage-\nment\
    \ platform includes seven functional modules: environ-\nmental perception, energy\
    \ consumption perception, traﬃc\nmanagement, intelligent security, maintenance\
    \ manage-\nment, intelligent irrigation, and lighting management. Each\nfunctional\
    \ module has corresponding perception, network,\ndata, platform, and application\
    \ ﬁve levels. For each manage-\nment function, the corresponding automatic decision-\n\
    making and intelligent application can be adjusted, so that\nit can fully realize\

    8\nJournal of Sensors\nBy rationally arranging smart streetlights, the park can\
    \ be\nrealized. The global coverage of the internal network, the\nsmooth information\
    \ transmission, and the real-time moni-\ntoring of various information in the\
    \ park smart streetlights\ncannot only meet the lighting needs of parks but also\
    \ pro-\nvide a comfortable nighttime recreation environment for\nurban residents.\
    \ It can also be superimposed by multipole-\nin-one technical modules, that is,\
    \ the combination of wire-\nless network, surveillance camera, environmental detection\n\
    sensor, wireless broadcasting, mobile phone charging inter-\nface, emergency call\
    \ ( as shown in Figure 5), and other mod-\nules, on the basis of satisfying the\
    \ lighting function, to build\na smart network of parks. At the same time, the\
    \ design of\nsmart street lamps should be combined with the park cul-\nture. Smart\
    \ streetlights can intelligently adjust the light dis-\ntribution intensity by\
    \ automatically sensing the brightness\nof the outside world and using the electronic\
    \ display screen\non the streetlights to release park information. Respond\npromptly\
    \ to situations that occur in the park.\n4.2. Security and Rescue. The smart security\
    \ monitoring and\ncontrol system monitor various areas in the park in real time\n\
    through surveillance cameras arranged on smart streetlights,\nsmart trash cans,\
    \ and other park infrastructure (as shown in\nFigure 6). The security monitoring\
    \ system can also add a\nface recognition module, which can be integrated into\
    \ the\nsecurity system of the smart city through the public security\nnetwork\
    \ to ensure the public safety of urban residents in the\npark. When a dangerous\
    \ situation occurs in the park, the\nintelligent monitoring system will issue\
    \ an alarm to the park\nmanagement personnel in time and broadcast it to the city\n\
    residents in real time through the broadcasting system in\nthe park, so that the\
    \ park management personnel can take\ncorresponding measures in time for the abnormal\
    \ situation\nand ensure the safe operation of the park.\nEmergency rescue system\
    \ includes an emergency rescue\nalarm system and automatic emergency rescue positioning\n\
    system. A positioning system is an interrelated assembly or\ndevice (component)\
    \ formed with the goal of determining a\nspatial location. This system can ensure\
    \ that at least four sat-\nellites can be observed simultaneously at any point\
    \ on the\nEarth at any time, to ensure that the satellites can collect\nthe longitude,\
    \ latitude, and height of the observation point,\nin order to achieve navigation,\
    \ positioning, timing, and\nother functions. This technology can be used to guide\
    \ air-\ncraft, ships, vehicles, and individuals to safely and accurately\nfollow\
    \ selected routes and arrive at their destinations on\ntime. Its basic principle\
    \ is to measure the distance between\na satellite with a known location and the\
    \ user’s receiver\nand then integrate the data from multiple satellites to know\n\
    the speciﬁc location of the receiver. To achieve this goal, the\nposition of the\
    \ satellite can be found in the satellite ephem-\neris based on the time recorded\
    \ by the onboard clock.\nThrough the self-service alarm columns arranged in the\n\
    parks, it is convenient for urban residents to send rescue sig-\nnals to the park\
    \ managers in case of emergencies (as shown\nin Figure 7). After receiving the\
    \ rescue signal from the park\nvisitors, the park management department cannot\
    \ only\ncommunicate with the seeker remotely through the emer-\ngency rescue alarm\
    \ system but also quickly grasp the loca-\ntion of the seeker through the automatic\
    \ emergency rescue\npositioning system and dispatch the park management per-\n\
    sonnel to the scene for disposal in time. The emergency res-\ncue system eﬀectively\
    \ protects the property and personal\nsafety of urban residents, safeguards the\
    \ legitimate personal\ninterests of traveling residents, and facilitates the safety\
    \ and\nsecurity of park managers.\n4.3. Plant Maintenance. The vegetation construction\
    \ of\nurban parks provides an excellent resting environment for\nurban residents,\
    \ is a green link between urban residents\nSurveillance\ncameras\nData and image\n\

    \ and is also an important part\nof urban parks. Plant conservation in urban parks\
    \ is also\none of the important tasks of the park management depart-\nment, which\
    \ requires a lot of human and material resources\nto ensure the green environment\
    \ of the park. Integrating the\napplication of the smart park system in the renovation\
    \ and\nrenewal of urban parks can better play the function of pub-\nlicity, education,\
    \ and popularization of parks and deepen the\ninteractive experience between urban\
    \ residents and parks. At\nthe same time, the smart plant maintenance system can\
    \ bet-\nter assist urban park managers to carry out convenient and\naccurate plant\
    \ maintenance work, saving manpower and\nmaterial resources.\nThe plant maintenance\
    \ work in urban parks is relatively\nheavy. Through the construction of an intelligent\
    \ plant\nmaintenance system, real-time monitoring and automatic\nmanagement of\
    \ vegetation and soil in the park can be real-\nized, which greatly improves the\
    \ work eﬃciency of urban\npark management departments. The intelligent plant main-\n\
    tenance system uses wireless sensors arranged in the soil\n(as shown in Figure\
    \ 8) to monitor the relevant data of soil\nmoisture and nutrients in real time\
    \ and collect and analyze\nthe data to intelligently generate maintenance management\n\
    work requirements. At the same time, the intelligent plant\nmaintenance management\
    \ system is also combined with\nthe intelligent rainwater collection and management\
    \ system\nto automate nozzle and fertilization based on the real-time\nmonitoring\
    \ of soil data. The intelligent plant maintenance\nsystem also monitors the growth\
    \ status of plants in real time\nthrough the disease and insect pest monitoring\
    \ system.\nWhen a plant has a disease focus, it will automatically alarm\nin time\
    \ to remind the management staﬀ to take relevant\nmeasures.\n4.4. Cleaning System.\
    \ Most urban parks use purchased ﬁn-\nished trash cans, and the required number\
    \ of trash cans is\nreasonably calculated according to the park area and service\n\
    radius and arranged in the city park. Park managers need to\nregularly clean the\
    \ trash cans in the park every day to ensure\nthe sanitary environment in the\
    \ park, so they need to invest\na lot of human and material resources. When urban\
    \ parks\nare renovated and updated, the application of smart trash\ncans in the\
    \ park sanitation system can eﬀectively improve\nthe work eﬃciency of park management\
    \ workers and save\nresources. Smart trash cans are new trash cans equipped\n\
    with solar power panels, smart waste sorting systems, smart\ncompression systems,\
    \ and smart monitoring systems (as\nshown in Figure 9). Smart trash cans can automatically\
    \ clas-\nsify and compress all kinds of garbage and remind manage-\nment staﬀ\
    \ to deal with them in time when the capacity\nreaches the warning value. Smart\
    \ trash cans can also be\nequipped with wireless Wi-Fi modules, electronic display\n\

    Journal of Sensors\nresidents around the park. With the rapid development of\n\
    society and the economy, the number of vehicles per capita\nin cities is also\
    \ increasing rapidly, and the public parking lots\nin many urban parks can no\
    \ longer meet the needs of citi-\nzens. At the same time, due to the increase\
    \ in the number\nof vehicles, the workload of the park management depart-\nment\
    \ has also increased, and the travel experience of urban\nresidents has also been\
    \ aﬀected. In the process of renovation\nand renewal of urban parks, it is necessary\
    \ to renew the\nparking lots of existing urban parks according to the current\n\
    conditions such as park area, service radius, and traﬃc con-\nditions around the\
    \ park. At the same time, the introduction\nof a smart parking system can make\
    \ the parking process\nmore eﬃcient. The functions of the smart parking system\n\
    mainly include real-time monitoring of vehicle information,\nvehicle parking guidance,\
    \ data collection and storage analy-\nsis, and command control (as shown in Figure\
    \ 12). The\nsmart parking system implements traﬃc management by\ncollecting real-time\
    \ vehicle information and parking space\ninformation through the cooperation of\
    \ wireless sensing\ntechnology and cloud computing. Through the command\ncontrol\
    \ after data collection and processing, the information\ndisplay in the smart\
    \ parking lot can display the number of\nremaining parking spaces in real time\
    \ and guide the driver\nto ﬁnd the parking location conveniently and eﬃciently\n\
    through the indicator lights in the parking lot, saving park-\ning time. The intelligent\
    \ monitoring and feedback system\nof the smart parking lot also greatly facilitates\
    \ the manage-\nment of the parking lot by the park managers and can better\nserve\
    \ the urban residents.\n5. Conclusion\nThis paper explores the process of urban\
    \ park renovation\nand renewal through the combination of relevant theoretical\n\
    basis for urban park renovation and on-site investigation. At\nthe same time,\
    \ based on the relevant research and investiga-\ntion of the smart park system,\
    \ the application of the smart\npark system in the renovation and renewal of urban\
    \ parks\nwas explored. At present, the relevant research and applica-\ntion of\
    \ smart city are relatively mature. As the construction\nof urban parks cannot\
    \ be ignored in urban construction, it\nis necessary to study and refer to relevant\
    \ applications of\nsmart cities to better integrate them into the application\
    \ of\nparks. The smart park system is a comprehensive system\nthat combines multiple\
    \ disciplines. How to combine science\nand technology more systematically and\
    \ comprehensively to\nestablish a smart link between urban residents and parks\
    \ and\nbetter serve the daily life of residents requires more in-depth\ndiscussion\
    \ and discussion in the future research. This paper\nlacks depth and breadth in\
    \ the discussion and research on\nrelated applications of the smart park system\
    \ and needs to\ncontinue to be explored and researched.\nData Availability\nThe\

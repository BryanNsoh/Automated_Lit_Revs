    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chengdu, China SECTION I. Introduction In
    order to reduce global environmental pollution and promote the upgrading of energy
    structure, renewable clean energy is gradually replacing fossil energy. Both in
    the field of electric vehicles and energy storage power stations, lithium-ion
    batteries have made great progress in the process of commercialization, but their
    safety is still a pain point that limits their application and development [1].
    As shown in figure 1, an energy storage power station safety accident that caused
    casualties in Beijing has attracted much attention. In addition to the inherent
    defects which may be caused by during manufacturing, the environment of lithium-ion
    batteries working conditions are also the fuse of battery accidents as shown in
    figure 2, such as collision, vibration, abuse, etc. Which may cause safety accidents
    inside and outside the battery [2]. Internal faults include overcharge and over-discharge,
    internal and external short circuit, overheating, thermal runaway, aging acceleration,
    etc., and external faults include sensor faults, connection faults, cooling faults,
    etc. In order to prevent the occurrence of the above accidents and evaluate the
    battery status in time, a large number of functions have been developed to manage
    the battery system, as shown in figure 3. Obviously, the normal operation of sensor
    is prerequisite for battery safety [3]. Commonly, the fault diagnosis methods
    of battery system can be divided into four types: model-based [3, 4], knowledge-based
    [5], signal processing-based [6], data driven-based [7]. More contents of the
    above diagnosis methods are presented in figure 4. Jan used support vector machines
    (SVM) to classify the five types of faults which are generated manually after
    extracting the time series characteristics of the data, but the amount of data
    was small, and there was an overfitting problem after the data increased [8].
    Mallak used the LSTM to detect and isolate the faults of the sensors and components
    of the hydraulic system [9]. For battery sensor faults, Xiong developed a model-based
    sensor fault diagnosis scheme to detect and isolate the fault of a current or
    voltage sensor [10]. There are two problems in the current fault diagnosis research
    of battery system: one is that the current research focuses on the failure of
    the battery cells and there is little research on the fault of the acquisition
    sensors; the other is that the sensor fault mode in the research only considers
    the constant bias single fault mode. Based on LSTM RNN, this paper constructs
    a fault diagnosis model for battery voltage sensor. With four LSTM layers and
    three dense layers, the constructed diagnosis model is capable of detecting sensor
    fault and isolate the specific fault mode. The rest of this paper is organized
    as follows: Section II introduces the constructed diagnosis model. Section III
    discusses the final result. Finally, conclusions are given in section IV. Fig.

    II. Diagnosis Model A. Battery data description In order to simulate the actual
    complex operating conditions as much as possible, the dynamic test which was conducted
    by CALCE battery group is used, corresponding battery sample is INR 18650-20R
    battery [11]. This test consists of DST, FUDS, US06 and BJDST as corresponding
    current profiles shown in figure 6. All tests were performed for 80% battery level
    and 50% battery level at 0°C, 25°C and 45°C. For the research purpose, every data
    sample consists of a window with (voltage, current) sequence length of 1000, which
    is captured under discharge conditions. The fault trigger point will be randomly
    selected within a range from 0 to 500 in the sequence window. The fault trigger
    points are considered as the fault start point to generate drift, freeze, lose
    accuracy faults of the voltage sensor, respectively. The setting parameters of
    voltage sensor faults are presented in table I and table voltage fault example
    is shown in figure 5. After normalizing, 3000 segment data with 9:1 ratio of training
    set and testing set were obtained. Each sample corresponds to one of four labels
    in the form of one-hot code as shown in table I. Fig. 5. Voltage profiles with
    different sensor faults Show All Table I Faults Description Fig. 6. Four battery
    test loading profiles Show All B. LSTM model LSTM RNN is one type of recurrent
    neural network [12]. Because of powerful ability in processing time-series data
    and overcoming gradient explosion or disappearing problem of RNN, LSTM RNN is
    widely used for diagnosis, machine translation, language recognition. The LSTM
    RNN mainly consists of input gate, output gate, forget gate. As shown in figure
    7, the structure of LSTM RNN cell is presented. The basic forward algorithm is
    listed as equations (1-6): f t =σ( W f ⋅[ h t−1 , x t ]+ b f ) (1) View Source
    i t =σ( W i ⋅[ h t−1 , x t ]+ b i ) (2) View Source C ~ t =tanh( W C ⋅[ h t−1
    , x t ]+ b C ) (3) View Source C t = f t ∗ C t−1 + i t ∗ C ~ t (4) View Source
    o t =σ( W o ⋅[ h t−1 , x t ]+ b o ) (5) View Source h t = o t ∗tanh( C t ) (6)
    View Source where ft donotes the variable after passing forget gate, it denotes
    the variable after passing input gate, ot denotes the variable after passing output
    gate, Ct denotes long-term cell state, ht denotes short-term cell state, W f ,  W
    i ,  W C ,  W o ,  b f ,  b i ,  b C ,  b o are trainable parameters. The diagnosis
    model in this paper consists of four LSTM RNN layers, three dense layers and one
    softmax layer in order as shown in Figure 8, the corresponding output shape of
    all layers and the number of trainable parameters is presented in table II. Notably,
    only the fourth LSTM layer adopted “many to one” structure. Besides, the training
    epoch is 300, the batch size is 100, the training method adopted Adam gradient
    descent algorithm with default setting [13], the cross-entropy is used as loss
    function. The GPU specification of computer is NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M, and tensorflow
    2.1 is adopted as Deeping learning framework. Fig. 7. LSTM RNN cell Show All Fig.

    III Accuracy Distribution of Dataset SECTION III. Result and Discussion The accuracy
    verse epoch chart and loss verse epoch chart are presented in figure 7 and figure
    8, respectively. It can be seen that the accuracy and loss converged to expected
    value with epoch increases, even though accuracy slides down after epoch reaches
    145. Around 200 epoch, accuracy arises rapidly. Finally, the training process
    costs 36.21 min, and the training set accuracy is 0.9867, test set accuracy is
    0.9867. For the four types of samples in dataset, the accuracy is presented in
    table III. SECTION IV. Conclusion This paper mainly used the LSTM recurrent neural
    networks to establish the voltage sensor fault diagnosis model. After adding the
    sensor fault signal to the dynamic working condition test conducted by CALCE battery
    group, the corresponding fault type of each data sample can be classified with
    at least 98% accuracy both in training set and testing set, which proves that
    the LSTM neural network-based diagnosis structure has the ability to identify
    the sensor faults. Our next work will foces on simplifying the diagnosis model
    and exploring more reasonable deep learning models for diagnosing sensor faults.
    Besides, the randomness of sensor faults would be considered in the future. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Intelligent diagnostic systems help avoid excessive outages and costly
    component replacement by taking corrective action before problems have time to
    become failures. System checks start with sensor validation and then progress
    to performance and condition status. Check control and data collection sensor
    signals against norms to pre-test sensor reliability and signal validity of measured
    parameters. Modules are available for sensor validation and recovery, performance
    degradation detection and fault diagnosis, startup and combustion system fault
    detection, and vibration fault detection and diagnosis. Fault detection module
    is designed to provide insight both into start-up equipment shortcomings and related
    functions that can cause start-up malfunction.

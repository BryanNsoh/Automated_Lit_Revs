    automatic irrigation according to desired drought scenarios, and a remote, wireless
    connection to monitor each plant and device performance via a data platform. During
    testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive enough to detect and measure plant transpiration,
    from early to ultimate plant developmental stages. Even though the results were
    generated on common beans, the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops.

    215 Accesses 1 Altmetric Metrics Abstract Climate instability directly affects
    agro-environments. Water scarcity, high air temperature, and changes in soil biota
    are some factors caused by environmental changes. Verified and precise phenotypic
    traits are required for assessing the impact of various stress factors on crop
    performance while keeping phenotyping costs at a reasonable level. Experiments
    which use a lysimeter method to measure transpiration efficiency are often expensive
    and require complex infrastructures. This study presents the development and testing
    process of an automated, reliable, small, and low-cost prototype system using
    IoT with high-frequency potential in near-real time. Because of its waterproofness,
    our device—LysipheN—assesses each plant individually and can be deployed for experiments
    in different environmental conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN
    integrates multiple sensors, automatic irrigation according to desired drought
    scenarios, and a remote, wireless connection to monitor each plant and device
    performance via a data platform. During testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive
    enough to detect and measure plant transpiration, from early to ultimate plant
    developmental stages. Even though the results were generated on common beans,
    the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops. This tool serves to screen
    transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related physiological
    traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design, LysipheN will
    be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and breeding context.
    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board
    temperature, the inside stem temperature (inserted thermocouple), and soil temperature
    together with air RH and calculated VPD. GU1 to GU5 studied younger (PCS) plants
    (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 studied plants close to the final harvest
    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for
    connecting sensors and dripping irrigation tubes. 5. Peristaltic pump for irrigation
    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t

    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information

    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate

    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.

    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

    vital cereals crops after wheat and rice grown in wide range of climates including
    tropical, subtropical and temperate regions of the world. Likewise other cereals
    crops maize crop also faces many biotic and abiotic constraints during life cycle.
    These include insect pest infestation, diseases, drought and nutrients deficiency
    [1]. Among these factors drought stress has considerable effect on crop growth
    and development [2]. Water is an important integral part of the plants, plays
    important role in maintaining growth, turgidity and acts as a reagent in plant
    cells. Water stress is the most prominent abiotic stress that has a significant
    effect on crop productivity in agriculture lands around the globe. Increasing
    population and changing climate are likely to increase water scarcity by declining
    water sources, which will leads to decline in crop productivity in the world [3].
    The researchers makes it very clear that reducing irrigation causes large losses
    in yield in maize. However, in some circumstances, this form of water deficit
    may allow for water savings through reduced irrigation water use at little yield
    cost [4]. Since these cropping and irrigation conditions are comparable to those
    that local farmers face, it is crucial to understand how the crops will react
    to a moderate water shortfall. As a result of osmotic stress, plant cells produce
    more solution metabolites to avoid a water shortage and a drop in turgor pressure.
    The metabolites, which include nitrogen components like proline and other amino
    acids, polyamines, and ammonium, build as a result of osmotic adjustment [5].
    Organic solutions accumulate up in the cytosol and are crucial for osmotic regulation
    and cell retention, while a moisture deficit increases [6]. Physiological and
    biochemical alternation coordinated at the cellular and molecular levels results
    in drought resistance. Osmotic adjustment and more rigid cell walls could be part
    of these changes. Plant growth and productivity are negatively impacted by abiotic
    stress, which induces a range of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and
    molecular changes [7]. Drought tolerance mechanisms can be classified into three
    broad categories such as drought escape, drought avoidance, and biochemical tolerance
    of the tissues to water deficit [8]. Plants ability to withstand drought was demonstrated
    by the Cell Membrane Stability (CMS) experiment, which measures the integrity
    of cell membranes [9]. Maize has been shown to be extremely susceptible to drought
    [10]. The leaf area index were determined by [11] to be decreased by the degree
    of water stress. Likewise, deficit irrigation planning for maize is challenging
    without lowering production [12]. Deficit irrigation is a scheduling approach
    in which irrigation is purposely carried out so that the crop’s water requirements
    are not entirely met, and plants are allowed to take soil moisture above the water
    that is easily accessible in the plant roots [13]. Inoculating plants with plant
    growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) has been proven to protect them from a variety
    of abiotic stresses [14,15,16]. Previous research in the literature have demonstrated
    that Burkholderia spp., Bacillus spp., Pseudumonas spp., Azospirillum spp., and
    Rhizobium spp. reduce the severity of drought in wheat, barley, maize, and beans
    [17,18,19]. However, the PGPB’s mode of action can be direct or indirect, and
    it can encourage plant growth in both stressful and non-stressful situations [20,
    21]. The current experimental trial was planned to evaluate the impact of Bacillus
    spp. and deficit irrigation during early growth stage (vegetative) of maize crop.
    Materials and methods The experiment was performed in glass house located at research
    site of Isparta University of Applied Sciences Isparta, Turkey in 2022. Experimental
    trial was conducted in Completely Randomized Design having 3 replications and
    a total of 24 pots were used (Fig. 1). Factorial experiment of 2 factors (Irrigation
    and Bacillus) were performed. Irrigation levels were (no stress: 100% (I1) and
    deficit irrigation: 75 (I2), 50 (I3), 25 (I4) % of required water amount to reach
    pot capacity). The product of Biotrinsic FP-30 (Bacillus spp. based strain) was
    obtained from Indigo Turkey. Based on company recommendations (36 mg (milligram)
    per 100 mg of seed) were applied. In this experiment the variety KWS Kerubino
    hybrid (Zea mays L., indentata) was used which is classified as strong grain variety
    in the FAO 570 mortality group and has a broad-leaved, thick and robust stem,
    and a body structure that is resistant to lodging. It is highly adaptable to different
    climatic and environmental conditions. The seed were inoculated with Bacillus
    strain prior to seeding in the pot. Total of 250 gram of seeds were inoculated
    with 0.072 mg of Bacillus. After inoculation, the seeds were mixed thoroughly
    for while followed by sowing. Fig. 1 Overview of the experiment Full size image
    Required amount of fertilizers (Nitrogen-Phosphorus) was calculated from MAP (Mono
    ammonium phosphate) and AS (Ammonium sulphate). During sowing, phosphorus was
    applied at a rate of 100 kg ha− 1 and nitrogen at a rate of 200 kg ha− 1 (50%
    at sowing and 50% at 30–40 cm height stage). Each pot of 7 kg soil was applied
    with 0.45 gram of MAP for phosphorus. The applied amount of nitrogen was calculated
    (1.3 gram N from MAP) the rest of nitrogen was calculated from AS. Each pot was
    supplied with 5.33 gram of AS as nitrogen base fertilizers @ 100 kg ha− 1. The
    rest of half dose nitrogen was applied at 30–40 cm height stage of crop (40 days
    after sowing). The examined soil properties are presented in Table 1. Table 1
    Soil physiochemical properties Full size table All pots of the experiment were
    weighted for their initial weight and were filled with equal amount of soil. The
    volume of the pot was calculated as 742 cm− 3 (surface area as 0.28 m− 2). After
    seeding all the pots were irrigated with same amount of water and the field capacity
    of the pot were measured (approx. 24 h after irrigation). Afterward the remaining
    irrigations were performed based on water usage (evapotranspiration). All the
    pots of experimental trial were followed on daily basis for their weight and moisture
    loss and irrigation were performed according with the base amount of water (field
    capacity-2230 ml) by keeping the levels of irrigation under the consideration.
    Based on basal application of water the amount was decreased accordingly for all
    the treatments. Afterward, the irrigation was performed based on 30% moisture
    loss from the no stress treatments (I1) by weighing the pots. Using [22] equation
    for the soil water balance, evapotranspiration (ET) from each pot was calculated
    (Eq. 1). (1) Where ET stands for evapotranspiration, I for irrigation water depth,
    P for precipitation, Cp for capillary rise, Dp for deep percolation, Rf for runoff
    loss, and S for change in soil water content. Hence, there was no precipitation,
    capillary rise, deep percolation and runoff loss as the study was carried out
    in glasshouse. Downward flux below the crop root zone that was neglected because
    the lower side of every pot was covered with plastic bag in order to avoid drainage
    loss. The amount of evapotranspiration was equal to the irrigation was applied.
    Therefore, Eq. 1 was simplified to Eq. 2: (2) Equation 3 were used to compute
    the water usage efficiency (WUE) in the treatments [23, 24] (3) Where, WUE is
    water use efficiency, FBa is actual fresh biomass obtained and ET is evapotranspiration.
    To determine the relationship between a relative decrease in evapotranspiration
    and a relative decrease in yield Eq. 4 was employed [25]. (4) Where, Ky is the
    yield response factor, ETa and ETm are the actual and maximum evapotranspiration
    (mm), and FBa and FBm are the actual and maximum fresh biomass, respectively.
    After 60 days the crop was harvested, fresh and dry biomass, plant height (cm),
    stem diameter (mm), leaf area (cm− 2) root length (cm), root fresh and dry weight,
    were measured. Scale was used to measure plant height and root length, digital
    calliper to measure stem diameter, and digital weight balance to measure plant
    weight. Equation 5 was used to calculate relative water content [26]. (5) Where,
    RWC stands for relative water content. DW stands for Dry weight, FW for Fresh
    weight, and TW for Turgid weight. The experiment was laid out for 2 months between
    31st June-31st August. Pots were placed at the center of glass house and were
    tagged with proper label of corresponding treatment (Fig. 1). After 60 days of
    the experiment, above soil biomass (plant part) was harvested and kept in the
    plastics bags to avoid evaporation loss for further analysis. Root of the plant
    was removed with proper care from the pots by applying water in order to ease
    the extraction and to avoid damage. Afterward the roots were analyzed for their
    length fresh and dry weight. The collected data were statistically examined using
    the analysis of variance method in accordance with a completely random design
    by using Statistix software (version 8.1). When the F-test was significant, the
    least significant differences (LSD) test was used to link data means [27]. Results
    Water use efficiency Water use efficiency (WUE) which is a measure of crop output
    per unit of applied water. The interactive values of both irrigation levels and
    bacteria were presented in Table 2 while the mean values of the individual treatments
    were presented in Table 4. The level of irrigation water that produced the maximum
    biomass (193 g pot− 1) and water use efficiencies (0.72 g pot− 1 mm− 1) was observed
    with application of I1 with bacteria. Keeping in consideration the least decline
    in biomass and WUE by the interactive effect of irrigation level I2 inoculated
    with bacteria (0.61 g pot− 1 mm− 1 WUE) when compared with 100% water level without
    bacteria there was no difference in water use efficiency and plant fresh biomass.
    Analysis of variance shows significant effect of irrigation levels and bacteria
    on water use efficiency of maize crop. Plants supplied with 100% irrigation water
    resulted in the highest WUE (0.67 g pot− 1 mm− 1) followed by I2 water application
    with WUE (0.56 g pot− 1 mm− 1) while the lowest WUE (0.08 g pot− 1 mm− 1) was
    recorded in pots applied with 25% water (Table 4). According to the results obtained
    from this study, the interactive effect of the both factors was not significant
    at different irrigation levels and Bacillus has influenced biomass of plant and
    WUE. Table 2 Interactive values of evapotranspiration, fresh biomass and water
    use efficiency (WUE), leaf area, plant dry biomass and relative water content
    Full size table Irrigation (evapotranspiration) relationships between fresh biomass
    Evapotranspiration and plant biomass yield have a linear relationship at 1% significant
    level (R2 = 0.963) as seen in Fig. 2. According to the findings of the study,
    the yield response factor (ky) was 1.43. This result illustrates that the maize
    fresh biomass (vegetative growth) was sensitive to water deficit. Fig. 2 Relationships
    between evapotranspiration (irrigation water used), and crop biomass (a) and the
    relationships between the relative evapotranspiration deficit and the relative
    yield decline for maize (b) Full size image Plant fresh biomass (g) Response of
    plant fresh biomass to various irrigation levels and biofertilizers is presented
    in Table 3. The effect of both irrigation and bacteria inoculation was found significant
    while the interactive effect of treatments was no significant. Plants applied
    with 100% of water (I1) produced more biomass (180.42 g) compared with I2 and
    I3 water application having fresh matter of (113 g) and (39.17 g) respectively.
    The growth and biomass of the plants were suppressed in case of 25% water application
    resulted in stunted growth and low biomass (5.63 g) production. Seeds inoculated
    with bacterial strain produced more vigorous biomass (91.65 g) compared with seeds
    without any treatment of bacteria (77.31 g). Table 3 Growth attributes of maize
    as affected by irrigations levels and Bacillus spp Full size table Plant dry biomass
    (g) The effect of water application and Bacillus was found significant on plant
    dry biomass of maize plant (Table 3). Likewise, the interactive effect of biofertilizers
    and water application was also found significant. Application of 100% water showed
    more plant dry biomass (73.58 g) followed by 75% of water having dry matter of
    (47.58 g). Lowest plant dry biomass was observed in pots applied with 25% of water
    (2.20 g). Application of I1 water along with bacteria treatment resulted in pronounced
    effect with drier biomass followed by I2 water application and I3 water application.
    There were no significant differences among the means of bacterial and nonbacterial
    treatment (Table 3). Plant height (cm) The amount of irrigation had a substantial
    impact on maize plant height (P ≥ 0.05) as shown in Table 3. However, there was
    no significant effect of biofertilizers on the plant height. The interactive effect
    of the both factors was also non-significant. By mean comparison taller plants
    (125 cm) was recorded under well-watered condition (I1) followed by I2, I3 and
    I4 irrigation treatments which was (104 cm), (82) and (44 cm) respectively. Stem
    diameter (mm) The effect of both factors irrigation and biofertilizers was found
    significant for the stem diameter of plant. Plants treated with 75% (I2) water
    of field capacity resulted in maximum stem diameter (20.85 mm) followed by I1
    irrigation (18.02 mm). Plants subjected to stress conditions (I4) was observed
    with thinner and weak stem diameter (7.86 mm). Among biofertilizers treatments,
    pots treated with bacteria (B+) strains shows maximum stem diameter (15.67 mm)
    in comparison with control (B-) having stem diameter of (14.64 mm). The comparative
    effect of irrigation and biofertilizers was non-significant (Table 3). Leaf area
    (cm− 2) Leaf area of maize was significantly affected by both irrigation and biofertilizers.
    The interactive effect of the treatments was also recorded significant (Table
    3). Plants treated with I1 treatment were observed with maximum leaf area (350.72
    cm− 2) compared with deficit amount of water I2, I3 and I4 treatments with leaf
    area (258.84 cm− 2), (131.94 cm− 2) and (51.31 cm− 2), respectively. Seeds inoculated
    with bacterial strain also affected leaf area of maize plant. Inoculated seeds
    with bacteria were observed with expanded and maximum leaf area (214.20 cm− 2)
    compared with non-inoculated pots with leaf area (182.20 cm− 2). Among the interactions,
    pots inoculated with bacteria and supplied with 100% water were observed to have
    more leaf area (386.00 cm− 2) in comparison to the rest of treatments (Fig. 4).
    Root length (cm) Both irrigation levels and biofertilizers has significant affected
    root length of maize plant. The interactive effect of irrigation and biofertilizers
    was found non significant (Table 3). Among irrigation levels plants treated with
    I1 water resulted in maximum root length (92.83 cm) followed by I2 treatment with
    root length of (78.75 cm) which was statistically not at far with I3 level of
    water application (74.83 cm). Plants supplied with limited water (I4) resulted
    in shorter root length (56.41 cm). Among biofertilizers, Bacillus inoculated plants
    were observed with maximum vigorous roots (79.20 cm) compared with control (72.20
    cm) treatment (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 Root length of maize crop as affected by irrigation
    levels and bacteria Full size image Root fresh weight (g) The effect of irrigation
    and biofertilizers on fresh root of weight presented in Table 3. Significant effect
    of both factors irrigation and biofertilizers was observed on fresh weight of
    root. The interactive effect of treatments was non significant. Pots applied with
    required amount of water (I1) were noted with more fresh matter (91.50 g) followed
    by I2 water application (69.83 g). Pots with least amount of water supply (I4)
    resulted in minimum fresh matter (6.29 g) production. Among biofertilizers treatments,
    pots with inoculated strain of bacteria produced maximum root fresh weight (53.52
    g) compared with control without bacteria application (46.10 g). Root dry weight
    (g) The effect of irrigation and bacteria inoculation was found significant on
    the dry weight of roots Table 3. Interactive effect of both factors was found
    no significant. Application of water in demand of plant (I1/field capacity) resulted
    in more dry weight of roots (28.66 g) compared with I2 treatment with root dry
    weight of (21.25 g g). Pots subjected to stress conditions (I4) were observed
    with lowest root dry weight (3.00 g). Likewise, bacteria treated seed produced
    maximum root dry biomass (16.70) compared with non-treated seed/pots (14.08).
    Relative water content (%) Leaf relative water content as affected by irrigation
    levels and Bacillus inoculation is presented in Table 4. Irrigation and bacteria
    has significantly affected leaf relative water content. Integrative effect of
    both treatments was also significant. Plants applied with 50% (I3) water resulted
    in highest RWC (81.95%) followed by I2 water application. Lowest Leaf RWC was
    recorded in leaf of plants applied with 25% irrigation. Among bacterial treatments
    non inoculated plants had more RWC (74.20%) value compared with inoculated plants
    (68.88%). When the interactive values of both the treatments was compared highest
    RWC (84.81%) was recorded in plants inoculated with Bacillus spp. and I3 treatment
    which was statistically at far with those of non inoculated treatment and I3 level
    of irrigation (Fig. 4). Table 4 Relative water content (%) and water use efficiency

    Plant characteristics including height, leaf area, stem diameter, and fresh and
    dry weight as affected by irrigation levels and Bacillus specie are presented
    in Table 3. Among the irrigations, levels the growth parameters were significantly
    increased with the amount of irrigation water. In the case of 100% water application
    highest growth in plant height stem diameter leaf area were observed followed
    by 75% irrigation and so on. Shortest plant height was recorded in pots applied
    with 25% water. This was probably of more water availability to the crop as water
    is an important component of plant cell and play vital role in cell division,
    enlargement and turgidity of the cell. These findings are in line with those of
    [28] who stated that highest moisture is important for cell division and growth.
    Stem diameter values increased parallel to increasing irrigation water [29]. The
    effect of bacterial inoculated seeds were found only for the leaf area and plant
    fresh weight of maize crop. Bacillus spp. treated pots resulted in more expanded
    leaf area compared with control (without bacteria). This could be due to due to
    more roots formation as a result plant extracted more water led to more leaf area
    and foliage production. Number of leaves on maize increased by roughly 12.4% and
    8.3%, respectively, when plant growth-promoting bacteria were used as compared
    to the control [30]. Similar studies have been carried out and researchers determined
    that the growth hormones released by the bacteria were responsible for the increased
    cell length, cell growth, and cell division that resulted in an increase in the
    number of leaves. The interactive effect of the treatments were found no significant
    for all growth aspects except leaf area and plant dry biomass. Inoculated seeds
    with 100% water application resulted in highest leaf area followed by non inoculated
    seeds. Lowest leaf area was noted in non-inoculated plots supplied with 25% of
    water. The differences in the plant growth during vegetative growth may be related
    to the photosynthetic processes that are closely associated with leaf and whole
    biomass growth [31, 32]. Variability in roots characteristics of maize was measured
    as root length, root fresh and dry weight. Plant treated with 100% of irrigation
    was observed with highest root characteristics followed by 75% water application.
    Lowest root aspects was noted in plants treated with 25% water. The increase in
    root formation with water application possibly due to moist rhizosphere in pots
    as a result the plants had showed its potential of lengthening their roots. These
    outcomes are consistent with those reported by [33], who observed significant
    variation in roots of maize with deficit irrigation levels. Drought stress has
    a significant impact on root development, root properties, and behaviour [34].
    In addition, plants treated with Bacillus spp. (inoculated plants) had the longest
    roots and the heaviest roots in both fresh and dry weight when compared with control
    plants. Numerous studies have examined PGBs, notably Bacillus spp., which exhibit
    a variety of features that enable them to mobilize soil nutrients and synthesise
    phytohormones that promote plant growth [35,36,37]. Inoculated maize seeds with
    the PGPR Azospirillum lipoferum produced more root tips, more root branching,
    and longer cumulative roots [38]. By increasing the production of proline, amino
    acids, and soluble sugars, Bacillus spp. Inoculation mitigate the effects of drought,
    increase plant development, and improve soil water and nutrient uptake [39]. Water
    use efficiency as a tendency of water holding was significantly affected by irrigations
    levels. WUE increased as the level of irrigation increased which means, a lower
    level of biomass was produced per mm of water used by the plants compared with
    required amount of irrigations. Highest WUE was recorded in pots applied with
    100% of irrigation. Water use efficiency was decreased by decreasing the level
    of water from 100 to 75%, 50% and 25%, respectively. Increase in WUE with increase
    in amount of irrigations could be due to more availability of water to the crop
    as a result plant has produced more biomass per unit of water applied. These results
    are consistent with those of [40], who reported significant increase in WUE with
    irrigation levels from low to high. The increase in WUE is a consequence of an
    overall decrease in plant transpiration caused on by a decrease in green leaf
    area as a result of the water shortage, which has probably reduced soil surface
    evaporation [41]. The combined variance analysis revealed that bacteria and irrigation
    practises both significantly impacted relative water content (RWC). Interactive
    effect of both treatments was also significant. Relative water content was decreased
    by increasing stress on plants. Highest RWC value was recorded in leaves of plants
    supplied with 50% irrigation followed by 75% and 100%. Plants exposed to stress
    conditions has shrinked and non turgor leaves when allow for water intake can
    restore their turgor therefore plants subjected to stress had highest relative
    water content. The findings of the current study accord with those of [42]. Among
    bacterial treatments, highest RWC value was recorded in leaves of plants having
    no inoculation in compared with inoculated plant leaves. In interactive effect
    of both treatments, highest RWC value was observed in inoculated plants applied
    with 50% irrigation which was statistical at par with non-inoculated treatment.
    During times of drought stress PGPB delay losses in leaf water potential, and
    speed up returns to control levels once water-limiting conditions are lifted [43].
    Conclusion It can be endorsed from the outcome that, under sufficient water conditions
    maize crop should be irrigated with the required amount of irrigation for obtaining
    maximum production. In case of limited conditions, water application can be minimized
    to moderate level up to 75% percent by alternate approach. In our study Bacillus
    spp. showed its pronounced effect in improving growth characters of maize crop.
    Bacillus spp. inoculation increased plant biomass, root biomass, and water use
    efficiency of maize plant during early growth stage of maize despite of water
    stress and can be used under limited water condition for crop combating during
    moderate to lower stress conditions. In addition to this, the yield response factor
    (ky) value in this study was determined as 1.43 (≥ 1) which demonstrates that,
    maize very sensitive to a lack of water in the soil during vegetative period.

  description: Climate-resilient crop production requires the use of crop technology
    that can sustainably increase productivity, build resilience to climate change,
    and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Despite countrywide initiatives that promote
    climate-smart agricultural technology (CSAT) adoption, the rate of adoption has
    been extremely low. Therefore, this study aims to identify factors that affect
    the adoption of CSATs in wheat production in the Arsi zone of the Oromia region
    of Ethiopia. Towards this, plot-level primary data were gathered from 628 plots
    that were managed by 422 randomly selected wheat-producing smallholder farmers
    in three selected districts of the Zone. Descriptive statistics and multivariate
    probit (MVP) model were used to analyze data. The major CSATs adopted for wheat
    production in the study area were improved wheat varieties (95%), integrated soil
    fertility management (85%), and irrigation (19%). The result of the MVP model
    revealed that farmers with higher levels of education, farming experience, and
    contact with extension workers, have credit access, have access to market information,
    have greater annual total income, and are closer to the nearest market center
    are more likely to adopt CSATs in wheat production. Therefore, it is recommended
    that to enhance the adoption of CSATs in wheat production, policymakers and other
    development partners should concentrate on the identified factors that were significantly associated
    with the decisions to adopt CSATs.

    that were managed by 422 randomly selected wheat-producing smallholder farmers
    in three selected districts of the Zone. Descriptive statistics and multivariate
    probit (MVP) model were used to analyze data. The major CSATs adopted for wheat
    production in the study area were improved wheat varieties (95%), integrated soil
    fertility management (85%), and irrigation (19%). The result of the MVP model
    revealed that farmers with higher levels of education, farming experience, and
    contact with extension workers, have credit access, have access to market information,
    have greater annual total income, and are closer to the nearest market center
    are more likely to adopt CSATs in wheat production. Therefore, it is recommended
    that to enhance the adoption of CSATs in wheat production, policymakers and other
    development partners should concentrate on the identified factors that were significantly
    associated with the decisions to adopt CSATs. Similar content being viewed by

    and agriculture Article 07 June 2021 1 Introduction Climate-smart agriculture
    (CSA) is a comprehensive management strategy for crops, livestock, forests, and
    fisheries that tackles the interconnected issues of food security and climate
    change [1]. It aims to increase productivity sustainably, adapt to climate change
    and build resilience to it, and reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions [2].
    Although agriculture is one of the most important economic sectors in Africa that
    employs about 70% of the population and accounts for about 14% of the Gross domestic
    product (GDP) in Sub-Saharan Africa [3], it is a highly vulnerable sector to the
    impact of climate change [4]. Similarly, in Ethiopia, agriculture contributes
    37.64% to the GDP, a source of employment for about 67% of the population, and
    more than 79% of foreign exchange earnings [5]. However, its performance has remained
    unsatisfactory in feeding its ever-growing population [6], which has risen to
    a projected figure of more than 126 million in the year 2023, which is a 2.55%
    increase from the year 2022 [7]. Therefore, this rapidly growing population needs
    greater economic performance than before to at least guarantee food security.
    Moreover, the contribution of the agricultural sector to Ethiopian GDP has been
    declining over time due to its dependence on rain-fed and traditional farming
    systems, low or no adoption of improved agricultural technologies, vulnerability
    to climate change stresses, and farmers’ intrinsic inefficiency in utilizing the
    available agricultural resources [6, 8,9,10,11,12]. Furthermore, the country has
    only an area of about 1.1 million square kilometers. Thus, given this scarce area
    of land along with the rapidly growing population, intensification, which requires
    investments in CSATs is a better choice that is used to increase agricultural
    productivity, resilience, and income [12,13,14]. Climate-smart improved wheat
    variety refers to the type of varieties that are resistant to disease, can withstand
    drought, and/or yield more [2, 15,16,17,18]. Irrigation technology encompasses
    effective water harvesting and management, whether through large-scale systems
    like canals and pumps or smaller-scale micro-irrigation strategies like pond construction,
    water wall construction, and utilizing all available water for wheat production
    [2, 4, 16, 17, 19, 20]. It also includes any technology that moves water from
    its sources to previously unreachable areas [21]. Similarly, integrated soil fertility
    management includes the careful application of chemical fertilizers together with
    integrated sustainable practices like crop rotation, intercropping, and the integrated
    use of organic fertilizers like farmyard manure, compost, and careful application
    of chemical fertilizers [2, 4, 17, 19, 22,23,24,25]. Hence, since the adoption
    of improved wheat varieties, irrigation, and integrated soil fertility management
    raise resilience, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and increase agricultural productivity,
    they are climate-smart agricultural technologies [2, 4, 15,16,17,18,19]. As the
    principal food crop in terms of area covered and production volume, cereals make
    up over 88% of Ethiopia’s grain crop production [26]. However, given the unsatisfactory
    performance of cereal production in feeding its ever-growing population and the
    rise in vulnerability to climate change on the other sides, increasing cereal
    production and productivity is a matter of existence [10, 27]. Thus, it is crucial
    to create and spread CSATs that can increase household resilience to food insecurity
    in the face of climate change [28,29,30]. Ethiopia is the leading producer of
    wheat in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) followed by South Africa, Sudan, and Kenya [31].
    Among cereal crops, in Ethiopia, wheat ranks third in terms of total production
    next to maize and teff with 1.86 million ha of land and productivity of 31.11
    qt/ha [26]. Similarly, in the Oromia region, wheat production took the third rank
    1.95 million numbers of holders, 1.03 million hectares of land, and productivity
    of 33.64 qt/ha [26]. In the study area, Arsi zone, wheat production had the second
    rank in terms of production next to maize with 393,316 numbers of holders, 256,172.2
    hectares of land, and productivity of 35.30 qt/ha [ibid]. Thus, wheat plays a
    major role in the socioeconomic growth of smallholder farmers in the research
    area and remains a strategic crop to meet the growing demand for food [10]. However,
    although the study area’s average productivity (33.1 qt/ha) is higher than the
    national (29.8 qt/ ha) and regional averages (31.9 qt/ ha), compared to 51.6 qt/ha
    of the world average [26, 31], wheat productivity is still very low. Governments
    and other development programs aimed at boosting agricultural productivity and
    enhancing resilience to climate change recommend the adoption of climate-smart
    agricultural technologies [32]. Moreover, the government of Ethiopia through its
    recent policies has been advocating for increasing adoption of CSATs to improve
    resilience to climate change and food security of smallholder farmers. In Ethiopia,
    [8, 33] and [34,35,36,37,38,39,40] conducted their studies on the determinants
    of adoption of improved technologies in wheat production. However, they considered
    only one technology, that is improved wheat seed varieties, and ignored the reality
    that farmers may adopt multiple technologies as complements, and/or substitutes.
    Besides, although studies by [41, 42] and [30] examine the determinants of the
    adoption of agricultural technologies in different parts of the country, the selected
    technology package is not climate-smart and looked at other crops (maize, rice,
    groundnut, and teff), and overlooked wheat crop. Furthermore, studies by [11,
    12, 14, 42,43,44], and [21, 45, 46] captured determinants of the adoption of climate-smart
    agricultural technologies as an index which is suffering from aggregation problem
    as well as the possibility that different technologies might be affected by different
    factors. Likewise, they didn’t conduct their studies at plot level and hence,
    ignore the reality that wheat farmers may adopt certain technologies on some of
    their plots but not on others. Hence, given the widespread food insecurity situations
    in the nation overall and the study area specifically, which are primarily caused
    by changing climatic conditions manifested by erratic rainfall, floods, and disease
    outbreaks, more research is required to better understand the causes of low adoption
    rates. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet identified factors that
    triggered the adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies by wheat farmers
    in Ethiopia in general and in the study area in particular. Likewise, climate-resilient
    crop varieties, integrated soil fertility management, and irrigation are climate-smart
    agricultural technologies [1, 2, 18, 21, 23]. Hence, this study is carried out
    to identify factors that affect the adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies
    (i.e. improved wheat varieties, integrated soil fertility management, and irrigation)
    in wheat production in the Arsi zone, Oromia region of Ethiopia. 2 Research methodology
    2.1 Description of the study area Arsi zone is situated within a total area of
    21,008 km2 in the Oromia National Regional State of Ethiopia. It borders the Bale
    zone to the south, the West Arsi zone to the southwest, the East Shewa zone to
    the northwest, the Afar Region to the north, and the West Hararghe zone to the
    east. Assela town, the zone’s capital, is situated 75 km south of Adama town and
    175 km from Addis Ababa. The Zone has four agro-climatic zones namely; lowland,
    midland, highland, and cool that account for about 20.12%, 50.72%, 27.32%, and
    1.84%, respectively. It is also distinguished by four seasons namely; summer,
    autumn, winter, and spring. The altitude of the zone ranges from 805 to 4195 m
    above sea level. The Zone’s average annual temperature ranges from 10° to 25 °C
    with an average annual rainfall of 1020 mm [47]. A relatively short rainy season
    (Belg), which lasts from February to March, and a lengthy rainy season (Meher),
    which lasts from June to September, characterize the rainfall pattern. There are
    2,637,657 people living in the Zone, of whom 1,323,424 are men and 1,314,233 of
    them are women. It has a population density of 133.05. In the Zone, there are
    a total of 541,959 households, with an average of 4.87 persons per household [48].
    Among the total districts of the zone, Hetosa, Digalu-tijo, Tiyo, Lode Hetosa,
    Limuna Bilbilo, Munesa, and Dodota districts have a greater potential in the production
    of wheat out of 24 districts of the Zone (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Location of the study
    area Full size image 2.2 Data types, sources, and methods of collEctions Primary
    and secondary data were used for this study. Primary data were collected by a
    team of skilled enumerators with previous experience in data collection, familiarity
    with the research area, and proficiency in the local language. A semi-structured
    questionnaire was used to gather the primary data that was prepared after conducting
    a pre-test to refine some of the questions based on the feedback obtained from
    this exercise. As a result, certain changes were made to the questionnaire based
    on the results of the pre-test before the actual survey was conducted. Additionally,
    secondary data were collected from published and unpolished documents, Arsi Zone
    Office of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dodota, Lode-Hetosa, and Digalu-Tijo
    districts offices of agriculture and natural resources for augmenting primary
    data. 2.3 Sampling technique and sample size To select a representative sample
    of households for an interview, a multistage sampling technique was used. In the
    first stage, the Arsi zone was selected purposively due to its high potential
    in the production of wheat in the region and the country. In the second stage,
    three districts were purposively selected based on wheat production potentials
    and the presence of climate-smart wheat technology interventions. These are, Digalu
    Tijo from the highland, Lode Hetosa from the midland, and Dodota district from
    the lowland were selected. In the third stage, three kebeles 1 from Dodota, four
    kebeles from Lode Hetosa, and five kebeles from Digalu Tijo districts, a total
    of 12 kebeles were selected randomly based on probability proportional to the
    number of kebeles in each district. In the final stage, 422 wheat-producing households
    were selected randomly based on probability proportional to population size. However,
    the study was carried out at the plot level because farmers might use a particular
    technology on some of their plots but not on others. In light of this, data at
    the plot level were gathered from 628 plots handled by 422 randomly selected wheat
    farmers. The formula provided by [49] was used to determine the sample size: $$n
    = \\frac{{Z^{2} pqN}}{{e^{2} (N - 1) + Z^{2} pq}} = \\frac{{(1.96)^{2} (0.5)(0.5)(2,637,657)}}{{(0.05)^{2}
    (2,637,657) + (1.96)^{2} (0.5)(0.5)}}{\\kern 1pt}$$ (1) where n is the sample
    size; Z (1.96) is the standard cumulative distribution at 95% confidence level;
    e is the level of precision; p (which is = 0.5) is the estimated proportion of
    an attribute in the population, q = 1-p; and N is the size of the total population
    from which the sample is drawn. Hence, based on the formula stated above, the
    required sample size is 384. However, considering a non-response rate of 10%,
    the data were collected from 422 households. 2.4 Method of data analysis To identify
    the major determinants of climate-smart agricultural technologies adoption by
    smallholder wheat farmers (Improved wheat, integrated soil fertility management,
    and irrigation) Multivariate Probit (MVP) model was employed. The MVP model for
    the three climate-smart agricultural technologies is specified as: $${{\\text{Y}}}_{{\\text{ij}}}^{*}={\\upbeta
    }_{{\\text{j}}}{{\\text{X}}}_{{\\text{ij}}}+{\\upvarepsilon }_{{\\text{ij}}} ({\\text{j}}=1,\\dots
    3)$$ (2) where, \\({{\\text{Y}}}_{{\\text{ij}}}^{*}\\) is a latent variable associated
    with technology \\(j\\) and individual \\(i\\) that can be translated into binary
    outcomes such that: $${Y}_{ij}=1 if {{\\text{Y}}}_{{\\text{ij}}}^{*}>0\\,and\\,0,
    ot{\\text{herwise}}$$ (3) The \\({{{\\varepsilon }}_{{{ij}}}}\\)represents error
    terms distributed as multivariate normal, each with zero conditional mean, and
    variance–covariance matrix Ω, where Ω, has values of 1 on the leading diagonal
    and correlations \\(\\rho_{jk} = \\rho_{kj}\\) as off-diagonal elements as presented
    below. $$\\Omega =\\left[\\begin{array}{c}1 {\\uprho }_{12} {\\uprho }_{13 }\\\\
    {\\uprho }_{21 1 } {\\uprho }_{23}\\\\ {\\uprho }_{31} {\\uprho }_{32} 1\\end{array}\\right].$$
    (4) $$E\\left( {{\\varepsilon \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {\\varepsilon x}}
    \\right. \\kern-0pt} x}} \\right) = 0$$ $$Var\\left( {{\\varepsilon \\mathord{\\left/
    {\\vphantom {\\varepsilon x}} \\right. \\kern-0pt} x}} \\right) = 1$$ (5) $$Cov\\left(
    {{\\varepsilon \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {\\varepsilon x}} \\right. \\kern-0pt}
    x}} \\right) = \\rho$$ The off-diagonal elements of the variance–covariance matrix
    \\({\\rho }_{jk}\\) represent unobserved correlations between the disturbance
    terms related to the jth and kth types of CSAT adoptions namely; improved wheat
    varieties, integrated soil fertility management, and irrigation \\(( j=1, 2\\dots
    3;k=\\mathrm{1,2}\\dots 3;j\\ne k)\\). 2.5 Definition of variables and working
    hypothesis The dependent variables of the model were the adoption of improved
    wheat varieties, integrated soil fertility management, and irrigation. All are
    dummy variables that took a value of 1 if the framer adopted the technology and
    0, otherwise. Similarly, the definition and measurement of the independent variables
    for climate-smart agricultural technologies(CSATs) are given by the following
    Table 1. Table 1 Definitions of independent variables hypothesized to influence
    CSATs adoptions Full size table 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Household socio-economic
    characteristics (continuous variables) The average educational level of the sample
    household heads was grade 4, with a range of 0 to 12. Similarly, it was discovered
    that the sample household heads had an average of 27.3 years of farming experience,
    with minimum and highest values of 3 and 62 years, respectively. The average family
    size among the sample respondents was 4.30 persons per household in adult equivalent,
    which is lower than the national average of 4.6 persons per household [26]. In
    addition, the average number of contacts a farm household had with extension workers
    was found to be two per year, with minimum and highest values of 0 and 10 times,
    respectively. The mean livestock holding for the sample respondents was determined
    to be 4.40 in the Tropical Livestock Unit (TLU), with a minimum and maximum of
    0 and 11 TLU, respectively. The average total income of the sample households
    was determined to be 85,978.00 Ethiopian birr (ETB). The results also indicate
    that the sample respondents had to travel 5.10 km on average to the closest market
    center. Likewise, the average distance that the household traveled to the nearest
    wheat plot is 1.2 km (Table 2). Table 2 Summary statistics of continuous variables
    used in the adoption of CSATs Full size table 3.2 Household socio-economic characteristics
    (dummy variables) The result reveals the sex distribution of the sampled households
    is quite skewed towards the male, which accounts for 88.4% of respondents. Besides,
    only 47.9% of households participated in off/non-farm income-generating activities.
    Similarly, 62.6% of the sample households had training related to the use of CSATs.
    Besides, only 40.8% of the sample households have access to credit for purchasing
    necessary inputs, 93.8% are members of social organizations (Edir and Equp), and
    70.4% are members of cooperatives. It further shows that, of the sample households,
    73.9% have access to market information on input and output price, while the remaining
    26.1% do not. Similarly, 65% of the wheat plots of the sample households were
    flat, while the remaining 35% were medium and gentel slope (Table 3). Table 3
    Summary statistics of dummy variables used in the adoption of CSATs Full size
    table 3.3 The adoption status of CSATs The results show that improved wheat varieties
    were adopted on 95.22% of the plots whereas integrated soil fertility management
    was used on 85.19% of the plots. Meanwhile, irrigation was adopted only on 19.43%
    of the plots (Table 4). Table 4 Plot level adoption status of CSATs Full size
    table 3.4 Adoption of CSATs by agro-ecologies The relationships between selected
    districts and the adoption status of the sample households were compared by the
    following Table 5. The result revealed that all three technologies were highly
    adopted in highland agroecology accounting for about 43.1%, 37.9%, and 8.3% of
    improved wheat varieties, integrated soil fertility management, and irrigation,
    respectively. However, the smallest rate of adoption of the technologies occurs
    in lowland agroecology which accounts for about 18.5%, 15.9%, and 5% for improved
    wheat varieties, integrated soil fertility management, and irrigation, respectively.
    The result of the chi-square test revealed that there were statistically significant
    mean differences among agroecologies in the adoption of improved wheat varieties
    and integrated soil fertility management at a 5% and 10% level of significance.
    Table 5 Adoption of CSATs and Agro-ecologies Full size table 3.5 Linkages among
    the technologies The multivariate probit model (MVP) is suitable because the correlation
    coefficients of the MVP error terms are statistically different from zero in one
    of the three scenarios (Table 6). After the influence of the observed factors
    has been taken into consideration, the correlation coefficients measure the pair-wise
    correlation between decisions to adopt any one of the three technologies with
    the other two technologies [50]. The study’s findings also show that households
    had a 95.25%, 85.27%, and 19.52% probability of adopting improved wheat varieties,
    integrated soil fertility management, and irrigation technologies, respectively.
    The least likelihood of adoption of irrigation could be associated with problems
    of accessibility and financial constraints. It also demonstrates that the proportion
    of farmers using all three technologies jointly is 15%, implying that about 85%
    use either 1 or 2 of the technologies. Table 6 The Multivariate Probit model’s
    correlation matrix of CSATs Full size table The correlation coefficients for the
    error terms show complementarities in technologies (positive correlation) and
    substitutabilities in technologies (negative correlation) [51]. The findings of
    the simulated maximum likelihood estimation show a positive and significant association
    between integrated soil fertility management and household decisions to adopt
    improved wheat varieties. Improved wheat variety along with the use of integrated
    soil fertility management can raise resilience, lower greenhouse gas emissions,
    and increase agricultural productivity. Hence, they are a complement to one another.
    Moreover, the outcome further reveals that there is no distinct line between different
    technologies and hence, supports the interdependence assumption across the technologies.
    3.6 Determinants of adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies (CSATs)
    Even though farmers employ several technologies in combination, there are a lot
    of factors that can affect their decision to select one over another. Multivariate
    Probit Model (MVP) to identify the key factors that impede the adoption of CSATs
    from a survey of prior research’s literature. A statistically significant chi-square
    test result shows that the independent variables included in the model are pertinent
    in explaining the differences in the adoption of the three technologies under
    consideration in the study (Wald chi2 (51) = 114.36, p = 0.000). As evidenced
    by the likelihood ratio test’s rejection of the independent assumption on the
    adoption of CSATs, multivariate regression gives results that are more reliable
    than individual univariate (likelihood ratio test of Rij = 0: chi2(3) = 2.00,
    p = 0.045). Furthermore, before model estimation, various tests were made to know
    whether or not the model surpasses various assumptions. Therefore, the Variance
    Inflation Factor (VIF) was used to perform multicollinearity tests among all of
    the independent variables. There were no significant issues with multicollinearity
    among the explanatory factors since the values of VIF for all variables included
    in the model were all below 10 (Appendix). Likewise, the Breusch-Pagan test result
    showed that the model''s heteroskedasticity (appendix) problem did not exist.
    The model goodness of fit also indicated that the model was able to fit the data(appendix).
    However, endogeneity was tested for climate-smart technology adoptions using the
    Durbin-Wu-Hausman test. The test result revealed that there was a problem of endogeneity
    (χ2 = 0.652, P-value = 0.023). Hence, to overcome the problem of endogeneity,
    two instrumental variables namely; access to credit, and the distance to the wheat
    plot were selected as instrumental variables, and the adoption of climate-smart
    technologies was regressed on these variables including other variables in the
    structural model. Then, the predicted value of climate-smart technology adoption
    was taken and included in the original model (multivariate probit) model. The
    result of the MVP model revealed that among the 17 variables included in the analysis,
    six of them, namely, level of education, family size, farm size, credit, distance
    to the nearest market, and market information, were found to have a statistically
    significant effect on the decision to adopt improved wheat varieties whereas education
    level, farming experience, family size, and credit, were found to significantly
    affect the choice to use integrated soil fertility management. The outcomes of
    the model further indicated that family size, farm size, frequency of extension
    contact, and total annual income were the significant factors that influenced
    the decision to use irrigation (Table 7). However, the sign for farm size in irrigation
    was not as expected. Hence, the discussions about each significant variable are
    presented as follows: Table 7 Results of the Multivariate Probit Model Full size
    table The adoption of improved wheat varieties and integrated soil fertility management
    are positively and significantly influenced by the household head’s education
    level at 10% and 1% levels of significance, respectively. As a result, households
    are more likely to adopt improved wheat varieties and integrated soil fertility
    management as their years of schooling increase. In terms of how to interpret
    marginal effects, the marginal effect of 0.004 for the level of education in improved
    wheat varieties indicates that for each additional year in education, the farm
    households are 0.4% more likely to adopt improved wheat varieties. Similarly,
    the marginal effect of 0.018 of the level of education for integrated soil fertility
    management indicates that for each additional year in education, the farm households
    are 1.8% more likely to adopt integrated soil fertility management. This may be
    because farmers with a higher level of education can increase awareness and digest
    information about the advantages of utilizing climate-smart crop technologies
    more than farmers with fewer years of schooling. Hence, education plays a crucial
    role in stimulating adoption-related decisions. This result concurs with the findings
    of [52, 53,54,55], and [44]. Farming experience was also positively and significantly
    related to integrated soil fertility management at a 1% level of significance.
    The marginal effect of 0.007 for farming experience implies that an increase in
    years of farming by one year would increase the probability of adopting integrated
    soil fertility management by 0.7%. This is because farmers would gain knowledge
    of the benefits of various advanced technologies and methods as their years of
    farming experience increased. So, the likelihood of implementing integrated soil
    fertility management increases with experience. This finding concurs with that
    of [46]. Family size was negatively related to improved wheat varieties and positively
    related to integrated soil fertility management at a 5% level of significance.
    It is also related to irrigation at a 10% level of significance. The marginal
    effect of -0.008 for improved wheat varieties implies that each additional number
    of families in adult equivalent would decrease the likelihood of adopting improved
    wheat varieties by 0.8%. However, the marginal effect of 0.028 for integrated
    soil fertility management and irrigation indicates that each additional number
    of families in adult equivalent would increase the probability of adopting integrated
    soil fertility management and irrigation by 2.8%. According to the findings of
    the study, although households with a smaller number of families are more likely
    to adopt improved wheat varieties, they are less likely to adopt integrated soil
    fertility management. The negative link between improved wheat varieties and family
    size is due to the greater expense of food consumed at home, which would make
    it more difficult to afford commercial inputs like improved wheat varieties. This
    outcome agrees with the findings of [56]. Its positive effect on integrated soil
    fertility management is plausible because, in the study area, the use of integrated
    soil fertility management is a labor-intensive technology. Although the farm size
    has a positive and statistically significant effect on the adoption of improved
    wheat varieties at a 10% level of significance, it has a negative and significant
    effect on the adoption of irrigation at a 1% level of significance. If improved
    wheat varieties are adopted, the marginal effect for farm size is 0.011, which
    suggests that every 1-hectare increase in farm size would increase the probability
    of adoption of improved wheat varieties by 1.1%. Similarly, the marginal effect
    of − 0.058 for farm size under irrigation implies that every 1-hectare increase
    in cultivated land size would be 5.8% less likely to adopt irrigation technology
    than those having small size of farms. Therefore, as farm size increases, the
    possibility of utilizing improved wheat varieties increases, whereas the likelihood
    of using irrigation falls. Farmers who own more land are more likely to produce
    more, which results in greater financial resources that they may use to buy improved
    inputs, leading to a positive effect of farm size on the adoption of improved
    wheat varieties. This outcome is in line with the results of related investigations
    [46, 57,58,59,60,61]. However, the negative effect of farm size on irrigation
    is due to the fact that, in the context of limited land, farm households are forced
    to intensify farming to meet the rising demand for food among their members and
    outside [32, 62]. Hence, adopting irrigation technology to increase output from
    agriculture might be more likely if the amount of cultivated land is small. Previous
    adoption studies found that households with lower land holdings would be more
    likely to apply sustainable intensification practices [44, 54, 63, 64]. The frequency
    of extension contact was positively and significantly associated with the likelihood
    of adopting irrigation at a 10% level of significance. The marginal effect of
    0.025 for the frequency of extension contact implies that as the frequency of
    contact with development agents increases, the probability of adopting irrigation
    increases by 2.5%. As a result, farmers who have frequent interaction with development
    agents are more inclined to use irrigation. This can be explained rationally by
    the fact that development agents actively encourage the use of irrigation technology
    by balancing the drawbacks of not employing it and thereby encouraging adoption.
    Similarly, development agents support input distribution, create awareness, improve
    access to agricultural credit, and convey agricultural research and development
    outcomes to smallholder farmers. This finding is therefore in line with those
    of [12, 46, 59, 61, 65,66,67], who identified extension services as a key driver
    of the adoption of various CSA techniques. At 5% and 10% levels of significance,
    access to credit positively and significantly influences the likelihood of adopting
    improved wheat varieties and integrated soil fertility management, respectively.
    Farm households with access to credit are 2.6% more likely to adopt improved wheat
    varieties than those who do not, as the marginal effect for access to credit for
    improved wheat varieties is 0.026. Similarly, the marginal effect of 0.047 for
    access to credit for integrated soil fertility management implies that farm households
    who have access to credit are 4.7% more likely to adopt integrated soil fertility
    management than those who have no access to it. This is because having access
    to credit makes it possible for households to purchase modern agricultural technologies
    without experiencing income problems, which opens the door for the timely execution
    of modern farm inputs. This result is similar to the findings of [11, 44 ,68],
    and [69, 70]. Distance to the nearest market was negatively and significantly
    related to improved wheat varieties adoption at a 1% level of significance. The
    marginal effect of − 0.010 for distance to the nearest market center indicates
    that for every 1 km increase in the distance to the nearest market, they are 1.0%
    less likely to adopt improved wheat varieties. As a result, households that are
    close to the nearest market have a greater probability of adopting improved wheat
    varieties than those that are far away. This makes sense given that market distance
    raises transportation and transaction costs and restricts access to information
    about new technology, which makes it more unlikely for distant locations to utilize
    inputs that have been purchased from the market. This result is consistent with
    the findings of [32, 44, 64, 71, 72], and [69]. At a 10% level of significance,
    access to market information positively and significantly determines the adoption
    of improved wheat varieties. The marginal effect of 0.034 for market information
    implies that farm households that have access to market information are 3.4% more
    likely to adopt improved wheat varieties than farm households without such access.
    This is because access to market information enables farm households to easily
    obtain necessary information about the availability and price of inputs and outputs.
    This result is concurring with the finding of [73]. At a 1% level of significance,
    the log of total annual income has a positive and significant effect on the likelihood
    of using irrigation. The marginal effect of 0.090 for total income indicates that
    an increase in household total income by one birr would lead to an increase in
    the probability of adopting irrigation by 9.0%. Due to the capital-intensive nature
    of irrigation technology, a household with a higher total income cannot be financially
    limited and prevented from making timely use of irrigation technology. This outcome
    concurs with the findings of [74,75,76]. 4 Conclusion and policy implications
    4.1 Conclusion Climate-resilient agricultural technology adoptions are essential
    for sustainably increasing productivity, building resilience to climate change,
    and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, as the opportunity to expand
    cultivated land is exhausted in Ethiopia due to growth in population and urbanization,
    the necessity to implement climate-smart agricultural technology in the agricultural
    sector has become critical. Despite this, the county’s agriculture sector is known
    for using traditional techniques and technologies. The success of the sector in
    terms of increasing its contribution to the overall growth of the economy and
    ensuring food self-sufficiency depends on the development and implementation of
    climate-smart technologies. So, research on the factors that hinder the adoption
    of climate-smart technologies is crucial to enhancing agricultural productivity,
    building resilience, and reducing poverty in the study area in particular and
    the country in general. Therefore, this study analyzed factors that affect the
    adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies among wheat farmers using
    plot and household-level data collected from a sample of 422 wheat-producer households
    in the Arsi zone. The study used a multivariate probit (MVP) model since it was
    found that farmers were more inclined to use a variety of technologies rather
    than only one. The three climate-smart agricultural technologies that were taken
    into consideration for this study were improved wheat varieties, integrated soil
    fertility management, and irrigation. The multivariate correlation coefficients’
    result shows that there was a significant and positive relationship between the
    adoption of integrated soil fertility management and improved wheat varieties.
    The MVP model’s findings showed that the factors influencing farmers’ decision
    to adopt a technology vary between technologies. Therefore, the level of education,
    family size, farm size, credit, distance to the nearest market, and market information,
    were found to have a statistically significant effect on the decision to adopt
    improved wheat varieties whereas level of education, farming experience, family
    size, and credit, were found to significantly affect the choice to employ integrated
    soil fertility management. It is also revealed that family size, farm size, frequency
    of extension contact, and total income were significant factors that determine
    the decision to use irrigation. 4.2 Policy implications The following suggestions
    were made in light of the study’s findings: The adoption of improved wheat varieties
    and integrated soil fertility management were both positively and significantly
    influenced by the level of education. Hence, the government must train farmers
    by strengthening and establishing both formal and informal types of farmers’ education
    programs, farmers'' training centers, and technical and professional schools.
    Besides, it has been discovered that having access to credit significantly increases
    the likelihood that climate-smart technologies will be adopted. Hence, facilitating
    access to credit services might ease the financial burden of acquiring and owning
    innovative agricultural technologies. Policymakers must make sure that farmers
    have access to credit to hasten the adoption of climate-smart technologies. To
    do this, they must expand the number of microfinance institutions in rural areas
    that offer credit services to smallholder farmers. Moreover, distance to the closest
    market center is another significant factor that influences the adoption of climate-smart
    technologies, according to the study. Hence, to ensure accessibility and availability
    of climate-smart technologies the market must be established near the home of
    farm households. Furthermore, to increase access to market information, the quantity
    and quality of extension contact, and total annual income, the government, non-governmental
    organizations, and donor agencies should work cooperatively with farm households.

  description: Global trends show that the rapid increase in maize production is associated
    more with the expansion of maize growing areas than with rapid increases in yield.
    This is possible through achieving possible higher productivity through maize
    production practices intensification to meet the sustainable production. Therefore,
    a field experiment on “Ecological intensification of climate-resilient maize–chickpea
    cropping system” was conducted during consecutive three years from 2017–2018 to
    2019–2020 at Main Agricultural Research Station, Dharwad, Karnataka, India. Results
    of three years pooled data revealed that ecological intensification (EI) treatment
    which comprises of all best management practices resulted in higher grain yield
    (7560 kg/ha) and stover yield compared to farmers’ practice (FP) and all other
    treatments which were deficit in one or other crop management practices. Similarly,
    in the succeeding winter season, significantly higher chickpea yield (797 kg/ha)
    was recorded in EI. Further EI practice recorded significant amount of soil organic
    carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and iron after completion
    of third cycle of experimentation (0.60%, 235.3 kg/ha,21.0 kg/ha,363.2 kg/ha,0.52 ppm
    and 5.2 ppm respectively). Soil enzymatic activity was also improved in EI practice
    over the years and improvement in each year was significant. Lower input energy
    use was in FP (17,855.2 MJ/ha). Whereas total output energy produced was the highest
    in EI practice (220,590 MJ ha−1) and lower output energy was recorded in EI–integrated
    nutrient management (INM) (149,255 MJ/ha). Lower energy productivity was noticed
    in EI-INM. Lower specific energy was recorded in FP and was followed by EI practice.
    Whereas higher specific energy was noticed is EI–INM. Each individual year and
    pooled data showed that EI practice recorded higher net return and benefit–cost
    ratio. The lower net returns were obtained in EI-integrated weed management (Rs.
    51354.7/ha), EI-recommended irrigation management (Rs. 56,015.3/ha), integrated
    pest management (Rs. 59,569.7/ha) and farmers’ practice (Rs. 67,357.7/ha) which
    were on par with others.

    Open access 17 May 2021 Introduction Maize (Zea mays L.) is known as the “Queen
    of Cereals” and is one of the most extensively planted cereal crops in the world,
    ranking first in terms of production. Annual global demand for maize, rice, and
    wheat is predicted to exceed 3.3 billion tons by 2050 and this will have to happen
    from similar or perhaps much lower land resources1. The global average yield for
    maize has been increasing steadily over the period. Yields have been improving
    at a rate of 65 kg/ha/year2 since 1960 which accounts to steady rate of 10 million
    ton/year until 2004, after which they shifted to a steeper production of 31 M
    ton/year2. The increase in production closely follows the recent trend for maize
    area expansion, which had been increasing at a rate of 0.9 million ha/year prior
    to 2007 and, has now been increasing at the more rapid pace of 4.7 million ha/year.
    Simultaneously, the shifting climate and environmental degradation, changing climate,
    and diseases and insect pests are known threats to crop production and productivity,
    especially in the tropics. The increased output must be achieved with less land,
    water, energy, and other vital inputs, as well as a limited natural resource base.
    Agriculture in Asia faces new challenges because of climate change. Climate change
    is thought to have affected worldwide maize and wheat yields by 3.8% and 5.5%,
    respectively, since 1980. Climate change has an impact on crop yields as well
    as food availability and productivity of natural resources including land and
    water3,4. South Asia''s natural resources are 3–5 times more stressed than the
    rest of the world due to demographic, economic, and political pressures4. After
    rice and wheat, it is India''s third most important cereal. It accounts for 9.1%
    of the India’s total whole food grain production. About 20–25% of India''s maize
    is used for human consumption, 60–65% for cattle and poultry feed, and 10–15%
    for food processing industries such as corn flakes, dextrose, starch, popcorn,
    corn oil, and corn syrup. The world''s maize area is 192.50 million hectares,
    and it ranks first in production with 1,112.40 million metric tonne1. In India,
    maize is grown in an area of 9.6 m ha with 28.8 m t of production and 3006 kg/ha
    productivity, while in Karnataka it has 1.6 m ha of area with 4.2 m t of production
    and 2990 kg ha−1 productivity5. However, demand for maize in India by end of 2022
    is estimated at 44 million metric tons. And not less than 15 million farmers are
    engaged in maize cultivation in India5. During the previous 5 years maize’s annual
    growth rate was 11% and is sourced for more than 35,000 products5. Despite several
    constraints, such as overdependence on rainfall, frequent climatic extremes such
    as drought, heat, and/or waterlogging, yield losses due to pre- and postharvest
    pathogens and insect pests, weeds, and lack of access to high-quality seed in
    some areas, several Asian countries have seen impressive growth rates in maize
    area, production, and productivity in recent years. However, alternative climate-smart,
    long-term intensification strategies in the tropics must be considered in addition.
    As a result, developing climate resilience in Asia necessitates a multi-disciplinary
    approach. More widespread understanding and implementation of climate-smart agronomic
    management practices, as well as the enhancement of local competencies and an
    emphasis on sustainability, are all part of this strategy. Maize is primarily
    grown as rainfed crops by smallholder farmers in most of Asia. Yield and yield
    components of corn were significantly affected by planting patterns, plant densities
    and maize hybrids6. Corn hybrids respond differently to high plant density7. Several
    researchers reported that the effects of row spacing and hybrids on maize dry
    matter yield and quality characteristics are variable7,8. Pest infestations can
    also be influenced by plant density or row spacing. Root maggots were minimized
    when the plant density was high (Delia spp.). On the contrary, high density reduced
    grain yield due to increased pollen to silking interval resulting in more barrenness
    of ears. However, it may lead to higher risk of lodging, hence causing significant
    yield loss of the crop9. Regional environmental condition is the key factor for
    determining the planting density, and reasonable cultivation techniques and appropriate
    density-resistant varieties are effective approaches to overcome environmental
    constraints and increase planting density10. Due to moderate organic matter oxidation,
    minimum soil cultivation restricts respiration gases in the rooting zone, porosity
    for water transport, retention, and release, and inhibits the re-exposure of weed
    seeds and their germination11. Irrigation is another key management strategy for
    increasing crop output and improving nutrient uptake. Irrigation frequency and
    total water application affect root dispersion and total root length12. This determines
    the physiological processes that are critical to plant growth. To attain higher
    yields, weed competition during the early phases of crop growth should be minimized13.
    Reduced crop-weed competition resulted in an increase in maize dry matter buildup,
    which led to improved yield characteristics and grain yield14. The performance
    of tembotrione as a herbicide has been presented at several conferences and through
    various scientific papers15,16. Topramezone and tembotrione are the new selective,
    postemergence herbicides introduced for use in maize that inhibit Hydroxy-phenyl
    pyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD) enzyme and the biosynthesis of plastoquinone15,17.
    Tank mixing of these herbicides with lower dose of atrazine was reported to be
    more effective than application of individual chemical. System Intensification
    using more biological inputs through best management practices, is the best alternative
    methodology for sustainable food, nutrition, ecological and health security18.
    The weed menace causes globally 11.5% and at national 10.9% production loss19.
    Turcicum leaf blight of maize (TLB) is a major foliar disease in maize and caused
    by Exserohilum turcicum (Pass.) Leonard and Suggs. (Synonyms: Drechslera turcica
    (Pass.) Subramanian and Jain; Bipolar isturcica (Pass.) Shoemaker; Helminthosporium
    turcicum (Pass.) Leonard and Suggs. The disease is known to affect maize from
    seedling to harvest. Loss in grain yield will be more if disease occurs before
    flowering, silking, and grain filling stages due to decreased photosynthetic area.
    The grain yield loss up to 46.7% has been reported due to TLB in maize20. As many
    as 141 insect pests cause different degrees of damage to maize crops from sowing
    to harvesting21. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (E. F. Smith) (Noctuidae:
    Lepidoptera) has become a serious pest on maize in India and elsewhere. The pest
    has been very recently reported on maize from Karnataka for the first time in
    India22,23. It is an insect native to tropical and subtropical regions of the
    Americas. During 2016, the FAW was noticed first in Karnataka and Central maize
    growing states of India and made the farmers feel panic about the incidence22.
    The fall armyworm larvae are a cosmopolitan, polyphagous pest which can feed on
    about 80 different plant species including crops such as corn, rice, small millets,
    sugarcane, alfalfa, soybean, sorghum, cotton, and vegetable crops23. The rapid
    spread of this pest in Indian states and Asian countries is due to its efficient
    ability to travel and migrate long distances in short time. Pest-related crop
    losses could amount to enough food to feed more than 1 billion people24. It is
    now obvious that other ways must be used to limit insect damage while avoiding
    the expense and unfavorable effects associated with synthetic pesticides because
    the use of synthetic pesticides poses additional obstacles. Integrated Pest Management
    (IPM) is a combination of several pest management approaches to supplement, minimize,
    or substitute the reliance of chemical pesticides. IPM encompasses simultaneous
    management and convergence of strategies, as well as consistent pest and natural
    enemy surveillance. IPM, on the other hand, is a lot more than merely a resource-saving
    technology. Due to land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change, soil
    has become one of the most vulnerable resources in the world. Achieving sustainability
    and increasing agricultural output are both possible with sustainable agricultural
    techniques. Climate smart agriculture, conservation agriculture and integrated
    soil fertility management and integrated pest management are agricultural technologies
    that are frequently marketed as supporting pathways to sustainable intensification
    (SI). These technologies also include carbon sequestrations, energy budgeting
    and green economy. In this context, a field experiment was initiated to enhance
    sustainable intensification of maize production in rainfed tropics by comparing
    farmers'' methods to precision-conservation best practices comprising green technologies
    such as crop residue mulching, minimum tillage, integrated soil fertility, weed
    and pest management options. Results Grain yield of maize and chickpea Results
    of three years pooled data revealed that ecological intensification (EI) treatment
    which comprises of best tillage, crop residue cover, planting density and genotype,
    precision nutrient management, application of water at critical growth stages,
    integrated weed, disease and insect management recorded significantly (p = 0.05)
    higher grain yield (7560 kg/ha) and stover yield (8757 kg/ha) compared to farmers’
    practice (FP) all and other treatments which were deficit in one or another crop
    management practices (T3, T4, T5, T6 and T8) (Table 1). In all individual years
    EI practice recorded significantly higher grain and stover yield. Whereas EI-INM
    recorded significantly lower grain and stover yield followed by EI-IWM. Similarly
    test weight and dry matter accumulation at harvest were also significantly higher
    in EI practice compared to other practices (Table 2). Table 1 Grain and stover
    yield of maize as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.
    Full size table Table 2 Test weight and dry weight of weeds as influenced by ecological
    intensification in maize-chickpea system. Full size table Similarly in the succeeding
    winter season, significantly (p = 0.05) higher chickpea yield (797 kg/ha) was
    recorded in EI all the years and the lowest was recorded in EI minus INM (539
    kg/ha) (Table 3). Further EI practice showed a greater number of secondary branches
    and pods per plant compared to remaining practices at p = 0.05 level of significance.
    In cropping systems, more than one species is involved, and it becomes very difficult
    to compare the economic produce of different nature. To express the yield advantage,
    the yields of individual crops in a system were converted into equivalent yield
    based on their economic value could be expressed in maize equivalent yield (MEY)
    (Table 3). Higher MEY in a system could be credited to yield advantages attained.
    Significantly more MEY was obtained in EI practice in both individual years (11,016,
    1186, 8852 kg/ha during first, second and third year respectively) and pooled
    over three years (10,418 kg/ha). Whereas EI-INM recorded the lowest MEY, and it
    was on par with FP, EI-IWM and EI-IPM during individual years and pooled over
    three years at p = 0.05 level of significance. Table 3 Chickpea yield and maize
    equivalent yield as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea
    system. Full size table Major disease and pest incidence Fall army worm (FAW-Spodoptera
    frugiperda, J. E. Smith) incidence was significantly higher on maize in EI-RPM
    (2.7%) followed by FP (1.4%) which was on par with other practices (Table 4).
    The FAW could threaten the food security and livelihoods of millions of small-scale
    farmers in Asia as the invasive crop-eating pest is highly likely to spread further
    from India, with Southeast Asia and South China most at risk. Among the system,
    FAW least infestation was noticed under EI practice (0.9%). Among the economically
    important diseases of maize, turcicum leaf blight (TLB: Setosphaeria turcica L.),
    regularly causes varying degrees of yield losses at national level. All the years
    EI practice recorded significantly lower disease severity score (6.0, 3.7, 4.9
    during first, second, and third year respectively) and EI-IPM recorded the highest
    (8.0, 6.3, 7.2 during first, second and third year respectively) and it was on
    par with FP. EI showed significantly lower disease severity of 55.00 and 31.67%
    during the year 2018 and 2019 respectively and pooled mean value 43.33% which
    was significantly lower over the other treatments. Highest disease severity 65.00
    and 72.00% was recorded in farmer’s practices during 2018 and 2019 respectively
    with mean pooled value 68.50%. Table 4 Turcicum leaf blight and fall armyworm
    incidence as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.
    Full size table Weed dynamics Major weed flora associated with experimental site
    were grasses, sedges, and broad-leaved weeds. The important grassy weeds observed
    were Brachiaria eruciformis (Trin.) Griseb., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., Dinebra
    retroflexa Jacq. and Cyperus rotundus L., was under sedges category. Among broad
    leaved weeds, Ageratum conyzoides L., Alternanthera sessilis H. B and K., Commelina
    benghalensis L., Euphorbia geniculate L., Mollugo disticha Lamk., Parthenium hysterophorus
    L., Phyllanthus niruri Webster and Corchorus trilocularis L. were the dominant
    weeds. All these were smothered effectively in EI practice and their population
    and dry weight were significantly higher in FP at p = 0.05 level of significance
    (Table 5). Table 5 Population and dry weight of weeds at 30 days after sowing
    as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system. Full size
    table Economic analysis of practices The net return was calculated treatment wise
    by subtracting the total cost of cultivation from gross returns and expressed
    in rupees per hectare (Rs./ha). Whereas benefit–cost ratio was worked out by dividing
    gross returns from cost of cultivation. To assess the advantage of any production
    system, it is finally the economics of the system which plays a major role in
    its acceptance by the farmers. Net returns obtained in different cultivation practices
    varied significantly. Each individual year and pooled data showed that EI practice
    recorded significantly more net return (Rs. 76,338, 83,469 and 82,011 during first,
    second and third year respectively), and benefit–cost ratio (1.8, 3.2 and 2.7
    during first, second and third year respectively) (Table 6). The lowest net returns
    were obtained in FP EI-integrated weed management (Rs.51354.7/ha) followed by
    EI-recommended irrigation management (Rs. 56,015.3/ha), integrated pest management
    (Rs. 59,569.7/ha) and farmers’ practice (Rs. 67,357.7/ha) over three years. Pooled
    net returns over three years also followed a similar trend with the highest net
    returns of Rs.80606/ha in EI practice. Further benefit–cost ratio of different
    cultivation practices varied significantly. In the first year and pooled data
    showed that B-C ratio was significantly higher FP which was on par with EI-INM
    and EI-RPM. The EI-IWM recorded the lowest B-C ratio followed by EI practice.
    B-C ratio varied year to year among the practices depending on yield obtained
    and cost invested at p = 0.05 level of significance. Table 6 Economics of maize
    as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system. Full size
    table Energetic analysis of practices Input energy which considers labor engaged
    organics, fuel, seeds, fertilizers pesticides and irrigation cost varied in different
    practices. Significantly lower input energy use was in FP (17,855.2 MJ/ha), whereas
    significantly higher energy input was in EI (24,647 MJ/ha)which was on par with
    remaining practices (Tables 7 and 8). Whereas total output energy produced was
    the highest in EI (220,590 MJ/ha) and lower output energy was recorded in EI–INM
    (149,255 MJ/ha). Input and output energy calculated for remaining practices were
    on par with each other. Net energy also followed a similar trend to that of output
    energy. EI recorded higher net energy and on the contrary EI–INM recorded lower
    net energy. Energy use efficiency is cultural energy utilized through inputs and
    energy produced as products. FP revealed higher energy use efficiency followed
    by EI. Whereas lower energy use efficiency was reported in EI–INM. Similarly higher
    energy productivity was also recorded in FP followed by EI. Specific energy is
    energy required to produce per kilo of main product. So, it is understood that
    the lower the specific energy, the better the practice. Lower specific energy
    was recorded in FP and was followed by EI. Whereas higher specific energy was
    noticed is EI–INM. Efficient use of energy helps to achieve increased production
    and productivity and contributes to the economy, profitability, and competitiveness
    of agriculture sustainability in rural areas25,26. Table 7 Contribution of different
    production factors towards total input energy (MJ/ha). Full size table Table 8
    Energetic of maize as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea
    system. Full size table Soil fertility status At initial stage of experimentation
    and after completion of each cycle of maize–chickpea cropping system, soil samples
    were analyzed for nutrient status in soil, the results showed that soil organic
    carbon (SOC) content in soil at the beginning of experimentation was deficit (0.43%)
    and it reached to medium (0.49 to 0.52%) in all the practices wherever crop residue
    was retained (Table 9). There was further improvement in soil organic carbon over
    the years and significantly more so in EI practice. Similar trend was recorded
    with respect to improvement soil available nutrient content in soil. EI practice
    recorded significant amount of organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus,
    potassium, zinc, and iron after completion of third cycle of experimentation (0.60%,
    235.3 kg/ha,21.0 kg/ha,363.2 kg/ha,0.52 ppm and 5.2 ppm, respectively) which account
    to 27,46,23,10,68 and 22% improvement respectively over FP (Tables 9 and 10, Figs.
    1 and 2). The comparison was made with initial value and results showed that FP
    recorded negative for organic carbon, available nitrogen, and phosphorus, DTPA
    extractable zinc and iron (Fig. 2). Whereas EI practice showed significant improvement
    of nutrient build up in soil. Further initial value in EI-INM did not show any
    improvement in nutrient status of soil compared to FP. And it recorded lower phosphorus
    and potash content in soil compared to FP. Whereas, other practices recorded increased
    nutrient status over the FP, but rate of increased linearity was less compared
    to EI practice. In FP, SOC, available nitrogen, and phosphorus remained deficit
    all through the years and it was on par with EI-INM practice. Table 9 Organic

    Full size image Enzymatic activity in soil Soil dehydrogenase and phosphatase
    enzymatic activity was improved in EI practice over the years and improvement
    in each year was significant compared to FP (Table 12). In EI practice, pooled
    data showed that dehydrogenase and phosphatase increase was 26.6 and 33.7% over
    FP. EI-INM practice found on par with FP with respect to these two enzymatic activities
    in soil in all the years. Discussion Sustainability of productivity of maize–chickpea
    system Grain yield of maize was significantly higher in EI practice as it comprised
    all recommended agronomic practices which included conservation tillage, crop
    residue cover, optimum planting density, precision nutrient management, application
    of water at critical growth stages, integrated weed, disease, and insect compared
    to FP and other treatments which were deficit in one or another best crop management
    practices. Grain yield was significantly higher in residue cover in comparison
    with conventional tillage and residue removed27. But in the case of EI-IWM, grain
    yield was not significantly influenced by residue cover (Table 1). In all three
    individual years also, EI practice recorded higher grain and stover yield due
    to improved test weight of grain and decreased weed population and their dry weight.
    The findings of higher maize yield under EI are in close agreement with other
    findings of reports of higher maize yield in conservation practice28,29,30,31.
    The higher yield of maize under EI could be attributed to the compound effect
    of better establishment of the crop due to favorable soil temperature and moisture
    conditions in soil, additional nutrients32, reduced competition for resources
    and improved bio-physico-chemical soil health over conventional farmers practice3,33.
    Precision-conservation agriculture, scale-appropriate mechanization and integrated
    nutrient management can help support sustainable intensification of maize-based
    cropping systems, helping to improve efficient use of soil, labor, water and nutrients34.
    Like maize yield, significantly higher chickpea yield (797 kg ha−1) was also recorded
    in EI all the years (Table 3). Further it showed a greater number of secondary
    branches and pods per plant compared to remaining practices as result of better
    soil fertility and soil moisture retention. Surface maintained crop residues act
    as mulch and therefore reduce soil water losses through evaporation and maintain
    a moderate soil temperature regime35. In cropping systems, more than one species
    is involved, and it becomes very difficult to compare the economic produce of
    different nature. To express the yield advantage, the yields of individual crops
    in a system were converted into equivalent yield based on their economic value
    could be expressed in maize equivalent yield (MEY). Higher MEY in a system could
    be credited to yield advantages attained. Significantly more MEY was obtained
    in was also significantly higher in EI practice in all individual years (11,016,
    1186, 8852 kg ha−1 during first, second and third year respectively) and pooled
    over three years (10,418 kg ha−1) (Table 3). Whereas EI-INM recorded the lowest
    maize equivalent yield, and it was on par with FP, EI-IWM and EI-IPM during individual
    years and pooled over three years due to poor performance of maize–chickpea cropping
    systems in these practices. INM practice obtained significantly p ≤ 0.01) higher
    grain yield (8.42 tons ha−1) than farmer dose of fertilizer27. Crop residue retention
    had lot of advantages as part of improvement in soil organic carbon, available
    nutrients and soil microbial activity are concerned. EI followed some principle
    of conservation agriculture (CA) which has three principles: (1) establishing
    crops with reduced tillage, (2) residue mulches on the soil surface, and (3) crop
    rotations36. The crop residues become mulch over the soil surface that protects
    the soil productive layer against runoff reducing the nutrient loss and erosion
    through runoff37,38 and increases the percentage of organic matter in the soil
    layer39. In EI practice, INM, IWM and IPM were the major tools for best crop production.
    They embrace soil, nutrient, water, crop, and vegetation management practices,
    tailored to a particular cropping and farming system, undertaken with the aim
    of improving and sustaining soil fertility and land productivity, and reducing
    environmental degradation. Precision INM aims to optimize the condition of the
    soil, about its physical, chemical, biological, and hydrological properties, for
    the purpose of enhancing farm productivity, whilst minimizing land degradation.
    Whereas EI-INM recorded lower grain and stover yield followed by EI-IWM as they
    recorded lower test weight and dry matter accumulation at harvest. It is well
    known that each of the nutrient elements plays a major role in growth and development
    of the plants, and when present in deficient quantities can reduce growth and
    yields40. One of the primary goals of the integrated strategy is to minimize the
    use of exogenous agriculture inputs like synthetic fertilizers and pesticides41.
    INM relies largely on the balanced application of appropriate fertilizers. Excess
    fertilizer usage does not result in significantly higher crop absorption of nutrients
    or yields. Furthermore, excessive nutrient applications are monetarily unproductive
    and may adversely affect the ecosystem. On the other hand, inadequate application
    might affect the crop growth and reduce yields in the short term while jeopardizing
    sustainability through soil exploitation, over time. Secondary nutrients and micronutrients
    that are also easily obtainable from organic fertilizers should also be included
    in a balanced fertilization42. The use of exclusively inorganic fertilizers causes
    nutritional imbalance, resulting in poorer yields and reduced yearly returns43.
    Weed management Weed management in maize can be highly critical due to wider row
    spacing. Manual control of weeds growing between the rows is labor intensive.
    Herbicides weed control is an important alternative to manual weeding because
    it is cheaper, faster and gives better weed control in maize44. Weed problems
    are more severe during continuous rains in early stages of maize growth which
    cannot be controlled by traditional and cultural practices alone due to too much
    wetness and difficulty in hand weeding. Weeds reduce maize yield from 33 to 50%
    depending upon weed species and density45. Weeds compete with crops for light,
    moisture, space, and plant nutrients and consequently interfere with the normal
    growth of crops. It is known that there is a critical crop-weed competition period
    with grain losses reaching between 28 and 100% if weeds are not controlled46,47.
    Control of weeds in maize is, therefore, very important for obtaining higher productivity.
    Much of previous crop residue covered the soil and thereby reduced the weed menace
    in all the treatments except FP where residue was not retained on soil. Apart
    from FP and EI-IWM practices, which were affected by crop residue cover, the maize
    crop cultivated under the EI practice had a decreased population of weeds and
    their dry weight (Table 5). Establishment of weeds and emerged weeds were controlled
    by application of tembotrione at 2 to 3 leaf stage of weeds resulting reduced
    dry weight of weeds. Weed control practices in maize resulted in 77 to 96.7% higher
    grain yield than the weedy check48,49. EI-IWM showed more weed menace as IWM practice
    was not affected and only cultural method such as hand weeding has been done which
    was less effective under system of soil cover with residue. Perennial weeds have
    a persistence effect under EI-IWM and FP. The performance of Tembotrione and Topramezone
    as effective herbicides has been already established15,16,50. However, there are
    reports of residual toxicity and there is need to use of alternative herbicides
    to avoid build –up of residue in soil. Topramezone and tembotrione are the new
    selective, post emergence herbicides introduced for use in maize that inhibit
    Hydroxy-phenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD) enzyme and the biosynthesis of plastoquinone15,17.
    Residues of tembotrione and TCMBA persisted up to 60 days in soil and tembotrione
    show maximum leaching up to 25 cm in soil depth51. Therefore, tank mixing of these
    post emergence herbicides with lower dose of atrazine was reported to be more
    effective than application of individual chemical. Management of Fall armyworm
    Another two major pests of maize are recent invasive Fall armyworm (FAW) and turcicum
    leaf blight (TLB) and they influence significantly maize productivity. FAW incidence
    was significantly higher on maize in EI-IPM (2.7%) practice. In other practices
    the incidence of FAW was on par with FP (1.4%). IPM is also influenced by several
    factors. Each grower has their own strategy for producing crops, minimizing losses,
    and making a profit in a manner that is acceptable to the retailer, safe for the
    consumers, and less disruptive to the environment. In other words, IPM is an approach
    to manage pests in an economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally
    safe manner52,53. Among the systems, FAW least infestation was noticed under EI
    practice (0.9%) as control measures were initiated at right time with cultural
    and chemical measures as part of IPM strategy. Among the economically important
    diseases of maize, turcicum leaf blight (TLB: Setosphaeria turcica), regularly
    cause varying degrees of yield losses at national level. All the years EI practice
    recorded significantly lower disease severity score (6.0, 3.7, 4.9 during first,
    second and third year respectively) as integrated disease management was part
    of EI practice (Table 4). EI-RPM recorded the highest (8.0, 6.3, 7.2 during first,
    second and third year respectively) and it was on par with FP. Whereas, under
    uncontrolled condition yield loss could reach upto 4.5%. Soil fertility status
    Organic carbon (OC) content in soil at the beginning of experimentation was deficit
    and it reached to medium (0.49 to 0.52%) in all the practices wherever crop residue
    was retained. There was further improvement in organic carbon over the years and
    more so in EI practice due to application of organics and crop residue retention
    which resulted in significant improvement in organic carbon, available nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and iron after completion of third cycle of experimentation
    (0.60%, 235.3 kg/ha, 21.0 kg/ha, 363.2 kg/ha, 0.52 ppm and 5.2 ppm respectively).
    It accounted for 27, 46, 23, 10, 68 and 22% improvement respectively over FP.
    Introduction of crop residue in the soil offers the best means to restore carbon
    in agriculture soils54. After comparing with initial value, FP recorded depletion
    of soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, and phosphorus, DTPA extractable zinc
    and iron (Table 11 and Fig. 2). Whereas EI practice showed significant improvement
    of nutrient build-up in soil due to crop residue retention and addition of recommended
    organic source in the form of farmyard manure (FYM-10.0 tons/ha). High yielding
    crops like maize require large amounts of mineral nutrients from soil which require
    proper nutrient management strategy that minimize loss and maximize the efficiency
    of use27. Except in FP, other practices were also covered with crop residue and
    FYM and that is why they are shown improved soil nutrient status compared to FP.
    Further EI-INM and FP recorded lower phosphorus and potash content in soil. Whereas
    other practices recorded increased nutrient status over the FP, but the rate of
    increased linearity was less compared to EI practice. In FP, soil OC, available
    nitrogen and phosphorus remained deficit all through the years due to negligible
    application of organic manures and no soil cover with crop residue. Soil dehydrogenase
    and phosphatase enzymatic activity were improved in EI practice over the years
    and improvement in each year was significant compared to FP (Table 12). In EI
    practice pooled data showed that dehydrogenase and phosphatase increase was 26.6
    and 33.7% over FP due to linear increase in organic carbon and its mineralization
    over the years. EI-INM practice found on par with FP with respect these two enzymes
    activity in soil in all the years. Because of high organic matter and nutrients
    in EI practice, the population of bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes were increased.
    And their activity in the form of dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase and acid
    phosphatase are the enzymes responsible for converting organic P into available
    form55. The increased population of microorganisms hasa role in yield maximization
    through increased nutrient availability56. Higher activity of dehydrogenase enzyme
    and microbes in organic -amended soil than in unamended soil was reported by many
    researchers57,58. Table 11 DTPA extractable zinc and iron (ppm) in soil as influenced
    by different ecological intensification treatments. Full size table Table 12 Dehydrogenase
    and phosphatase in soil as influenced by different ecological intensification
    treatments. Full size table Energetics analysis in different practices Input energy
    which takes into variable cost incurred on labor engaged, organics, fuel, seeds,
    fertilizers pesticides and irrigation varied in different practices. Significantly
    lower input energy use was in farmers’ practice (17,855.2 MJ/ha)as there was no
    investment in crop residue application and potash fertilizers (Table 8 and Fig.
    3). Further pesticide, micronutrient and fertilizer purchase cost was also less.
    However, there was more investment on land preparation in FP. Land preparation
    and planting practices are considered the next most important energy component
    investment in conventionally managed agricultural systems59,60. On the contrary,
    higher energy input was in EI (24,647 MJ/ha) which was on par with remaining practices
    (Table 8). In Iran, maize production systems total energy input was 39,295.50
    MJ/ha61. Whereas total output energy produced was the highest in ecological intensification
    (220,590 MJ/ha) and lower output energy was recorded in EI–NRM (149,255 MJ/ha).
    Whereas in Iran, total output energy recorded was 58,065 MJ/ha61. Input and output
    energy calculated for remaining practices were on par with each other. It is understood
    that the output energy depends upon the grain and stover yield of the crop. The
    higher the grain and stover yield, the higher will be the output energy. The lower
    output energy in EI–INM was due to low yield as results of deficiency of nutrients
    particularly potash and zinc. Nutrient management is very important since it utilizes
    almost 70% of total input energy used in maize production62. Similarly net energy
    also followed a similar trend to output energy i.e,. EI recorded higher net energy.
    The highest share of energy consumed was recorded for N fertilizer (39%) which
    is a nonrenewable resource and agrochemicals altogether consumed 46.42% energy
    which was very much percent of input energy in this agro-ecosystems61. Conversely
    EI–INM recorded lower net energy. Energy use efficiency is cultural energy utilized
    through inputs and energy produced as products are calculated. The higher energy
    use efficiency means better utilization of energy. FP revealed higher energy use
    efficiency followed by ecological intensification. Energy efficiency (output-input
    ratio) was 1.48 in Iran61. Whereas lower energy use efficiency was reported in
    EI–INM. Similarly higher energy productivity was also recorded in farmers’ practice
    followed by EI. Specific energy is energy required to produce kg of main product.
    So, it is understood that the lower the specific energy, the better is the treatment.
    Lower specific energy was recorded in Farmers’ practice and was followed by ecological
    intensification treatment. On an average specific energy use was observed as 9.95
    MJ/kg61. Whereas higher specific energy was noticed is EI–Nutrient management.
    In conservation agriculture, energy efficiency was higher63. Figure 3 Average
    energy use efficiency, energy productivity and specific energy transformed in
    different practices. Full size image Energy productivity is defined as the quantity
    of physical output obtained per every unit of input. The higher energy productivity
    indicates for every unit of input energy there is a higher quantity of physical
    output. Lower energy productivity was noticed in EI-Nutrient management. Specific
    energy is energy required to produce kg of main product. So, it is understood
    that the lower the specific energy, the better is the treatment. Lower specific
    energy was recorded in Farmers’ practice and was followed by ecological intensification
    treatment. Whereas higher specific energy was noticed is EI–Nutrient management.
    It was reported higher input energy, output energy and energy balance in higher
    nutrient levels and higher energy use efficiency and energy productivity in lower
    nutrient levels in both maize and wheat crop64. Several workers reported higher
    output energy and net energy return in site specific nutrient management compared
    to farmer practice and RDF due to higher yield levels in precision nutrient management
    practices65,66. It was also found that higher input energy, output energy and
    net energy in higher fertility levels compared to lower fertility levels67. Economic
    analysis of practices The net return was calculated treatment wise by subtracting
    the total cost of cultivation from gross returns and expressed in rupees per hectare
    (Rs. ha−1). Whereas benefit–cost ratio was worked out by dividing gross returns
    from cost of cultivation. To assess the advantage of any production system, it
    is finally the economics of the system which plays a major role in its acceptance
    by the farmers. Net returns obtained in different cultivation practices varied
    significantly. Lower production costs and energy use, and boost income, while
    improving system resilience68,69,70. Reduced tillage systems can aid system yields
    in rice-maize in rotations in Bangladesh71. Each individual year and pooled data
    showed that EI practice recorded significantly more net return (Rs. 76,338, 83,469
    and 82,011 during first, second and third year respectively), and benefit–cost
    ratio (1.8, 3.2 and 2.7 during first, second and third year respectively) (Table
    6). Pooled data showed that EI practice recorded higher net returns (Rs. 86,606/ha).
    The lower net returns were obtained in EI-integrated weed management (Rs. 51,354.7/ha)
    which was on par with FP, EI-recommended irrigation management and EI-integrated
    pest management. Further benefit–cost ratio of different cultivation practices
    varied significantly. In the first year and pooled data showed that the B:C ratio
    was significantly higher FP which was on par with EI-INM and EI-RDM. EI-IWM recorded
    the lowest B:C ratio followed by EI practice. B-C ratio varied year to year among
    the practices depending on yield obtained and cost invested. Similarly, net return
    (Rs.76338 ha−1) was significantly higher in EI compared to the rest of treatments.
    The lowest yield (1916 kg ha−1), net return (Rs. 18,497 ha−1) and B:C ratio was
    obtained in EI minus INM (T4). Similarly, significantly higher chickpea yield
    (797 kg ha−1) was recorded in EI all the years and the lowest was recorded in
    EI minus INM (539 kg ha−1). Furthermore, EI practice showed a greater number of
    secondary branches and pods per plant compared to remaining practices. In cropping
    systems, more than one species is involved, and it becomes very difficult to compare
    the economic produce of different nature. To express the yield advantage, the
    yields of individual crops in a system are converted into equivalent yield based
    on their economic value could be expressed in maize equivalent yield (MEY). Higher
    MEY in a system could be credited to yield advantages attained. Significantly
    more MEY was obtained in was also significantly higher in EI practice in both
    individual years (11,016, 1186, 8852 kg ha−1 during first, second and third year
    respectively) and pooled over three years (10,418 kg ha−1). Whereas EI-INM recorded
    the lowest maize equivalent yield, and it was on par with FP, IWM and IPM during
    individual years and pooled over three years. Tembotrione herbicidal treatments
    had only 0.131-0.201 times of application cost than that under manual weeding
    thrice. Herbicidal treatments resulted in 9.7–13.3 times higher marginal benefit:cost
    ratio over hand weeding thrice72. Conclusion Ecological intensification (EI) practice
    recorded significantly higher grain yield, maize equivalent yield, net return,
    net energy from maize–chickpea sequence cropping system compared to farmers’ practice
    (FP) and other practices which were deficit in one or the other crop management
    practice. Further, EI practice, recorded significant amount of soil organic carbon,
    available plant nutrients and microbial activity after completion of third crop
    sequence indicating linear reduction of carbon footprints by sequestration and
    improving ecological sustainability. Methods Experimental materials A field experiment
    was carried out at the Main Agricultural Research Station (15° 12′ N, 74° 59′
    E), Dharwad, Karnataka, India, for three consecutive years from 2017–2018 to 2019–2020
    for sustainable intensification of climate-smart maize–chickpea cropping system
    in northern transition zone of Karnataka under rain fed condition. The soil at
    the location of the experiment site was a medium black clay with a pH of 7.6 and
    electrical conductivity of 0.35 dS m−1. The soil had a medium level of organic
    carbon (0.51%), as well as medium levels of available nitrogen (296 kg ha−1),
    phosphorus (28 kg ha−1), and potassium (283 kg ha−1). The JG-11 chickpea variety
    and the University''s single cross maize hybrid, GH-150125, were selected as the
    experimental seed materials. Experimental research and field studies on cultivated
    varieties complied with relevant institutional, national, and international guidelines
    and legislation. Climatic condition during cropping years In comparison to the
    average rainfall over the previous 69 years, the three cropping years at the experimental
    location recorded rainfall of 582.8, 892.0, and 1316 mm in 2017, 2018, and 2019,
    respectively (Fig. 4). In each of the 3 years, April witnessed the highest maximum
    temperature (37.7, 36.2, and 37.2 °C in 2017, 2018, and 2019 respectively). Similarly,
    the lowest temperature was13.9, 13.9and 13.0 °C during January month of 2017,
    2018 and 2019 respectively. The mean maximum relative humidity ranged from 90.9%
    during September 2017 to 88.0 during both July 2018 and August 2019. The minimum
    mean relative humidity ranged from 35.1% during February 2017 to 46 and 40% during
    February 2018 and 2019 respectively. Figure 4 Monthly meteorological data during
    cropping years (2017–2019) and the average of 69 years (1950–2019) at Main Agricultural
    Research Station, Dharwad, India. Full size image Treatment details The experiment
    was laid out in randomized block design with three replications consisted of eight
    treatments involving different soil and crop management practices viz., Farmers’
    practice (FP), ecological intensification (EI), EI minus recommended tillage management
    (EI-RTM), EI minus recommended nutrient management (EI-INM), EI minus recommended
    planting density management (EI-RPM), EI minus recommended water management (complete
    rainfed, EI-RIM), EI minus recommended weed management (EI-IWM) and EI minus recommended
    disease and insect management (EI-IPM). Each treatment was on a fixed plot for
    all three years. Treatment details are elaborated in Table 13. Table 13 Description
    of agronomic practices followed for each treatment. Full size table Cultivation
    method The EI treatment comprised all best management practices (BMPs), such as
    mulching the soil with leftover maize and chickpea crop residue and planting maize
    at a specified spacing of 60 cm × 20 cm with 7.5 t/ha of FYM that was spread on
    the field two weeks prior to planting. In furrows that were opened at 5 cm from
    the crop row, the recommended fertilizer dosage of 150:65:65 kg/ha N, P2O, and
    K2O were applied and then covered with soil. At the time of sowing, full doses
    of phosphorus, potassium, and half of the recommended nitrogen were applied. The
    remaining quantity of the nitrogen was top-dressed in two equal portions, the
    first at weeding stage, which corresponds to the knee-high stage, and the second
    dose, which corresponds to the tasseling stage. At 25 days after sowing (DAS),
    tembotrione 120 g a.i./ha was applied post-emergence to control weeds. In the
    first year due to a prolonged dry spell, protective irrigation was given to the
    crop at the flowering stage. Due to an abundance of rain in the two years that
    followed, the soil was sufficiently moist. In the tropics, fall armyworm and turcicum
    leaf blight are the two main pests of maize. Apart from EI-RPM, crop management
    measures were performed in accordance with the prescribed set of practices to
    manage these pests. Succeeding chickpea crop was planted uniformly in all treatment
    plots and recommended fertilizer dose of 50:25:0 kg N, P2O5 and K2O ha−1, respectively
    was applied at the time of planting. Data were recorded on growth and yield attributes
    of both crops by following standard procedures. Maize farmers usually employ conventional
    tillage and establish maize crops manually. Irrigating, fertilizing, weeding,
    and harvesting, with periodic advice by researchers. Inputs such as seeds, fertilizers,
    tillage machinery and herbicides were applied as per the treatment requirement.
    Analysis of available nutrients in the soil At the beginning of the experiment,
    the physico-chemical properties of the soil were examined (Table 14). Soil samples
    were collected after crop harvest and analyzed for available nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium (kg ha−1) using the modified alkaline potassium permanganate method73,
    Olsen''s method74, and neutral normal NH4OAc extractant method)75, respectively.
    The micronutrients, zinc and iron were extracted from soil samples using DTPA
    reagent and measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer76. Soil organic
    carbon was estimated by Walkley and Black’s method77. Table 14 Initial physico-chemical
    properties of experimental soils. Full size table Soil microbial enumeration Freshly
    collected soil samples from each plot were analyzed for total bacterial, fungal,
    and actinomycetes populations using the commonly employed serial dilution plate
    count method with soil extract agar for bacteria78, Martin rose bengal agar for
    fungi79, and Kuster''s agar for actinomycetes80. Plates were cultured in an incubator
    at 28 + 2 °C for 3 to 6 days before colony counts were recorded. Microbial populations
    were expressed as the number of colonies forming units per gram of soil or per
    milliliter (ml) of sewage water. Estimation of enzyme activity in soil The phosphatase
    activity of a soil sample was measured using an established procedure81. One gram
    of soil sample was transferred in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask, followed by 0.2 ml
    toluene and four ml of modified universal buffer (pH 7.5). One milliliter of P-nitrophenol
    phosphate solution prepared in modified universal buffer was added to the flasks,
    and the contents were swirled for 2 min. The flasks were paused and incubated
    for one hour at 37 °C. Following incubation, one milliliter of 0.5 M CaC12 and
    four milliliters of 0.5 M NaOH were added to the flask, stirred, and filtered
    using Whatman No. 42 filter paper. Using a spectrophotometer, the intensity of
    the yellow color obtained was examined at 420 mm in comparison to the blank reagent.
    Phosphatase activity in soil samples was measured in milligrams (mg) of para-nitrophenol
    phosphate. The activity of dehydrogenase in soil samples was evaluated as well
    using the standard procedure82. In test tubes, ten grammes of soil and 0.2 g CaCO3
    were properly mixed and dispensed. One ml of a 3% aqueous solution of 2, 3, 5
    triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TIC) was added to each tube. One ml of 1% glucose
    solution and eight ml of distilled water were used to create a thin film of water
    over the soil layer. Rubber bungs were used for sealing the tubes, that were then
    incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the contents of the tube were washed
    into a small beaker, and a slurry was created by adding 10 ml methanol. Whatman
    No. 50 filter paper was used to filter the slurry. The soil was rinsed with methanol
    many times until the filtrate was red-free. In a volumetric flask, the filtrate
    was pooled and made up to 50 ml with methanol. Using a spectrophotometer, the
    intensity of the red color was determined at 485 nm against a methanol blank.
    The amounts of formazan in soil samples were measured by comparing them to a standard
    curve developed with graded formazan concentrations. The results were expressed
    in mg of triphenyl format. Turcicum leaf blight severity The severity of turcicum
    leaf blight was recorded at the dough stage of crop growth (90–95 days after sowing)
    using modified 0–9 disease rating scale83 on ten randomly selected plants. A further
    per cent disease index was calculated using the following formula84. $${\\text{PDI}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Sum
    \\; of \\;all \\; disease \\;ratings}}{\\mathrm{Total \\; number \\; of \\;plants
    \\;observed}}\\times \\frac{100}{\\mathrm{Maximum \\; disease \\; grade}}$$ Incidence
    of the fall armyworm In each treatment, ten plants were randomly selected and
    observations on the number of larvae per plant were recorded. Further, this data
    was used for calculation of mean larval population per plant by using the following
    formulae. $$\\mathrm{Incidence \\; of \\; larvae \\; per \\; plant}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Number
    \\; of \\; larva}}{\\mathrm{Number \\; of \\; plants \\;observed}}$$ Energetic
    and bio-economic analysis All the agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers,
    labor, animals, electricity, machinery, organic manures etc. and all the agricultural
    outputs such as grain and straw have their own equivalent energy and expressed
    in Mega Joules (Table 15). The energy balance was calculated using the data on
    input energy and output energy. From these, the net energy returns, energy use
    efficiency, energy productivity and specific energy were calculated using the
    following formulae26,85,86,87,88. $${\\text{Net}}\\;{\\text{energy}}\\;{\\text{returns}}\\left(
    {{\\text{MJ}}/{\\text{ha}}} \\right) = {\\text{Output}}\\;{\\text{energy}} - {\\text{input}}\\;{\\text{energy}}$$
    Table 15 Energy equivalents (MJ/unit) used for energy input and output calculations.
    Full size table $$\\mathrm{Energy \\;use \\; efficiency}=\\mathrm{Output \\;energy}({\\text{MJ}}/\\mathrm{ha
    })/\\mathrm{Input \\; energy}({\\text{MJ}}/\\mathrm{ha })$$ $$\\mathrm{Energy
    \\; productivity }\\left(\\mathrm{kg \\; MJ}/{\\text{ha}}\\right)= \\frac{\\mathrm{Output
    \\; energy }({\\text{MJ}}/\\mathrm{ha })}{\\mathrm{Input\\; energy }({\\text{MJ}}/\\mathrm{ha
    })}$$ $$\\mathrm{Specific \\; energy }\\left({\\text{MJ}}/\\mathrm{kg }\\right)=\\frac{\\mathrm{Output
    \\;energy }({\\text{MJ}}/\\mathrm{ha })}{\\mathrm{Input \\;energy }({\\text{MJ}}/\\mathrm{ha
    })}$$ Maize equivalent yield (MEY) was calculated by considering prevailing market
    prices of two crops and expressed in q ha−1. $$\\begin{aligned} {\\text{MEY for
    intercrop }} & = {\\text{ Maize yield }} + [\\{ {\\text{chickpeayield }}({\\text{q}}/{\\text{ha}})
    \\, \\hfill \\\\ & \\quad \\times {\\text{Price of chickpea}}({\\text{Rs}}.{\\text{
    q}}^{{ - {1}}} )\\} \\, \\div {\\text{Maize price }}({\\text{Rs}}.{\\text{ q}}^{{
    - {1}}} )] \\hfill \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ Prices for inputs and outputs for each
    season were monitored by local markets. Fuel use for land preparation, planting,
    and irrigation was quantified31. This information was used for partial budgeting
    and was converted to megajoule (Mj) equivalents for energetic analysis31,89. Net
    income was determined by subtracting all variable costs from the gross returns
    from grain and exported stover or straw. Energy inputs and outputs were computed
    for recycled grain and stover, as well as total biomass exported. Energy use efficiency
    (EUE) was calculated by dividing total output of energy for rice and maize (Mj/ha)
    by total inputs of energy (Mj/unit). Specific energy (SPE) was estimated by dividing
    total energy inputs (Mj/inputs) by grain + stover yield (kg/ha). Subsequently,
    energy productivity (EP) was derived by dividing grain yield (kg/ha) by total
    energy input (Mj/ha). The price of the inputs in rupees (Rs.) at the time of use
    was considered to figure out the cost of cultivation per hectare treatment wise
    and expressed in Rs./ha. For working out the cost of inputs, land preparation,
    inter-cultivation, all applied fertilizers, FYM, seed, plant protection chemicals,
    irrigation, men, and women wages from planting through harvesting, drying, processing,
    and marketing of produce were all included. A gross return per hectare was computed
    by taking into consideration the market price of the commodity after harvest and
    the yield of grain per hectare and was expressed in Rs. per hectare. The net return
    per hectare was calculated treatment wise by subtracting the total cost of cultivation
    from gross return and expressed in Rs./ha. $${\\text{Net return }}\\left( {{\\text{Rs}}./{\\text{ha}}}
    \\right) \\, = {\\text{ Gross return }}\\left( {{\\text{Rs}}./{\\text{ha}}} \\right)
    \\, {-}{\\text{ Cost of cultivation }}\\left( {{\\text{Rs}}./{\\text{ha}}} \\right)$$
    The benefit cost ratio was calculated as follows. $$\\mathrm{Benefit \\; cost
    \\;ratio }\\left({\\text{B}}{-}{\\text{C}}\\right)=\\frac{\\mathrm{Gross \\;retun
    }({\\text{Rs}}./{\\text{ha}})}{\\mathrm{Cost \\;of \\;cultivation }({\\text{Rs}}./{\\text{ha}})}$$
    Weed dynamics Total weed population/m and total weed dry matter was recorded at
    30 and 60 DAS under each treatment in 0.5 m−2 quadrat. Data on weed density and
    weed biomass were transformed using square root transformation. Statistical analysis
    and the interpretation of data The data collected from various parameters on soil
    and plant growth, biochemical, biophysical and yield attributes from field experiment
    at different growth stages were subjected to statistical analysis90. These data
    were subjected to ANOVA (analysis of variance) in accordance with field design
    (Randomized Complete Block Design) using M-Stat package to quantify and evaluate
    the sources of variation. The level of significance used in ‘F’ and ‘T’ test was
    P = 0.05. Critical difference (LSD) values were calculated whenever the ‘F’ test
    was found significant. Data availability All data generated or analyzed during
    this study are included in this publication article. References FAOSTAT. Food

    Article Open access 13 January 2023 Introduction A changing climate has the potential
    to alter the composition and structure of plant and soil communities and the interactions
    between them, so-called plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs)1. However, very little is
    known about the basic mechanisms and the consequences for PSF of climatic events
    such as drought. In particular, most studies have examined the role of soil microbial
    communities in PSF, focusing on examining the effects of those microbes involved
    in positively or negatively influencing plant performance2. Climate change creates
    shifts in microbial communities from bacterial on more humid soils to fungal on
    most dry soils and thus affects plant inputs into the soil subsystem via litter
    and rhizodeposits. As a consequence, the litter quality changes from high to low3,
    while the number of metabolic products that play an important role in the PSF
    relationship is also diminished. It is known that bacteria and their metabolites
    play key roles in soil functioning and interact with plants and trophic chains2.
    One of the key metabolites is γ-polyglutamic acid (PGA), which is produced by
    Lactobacillus strains and is concentrated in the extracellular component of biofilms.
    Biofilms are complex microbial communities that are surrounded in an extracellular
    matrix containing many mucopolysaccharides, peptides, and anionic polyamides,
    whose function is related to the protection of Lactobacillus strains from the
    negative impacts of other bacteria, the maintenance of homeostasis, and the protection
    from external environmental conditions, such as drought stress, temperature changes,
    salinity, or UV radiation. Plants growing in the proximity of these biofilms also
    benefit and can even become bacterially dependent4. In agrocenoses, where many
    natural processes are broken5, crop plants are especially exposed to deficiencies
    in biofilm components. Therefore, in order to overcome this problem, modern agrostrategies
    include the treatment of plants with bacterial strains6 or fermentation products
    such as humic acids. These applications, however, are ineffective in the long
    term because of unfavorable agricultural soil conditions being magnified by chemical
    applications. One of the solutions to this problem is to produce bacterial metabolites
    in high amounts by biofermentation processes and apply them in the field7. A promising
    example of such a strategy is the biotechnological production of PGA in very high
    concentrations due to high bioreactor intensity and the acceleration of metabolic
    processes8,9. PGA is a natural biofilm component, an optically active anionic
    polymer, which exists in two isoforms: α-PGA and γ-PGA. This polymer is built
    with repeating units of D- or L-glutamate connected via amide linkages that are
    formed between the α-amino and α/γ-carboxylic groups. Microorganisms produce three
    types of poly-glutamic acid: D-PGA, L-PGA (which are respectively composed of
    D-glutamate or L-glutamate units), and DL-PGA (in which D- and L-glutamate units
    are randomly connected10). PGA is characterized by its molecular weight, the carboxyl-group
    (α or γ) engaged in the amide bond, and by the ratio of D- to L-glutamic acid
    units8. γ-PGA can protect microorganisms against phagocytic attacks and high salt
    concentrations, while also providing extracellular nutrient storage and promoting
    biofilm formation8. γ-PGA is water soluble, biodegradable, biocompatible, edible,
    and non-toxic to humans and the environment. It has the ability to bind metals
    and absorb water, and its biotechnological production for agricultural applications
    is becoming increasingly profitable. This polymer has many potential applications
    in the fields of pharmaceuticals, water and soil treatment, food, cosmetics, and
    agriculture11,12,13. One of the most important applications of PGA is in agriculture.
    Due to the fact that γ-PGA and especially superabsorbent materials synthesized
    from PGA14 are able to hold a large amount of water, they can be used on crop
    fields as soil conditioners. Many studies have reported that γ-PGA plays an important
    role in plant growth and its regulation; for example, it raises the dry weight
    of plants such as cucumber, Chinese cabbage, spinach, and tomato15,16,17. γ-PGA
    can also be used to bind toxic metal ions and prevent plants from sequestering
    them. Due to its capacity to bind ions, γ-PGA can be used as a fertilizer, which
    delivers to plant rhizospheres cations18 such as Ca2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, and Mn2+.
    PGA can also be used to reduce salt-induced inhibition of plant growth. Under
    salt stress, the accumulation of toxic levels of cellular Na+ and restricted absorption
    of K+ were observed in plant cells. Interestingly, the foliar application of γ-PGA
    was shown to reduce ion-specific toxicity by decreasing the cellular accumulation
    of Na+, while increased K+ accumulation was observed17. In addition, recent studies
    showed that this polymer has beneficial effects on the availability of soil nitrogen,
    phosphorus, and potassium, as well as plant C and N metabolism13. Data from a
    limited number of single model plant species confirmed the acceleration of plant
    growth and increase in crop yield following PGA application. Moreover, γ-PGA stimulated
    plant N uptake and improved N soil availability by enhancing microbial and urease
    activity15,16. It is also known that γ-PGA can increase root biomass15,19 and
    that urease activity depends on PGA metabolites, such as glutamic acid or small
    homopeptides13. A recent experiment on the effect of PGA acceleration on the drought
    tolerance of Brassica napus seedlings confirmed that γ-PGA may induce a tendency
    towards plant tolerance to drought stress by promoting abscisic acid accumulation20.
    In Europe, sandy soils are present mainly in Nordic countries and Baltic states,
    which reflects the glacial history of the continent21. In Poland, more than 60%
    of mineral soils have developed from sandy parent material. Sandy soils naturally
    show low water retention capacity and are prone to drought22. Semi-natural grasslands
    on light soils that are managed as meadows and pastures are especially endangered
    due to climate change23,24, which could result in reduced pastoral farming, crop
    loss25, and biodiversity loss26. Nardus stricta grasslands play an important role
    in supporting the diversity of the agricultural landscape27 and vulnerable plant
    preservation28. The consequences of drought in N. stricta grasslands can be observed
    in adjacent fields, meadows, and forest (broken ecosystem connectivity and metapopulation
    changes of pollinators25 and predators29 in agrocenoses). Therefore, intervention
    strategies aimed at mitigating the consequence of drought events in such ecosystems
    should be developed urgently. The current study provides field experimental data
    which supports the use of γ-PGA in drought stress and proposes its application
    in grassland management. We hypothesize that water treatment combined with PGA
    application to light and sandy soil will reduce drought stress in grasslands more
    effectively than watering alone, by one of following mechanisms: 1. Increase in
    soil macro- and microelements’ availability to grasses and herbaceous plants,
    2. Influence on plant root system development and aboveground biomass production,
    3. Influence on the resprouting capacity of grasses (Nardus stricta) undergoing
    drought stress, 4. Supporting the regeneration of dicotyledons in grasslands.
    Materials and methods Study site The survey was conducted in the vicinity of Staszów,
    Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, Poland (50°35′N 21°11′E, 190 m a.s.l). The experimental
    site was a typical post-pasture grassland, mown irregularly only to sustain open
    areas. The site was surrounded by a mosaic of small arable areas, where mainly
    potatoes and cereals are cultivated. The grassland was classified in the Nardo-Callunetea
    class, with Nardus stricta as the dominant species, with Potentilla erecta, Polygala
    vulgaris, Hieracium pilosella, Luzula campestris, and Rumex acetosella co-domination.
    Thanks to the owners, the 3600 m2 experimental site was fenced to avoid any animal
    activity. The climate of the given region represents the transitional temperate
    zone, classified as Dfb (continental with warm summer) by the Köppen-Geiger system30
    (adjacent to the north-east boundary of a moderately warm climate with uniform
    moisture content, Cfb). The average annual temperature in Staszów is 8.0 °C (− 3.0
    °C in January and 18.3 °C in July). The multiyear average annual rainfall in this
    area is 570 mm. Field experiments were conducted during the drought event of June–August
    2019. A coincidental occurrence of drought and heavy precipitation was observed
    during the spring and summer in the investigated region (Fig. 1). An assessment
    of the occurrence of meteorological drought conditions in consecutive 10-day periods
    before and during the experiment was made on the basis of Selyaninov''s Hydrothermal
    Coefficient, HTC1. During the experiment, four 10-day periods were classified
    as extremely dry (HTC = 0.0–0.25), three periods as very dry or dry (HTC = 0.46–0.82),
    and only one period was moist (HTC = 2.38), due to days with heavy rainfall. Figure

    was loamy sand containing 81% sand, 16% silt, and 3% clay. The soil was highly
    acidic and generally nutrient poor (Table 1); especially low concentrations of
    Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Fe2+/3+ were observed. However, the content of available
    P and Nmin (N-NO3− + N-NH4+) may indicate the application of fertilizers in the
    past. Table 1 Mean, median, and range of the soil parameters in the reference
    experimental plots. Full size table Study design The experiment was carried out
    between 1 June and 15 August 2019. A randomized block design was used in the experiment,
    with three watering blocks replicated eight times and four PGA treatments at various
    concentrations. Eight blocks of 2.25 m2 (1.5 m × 1.5 m) were allocated to one
    of three different watering regimes (24 blocks in total). The spatial distance
    between blocks was greater than 10 m, while the spatial distribution was random.
    In each watering block, four plots of 0.25 m2 (0.5 m × 0.5 m) were allocated to
    different PGA treatments (96 plots in total) (Fig. 2). The mode of watering in
    each PGA treatment plot was the same. Figure 2 Study site design and spatial arrangement
    of 24 watering blocks and four PGA treatments in each block. Description of abbreviations
    in the text. Full size image Blocks The amount of water applied to each watering
    block was calculated on the basis of the water deficit from the multiyear (1991–2018)
    average monthly precipitation for the April–June period. The calculated water
    deficit (the difference between the average monthly precipitation and the April–June
    precipitation) since the beginning of the vegetation season was estimated to be
    approximately 42 L per square meter. A certain percentage of the water deficit
    was covered for each block: (1) RW (reference watering): no watering applied to
    establish very dry conditions, (2) WW (weekly watering): coverage of total (100%)
    calculated water deficit—2 L of water per treatment plot of 0.25 m2—applied weekly
    over a 6-week time period, 3) MW (monthly watering): coverage of 30% of calculated
    water deficit—2 L of water per treatment plot of 0.25 m2, applied twice at the
    beginning of experiment and after 4 weeks. Treatments In each watering block,
    four PGA treatments were employed: (1) PGA0: reference, without PGA application,
    (2) PGA2: PGA concentration 2% (40 mL of PGA per m2), (3) PGA1: PGA concentration
    1% (20 mL of PGA per m2), and (4) PGA0.3: PGA concentration 0.33% (6.6 mL of PGA
    per m2). Commercially available Ambiogel® PGA (Ambioteco, Sztombergi, Poland),
    which contained 5% pure PGA, was applied once on the first day of the experiment.
    Plant functional traits Plant species from abandoned fields were identified to
    species level by Prof. Elżbieta Jędrszczyk (Department of Horticulture, University
    of Agriculture, Krakow, Poland). All collected specimens were not under of law
    restriction or any permission. Voucher specimens were photographed and stored
    in the authors collection. On the last day of the experiment, plant samples (roots
    and shoots) were collected from each treatment plot from eight randomly distributed
    area units using the ring method. Eight random measurements (ring throws) for
    each plot using a ring of a given size (mentioned below), which was adopted as
    the minimum area of the estimated shoot variation, were carried out (768 samples
    in total). The plant''s roots and stems were cut from 12.56 cm2 (measured with
    a loose-leaf ring, 4 cm in diameter) and rinsed gently with distilled water to
    remove soil remnants. The root max length was determined to be the maximum length
    from the root base. The aboveground dry biomass of the dominant grass species,
    N. stricta, was determined using the oven-dried biomass method31. The shoots were
    soaked in distilled water for 4 h and then dried at 80 °C for 24 h. In addition,
    the maximum aboveground plant height (MH) per area unit (4 cm diameter = 12.56
    cm2) was measured as the maximum point reached by the highest plant. Based on
    the measured plant parameters, two indices were calculated: (1) DFR—the ratio
    of dry to fresh shoots of N. stricta. A ring of 1 cm diameter = 0.78 cm2 was randomly
    thrown eight times, and the fresh and dry stems were visually calculated, (2)
    DMR—the ratio of dicotyledons to monocotyledons. The DMR was determined from the
    number of individual specimens per 78.5 cm2 ring size (10 cm diameter) to cover
    variations in the plant abundance. To obtain a random effect, the ring was thrown
    eight times for each treatment plot. Soil analysis Soil samples for laboratory
    analysis were taken from the 0–10 cm layer of each treatment plot as pooled samples
    taken from triplicate samples (96 samples in all). The soil particle size distribution
    was determined by the hydrometer method according to the PN-R-04032 standard (Polish
    Committee for Standardization: Warszawa), while soil pH and electrical conductivity
    (EC) were measured using the potentiometric method with a soil/distilled water
    ratio of 1:5 (v/v). The levels of ammonium (N-NH4+) and nitrate (N-NO3−) nitrogen
    were determined by flow injection colorimetry analysis (FIAstar 5000, Foss), the
    levels of available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) by the Egner-Riehm method,
    the available magnesium (Mg) by the Schachtschabel method. Phosphorus content
    in the solution was determined colorimetrically using UV–Vis spectrophotometer
    (Helios Beta UVB1002 E, Thermo Electron Corporation, Paisley, UK), while potassium
    and magnesium content by atomic absorption spectrometry (Varian SpectrAA-20).
    The level of calcium (Ca) and available microelements (Fe, Mn, and Zn) was determined
    by atomic absorption spectrometry after extraction into 0.03 M CH3COOH. Statistical
    analyses The influence of watering and PGA treatments on the soil and plant parameters
    were compared using two-way ANOVA. The normality of the data was tested using
    the Shapiro–Wilk test. Post-hoc Duncan’s comparisons of the soil parameters were
    performed with a Bonferroni correction. All statistical analysis were performed
    using Statistica v.13 (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Multivariate
    redundancy analysis (RDA) was carried out using non-standardized plant parameters.
    For soil parameters, PGA concentration, and watering (as a dummy variable), forward
    selection was employed to indicate the soil and treatment variables significantly
    describing the plant parameters’ variation. Multivariate statistical analyses
    were carried out using CANOCO software version 4.56. Values were considered to
    be statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05. Results Two-way analysis of variance
    indicated that watering, either as a single parameter or in combination with PGA
    treatment, had no significant effect on soil parameters (Supplement 1). Only the
    PGA, as a single parameter, significantly influenced the soil macro- and microelement
    content and soil pH. The available phosphorus (P) and mineral nitrogen (N-NH4+ + N-NO3−)
    content were significantly enhanced by the presence of PGA with the results varying
    at different concentrations (Fig. 3). The available P content (Fig. 3a) in the
    soil was the highest when the lowest concentration of PGA was applied (PGA0.3).
    A similar pattern was observed for N-NO3− (Fig. 3c). However, the highest N-NH4+
    content was associated with the highest PGA concentration (PGA0.3) (Fig. 3b).
    Surprisingly, the reference (PGA0) content was always approximately at the level
    of the medium PGA concentration (PGA1). Figure 3 Mean comparison of the different
    concentrations of (a) available phosphorus (P), (b) ammonium nitrogen (N-NH4+)
    and (c) nitrate nitrogen (N-NO3−) compounds with respect to PGA treatments by
    Duncan tests (means with the same letter did not show significant differences).
    Full size image The variation in macro- and microelements in the soil is presented
    in Fig. 4. The content of the two divalent base cations in the soil, i.e., Ca2+
    and Mg2+, significantly increased when the PGA was added (Fig. 4). The opposite
    effect was obtained for K+ and Mn2+, their distribution in the soil being decreased
    when PGA was applied. The Zn2+ concentration in the soil was reduced by PGA2 and
    PGA0.3 relative to PGA0, while the Fe2+/3+ content was reduced only at the lowest
    concentration of PGA (PGA0.3). Figure 4 Mean comparison of the different concentrations
    of metal compounds with respect to PGA treatments by Duncan tests (means with
    the same letter did not show significant differences). Full size image High concentrations
    of PGA enhanced the soil pH values, while the lowest PGA concentration was responsible
    for the lowest pH values (Fig. 5a). Electrical conductivity (Fig. 5b), which reflected
    the concentration of soluble salts, was also related to the PGA content. The EC
    increased significantly when the PGA content was lowest. Figure 5 Mean soil pH
    (calculated on the basis of hydrogen ion concentration in mmol dm−3) (a) and electrical
    conductivity (EC) (b) with multiple comparison Duncan test (means with the same
    letter did not show significant differences). Full size image Two-way ANOVA indicated
    that both factors in combination, i.e., watering and PGA concentration, significantly
    influenced plant functional traits under drought stress (Supplement 2). PGA applied
    at low or medium levels (PGA0.3, PGA1) significantly increased the mean root length
    (Fig. 6a) and aboveground biomass of N. stricta (Fig. 6b), as well as the maximum
    shoot height of dicotyledons in the experimental plots (Fig. 6c). The effect of
    watering the blocks, however important, only slightly influenced the N. stricta
    parameters. The mean maximum height of all plants was also significantly stimulated
    by low amounts of PGA, especially PGA1. PGA2 treatment decreased the three parameters
    to levels similar to those observed in the PGA0 plots. In this case, watering
    had only a small effect (F-values more than 10-times lower for watering than for
    PGA treatment (Supplement 2) (Fig. 6c)). Figure 6 Mean and 95% of confidence interval
    values of grassland life traits: (a) Nardus stricta root length and (b) aboveground
    biomass; (c) maximum shoot height of dicotyledons; (d) DFR index; (e) DMR index
    per sample unit. Blue lines—reference watering (RW), green lines—monthly watering
    (MW), red lines—weekly watering (WW). Full size image The regeneration of shoots
    of N. stricta expressed by DFR depended mostly on the PGA treatment (Fig. 6d).
    The watering had no effect on shoot regeneration only with the PGA0.3 concentration,
    where the lowest DFR values indicated the best regeneration of shoots. In the
    case of PGA0 treatment, better shoot regeneration was observed in the WW blocks,
    but in general the watering, even at high amounts, only slightly influenced N.
    stricta regeneration. The watering appeared much more important for dicotyledon
    density expressed as DMR (Fig. 6e). Both parameters, watering and PGA application
    at a low or medium concentration highly enhanced the appearance of dicotyledons,
    whereas in water stress conditions (RW blocks) no beneficial effect on the dicotyledon
    plant density was observed. Redundancy analysis revealed 96.6% of the variance
    of the experimental variables (watering, PGA concentration) for the first ordination
    axis (Fig. 7). The main gradient along the first axis was related to the PGA2
    treatment (r = 0.26) and watering (r = 0.13), while the second gradient, describing
    only 2.8% of the variance, was related to PGA0.3 (r = − 0.20) and PGA1 (r = − 0.18).
    The concentration of PGA2 correlated positively with the content of most of the
    ions in the soil, as well as with pH, while N-NO3− and Zn2+ were related to lower
    concentrations of PGA (PGA0.3 and PGA1). Along the PGA0.3 and PGA1 gradient, some
    plant functional traits such as mean plant height, root max length, and aboveground
    dry biomass also increased, which indicated an improvement in plant growth during
    drought stress. Another plant parameter, DRF, and the K+ content were positively
    related to the PGA0 gradient and negatively to the PGA0.3 and PGA1 gradient. This
    relationship indicated that the application of low doses of PGA (0.3–1%) stimulated
    regeneration of N. stricta shoots and enhanced K+ uptake from the soil. Figure

    size image Discussion Our studies have shown for the first time that drought stress
    effects in grasslands were positively mitigated by the application of specific
    doses of γ-PGA into light soil. We found a positive significant impact of PGA,
    supporting both nutrient management and plant functional traits in grasslands
    affected by drought. In general, the results of the research indicated that for
    reducing the effects of drought on meadow vegetation, the use of a certain concentration
    of PGA was more important than irrigation. We therefore demonstrated the biostimulatory
    effect of PGA in combating drought stress in grassland vegetation. Our results
    confirmed previous hydroponic studies for Brassica napus20 and a pot trial of
    Brassica rapa cultivars13. Drought-induced stress disrupts the uptake and translocation
    of certain nutrients in the whole plant25. The more severe the drought, the more
    limited the flow of water and nutrients becomes, and the more limited is the availability
    of nutrients that can be absorbed by the roots32. The use of PGA can reduce this
    stress, most probably because it behaves as a chelator and biostimulator13,33
    and facilitates the penetration of water and nutrients through the membranes of
    plant cells and the supply of nutrients in conditions of water deficit34,35,36.
    The uptake of most nutrients by plants depends on the water content in the soil37.
    The nitrogen supply of plants is closely related to the availability of water,
    and in drought conditions nitrogen mineralization and mobility are very limited38.
    The major source of plant nitrogen is mineral nitrogen, Nmin, which occurs in
    two main forms (Nmin = N-NH4+ + N-NO3−). Our results indicate that after the application
    of PGA, the concentration of Nmin in the soil generally increased (Fig. 3). In
    the case of PGA2 and PGA1, the Nmin content was at a medium level, while in the
    case of PGA0.3 it increased to a very high level (according to the proposed reference
    values for very light and light soils in Poland)39. N-NH4+ cations are retained
    in the soil by cation exchange, unlike N-NO3−, which can be leached40,41. In the
    case of sandy soils (as in our experiment) characterized by a low cation exchange
    capacity, the addition of PGA played an essential role in the binding of N-NH4+.
    At the highest concentration of PGA2, the N-NH4+ content was the highest. The
    binding of ions, including N-NH4+, is possibly due to the specific structure of
    this anionic biopolymer, which has numerous carboxyl groups in the side chains9.
    Some part of the NH4+ probably resulted from PGA degradation, but we assume that
    it was a negligible amount. Otherwise, the NH4+ content should be strongly dependent
    on the PGA concentration used and higher than in PGA0, but such an effect was
    not observed (Fig. 3b). The role of PGA in the “N-NH4+ turnover pool” was described
    by Liu et al.42, highlighting the regulatory role of PGA, which enables the release
    of ammonium ions during its deficit in plants as well as the binding of any excess.
    Consistent with our findings, the content of mineral forms of nitrogen, as well
    as the total nitrogen in the sandy clay loam soil, increased with an increase
    in the applied PGA dose. Such a trend was also noted in a simplified system by
    Zhang et al.13. In soils, N-NH4+ is transformed into N-NO3− as a result of the
    nitrification process41. Our results following PGA2 treatment demonstrated that
    the nitrification process was twice as slow relative to PGA0, as evidenced by
    the NH4+:NO3− ratio. The mean ratio for the reference treatment was 1.30, while
    for PGA2 it was 2.95. The nitrogen nitrification process was most intense at the
    lowest PGA concentration. The NH4+:NO3− ratios were significantly lower at 0.98
    and 0.65 for PGA1 and PGA0.3, respectively. Similar results related to the retention
    and transitions over time of N-NH4+ and N-NO3− were reported by Zhang et al.43.
    This trend suggests that when higher doses of PGA are applied on light soils,
    it may be possible to retain more N-NH4+ ions and reduce N-NO3− losses due to
    leaching, which is consistent with the results of the studies by Zhang et al.13.
    Due to its chelating properties, PGA forms fully water-soluble salts with K+,
    Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions44. The present study showed an increase in the retention
    of alkaline cations by PGA, which is a positive effect, especially in light soils
    with a low cation exchange capacity. The content of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions was higher
    if higher concentrations of PGA were used. In conditions of water deficit, Mg2+
    is practically physiologically inaccessible to plants45, despite it being essential
    for the development of the root system and adequate root feeding46. Xu et al.47
    showed that the positive effect of PGA on nitrogen metabolism and thus plant growth
    is related to Ca2+ ions. In general, under drought stress, the availability of
    Ca2+ to plants decreases, but only slightly compared to available P and K+45.
    The availability of P for plants and its accumulation in biomass decreases even
    under moderate drought conditions38. In the current study, a similar tendency
    of available P accumulation in the soil was observed when using different PGA
    concentrations, as in the case of Ca2+ and Mg2+. In turn, Zhang et al.13 and Xue
    and Zhang48 found a decrease in the available P content in the soil after the
    application of PGA, which was associated with microbial immobilization. In the
    case of sandy soils (as in our experiment), microbial biomass (C and N) is lower
    compared to silty or clayey soils49, hence a higher content of available P after
    using PGA compared to PGA0, especially when using lower concentrations. The K+
    content in soil, however, was different. The highest K+ content was found in PGA0,
    while in the case of PGA application, its content in the soil decreased with decreasing
    PGA concentration, which proves its most intense uptake at lower PGA concentrations.
    K plays a very important role in the context of plant resistance to the effects
    of drought stress, as it is responsible for regulating osmotic pressure and maintaining
    the turgor of plant cells50. Its mobility, and thus bioavailability, decreases
    as the water content of the soil decreases45. Zhang et al.43 did not observe any
    effect of the application of the PGA additive on the available potassium content
    under watering conditions. In turn, the obtained results suggest that under stress
    conditions, the addition of PGA (probably the higher the concentration of PGA,
    the more potassium ions were bound) increased the potassium uptake by plants.
    This proves the importance of PGA in reducing the effects of drought stress in
    plants. The use of PGA also increased the uptake of Mn2+ and Zn2+ (apart from
    the PGA1 concentration), as evidenced by lower concentrations of these ions compared
    to PGA0. Zn uptake is well illustrated by the RDA diagram, where its concentration
    is related to good N-NO3− supply51. Also, the availability of Fe and its uptake
    by plants could be more closely related to the intensity of N-NO3− and H+ ion
    uptake, which leads to an increase in the reaction in the root zone and a reduction
    in iron availability52. The increase in the pH value in relation to PGA0 at PGA2
    (also PGA1) can be associated with: (1) increased content of calcium and magnesium
    ions, or (2) increased uptake of N-NO3−, which leads to an increase in the reaction
    in the rhizosphere because H+ is transported along with NO3−. An increase in pH
    values by 0.1 to 0.2 units was also observed by Zhang et al.43. On the other hand,
    at PGA0.3, the pH dropped slightly below the value for PGA0, which may have been
    the result of the most intensive oxidation of N-NH4+ to N-NO3− taking place at
    this concentration, during which hydrogen ions are released, which promotes acidification41.
    The water content and its availability in the substrate determine the rate of
    nutrient supply to plants during their life cycle. Drought stress is a key factor
    limiting root size growth, which in turn affects nutrient uptake38. Since the
    roots are the main system that allows water to be taken from the soil, the rate
    of their growth, their degree of compaction, and the size they reach are of fundamental
    importance for plant tolerance of drought stress53. The architecture of the root
    system is closely related to the distribution of moisture and nutrients in the
    soil profile. The development of long roots is related to the plant''s adaptation
    to drought conditions by its uptake of water available deeper in the profile54
    and nutrients, such as nitrogen, that are leached to deeper layers55. The size
    of the root system is the main factor limiting the uptake of P and Ca in particular,
    and to a lesser extent NO3− and K+32. The application of PGA has a positive effect
    on the length and activity of plant roots43,56. The results of our experiments
    indicate that PGA stimulates the growth of the rhizosphere. The lowest concentration
    of PGA (PGA0.3) stimulated the growth of roots, as well as being responsible for
    a significant concentration decrease for potassium in the soil. Potassium is essential
    for root cell proliferation in drought conditions, which accelerates root elongation50.
    Due to the better development of the root system, the plant’s supply of nutrients
    and water also improved. This resulted in an increase in the yield of dry aboveground
    biomass and a smaller amount of dried plants compared to fresh plants, the best
    results being obtained with the use of the lowest concentration of PGA (PGA0.3).
    In general, the better development of vegetation with the use of PGA0.3 was associated
    with the lowest levels of the available forms of most macro- and micronutrients
    in the soil (except N-NO3−) (Fig. 7), which may be due to the more efficient uptake
    of nutrients at the lowest PGA concentration used. At higher PGA concentrations,
    the effect of viscosity on the ion exchange between salt particles and soil solution,
    and thus on the availability of nutrients, may be important. It was surprising
    that watering had no effect on soil parameters under conditions of drought stress
    and only a slight effect on plant parameters. Sandy soils exhibit a high filtration
    index57, and even when watering was carried out with different PGA concentrations,
    no positive effect was noted. The only exception was the increase in the share
    of dicotyledonous plants in the plots studied, their survival and germination
    on PGA plots being further enhanced by watering. Drought stress is also responsible
    for the reduction in growth of perennials in agricultural and seminatural habitats58,59,60.
    Drought immobilizes the seeds in the soil as a survival adaptation to drought
    stress61. As a consequence, prolonged drought events influence negatively on plant
    diversity, ecosystem functioning, and the available resources for pollinators25,26.
    In our studies, a low concentration of PGA increased the DMR. This parameter was
    also accelerated by the watering conditions. These results indicate that PGA accelerates
    the dicotyledons’ growth, but it is necessary to water during the growing season,
    and even giving 30% of the calculated water deficit for a given month in a multi-year
    period increased the DMR. PGA is a biopolymer that is produced by bacteria as
    a biofilm component in artificial conditions, but should be treated as a natural
    element of ecosystems25,62. Its presence in agrosystems is reduced due to the
    elimination of many bacterial strains during agricultural activities and soil
    changes63. Artificial supplementation of PGA into agroecosystems is beneficial
    for crops13,51, but it has not been previously applied to grasslands. We showed
    that precise amounts of PGA enhance plant growth and the regeneration of shoots
    during drought periods. We do not believe that it directly holds water as a hydrogel,
    but it can be regarded as an effective biostimulator64, helping the plant to grow
    and survive through dry periods. These data are preliminary and studies should
    be continued using different soil conditions and also on intensively managed grasslands,
    as well as those of conservation value. Conclusions The results of our field experiment
    combining watering and the application of different concentrations of γ-PGA to
    grassland during a period of drought clearly showed that PGA acts as biostimulant,
    alleviating the effects of stress in plants. The biostimulation effect of PGA
    consisted in increasing the availability of ions, especially K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Fe2+/3+,
    Ca2+, Mg2+, and mineral forms of nitrogen (N-NH4+ and N-NO3−), elongating plant
    roots, and increasing the aboveground biomass, as well as improving the resprouting
    capacity of the dominant grass, N. stricta, and the regeneration of dicotyledons.
    In the case of meadows on sandy soils, the use of low PGA concentrations (0.3%
    or 1%) was the most beneficial for both the availability of macro- and microelements
    and for plant functional traits. Irrigation had a greater effect than using PGA
    only for the dicotyledon to monocotyledon ratio (DMR). Again, it was most advantageous
    to use the lowest concentration of PGA, but in combination with watering. On the
    basis of the obtained results, we recommend using a PGA concentration in the range
    of 0.3–1% to manage grassland on light soils. PGA in the given doses is a promising
    treatment, which protects grassland ecosystems from drought stress. Data availability

    and rice growth Article Open access 29 September 2022 Introduction Substrate cultures
    are widely used for protected cultivation because of their multiple advantages
    over soil cultivation1,2,3,4. Over the last decade, substrate culture has expanded
    rapidly in China5,6. Irrigation management of substrate cultures is of great importance
    because irrigation is the only source of water required by crops and the water-holding
    capacity of the substrate is very low3,7,8. In practice, most irrigation is managed
    based on the experiences of growers and advisors. Timer-based methods are commonly
    used in the irrigation management of substrate cultures in solar greenhouses in
    China. This can easily lead to plants suffering from water stress caused by inadequate
    irrigation, or roots suffering from hypoxia due to excessive irrigation, adversely
    affecting plant growth and fruit production2,3,9. Noncirculating systems are more
    commonly used for irrigation in coconut coir cultures because of the difficulty
    in filtration and disinfection of the discharge liquid10. Excessive irrigation
    also results in the wastage of water and fertilizer and causes environmental pollution,
    which increases the pressure on water scarcity and environmental protection. Therefore,
    precise irrigation scheduling for coconut coir cultivation in solar greenhouses
    is urgently required owing to its potential to promote yield, decrease water used
    for irrigation, and improve water-use efficiency. Preparing an irrigation schedule
    involves determining when (irrigation frequency) and how much to irrigate (irrigation
    amount)11,12. Irrigation frequency is related to the climate and crop development
    stage. The irrigation amount includes the water required to maintain maximum rates
    of crop transpiration without water stress and an additional amount to manage
    substrate salinity and deal with application uniformity7,12. However, existing
    studies on the effects of irrigation frequency on crop production are inconclusive11.
    The measurements of substrates, atmospheric variables, and plants closely related
    to crop transpiration can directly help make decisions or provide information
    for calculating the irrigation frequency and amount13. In recent years, the most
    commonly researched approaches for irrigation include 1) the use of soil/substrate
    moisture sensors4,14,15, 2) the estimation of crop water requirements based on
    climatic data2,8,16, and 3) the use of weighing lysimeters17,18,19 or plant sensors10.
    Soil moisture sensors can be read with continuous automatic data collection to
    obtain detailed information on the dynamics of water use by crops, which can be
    used to manage irrigation9,20,21. The simplest method is to compare the values
    of the soil moisture sensor with the selected lower and upper limits of soil moisture
    to initiate and stop irrigation9,12.The appliance of dielectric sensors in substrate
    has been documented by many research7,12,22,23,24. Capacitive or frequency-domain
    reflectance (FDR)-based moisture sensors have the advantages of low cost, good
    reliability, and easy maintenance, and are widely used in research applications
    and commercial cultivation irrigation management7,9,25. Moreover, the approaches
    for irrigation using climatic data are based on energy balance and bring water
    supply more closely match to crop transpiration. The accumulated radiation method,
    which initiates irrigation based on measurements of the integral of solar radiation
    over the canopy, is a relatively easy approach based on climatic data2,23.The
    method is commonly used in greenhouses in the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey and
    in substrate cultivation of glass greenhouse in China2,7,12,26.The crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) estimated from ETc = ETo \\(\\times\\) Kc, where ETo is the reference crop
    evapotranspiration estimated by the Penman-Monteith method and Kc is the crop
    coefficient, is important to correctly quantify crop irrigation requirements27.Many
    commercial weather stations provide precise and real-time environmental data on
    a scale of hours or even minutes. These data are consistent with the requirements
    for hourly ETo calculation12,28.The irrigation scheduling by estimating ETc using
    the hourly PM-ETo equation, which provides numerous small irrigations each day,
    is a more scientific method based on climate parameters for substrate culture.
    However,The response of plant transpiration rate to solar radiation may vary with
    variations in crop species, developmental stages, and the environment29,30,31.The
    accumulated radiation threshold for triggering irrigation or irrigation amount
    should be adjusted for specific application scenarios2,10,26.The three constant
    Kc values of the standard FAO method, each for a fixed developmental stage, are
    unsuitable for greenhouse-grown crops because of variability in crop training
    systems and management practices, planting dates, length of the cropping cycle,
    plant density, and cultivars7,12,15,32. Using the three constant Kc values of
    the standard FAO method to estimate ETc may impact the accuracy of irrigation
    amount. Therefore, to enhance irrigation management for coconut coir cultivation
    in solar greenhouses, it is necessary to improve irrigation schedules. The integration
    of meteorological parameters and soil moisture sensors allows for the estimation
    of irrigation levels using energy balance in combination with site-specific adaptive
    responses to sensors15,33.In substrate cultivation, the amount of irrigation and
    discharge can be easily measured manually or automatically. The ETc can be calculated
    using the water balance formula and used to divide by ETo to obtain the actual
    Kc, which can improve the accuracy of crop evapotranspiration estimation for precise
    irrigation. Therefore, we developed two irrigation schedules. One is a composite
    irrigation system that combines accumulated radiation and soil moisture sensors
    (Rn-VWC), and the other is an improved method based on estimating ETc using the
    hourly PM-ETo equation with an improved calculation of Kc values (T-ETc). Furthermore,
    the soil moisture sensor-based method (T-VWC)34, developed in our previous work,
    was used as a reference. The analysis included irrigation, evapotranspiration,
    substrate water content, growth and yield characteristics, and IWP. The goal is
    to establish a precise irrigation schedule for coconut coir cultivation in solar
    greenhouses to ensure cucumber yield and improve IWP in China. Methods Experimental
    conditions This research was carried out at the Xiaotangshan National Precision
    Agriculture Experiment Station in Beijing, China (40\\(^{\\circ }\\)10’43” N,
    116\\(^{\\circ }\\)26’39” E) from March 15 to June 19, 2017. The experimental
    greenhouse was 28 m long and 7.5 m wide, with a wall made of brick-concrete and
    brackets constructed with welded galvanized steel pipes and covered with a transparent
    plastic film. To avoid excessive temperatures within the structure, the greenhouse
    was screened with a 50% shading net from 10:00 to 15:00 on sunny days from May
    16 to June 19. The H-type substrate cultivation system was 500 cm long, 24 cm
    wide, and 40 cm high and was equipped with a cultivation tank with a hole for
    drainage at the end (Fig. 1(5)). A bucket was connected to the hold via a plastic
    hose to collect the discharged water. Coconut coir slabs [ 100 cm (length) \\(\\times\\)
    20 cm (wide) \\(\\times\\) 8 cm (height)] were composed of 70% coconut chunks
    (10–20 mm) and 30% coconut bran (0-6 mm) with EC \\(< 1.00\\) mS cm\\(^{-1}\\)
    and pH 5.8–6.8. The bulk density, porosity air-water ratio, and organic matter
    of the coconut coir slab were 0.14 g cm\\(^{-3}\\), 87.89%, 0.26, and 86.4%, respectively.
    Coconut coir slabs were wrapped with a polyethylene (PE) film on six sides to
    avoid the evaporation of substrate water. Irrigation was controlled using an automatic
    fertigation applicator developed by the Intelligent Equipment Research Center
    of the Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences34. Yamazaki cucumber
    nutrient solution formula was used in this study and was applied using a drip
    irrigation system with in-line emitters of 2 L h\\(^{-1}\\) discharge. The emitter
    distance was 25 cm and was associated with a single row of plants. The cucumber
    variety used in the experiment was “Zhongnong 26”, and cucumbers were transplanted
    on March 15 and harvested from April 19 to June 19. Cucumbers were arranged in
    two rows for each cultivation system, and 10 plants were planted in each row at
    a planting density of 3 plants m\\(^{-2}\\). Experimental design Two irrigation
    schedules were developed: a complex irrigation schedule combining accumulated
    radiation and soil moisture sensors (Rn-VWC) and another irrigation schedule based
    on estimating ETc by the hourly PM-ETo equation with an improved calculation of
    Kc values (T-ETc). The soil moisture sensor-based method (T-VWC)34, which was
    developed in our previous research and significantly reduces irrigation amount
    and improves IWP compared with Timer-based scheduling, was used as a reference.
    In the T-VWC treatment, irrigation frequency and amount were determined hourly
    from 7:00 to 18:00. Irrigation was triggered when the value recorded by the soil
    moisture sensor was lower than the maximum substrate water content (\\(VWC_{max}\\),
    m\\(^{3}\\) m\\(^{-3}\\)). The amount of irrigation was determined by the substrate
    water content read by the sensor (VWC, m\\(^{3}\\) m\\(^{-3}\\)).In Rn-VWC treatment,
    every irrigation event was initiated when the accumulative radiation reached 0.8
    MJ m\\(^{-2}\\), and the calculation of irrigation amount was consistent with
    T-VWC. The irrigation amount of the T-ETc treatment was dependent on the hourly
    ETc (\\(ETc_{h}\\)) calculated by multiplying Kc by the hourly ETo (\\(ETo_{h}\\)),
    where \\(ETo_{h}\\) was estimated using the standardized reference evapotranspiration
    equation (ASCE-PM)28, and Kc was obtained from the daily actual evapotranspiration
    (\\(ET_{d}\\)) and daily ETo (\\(ETo_{d}\\)) of the previous day. Irrigation was
    triggered when \\(ETc_{h}\\) reached or exceeded 0.4 mm to avoid a small amount
    for a single irrigation; otherwise, irrigation was not performed temporarily,
    and this \\(ETc_{h}\\) was accumulated into the next time. Furthermore, the coefficient
    k was incorporated to aid in determining the irrigation amount to ensure proper
    drainage for managing substrate salinity. The value of k was determined based
    on the variance between the electrical conductivity (EC) of irrigation and drainage.2,35,36.
    Descriptions of the three irrigation schedules were presented in Table 1. \\(M_1\\)
    in Table 1 was the calculated irrigation amount used for the actual irrigation
    amount (Ir) of the T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments,and could be described as follows:
    $$\\begin{aligned} M_1 = 0.001 (VWC_{max} - VWC) V p/\\eta \\end{aligned}$$ (1)
    where \\(VWC_{max}\\) is 0.507 (m\\(^{3}\\) m\\(^{-3}\\)), V is the volume of
    the substrate to be irrigated (m\\(^{3}\\)), p is the wetting ratio of the substrate,
    \\(\\eta\\) is the irrigation efficiency.In substrate cultivation, the small volume
    of the substrate is distributed by the root system of the crop, requiring complete
    wetting through irrigation. Therefore, p in this study was 100%. The nutrient
    solution was delivered to the substrate without any loss, \\(\\eta\\) was set
    at 1.0. s in Table 1 was the area of the cultivation plot (m\\(^{2}\\)). The \\(ETc_{h}\\)
    was determined using Eq. (2). $$\\begin{aligned} ETc_{h}=K_c ETo_{h} \\end{aligned}$$
    (2) where \\(K_c\\) can be obtained with an improved calculation as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}
    K_c=ET_{d}/ETo_{d} \\end{aligned}$$ (3) The ET was the actual evapotranspiration
    calculated by the water balance method37. The change in substrate water content
    was too small to be neglected compared to the evapotranspiration and runoff did
    not occur. Therefore, The ET and \\(ET_{d}\\) in Ep.3 were determined using Eqs.
    (4) and (5),respectively. $$\\begin{aligned} ET=(Ir-D)/s \\end{aligned}$$ (4)
    where s is the area of the cultivation plot (m\\(^{2}\\)), Ir is the amount of
    irrigation (L), and D is the amount of discharge (L). $$\\begin{aligned} ET_{d}=(Ir_{d}-D_d)/s
    \\end{aligned}$$ (5) where \\(Ir_d\\) is the daily amount of irrigation (L), and
    \\(D_d\\) is the daily amount of discharge (L). Because coconut coir slabs were
    wrapped with PE film on six sides to avoid the evaporation of substrate water,
    it was considered that the actual evapotranspiration (ET) was equal to the transpiration
    of cucumber plants in this study. The three irrigation schedules were programmed
    and imported into the operating system of the automatic fertigation system and
    started at the first cucumber fruit site (April 14), and The Timer-based method
    (0.02 L plant\\(^{-1}\\) h\\(^{-1}\\)) was applied before. The treatments were
    arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replicates per treatment.
    One H-type cultivation system was a replicate equipped with a branch pipe connected
    to the main pipe through an electric valve and a high-precision flowmeter, which
    was used to ensure independent irrigation of each cultivation system. At the center
    of each cultivation system, an EC-5 sensor (METER Group, Inc., USA) was installed
    between the two plants in the coconut coir slabs to measure the substrate water
    content. The EC of the irrigation and discharge nutrient solutions were measured
    using electrical conductivity (EC) sensors. The amounts of irrigation and discharge
    were measured using high-precision flow meters and water lever sensors installed
    in the discharge collection bucket, respectively. Irrigation frequency was obtained
    by recording the opening and closing of the electric valves. All the electric
    valves, high-precision flow meters, and sensors were connected to an automatic
    fertigation system. The schematic diagram of the experimental set-up is shown
    in Fig. 1. The VWC, EC, and water level data from the sensors were collected every
    5 s. Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the experimental set-up: (1) ressure-regulated

    The solar radiation, temperature, and relative humidity were measured every 5

    (PTS-3) developed by Jinzhou Sunshine Meteorological Science Co., Ltd., China.
    Table 1 Treatments for the three irrigation schedules. Full size table The leaf
    was marked at the beginning of its expansion, and its area was calculated by measuring
    the length and width38. Stem diameter 1 cm below the marked leaf was measured
    with a vernier caliper. The fruits were harvested when they reached normal size.
    The yield and number of cucumbers from each cultivation system were determined
    at the beginning (April 19 to April 30), middle (May 1 to June 5) and end (June
    6 to June 19) of the harvest, and the mean fruit weight and total yield were calculated.
    The soluble protein, soluble sugar, vitamin C, and NO\\(_3^{-}\\)-N contents of
    five fruits per replicate were measured at mid-harvest to compare fruit quality39.
    Drainage rate (DR) and IWP (fresh weight/irrigation amount) were also calculated
    with Eqs. (6) and (7),(respectively. $$\\begin{aligned} DR= & {} D/Ir \\end{aligned}$$
    (6) $$\\begin{aligned} IWP=Y/I \\end{aligned}$$ (7) where Y is total yield (t

    Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted by one-way analysis of
    variance (ANOVA), using SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).The differences
    among mean values were established by Duncan’s multiple range test at P \\(< 0.05\\).
    Results and analysis Irrigation, evapotranspiration, and drainage at harvest of
    cucumber The dates related to the daily irrigation and evapotranspiration, and
    drainage of the three irrigation schedules during harvest were listed in Table
    2.The daily number of irrigation events varied according to irrigation scheduling,
    and the highest and lowest were recorded at 14 and 5 times at the beginning and
    end of harvest, respectively, for the Rn-VWC treatment.The daily number of irrigation
    under the T-VWC and T-ETc treatments were 12 times and 9-10 times. The daily amount
    of irrigation (\\(Ir_{d}\\)) was recorded as 1.70–2.00 L plant\\(^{-1}\\), 0.85–2.03
    L plant\\(^{-1}\\), and 1.12–1.41 L plant\\(^{-1}\\) in the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and
    T-ETc treatments, respectively. Similar to the irrigation events, the highest
    and lowest \\(Ir_{d}\\) were recorded at the beginning and end of the harvest,
    respectively, in the Rn-VWC treatment, and the difference between the three stages
    of the harvest was small in the T-VWC and T-ETc treatments. At the beginning and
    middle of harvest, \\(Ir_{d}\\) in the T-ETc treatment was lower than that in
    the other treatments. Table 2 The effect of irrigation scheduling on the daily
    number and amount of irrigation together with evapotranspiration and drainage
    rate at the beginning, middle and end of harvest. Full size table Because irrigation
    is the only source of water for cucumber plants, the daily evapotranspiration
    (\\(ET_{d}\\)) were very similar to the irrigation. The maximum and minimum \\(ET_{d}\\)
    were 4.66 and 1.91 mm, at the beginning and end of the harvest in Rn-VWC treatment,
    respectively. Moreover, the T-ETc treatment had the lowest \\(ET_{d}\\) at the
    beginning and middle of harvest, with figures for 2.17 and 2.94 mm, respectively,
    and at the end of harvest was lower than that in the T-VWC treatment. The daily
    drainage (\\(D_d\\)) under the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and T-ETc treatments during the
    experiment ranged from 0.34-0.43 L plant\\(^{-1}\\)),0.18-0.40 L plant\\(^{-1}\\)),0.26-0.50
    L plant\\(^{-1}\\)), respectively.Thus,the drainage rate (DR) was within an appropriate
    range and was calculated as 17.49–33.48%, 19.57–24.47%, and 19.95–35.83%, respectively.
    The differences in DR among the different treatments at the beginning and end
    of harvest were the smallest and the largest, respectively. Irrigation, evapotranspiration,
    and substrate water content under different weather conditions The solar radiation,
    air temperature, and relative humidity Of different weather conditions The solar
    radiation, air temperature, and relative humidity inside the greenhouse on April
    26 (sunny), May 3 (cloudy), and May 24 (sunny and shading screens used) are plotted
    in Fig. 2. The daily solar radiation in these three days was 15.45 MJ m\\(^{-2}\\),
    3.98 MJ m\\(^{-2}\\), and 7.56 MJ m\\(^{-2}\\), respectively, and the mean air
    temperature and relative humidity were 20.38 \\(^{\\circ }\\) C, 22.08 \\(^{\\circ
    }\\) C, and 23.40 \\(^{\\circ }\\) C and 52.51%, 46.10%, and 54.16%, respectively.
    The maximum values of solar radiation and air temperature on April 26 and May
    24 reached 691 J m\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) and 37.12 \\(^{\\circ }\\) C and 322
    J m\\(^{-2}\\) s\\(^{-1}\\) and 34.02 \\(^{\\circ }\\) C, respectively, indicating
    that the use of shading screens on May 24 effectively reduced the solar radiation
    inside the green-house and kept the maximum air temperature within 35 \\(^{\\circ

    and shading screens used). Irrigation and evapotranspiration under different weather
    conditions The irrigation frequency of T-VWC and T-ETc treatments was determined
    using Timer (7:00–18:00) and had the auxiliary condition of “ETc \\(\\ge\\) 0.4
    mm for starting irrigation” under the T-ETc treatment. Figure 3 shown that the
    irrigation events in the T-ETc treatment were 8, 4, and 11 times, which were less
    than that in the T-VWC treatment (12 times). For the Rn-VWC treatment based on
    accumulated radiation to determine the irrigation frequency, the irrigation period
    was shortened with an increase in solar radiation. On April 26 (sunny), the irrigation
    frequency from 10:00 to 15:00 was significantly higher than that during other
    periods, and had the maximum number of irrigation events with 15 times; the minimum
    number of irrigation events was four times, recorded on May 3 (cloudy). Owing
    to the amount of irrigation (Ir) based on the soil moisture sensor, the T-VWC
    and Rn-VWC treatments had the largest amount for the first daily irrigation event
    (Fig. 3). This might be because the root system absorbed water from the substrate
    for plant transpiration and metabolism, and no irrigation occurred at night, which
    led to a decrease in substrate water content. The fluctuations in the amounts
    between other irrigation events were small. The Ir of the T-ETc treatment was
    0.10 L plant\\(^{-1}\\) on April 26 and May 3, and showed a single peak curve
    similar to radiation and temperature on May 24, with a maximum value of 0.20 L
    plant\\(^{-1}\\). The ET values for the three irrigation schedules were shown
    in Fig. 3. Daily variations in ET were analyzed. The ET of the T-VWC and Rn-VWC
    treatments were higher in the first irrigation cycle, which might be related to
    a higher amount of irrigation. The ET in the T-VWC treatment gradually decreased
    in the afternoon, which differed from the variation in irrigation amount. However,
    the daily variation of ET was consistent with that of irrigation amount in the
    T-ETc treatment. Additionally, both the ET of the T-VWC treatment on May 3 (cloudy)
    and the ET of the T-ETc treatment on May 24 (sunny with shading screens used)
    were significantly lower than their irrigation amount, resulting in a high DR
    (40.75% and 40.88%, respectively). The Rn-VWC treatment had a similar effect on
    two sunny days. This suggests that the T-VWC treatment on cloudy day, the Rn-VWC
    treatment on sunny day, and the T-ETc treatment on sunny day with shading screens
    used were over-irrigated. Figure 3 Irrigation and discharge amount together with
    evapotranspiration under different irrigation schedules. T-VWC: the soil moisture

    (sunny and shading screens used). Full size image Substrate water content under
    different weather conditions The changes in substrate water content under different
    irrigation schedules were shown in Fig. 4. The substrate water content in the
    T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments were always lower than the maximum substrate water
    content during the experiment. Because the low indoor light radiation on May 3
    and 24 increased the irrigation interval, and the strong indoor light radiation
    on April 26 led to frequent irrigation, the substrate water content of the Rn-VWC
    treatment had the largest fluctuation. The substrate water content of the T-ETc
    treatment was relatively stable, which might be because the irrigation supply
    tended to synchronize with evapotranspiration. In addition, there was a significant
    increase in the substrate moisture content of the T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments
    on April 26 and the T-ETc treatment on May 24, which might be due to excessive
    irrigation. Figure 4 The substrate water content diurnal curves under different

    on plant growth of cucumber As shown in Fig. 5, the plant height and the number
    of leaves increased continuously from April 17 to June 1. The area of the marked
    leaves and stem diameter below the marked leaf increased rapidly at the beginning
    of the measurement period, after April 31 it increased slowly. The height, number
    of leaves, leaf area, and stem diameter of the T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments were
    higher than those of the T-ETc treatment, and the differences of the height and
    the number of leaves after April 31 and the leaf area after April 25 were more
    obvious. But there was no difference between the T-VWC and Rn-VWC treatments.

    3 listed the cucumber number, mean weight, and yield of the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and
    T-ETc treatments at each harvesting stage. There were not significantly different
    except that the mean weight of fruit in the T-ETc treatment at the last fruit
    stage was significantly higher than that in the Rn-VWC treatment (P \\(< 0.05\\)).
    Because the number, mean weight, and yield in the Rn-VWC treatment were the lowest
    at all harvest stages, its total yield (58.98 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) was lower than
    that of the T-VWC (66.77 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) and T-ETc (64.54 t ha\\(^{-1}\\)) treatments
    (Table 3). The T-VWC treatment had the highest total yield but the difference
    between the three treatments did not reach a significant level (P \\(< 0.05\\)).

    Full size table Total irrigation amount and irrigation water productivity The
    Total irrigation amount (I) determined for the treatments with different irrigation
    schedules were summarized in Fig. 6 (a). The I under the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and T-ETc
    treatments were 3,901.92 m\\(^{3}\\) ha\\(^{-1}\\), 2897.15 m\\(^{3}\\) ha\\(^{-1}\\),
    and 2573.88 m\\(^{3}\\) ha\\(^{-1}\\), respectively. The T-VWC and T-ETc treatment
    had the highest and the lowest values. Compared with the T-VWC treatment, I for
    the Rn-VWC and T-ETc treatments significantly decreased by 25.75% and 34.04%,
    respectively, and there was significant difference between the T-VWC and T-ETc
    treatments (P \\(<0.05\\)). As shown in Fig. 6b, the irrigation water productivity
    (IWP) under the T-VWC, Rn-VWC, and T-ETc treatments were 17.37 kg m−3, 20.52 kg
    m−3, 25.07 kg m−3, respectively. Compared with the T-VWC treatment, the IWP under
    the Rn-VWC and T-ETc treatments increased by 18.13% and 44.33%, respectively.
    The T-ETc treatment had the highest IWP. Moreover, there was a significant difference
    between T-ETc treatment and T-VWC treatment (P \\(< 0.05\\)). This was linked
    to the calculation of irrigation amount based on the estimation of ETc in the
    T-ETc treatment, which resulted in no loss of yield, but a significant decrease
    in irrigation and evapotranspiration. Figure 6 Total irrigation amount and irrigation

    scheduling on irrigation Scientific irrigation scheduling is needed to synchronize
    the supply with the real water requirements of substrate-cultivated crops and
    to maintain an appropriate substrate water content and DR to protect the crop
    from water and salt stress. The DR was generally 15–30% and it could increase
    to 30–35% if necessary2,36. In addition, owing to the limited volume and low water
    retention of the substrate, irrigation needed to be small and frequent to ensure
    good plant growth. The results of this study shown that the daily irrigation frequency
    under the T-VWC and T-ETc treatments was 12 times and 9–10 times, the Ir was 1.70–2.00
    L plant\\(^{-1}\\) and 1.12–1.41 L plant\\(^{-1}\\), and the DR was 17.49–33.48%
    and 19.95–35.83%, respectively. The irrigation frequency under the Rn-VWC treatment
    decreased with the weakening of solar radiation while increased with the strengthening
    of solar radiation in the greenhouse (Fig. 3). This led to a high amount of irrigation
    at the beginning of the harvest period (Table 2), a decrease in irrigation at
    the middle and end of the harvest period (Table 2) and a large fluctuation in
    the water content of the substrate (Fig. 4), which is consistent with the results
    of Wei et al26. Compared with the Rn-VWC treatment, the T-VWC and T-ETc treatments
    provided more suitable irrigation management for cucumbers in coconut coir culture.
    As the coconut coir slab is a coarse substrate with high porosity, finger flow
    is easily formed under drip irrigation, which reduces the water content of the
    substrate at a distance from the emitter or the time lag to reach the same water
    content4,24.Moreover, the soil moisture sensor represents a “point measurement”
    in space4,11,20. The placement of soil moisture sensor directly affects the efficiency
    of irrigation scheduling4. the T-VWC treatment had a higher daily irrigation amount
    (Table 2) and fluctuations in substrate water content (Fig. 4) than the T-ETc
    treatment. These might be related to the fact that the irrigation amount of the
    T-VWC treatment was based on soil moisture sensors, which were arranged in the
    middle of the adjacent emitters. The T-ETc treatment made the change in of irrigation
    amount tend to the actual transpiration of cucumber plants (Fig. 3) and then reduced
    the total irrigation amount by 34.04% compared with the T-VWC treatment (Table
    2). Therefore, the T-ETc treatment was better than the T-VWC treatment in this
    study. The T-VWC treatment based on soil moisture sensor needs to further optimizing
    the installation position of the sensor to improve irrigation efficiency. Effect
    of irrigation scheduling on evapotranspiration In general, crop transpiration
    increases with irrigation2,11,33. In this study, evapotranspiration was equal
    to the transpiration of the cucumber plants because the six sides of the coconut
    coir slabs were wrapped with PE films to avoid the evaporation of substrate water.
    The difference in \\(ET_{d}\\) among the different treatments at each harvest
    stage was consistent with that in Ir. The \\(ET_{d}\\) of the T-ETc treatment
    was the lowest at the beginning and middle of the harvest and was inferior to
    that of the T-VWC treatment at the end of the harvest (Table 2). In addition,
    the T-ETc treatment with low irrigation had the smallest number of leaves and
    leaf area, which further reduced the transpiration from cucumber plants. It is
    often assumed that the water requirements of greenhouse-grown crops are equivalent
    to those of crop evapotranspiration. This indicates that the daily variation tendency
    of irrigation amount should be consistent with evapotranspiration.12. In the three
    meteorological environments of this experiment, the ET of the T-VWC treatment
    decreased with the weakening of solar radiation in the afternoon, especially on
    cloudy days, which was different from the irrigation amount, with a very small
    variation. The daily variation of ET in the Rn-VWC and T-ETc treatments had the
    same tendency as that of the irrigation amount (Fig. 3). Shin et al31,33 found
    that the transpiration rate was not always proportional to the light intensity
    and was almost constant when the light intensity exceeded 200 J s\\(^{-1}\\) m\\(^{-1}\\),
    suggested that the cumulative radiation threshold used to trigger irrigation should
    be adjusted appropriately under bright light conditions to avoid over-irrigation.
    Similar results were observed for the Rn-VWC treatment. During most of the time
    from 7:00 to 18:00 on April 26 and May 24, the solar radiation in the greenhouse
    was above 200 J s\\(^{-1}\\) m\\(^{-1}\\) and the cumulative radiation threshold
    in Rn-VWC treatment was fixed, which could resulted in excessive irrigation and
    high DR (over 35%). In addition, the application of environmental control systems
    in greenhouses affects the correlation between meteorological parameters and crop
    transpiration23,31,40. After using the shading screens, the incident radiation
    and vapor pressure deficit, the response of leaf transpiration to incident radiation,
    and the transpiration rate per unit leaf area decreased significantly29,41. The
    ET of cucumber on May 24 in the T-ETc treatment was significantly lower than the
    irrigation amount (Fig. 3), which may be related to the high \\(ETc_{h}\\) estimated
    by Eq. (2) due to the use of shading system. Therefore, it is necessary to further
    investigate the response mechanisms of crop photosynthesis, transpiration, and
    other physiological activities under the application of greenhouse environmental
    control systems to provide a theoretical basis for continuing to optimize irrigation
    methods. The purpose of this study is to obtain a more precise irrigation regime
    suitable for coconut coir cultivation of cucumber in solar greenhouses. However,
    the data used for the analysis of irrigation regimes under different meteorological
    conditions in this study is limited, which needs to be improved in the future
    studies. Effect of irrigation scheduling on the yield of cucumber and IWP The
    effect of irrigation scheduling on crop yield in substrate culture depends on
    irrigation frequency and amount. A higher frequency of irrigation, which could
    maintain the stability of the substrate water content, helped improve yield2,9,11,42.
    Suyum et al.9 found that the fluctuation in substrate water content increases
    with a decrease in the threshold of substrate water content for irrigation control,
    resulting in a decline in sweet basil yield. Similar results were observed for
    the Rn-VWC treatment, with the highest fluctuation in substrate water content
    and the lowest yield. Especially at the end of harvest, the yield decreased by
    22.35–24.81%. The primary response of plants to water stress is the inhibition
    of cell expansion43, which, in turn, affects fruit size and weight. At the end
    of harvest, the mean weight of fruit in the Rn-VWC treatment was significantly
    reduced, leading to the lowest yield (Table 3). It is suggested that the large
    fluctuation in substrate water content may cause the plants to suffer from water
    stress. However, this result was inconsistent with previous studies on tomatoes3,11
    and sweet peppers44, which showed that a reduction in fruit number was the cause
    of lower yield under water stress. According to the characteristics of the crop
    water production function, the yield increases with an increase in the irrigation
    amount when water is the limiting factor; if the increase in the irrigation amount
    is greater than that in crop production, the input of water should be limited45
    . Simsek et al.46 constructed a polynomial equation using cucumber yield and irrigation
    data from two years and pointed out that excessive irrigation reduces yield. Meric
    et al.2 found that the increase in yield caused by high-frequency irrigation was
    slower than the increase in the irrigation amount. Hao et al.11 reported that
    the yield of tomatoes increased slowly to approach their plateau when the irrigation
    amount reached 70% and 90% of cumulative evaporation. The total irrigation amount
    in the T-VWC treatment was significantly higher than that in the T-ETc treatment,
    while the total yield was almost the same. This indicated that the greater amount
    of irrigation in the T-VWC treatment did not contribute to the yield. This finding
    was consistent with those of above-mentioned studies. Moreover, the plant height,
    stem diameter, leaf number, and leaf area under the T-VWC treatment were higher
    than those under the T-ETc treatment. It was suggested that the cucumbers under
    the T-VWC treatment were biased towards nutrient growth. Due to the pursuit of
    cucumber yield, T-VWC treatment was considered to provide excessive irrigation,
    leading to waste of water and fertilizer resources. IWP is the ratio of yield
    to irrigation amount and is an important criterion for evaluating production systems41,47.
    In general, IWP increased with the decrease of irrigation amount and the increase
    of yield. Recep et al.47 found that the treatment with the least amount of irrigation
    resulted in the highest IWP of cucumbers grown in a solar green-house during the
    springsummer season. In the present study, the decrease in the yield under the
    Rn-VWC treatment was less than the reduction in the irrigation amount, however,
    the yield under the T-ETc treatment did not decrease with the reduction in the
    irrigation amount. Thus, the IWP under the T-ETc treatment was the highest, followed
    by that under the Rn-VWC treatment. Conclusion In this study, three irrigation
    schedules for cucumber coconut coir cultures were evaluated. The results shown
    that the daily irrigation frequency, irrigation amount, and discharge rate under
    the T-ETc treatment were 9–10 times, 1.12–1.41 L plant\\(^{-1}\\), and 19.95–35.83%,
    respectively, and the irrigation amount was consistent with the change in ET.
    Compared to the other two treatments, the total irrigation amount in the T-ETc
    treatment was the lowest, the cucumber yield was not affected, and IWP was the
    highest. The T-ETc treatment synchronized irrigation with the transpiration of
    cucumber plants and saved a substantially larger amount of water and fertilizer.
    Thus, the method based on estimating ETc using the hourly PM–ETo equation with
    an improved calculation of Kc values (T-ETc) was a more precise irrigation management
    method for cucumbers in coconut coir culture. Data availability The data used

  description: Because there is more demand for freshwater around the world and the
    world’s population is growing at the same time, there is a severe lack of freshwater
    resources in the central part of the planet. The world’s current population of
    7.2 billion people is expected to grow to over 9 billion by the year 2050. The
    vast majority of freshwater is used for things like cooking, cleaning, and farming.
    Most industrialised countries are in desperate need of smart irrigation systems,
    which are now a must-have because of how quickly technology is improving. In article
    presents IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system for agriculture
    industry. IoT based humidity and soil sensors are used to collect soil related
    data. This data is stored in a centralized cloud. Features are selected by CFS
    algorithm. This will help in discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of data is
    performed by K means algorithm. This will help in keeping similar data together.
    Then classification model is build using the SVM, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes
    algorithm. Model is trained, validated and tested using the acquired data. Historical
    soil and humidity related data is also used in training the model. K-means SVM
    hybrid classifier is achieving better results for classification, prediction of
    water demand and saving fresh water by intelligent irrigation. K-means SVM hybrid
    classifier has achieved accuracy rate of 98.5 percent. Specificity, recall and
    precision of K-means SVM hybrid classifier is also higher than random forest and

    Accesses Explore all metrics Abstract Because there is more demand for freshwater
    around the world and the world’s population is growing at the same time, there
    is a severe lack of freshwater resources in the central part of the planet. The
    world’s current population of 7.2 billion people is expected to grow to over 9
    billion by the year 2050. The vast majority of freshwater is used for things like
    cooking, cleaning, and farming. Most industrialised countries are in desperate

    system using IoT Article 05 January 2022 1 Introduction A particular volume of
    water is required to be provided to a crop at predetermined intervals throughout
    the period in which it is developing. Irrigation is critical to the accomplishment
    of any agricultural project. The process of supplying water to plants via the
    use of mechanical methods is referred to as irrigation. Particularly helpful in
    areas prone to drought or subject to unpredictable rainfall. It is impossible
    to overestimate the significance of water in the life of a plant. Because the
    principles of water management vary depending on the weather, it is essential
    to have a solid understanding of how the soil and plants interact with one another.
    The soil may be sandy, silty, clay, or any number of other textures. Every type
    of soil has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it was formed.
    Consider, for example, the high water absorption capacity of sand. However, the
    nutrients are immediately flushed down the drain. On the other hand, silty soil
    is made up of extremely small particles and has an exceptional capacity to store
    water for extended periods of time. Sadly, water has a difficult time draining
    through this soil because of its structure. The quality of the soil in all of
    its facets, including its ability to retain water and nutrients, is absolutely
    necessary for agricultural production. Therefore, in order to effectively manage
    the water requirements of the various types of soil, it is essential to have a
    solid understanding of the characteristics of the soil [1]. Even if there is sufficient
    precipitation in many agricultural places, there is not enough moisture for crop
    development for a number of different reasons. These causes include a lack of
    storage capacity and/or precipitation that falls at inconvenient times. It has
    been stated that the rainfall is insufficient if it is less than one hundred centimeters,
    as the irrigation system requires at least that much rain in order to function
    properly [2]. Irrigation is also necessary in regions that see fluctuating amounts
    of precipitation, such as the dry Sahel, which receives a lot of rain during the
    monsoon season but suffers from dryness during the winter months. In order to
    assist in the development of crops at times of the year when there is a deficiency
    in rainfall, water irrigation is necessary. The majority of the newest and highest-quality
    hybrid crop varieties need for a substantial amount of watering. As a consequence
    of this, it is very necessary to manage the flow of water in order to improve
    the yield and quality of the crops. Even the most common varieties of sugarcane
    and rice require a substantial amount of water to cultivate, which is demonstrated
    by the extensive and illustrious history of irrigation in the basin. This is something
    that has been well researched and written about. Each individual farmer is responsible
    for carrying out all aspects of agricultural labor, from sowing seeds and picking
    weeds to fertilizing, watering, and harvesting their crops. This process requires
    a significant investment of both time and water, in addition to a substantial
    amount of manual labor [3]. The method includes a number of decision-making phases
    that are spread out across the course of the agricultural cycle to enhance the
    productiveness of farming. Precision agriculture assists farmers in mitigating
    these issues while also increasing crop yields. This is accomplished by continuously
    measuring the soil’s temperature, humidity, temperature gradient, and pH. There
    are a number of industrialized countries in which precision farming is carried
    out exclusively through the use of the Internet of Things. The process of a computer
    being able to learn new abilities by itself through observation and repeated practice
    is referred to as machine learning [4]. In order for the algorithms to learn from
    the input datasets, gradually train the samples, and increase their performance,
    the equations need to be modified. Its foundation in real-world settings enables
    it to develop decision-making capabilities with relatively minimal input from
    humans. Machine learning-based algorithms are increasingly being used in every
    sector of the economy. On the other hand, the accuracy might be very different
    depending on the quality of the data that was utilized. As a consequence of this,
    the representations of the datasets and the variables that are being targeted
    are both essential components of the machine learning approaches [5]. The ability
    to predict the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level,
    together with other meteorological information, is vital for the irrigation action
    timing plan used in precision agriculture. When designing irrigation schedules,
    it is important to highlight the kind of water distribution and to take into account
    the buffer time of the system. Whether deciding when to water plants, the moisture
    level of the soil is an extremely important aspect. As soon as the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded. When it comes to the
    Internet of Things, new agricultural systems are beneficial because of the simplicity
    with which they make farm maintenance. The creation of such an automated system
    makes it possible to hydrate plants without the need for human involvement. Several
    different sectors have begun implementing IoT in order to increase their level
    of production. In today’s world, the Internet of Things is also being applied
    in farming in the form of smart farming. Devices connected to the internet of
    things have the ability to monitor the weather, find solutions to problems with
    irrigation, and assist farmers in increasing their crops in incremental steps.
    Innovative ideas are now necessary in the agriculture industry as a direct result
    of the growing population around the world and the accompanying rise in food consumption.
    Farmers can benefit from the Internet of Things in a number of ways, including
    increased crop productivity, improved harvesting yield, and proper field management;
    water monitoring; water usage limitation; crop monitoring; environmental impact
    prediction in advance; use of fewer people and fewer resources; prediction of
    environmental impact in advance; monitoring of water; and monitoring of crops.
    As a result of increased worldwide demand for freshwater and the concurrent expansion
    in global population, the central area of the planet is currently facing a severe
    lack of available freshwater resources. It is anticipated that by the year 2050,
    the current world population of 7.2 billion would have increased to over 9 billion.
    The vast majority of freshwater is consumed for uses related to household and
    agricultural production. The majority of industrialised countries are in dire
    need of intelligent irrigation systems since the rapid advancement of technology
    has rendered them indispensable [6]. The Smart Irrigation System is equipment
    that is considered to be at the cutting edge of technology when it comes to managing
    the flow of water in agricultural infrastructure. The SIS controller will automatically
    change the irrigation schedule so that it is optimal for the conditions of the
    soil, the current weather, and the prediction for the next week. The water-soil
    interaction as well as the crop water demand that goes along with it may both
    be established via the process of characterising the soil feature. Embedded system
    components, such as a microprocessor, together with the associated timers, sensors,
    and electrical valves, are responsible for regulating the flow of water in autonomous
    irrigation systems. As a result of this, the system is able to work in a more
    efficient manner. Controls for volume and timing, in addition to sensors that
    monitor the moisture content of the soil, are a few examples of automated irrigation.
    The controllers of the intelligent irrigation system each have their own embedded
    intelligence, which works in conjunction with the other integrated components
    of the system. These sophisticated controls keep an eye on the weather as well
    as other aspects of the surrounding environment. Based on their findings, they
    modify watering schedules and quantities so that water is neither wasted nor wasted
    too quickly. You have to be aware that the most recent generation of intelligent
    irrigation controllers set the watering schedule for the irrigation system based
    on weather forecasts. People’s confidence in the correctness of the data projected
    is essential to the operation of such a system since it relies on their input.
    This article presents IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity and soil sensors are used to collect
    soil related data. This data is stored in a centralized cloud. Features are selected
    by CFS algorithm. This will help in discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of
    data is performed by K means algorithm. This will help in keeping similar data
    together. Then classification model is build using the SVM, Random Forest and
    Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained, validated and tested using the acquired
    data. Historical soil and humidity related data is also used in training the model.
    Section 2 presents literature survey of existing work related to intelligent irrigation
    system. Section 3 depicts the methodology part. Section 4 presents result analysis
    and discussion. This section includes performance comparison on the basis of certain
    parameters. Section 5 contains conclusion. 2 Literature survey Weakly-Secured
    Networks, often known as WSNs, are an emerging technology that have the potential
    to completely transform the agricultural industry. Maurya and Jain were kind enough
    to supply details on how to make efficient use of fuzzy logic in agricultural
    precision farming [7]. They assert that the information collected by field sensors
    is transmitted to a base station, which is then delivered to a centralised location.
    Through the use of a threshold hybrid route, the information that has been received
    by the sensors is transmitted to the base station. The authors use fuzzy logic
    to select the best cluster head in order to bring down the total amount of energy
    consumed. Farmers are able to utilise the data received by the base station to
    figure out how much water should be used for irrigation in various parts of their
    property by using the information. Farmers need to implement practises of precision
    agriculture in order to enhance their productivity. If this is the case, implementing
    WSN may significantly help farmers and other players in the agricultural sector,
    notably government irrigation agencies, make great judgements that aid in the
    forecasting of irrigation demands and crop yields. This might be a significant
    benefit of adopting WSN. A method for autonomous precision farming was developed
    by Dong et al. [8], and it makes use of centre pivot irrigation systems. This
    technological advancement makes use of sensor networks that are placed in the
    ground in order to monitor environmental elements in a field, such as the temperature
    of the soil and the moisture levels. As a result, sensors are installed, initial
    power settings are defined, and the network is maintained on a consistent basis
    in order to guarantee the most efficient utilisation of energy. In the past, a
    number of different user applications have been developed to automate and make
    the task of managing and scheduling irrigation systems more straightforward. Vellidis
    and his colleagues came up with a system that allows for more effective watering
    of cotton crops [9]. In order to establish the soil water balance in their system,
    the researchers analysed data sets collected from a variety of cotton-growing
    locations. An android mobile application was developed by the author with the
    help of the datasets. In addition to that, they have designed their app in such
    a way that it can pull weather information from surrounding weather stations.
    In order to achieve optimal levels of cotton production, the software was designed
    to carry out automated planning of the irrigation systems on the basis of the
    calculated irrigation requirements arrived at by applying both local and downloaded
    meteorological data. Imam et al. [10] conducted a study of the challenges associated
    with the design of wireless sensor networks and intelligent humidity sensors for
    use in precision agriculture. This was done with the goal of maximising the benefits
    that could be obtained. In the context of precision farming, they compared the
    performance of several microcontroller families and sensor node units with one
    another. In addition to this, an inventory of relative humidity sensor requirements
    along with modelling and interface methodologies was produced by them. Chen et
    al. [11] suggested that precision farming would be impossible without the use
    of agricultural IoT systems. Several farmers have benefited greatly from the automated
    control and data monitoring systems. The agriculture industry is rapidly turning
    to the use of machine learning in response to the pressing need to enhance traditionally
    employed practises. The capabilities of the IoT to perform remote monitoring and
    data collecting help farmers save both time and effort thanks to the utilisation
    of preexisting internet infrastructure as well as mobile and web-based applications.
    The Internet of Things system used in agriculture incorporates a wide range of
    functions, one of the most important of which is irrigation. As a result of developments
    in technology that have rendered conventional farming methods archaic, people
    are more interested in modern irrigation methods than they are in traditional
    farming. Traditional agricultural methods are no longer viable. The Internet of
    Things would be of enormous use to farmers since it would save them the time and
    effort necessary for manual monitoring of their fields. This is a big deterrent
    for many people living in metropolitan areas, despite the abundance of farmland.
    Farmers would gain greatly from the IoT. Data from sensors stored in the cloud
    might potentially be combined with methods of machine learning in order to provide
    users with assistance in planning for future output. A novel Internet of Things
    (IoT) enabled smart system was presented by Akshay and Ramesh [12] to predict
    the quantity of irrigation that is required for the field by sensing characteristics
    such as soil moisture, humidity, and temperature using a machine learning algorithm.
    This was accomplished by Akshay and Ramesh’s novel smart system. We resort to
    the K-closest neighbour strategy in order to circumvent the overfitting problem
    that occurs with the more traditional K-means and SVM methods. The outcomes of
    processing data using 3 weeks’ worth of predefined data are detailed, illustrating
    how the recommended method''s usage of the K-nearest neighbour algorithm may produce
    a completely automated irrigation system. The predictions made by the recommended
    system have a high degree of accuracy. The groundwater that is utilised for irrigation,
    home uses, and industrial reasons was analysed by Sarakutty et al. [13] in this
    particular paper. The writers also mention that in many extensive rural regions,
    irrigation is done with groundwater rather than surface water. Due to the fact
    that water is required for all forms of life on Earth, the problem of water conservation
    is an urgent one that has not yet been resolved. The global water system boosts
    the incomes and productivity of rural areas by providing assistance to farmers
    in reducing the impacts of drought and the variable nature of the weather. Irrigation
    is the most significant consumer of drinkable water but also contributes significantly
    to the depletion of ground water. The use of ground water is an unavoidable outcome
    brought about by the rising demand for agricultural goods. Because of this, it
    is very necessary to adopt cutting-edge technology in irrigation in order to make
    more efficient use of the water that is available. In a smart irrigation system
    enabled by the Internet of Things, in order to minimise the amount of water that
    is used for irrigation while yet being able to accurately estimate the rate at
    which soil moisture is being drained, Singh and others Data collected from field
    sensors and forecasts of the weather that may be available online are used to
    generate estimates of the amount of moisture in the soil. The GBRT has been demonstrated
    to be the most accurate of the several ML approaches that can be used to estimate
    the soil''s moisture content. The presented strategies have the potential to be
    a fruitful research avenue for reducing the amount of water required for irrigation.
    Pratyush Reddy and colleagues [14] have developed an intelligent irrigation system
    that is able to forecast the amount of water that a crop will require by making
    use of an algorithm that is designed for machine learning. The amount of water
    that is required for agricultural purposes may be approximated based on a number
    of different criteria, the moisture content, temperature, and humidity being the
    three most essential of these. The system’s sensors for measuring temperature,
    humidity, and wetness send data to a central CPU, which then links the device
    to the cloud. These sensors are placed in an agricultural field. The data gathered
    in the field is input into a decision tree algorithm, which is an effective tool
    for machine learning and enables efficient result prediction. Kirtana et al. [15]
    produced a work that combines the power of the internet of things (IoT) with an
    algorithm for machine learning in order to automate and speed up the process of
    developing new agricultural techniques. The planning and implementation of a smart
    irrigation system are described in depth in this article. This system makes use
    of machine learning techniques in order to fully and correctly automate the watering
    process. The sensor module is powered by solar energy, which results in a reduction
    in the system''s overall energy consumption and an improvement in the lifetime
    of the system. Singh and Sobti [16] investigated the potential applications of
    several ML algorithms in the field of agriculture as part of their research. In
    addition, the report shed light on the difficulties associated with merging IoT
    and WSN in order to achieve precision agriculture. It has come to light that the
    primary problems stem from a deficiency in intelligent infrastructure, accurate
    sensing technologies, careless water use, and an inability to predict important
    components that are required for irrigation. Therefore, according to the author,
    there is a significant demand for methods of machine learning that are both effective
    and efficient. 3 Methodology In this section, Fig. 1 presents IoT based Sensor
    integrated intelligent irrigation system for agriculture industry. IoT based humidity
    and soil sensors are used to collect soil related data. This data is stored in
    a centralized cloud. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. This will help in
    discarding irrelevant data. Clustering of data is performed by K means algorithm.
    This will help in keeping similar data together. Then classification model is
    build using the SVM, Random Forest and Naïve Bayes algorithm. Model is trained,
    validated and tested using the acquired data. Historical soil and humidity related
    data is also used in training the model. Fig. 1 IoT based Sensor integrated intelligent
    irrigation system for agriculture industry Full size image Important features
    are selected using CGS algorithm. K-Means Clustering [17] is one of the most common
    “Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques,” and if you want to evaluate the organisation
    of your data, you may make use of this technique, which gives you the opportunity
    to do so. It is a process that divides the dataset into a predetermined number
    of subsets in an iterative manner (clusters). In addition to making certain that
    the clusters do not intersect with one another, we checked to see that the data
    points contained within each cluster were as analogous to one another as was practically
    possible. The elements were grouped together into clusters according to their
    distances from the cluster''s centre, with the elements that were located the
    furthest away receiving the least amount of weight. The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
    was successful in explaining 86.6% of the variation in the data that was observed.
    K indicates that there is less variance inside a group but a greater degree of
    diversity between groups. A classifier known as a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    [18] can be utilised to accomplish the task of separating data into linear and
    nonlinear categories. If you have more than one different group, support vector
    machine analysis can guide you through the process of building a hyperplane that
    maximises the distances that separate them. The number of classes must be added
    to the number of features to arrive at the total number of hyperplanes. The precise
    positioning and orientation of the hyperplanes can be determined by examining
    the points that make up the supports vector. With the assistance of these support
    vectors, it is possible to expand the margins of the hyperplanes. Support vector
    machines, often known as SVMs, are comprised of mathematical functions known as
    kernels. These kernels accept data as input and output it in the appropriate format.
    SVM kernels are available in a wide variety of shapes, such as linear, radial
    basis function, polynomial, and sigmoidal, amongst others. These kernels are included
    in accordance with the manner in which the data is dispersed. During the course
    of this investigation, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classification
    model by making use of radial basis functions. A random forest (RF) is a type
    of statistical analysis in which numerous individual decision trees are blended
    to generate a single forest. In the end, the ensemble forecast that was generated
    by many disparate models (tress) is superior to the prediction that was generated
    by any one prediction model. RF can be applied in classification in addition to
    its use in regression analysis, which is one of its more common applications.
    The research led to the development of the classification RF, which utilises three
    hundred trees. Out of bag error decreases with rising tree counts, but eventually
    levels off at 50 trees, which may be used to analyse the error rate by creating
    a plot. In other words, the error rate can be evaluated by drawing a plot [19].
    The Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is a type of supervised machine learning that is
    based on Bayes'' theorem as well as the concept that the features that are utilised
    as predictors are independent of one another within a particular class. The Naive
    Bayes model outperforms a large number of other sophisticated classifiers and
    is notably helpful for making multiclass predictions with enormous datasets. It
    is possible to calculate the posterior probability with the assistance of Bayes''
    Theorem. The posterior probability, denoted by the symbol P(W|Y), is computed
    using the formula P(Y|W) * P(W)/P(Y), where P(W) represents the prior probability
    of the predictor, P(Y|W) represents the probability of the predictor given class,
    and P(Y|W) represents the prior probability of the class. We were able to generate
    a density map for each of the seven predictor variables with the help of the Naive
    Bayes function [20]. 4 Result analysis and discussion We created a dataset of
    several environmental parameters such as soil moisture, Humidity, Temperature,
    Pressure, and Luminosity. To create comprehensive data set with all important
    parameters, we have used data sets available at [21]. Rice crop related data set
    has 42665 records. 35000 records used to train the classification model and 7665
    records used to test the classification model. IoT based soil and humidity sensors
    are used to acquire data. Features are selected by CFS algorithm. Results are
    represented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Amount of fresh water saved by proposed
    technique is presented in Fig. 7. Accuracy, precision, specificity, recall and
    F1 score are used as performance parameter [22]. $$ \\begin{aligned} {\\text{Accuracy}}

    the properties of the soil and plants, as well as the water level and other weather
    information. This is important for the irrigation timing plan. When making irrigation
    schedules, it''s important to pay attention to the type of water distribution
    and take the system''s buffer time into account. The level of moisture in the
    soil is a very important part of deciding when to water plants. When the set amount
    is reached, the playing field will start to get flooded.This article presented
    an Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor integrated intelligent irrigation system
    for the agricultural sector. In order to collect data pertaining to the soil,
    humidity and soil sensors based on the internet of things are utilised. This information
    is kept in a centralised cloud storage system. The CFS algorithm is responsible
    for the selection of features. This will aid in removing irrelevant data. The
    K means approach is used to conduct the clustering of the data. This will assist
    in keeping related data together in one place. The SVM, Random Forest, and Naive
    Bayes algorithms are utilised next in the construction of the classification model.
    Using the data that was obtained, the model is then trained, verified, and tested.
    The training of the model additionally makes use of data relating to the soil''s
    history and the humidity. The K-means SVM hybrid classifier is producing superior
    results for classification, the forecast of water demand, and the conservation
    of fresh water through intelligent irrigation. Hybrid Kmeans SVM is saving fresh
    water up to 20 percent by intelligent irrigation. Data availability The data that

    Introduction Rice is a major food crop that feeds 50% of the world’s population,
    although many abiotic stresses, particularly salt stress, endanger its yield.
    Around 20% of the world’s cultivated land and 33% of its irrigated agricultural
    land is affected by salinity stress [1]. Salinity is one of the vital abiotic
    stresses that not only reduce significantly agricultural production but also deteriorates
    the cultivated lands. It influences 830 million hectares of arable land all over
    the world [2] and causes around two million uncultivable lands yearly [3]. To
    sustain production and to meet the global food security demands, it is critical
    to discover stress-tolerant rice cultivars. Multi-stress tolerant Green Super
    Rice (GSR) has been developed with resistance to salinity, drought, cold, heat,
    insects, and flooding with better nutrient and water use efficiency [4,5,6,7,8].
    GSR has resulted in an exemplary shift in crop genetic advancement goals and food
    production models for promoting sustainable agriculture. GSR is a critical concept
    proposed to meet the challenge of attaining environmentally friendly and resource-saving
    crops because GSR genotypes can maintain stable and higher yields with fewer inputs,
    as well as have higher resistance and survival rates to combat extreme climate
    change [9]. Salt stress in plants triggers several complicated signaling pathways
    and is owed to the collegial interactions of salt-stress-sensitive genes with
    other stress signal transduction pathways components [10]. Plants adapt to salt
    stress via different molecular mechanisms that involve regulation of ion homeostasis,
    cell wall composition, cytoskeleton dynamics, activation of plant hormone signaling,
    and osmotic stress pathway [11]. Phytohormones are the crucial signal molecules
    that regulate the growth and development of plants in both normal and stressed
    settings. Several phytohormones that respond and help to tolerate salt stress
    are abscisic acid (ABA), indole acetic acid (IAA), ethylene (ETH), jasmonic acid
    (JA), gibberellic acid (GA), cytokinin (CK), salicylic acid (SA), brassinosteroids
    (BR), and triazoles (TR) [12, 13]. Plants also adapt to salt stress through complicated
    physiological mechanisms that involve alterations of the metabolites. Changes
    in metabolite level are a good indicator of cell physiological conditions prediction
    than protein level because metabolites are produced as an outcome of interactions
    between different genes in different pathways as a result of stress [14], and
    polyamines (PAs) are involved in osmotic tolerance during salt stress [15]. The
    next-generation sequencing technology based on transcriptomes allows us to get
    deeper insights into the molecular and physiological processes that help plants
    to tolerate and recover from biotic and abiotic stresses [16]. Comparative transcriptomics-based
    RNA-seq data help in how plants regulate their molecular and cellular mechanism,
    change transcriptome and stimulate the stress tolerance pathways to survive external
    stresses. Understanding the differentially expressed genes and how they interact
    in various tissues under various stress circumstances can help us better understand
    how stress stimulates transcriptional changes [16]. Transcriptome studies have
    been performed on rice with salt stress for 24 h in a 150 mM NaCl [17] and a 200
    mM NaCl solution [18], 3 days in an 85 mM NaCl [19], and a 200 mM NaCl solution
    [20, 21], 5 days in 250 mM NaCl solution [22], and for 7 days in 50 mM NaCl [23],
    125 mM NaCl [24], and 150 mM NaCl solution [25]. The global yield losses in rice
    crop majorly caused by salinity, that can be reduced by hunting the pre-breeding
    information in prevailing rice germplasm and identifying the novel genes in salt
    tolerant. Comparative transcriptome analysis between contrasting genotypes could
    help in identifying the novel genes and understanding the pathways underlying
    the salt tolerance in rice [19, 21, 23, 24]. In this study, we have performed
    comparative transcriptome studies at a seedling stage between two GSR varieties
    with different tolerance levels to salt stress. Comparative transcriptome analysis
    between contrasting genotypes could help in understanding the pathways underlying
    salt tolerance in rice. Methods Plant growth and treatment Previously our research
    group identified 10 salt-tolerant and 12 salt-susceptible genotypes out of 22
    GSR genotypes evaluated under the salt stress [6]. We herein selected two genotypes
    GSR-54 (S13) and GSR-305 (S3) with contrasting tolerance to salt stress. The seeds
    of salt-tolerant GSR-54 (S13) and salt-susceptible GSR-305 (S3) were sterilized
    with 30% hydrogen peroxide solution germinated in Petri dishes under 14 h light,
    10 h dark, 28 °C (day), and 24 °C (night) conditions for 3 days. The germinated
    seeds were transferred to plastic trays containing Yoshida medium under growth
    chamber conditions. To compare the effect of salinity on both genotypes at the
    transcriptome level, seeds of GSR-54 and GSR-305 were grown in normal conditions
    for 30 days. Half of the seedlings were transferred to a culture solution supplemented
    with 140 mM NaCl for 12 days. The remaining seedlings left for normal growth were
    used as control plants. At the 42-day developmental stage, root samples were collected
    from both control and salt-stressed plants and stored in liquid nitrogen at − 80
    °C until RNA extraction. RNA isolation, library construction, and RNA sequencing
    Two biological replicates for control and three biological replicates for stress
    conditions of each genotype were used for transcriptome profiling. Total RNA was
    extracted from the roots of each sample using the phenol/chloroform method. The
    purity test of RNA was undertaken using NanoDrop 2000 & 8000 micro spectrophotometer.
    The concentration and integrity of RNA samples were tested with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
    using an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit. cDNA libraries were constructed using the
    manufacturer’s standard procedures and subsequent cDNA libraries were sequenced
    by the paired-end (2 bp × 150 bp) on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. Identification
    of differentially expressed genes Raw sequencing data were assessed for quality
    with FastQC v0.11.9 [26]. Adaptor contamination and poor-quality bases were trimmed
    using Trimmomatic v0.39 [27]. Clean reads were mapped against reference assembly
    IRGSP 1.0 (https://plants.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html) with HISAT2 v2.2.1
    [28]. Gene level quantification was performed with featureCounts v2.0.0 [29].
    Differential gene expression analysis and exploratory data analysis were performed
    using the DESeq2 package (1.34.0) [30] in R. Genes that satisfied the threshold
    value of false discovery rate (Padj) < 0.05 and |log2FC| ≥ 2 or ≤ – 2 were classified
    as differentially expressed genes. Discovery of novel transcripts expressed under
    salt stress Stringtie v2.1.1 [31] was used to carry out the de novo assembly of
    transcripts with mapped reads from HISAT2 output. The merge utility of Stringtie
    merged the transcripts from all samples in a way that resulted in a unified set
    of transcripts based on genomic coordinates from all conditions. Novel transcripts
    were compared to a known reference gene model from Ensembl Plants (https://plants.ensembl.org)
    and genes with single exons were discarded. FASTA sequences of novel transcripts
    were also retrieved for annotation. To identify the protein-coding potential of
    novel transcripts we used Transdecoder v5.5.0 (http://transdecoder.github.io)
    to predict open reading frames (ORFs) with default parameters. Novel genes were
    annotated by blast against Nr, Swiss-prot, Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG, and EuKaryotic
    Orthologous Group (KOG) databases with an e-value threshold of 1e-10 and max-target-seqs
    1. Protein sequences were scanned against the Pfam database by HMMER v3.3 to identify
    the functional domains in novel genes based on homology. Enrichment analysis GO
    accessions were added to identified DEGs using biomartr package v1.0.2 [32] in
    R. Only the genes with identified GO terms were used for enrichment analysis.
    Custom annotation database of rice for enrichment analysis of DEGs was made using
    AnnotationForge package v1.39.2 [33] in R. ClusterProfiler v4.0 [34] was used
    to perform Gene set enrichment analysis in R. KEGG pathway analysis of DEGs based
    on P-value < 0.05 threshold was also performed with ClusterProfiler for identifying
    significantly enriched pathways. The P-value was corrected as described by the
    Benjamini–Hochberg method. Classification of transcription factors in DEGs Transcription
    factors serve several important functions in biological processes from the development
    of the plant to the stress tolerance control [35]. For identification and classification
    of transcription factors, protein sequences of differentially expressed genes
    identified in four comparisons were retrieved using BioMart in Ensembl Plants
    (https://plants.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/) and submitted to iTAK—Plant Transcription
    factor & Protein Kinase Identifier and Classifier tool (http://itak.feilab.net/cgi-bin/itak/index.cgi,
    Accessed on 1st August 2022). Identification of SNP variations For SNP calling,
    clean reads were mapped against reference assembly using the STAR v2.7.10a [36]
    2-pass method with default parameters. Mapped files were sorted by coordinate
    and converted to BAM files. SNP sites were identified by a single base mismatch
    between the reference site and sample site using the GATK v4.2.1.0 [37] pipeline.
    SNPs were filtered based on three criteria: (a) no more than three consecutive
    SNPs within 35 bp of windows size, (b) the sequencing depth of SNPs was between
    5 and 100 bp, and (c) genotype qualities were bigger than 20. SnpEff v5.1d [38]
    was used to identify the location of SNPs on the reference genome regions and
    their impact on the protein products. The SNP density on each chromosome was determined
    using an in-house R script. Validation through quantitative PCR Six differentially
    expressed genes (DEGs) were selected randomly to validate the results of RNA sequencing;
    including growth-regulating factor interacting factor 1 Os03g0733600 (OsGIF1)
    [39], U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase Os01g0823900 (OsPUB3) [40], 12-oxophytodienoic
    acid reductase, Jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defense signaling Os02g0559400 (OsOPR8)
    [41], CBL-interacting protein kinase 5 Os01g0206700 (OsCIPK5) ( [42]), Squamosa
    promoter-binding-like protein Os06g0659100 (OsSPL10) [43], and Similar to Globulin
    1 expressed protein Os08g0127900 (OsEnS-115). Gene-specific primers for selected
    DEGs were designed with Primer3 (https://primer3.ut.ee/) (Supplementary Table
    S1). In addition, Real-time quantitative (q) PCR was performed with three replicates
    for both control and salt stress treatments in salt-sensitive S3 and salt-tolerant
    S13 genotypes. For this purpose, 1 g of RNA was converted into cDNA by using a
    cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). qRT-PCR was performed in Applied
    Biosystems Prism 7500HT Real-time Sequence Detection System using 2 × SYBR Green
    PCR Master Mix (TAKARA, Kyoto, Japan). Relative gene expression level was calculated
    for each gene relative to the Actin1 gene using the delta CT method. A bar chart
    graph was made to show the relative expression of selected DEGs based on fold
    change (log2FC) values. PCA and correlation analysis Principal component (PCA)
    and correlation analysis were conducted in the R 3.4.5 by using different packages
    (magrittr, ade4, FactoMineR, factoextra, and ggplot2). Results RNA sequencing
    and alignment After removing poor-quality bases and adaptor sequences, we obtained
    68.38 Gb of clean data, with Q30 values for each library being higher than 92%
    (Table 1). The clean reads were annotated with reference assembly and the mapping
    statistics showed that 93.03–96.49% of total reads were mapped (Table 1). Table
    1 Sequencing data and alignment summary statistics Full size table Exploratory
    data analysis (EDA) We performed the exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess
    the quality of samples and the relationship between biological replicates. The
    results of principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that the first two
    PCs covered 82% of the total variation and three biological replicates of treated
    samples from each genotype were individually clustered and two biological replicates
    of control samples from each genotype were individually clustered (Fig. 1A). The
    hierarchical clustering pattern showed a high consistency and low variability
    between biological replicates (Fig. 1B). PCA also confirm that genotypes S3 and
    S13 have different salt tolerance level. This large difference between all groups
    based on PCA suggests that salt-responsive genes might be the main cause of between-group
    differences. Identification of differentially expressed genes The differential
    gene expression analysis under salt stress was carried out with the pairwise comparisons
    of S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt, S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and S3-ctrl
    vs. S13-ctrl in roots. The up-regulated and down-regulated genes obtained from
    four comparisons were 3,982, 3,463, 977, and 596 DEGs in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt,
    S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl (Supplementary
    Table S2). More DEGs were identified in the salt-susceptible S3 line than in the
    salt-tolerant S13 line indicating that many DEGs were involved in the salt stress
    responses (Fig. 1C). A Venn diagram of DEGs under salt stress was generated to
    identify the number of genes expressed specifically in a single comparison and
    the number of genes that overlap between four comparisons (Fig. 1D). Both lines
    shared 1894 consistently regulated DEGs, suggesting shared mechanisms of salt
    response. Additionally, the 1271 DEGs that were selectively regulated in the salt-tolerant
    S13 might be a representation of the candidate genes for salt stress tolerance.
    There were 1821 regulated DEGs found only in the salt-susceptible S3. Only 10
    DEGs were found in the overlap region of these four comparisons. A total of 1115
    up-regulated DEGs were shared between S3 and S13 genotypes compared to salt stress.
    Out of these 1115 genes, 140 genes were involved in transport activities, 113
    genes were involved in different metabolic processes, 66 genes were associated
    with kinase activity, and 56 genes belonged to different Transcription factors
    (TFs) expressed under salt stress. Fig. 1 Exploratory data analysis and RNA-seq
    analysis. A Principal component analysis plot of normalized and variance stabilized
    counts from DESeq2. Samples with similar expressions are grouped closely. B Hierarchical
    clustering of samples based on log2 transformed gene counts showing a correlation

    A number of differentially expressed genes were identified between four groups
    i.e., S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt, S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl, S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, and S3-salt
    vs. S13-salt. D Venn diagram representing the differentially expressed genes overlapping
    between four groups Full size image Gene set enrichment analysis For all DEGs
    identified in the four pairwise comparisons, a total of 2589 (65.01%), 2188 (63.18%),
    559 (57.22%), and 296 (49.66%) DEGs were assigned GO terms in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt,
    S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl, respectively.
    We identified enriched GO terms in these four groups based on a P-value. There
    were 162 and 150 GO terms enriched in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt and S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt
    (Fig. 2). No GO-enriched term was identified in S3-salt vs. S13-salt and S3-ctrl
    vs. S13-ctrl. We have also identified the over-represented GO terms in these four
    groups (Supplementary Table S3). In the salt-tolerant genotype S13, genes of high
    significance were enriched in biological processes that involved response to stress,
    and regulation of different metabolic, and biosynthesis processes. Whereas in
    salt-susceptible genotype S3, genes were significantly enriched in cellular components
    that involved organelle, membrane-bounded organelle, intracellular anatomical
    structure, and cytoplasm. For biological process terms, genes in both genotypes
    (S3 and S13) were enriched in metabolic processes, biosynthesis, and response
    to hormones, stimuli, and stress. For molecular function ontology, transport,
    binding, and catalytic activities were the significantly enriched terms in both
    genotypes (S3 and S13). For cellular components, genes were enriched in cytoplasm,
    membrane, and non-membrane bounded organelles and cellular anatomical entities.
    Common enriched terms shared by both salt-susceptible and -tolerant genotypes
    imply the common mechanism in GSR varieties to overcome the salt stress. 1241
    and 1106 genes were enriched in different metabolic processes in salt-susceptible
    (S3) and salt-tolerant (S13) genotypes, which suggest high metabolic activity
    under salt stress. The up-regulated genes were particularly enriched in binding
    activity and metabolic processes. Salt-susceptible genotype has a greater number
    of genes involved in metabolism suggesting high metabolic activity needed for
    its survival under salt stress. Fig. 2 Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
    of DEGs. A Boxplot of gene ontology of terms enriched in biological processes
    (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) in salt-susceptible
    S3 genotype. B Boxplot of gene ontology of terms enriched in biological processes,
    cellular component, and molecular function in salt-tolerant S13 genotype. The
    vertical axis shows the number of gene counts for each enriched term. P < 0.05
    value was used Full size image KEGG pathway enrichment analysis To identify the
    pathways that are enriched under salt stress, we performed KEGG pathway enrichment
    analysis using up and down-regulated DEGs identified from a pairwise comparison
    in S3-ctrl vs S3-salt and S13-ctrl vs S13-salt. The results showed that DEGs upregulated
    in the S3 genotype under salt stress were enriched in the ‘Biosynthesis of secondary
    metabolites’, ‘Alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism’, ‘MAPK signaling pathway - plant’,
    and ‘Plant hormone signal transduction pathways (Fig. 3A). In the S13 genotype
    up-regulated DEGs were enriched in ‘Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis’, ‘Cutin, suberine,
    and wax biosynthesis’, ‘Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites’, and ‘Plant hormone
    signal transduction pathways (Fig. 3B). However, DEGs down-regulated in the S13
    genotype were not enriched in any pathway. There were 49 and 47 up-regulated DEGs
    for ‘Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in S13 and S3 genotypes. However, 18
    and 13 DEGs were up-regulated for ‘plant hormone signal transduction’ in S3 and
    S13 genotypes. Both pathways are highly linked to the response to salt stress
    in plants. Fig. 3 KEGG enrichment analysis of up-regulated differentially expressed
    genes. A Bubble plot of pathways up-regulated significantly in salt-susceptible
    S3 genotype under salt stress. B Bubble plot of pathways up-regulated significantly
    in salt-tolerant S13 genotype under salt stress. The horizontal axis shows the
    GeneRatio (number of DEGs enriched in pathway/background genes). p. adjust is
    the P-value corrected by the Benjamini–Hochberg method Full size image Alpha-linolenic
    acid metabolism Jasmonic acid (JA) is a plant signaling molecule that imparts
    stress tolerance in plants [44]. Under salt stress, 9 genes that regulate α-linolenic
    acid (the precursor of JA) metabolism were differentially expressed in the salt-susceptible
    S3 genotype and 6 genes were differentially expressed in salt tolerant S13 genotype.
    The allene oxide synthase 4 AOS4 (Os02g0218800) gene was downregulated in both
    genotypes. OsOPR8 (Os02g0559400) and OsOPR4 (Os06g0215900) genes involved in JA
    biosynthesis were up-regulated in the salt-tolerant S13 genotype suggesting more
    tolerance in this genotype as compared to S3. Lipoxygenase OsLOX7 (Os05g0304600)
    was downregulated while OsLOX8 (Os08g0509100) was up-regulated in S13. OsLOX2
    (Os08g0508800) was up-regulated in both S3 and S13. The downregulation of 2 genes
    (AOS4 and OsLOX7) responsible for JA biosynthesis in salt-tolerant S13 could be
    due to a longer stress period of 12 days as many salt-responsive genes respond
    at earlier induction of salt. Hydroperoxide lyase gene OsHPL3 (Os02g0110200) was
    up-regulated while OsHPL2 (Os02g0218700) was downregulated in S3. Gene like Quinone-oxidoreductase
    QR1 (Os09g0503100) was also up-regulated in S3. Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase
    1 OsJMT1 (Os05g0102000), Acyl-CoA oxidase ACX2 (Os11g0605500), Fatty acid alpha-dioxygenase
    PIOX (Os12g0448900), and OsLOX11 (Os12g0559200) were downregulated in S3 as well.
    A total of 6 genes were downregulated in S3 for α-linolenic acid metabolism suggesting
    reduced salt tolerance in contrast to the S13. Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis Phenylpropanoids
    are a class of secondary metabolites that are derived from phenylalanine and perform
    crucial functions in the life of plants. In our findings, 23 DEGs involved in
    phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were expressed in both genotypes under salt stress.
    There were 9 DEGs up-regulated and 14 DEGs down-regulated in salt-sensitive S3.
    Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2C1 OsALDH2C1 (Os01g0591300), Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase
    1 PAL1 (Os02g0627100), Hydroxycinnamoyl transferase 3 OsHCT3 (Os06g0184900), and
    Cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 3 OsCAD3 (Os10g0430200) were up-regulated in both
    S3 and S13 genotypes. While Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase OsPAL (Os02g0626100) and
    Ferulate-5-hydroxylase 2 OsF5HL2 (Os03g0112900) were down-regulated in both genotypes.
    Cinnamoyl CoA reductase 19 OsCCR19 (Os09g0419200) was up-regulated in S3 and cinnamoyl
    CoA reductase 1 OsCCR1 (Os02g0808800) was down-regulated in S13. Phenylalanine
    ammonia-lyase 4 OsPAL4 (Os05g0427400) and 4-coumarate-coenzyme A ligase for lignin
    biosynthesis Os4CL5 (Os08g0448000) were also up-regulated in salt-tolerant S13.
    Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 7 OsPAL7 (Os04g0518400) and two genes for Caffeoyl-CoA
    3-O-methyltransferase OsCOA1 (Os06g0165800 and Os09g0481400) were down-regulated
    in S13. Class III peroxidases (PRXs) are the plant-specific enzymes that are involved
    in the various biotic and abiotic stress responses [45]. There were 16 and 11
    class III PRX genes differentially expressed in S3 and S13 genotypes. prx32 (Os02g0833900)
    was up-regulated, while prx41 (Os03g0339300), prx51 (Os03g0762400), prx109 (Os07g0676900),
    and prx125 (Os10g0109300) were down-regulated in both S3 and S13 genotypes. In
    S3 specifically, genes for prx22 (Os01g0963000), prx130 (Os11g0112400), and prx132
    (Os11g0210100) were up-regulated while genes for prx15 (Os01g0327100), prx30 (Os02g0240100),
    prx43 (Os03g0368300), prx64 (Os04g0689000), prx65 (Os05g0134400), prx110 (Os07g0677100),
    prx115 (Os07g0677600), and prx136-like (Os12g0111800) were down-regulated. In
    S13 particularly, prx11 (Os01g0294700), prx29 (Os02g0240300), and prx118 (Os08g0302000)
    genes were up-regulated whereas prx87 (Os06g0547100), Os1-CysPrxA (Os07g0638300),
    and prx129 (Os10g0566800) genes were down-regulated. More PRX genes were down-regulated
    at 12-day stress conditions in both genotypes suggesting that the cell has overcome
    the oxidative stress induced by salt stress. Identification of various transcription
    factors regulated under salt stress Transcription factors regulate the developmental
    processes, metabolic processes, and biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. A total
    of 228 and 204 transcription factors were identified that were up-regulated and
    down-regulated in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt (115, 106), S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt (87, 82),
    S3-salt vs. S13-salt (19, 11), and S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl (7, 5) (Supplementary
    Table S4). These transcription factors included 41 families of transcription factors
    which are bHLH (42), ERF (36), NAC (30), WRKY (26), MYB (25), MYB_related (25),
    bZIP (23), C2H2 (18), HSF (15), B3 (14), SBP (14), GRAS (13), Dof (11), GATA (11),
    GRF (10), LBD (10), TCP (9), MIKC_MADS (8), C3H (7), DBB (7), G2-like (7), HD-ZIP
    (7), TALE (7), ARF (6), M-type_MADS (6), FAR1 (5), ZF-HD (5), AP2 (4), CO-like
    (4), E2F/DP (3), EIL (3), NF-YA (3), NF-YB (3), ARR-B (2), CPP (2), GeBP (2),
    HB-other (2), Trihelix (2), RAV (2), YABBY (2), and NF-X1 (1). bHLH, ERF, NAC,
    WRKY, MYB, MADS, and bZIP are salt stress-responsive transcription factors expressed
    in rice. Identification of novel genes The use of RNA-seq technology can help
    find novel genes that have been skipped in earlier studies because of their unique
    expression patterns or structural differences from genes that have been extensively
    studied. We have identified 5357 novel transcripts and 3978 novel genes that were
    expressed under salt stress. To predict the coding potential and open reading
    frames among all novel transcripts identified, we used Transdecoder. To identify
    the function of newly identified genes, protein sequences of these genes were
    compared to known annotations in Nr, Swissprot, GO, KEGG, and KOG databases. The
    transcoder has identified 1,806 unique genes with functional domains. In this
    study, 1368 novel genes were assigned GO terms. For cellular components, genes
    were abundant in the cellular anatomical entity (357), membrane (168), and cell
    periphery (104). For the biological process, 50 genes were involved in the defense
    response. Most genes were assigned molecular functions and the most common terms
    in this category were binding (254), organic cyclic compound binding (169), heterocyclic
    compound binding (168), ion binding (157), and anion binding (105). 1672 genes
    were identified when a blastp search was performed against the Nr database for
    Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica. While blastp search against the SwissProt database
    has identified 1067 unique genes. The search against the Pfam database has identified
    1,659 genes with the functional domain. We also performed a BLAST search against
    EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) database for the classification of novel genes
    into functional classes and the KOG term was assigned to 1282 novel genes. Most
    of the genes were grouped into a subgroup T (Signal transduction mechanism) (Fig.
    4). We used KOBAS for KEGG pathway annotation of newly identified genes which
    has annotated 1135 genes. A total of 36 and 16 genes were involved in metabolic
    pathways (dosa01100) and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (dosa01110). Fig.

    10 SNP identification We compared the salt-susceptible S3 and salt-tolerant S13
    genotypes with the reference to look for potential SNPs that are involved in different
    responses under salt stress. We have identified 59,830 SNPs in 10 samples, including
    46,816 SNPs in genic regions and 13,014 SNPs in intergenic regions. The transitions
    type in each sample varied from 65.01 − 65.73% while the transversions type varied
    from 34.27–34.99% (Table 2). The heterozygosity rate for the samples ranged from
    4.50 to 17.21%. We also estimated the SNP density on each chromosome in non-overlapping
    bins of 1 Mb (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, we estimated the DEGs density in non-overlapping
    bins of 1 Mb (Fig. 5B). The largest peak for SNP density was observed in (Chr5:2.6–2.7
    Mb), (Chr3:1.0 − 1.1 Mb), and (Chr3:3.4–3.5 Mb). The highest peaks for DEGs density
    were located at (Chr4:2.4–2.5 Mb), (Chr3:3.0–3.1 Mb), (Chr3:3.2−3.3 Mb), and (Chr4:2.2−2.3
    Mb) respectively. Table 2 Sequencing data and alignment summary statistics Full

    quantitative expression analysis of salt-induced genes In order to validate the
    expression of genes identified as differentially expressed in RNA-seq analysis,
    we used the total RNA from the roots of all samples for Real-time quantitative
    (q) PCR. Six genes that depicted different expression patterns between salt-sensitive
    S3 and salt-tolerant S13 genotypes were assayed (Fig. 6). Our results indicate
    that Squamosa promoter-binding like protein Os06g0659100 (OsSPL10) that negatively
    regulates the salt tolerance [43] was up-regulated in the salt-sensitive S3 but
    showed the lowest and non-significant expression in salt-tolerant S13. Growth-regulating
    factor interacting factor 1 Os03g0733600 (OsGIF1) gene was up-regulated in both
    genotypes under salt stress, however, an increased relative expression was noticed
    in the tolerant genotype. Furthermore, four genes including similar to Globulin
    1 expressed protein Os08g0127900 (OsEnS-115), U-box E3ubiquitin ligase Os01g0823900
    (OsPUB3), 12-oxophytodienoic acid reductase, Jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defense
    signaling Os02g0559400 (OsOPR8), CBL-interacting protein kinase 5 Os01g0206700
    (OsCIPK5) were up-regulated in salt-tolerant genotype and down-regulated in salt-sensitive
    genotype. Fig. 6 Validation of RNA-seq results with Real-time qPCR using six genes.
    The results show the relative expression of six genes in both S3 and S13 genotypes
    under control and salt-stressed conditions. Data is represented by mean ± SD Full
    size image Discussion Plants have a number of tolerance and adaptive mechanisms
    at the biochemical and physiological levels to withstand salt stress [46]. Transcriptomics
    can help in revealing changes in the expression of genes at the whole-genome level
    which can aid in comprehending the complicated gene networks that are involved
    in plants’ adaptability to various stresses [16]. To identify these tolerance
    mechanisms, we have compared the two GSR genotypes with varying tolerance to salt
    stress at the seedling stage using RNA sequencing. In our findings, a total of
    9018 DEGs have been identified in four sets: S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt, S13-ctrl vs.
    S13-salt, S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl after 12 days of salt
    stress. These DEGs were identified using DESeq2 in R with screening thresholds
    of |log2FC| ≥ 2 or ≤ − 2 and adjusted P value < 0.05. Out of 9,018 DEGs, 44.16%
    were expressed in S3-ctrl vs. S3-salt, 38.40% in S13-ctrl vs. S13-salt, 10.83%
    in S3-salt vs. S13-salt, and 6.61% in S3-ctrl vs. S13-ctrl. Whereas 53.05% of
    genes were up-regulated and 46.95% were down-regulated, confirming the gene expression
    level change in rice root tissues due to salt exposure. Our results showed more
    up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs in salt susceptible genotype S3 than in salt-tolerant
    genotype S13. These findings are in accordance with Formentin et al. [47]. The
    gene set enrichment analysis has identified genes enriched in cellular, biological,
    and molecular processes in both genotypes such as metabolic processes, biosynthesis,
    response to hormones, stimuli, stress, transport activity, binding activity, catalytic
    activity, cytoplasm, membrane and non-membrane bounded organelles, and cellular
    anatomical entity in both genotypes. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of up-regulated
    genes expressed in both genotypes has identified biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
    phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction as enriched
    pathways. The data shows that many significantly enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways
    were consistent between the two genotypes and that indicates both salt-susceptible
    and salt-tolerant genotypes have a common salt stress adaptability mechanism.
    However, some down-regulated genes in salt susceptible S3 were also enriched in
    the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites while no same pattern was observed in
    salt-tolerant S13. Previously, it has been reported that salt stress regulates
    the same metabolic pathways in both sensitive and tolerant species, with the primary
    quantitative difference [48]. In our present study, we have identified 46 DEGs
    related to phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and 15 DEGs that are involved in α − linolenic
    acid metabolism. Under abiotic stress conditions, plants produce more flavonoids
    and polyphenols such as phenolic acids to cope with fluctuating environments [49,
    50]. During abiotic stresses of heavy metals, salt, cold, drought, UV radiations,
    and heat the polyphenol biosynthesis mechanism is activated which accumulates
    different phenolic compounds that scavenge damaging reactive oxygen species [51].
    In this study, our data showed that various DEGs in both salt-susceptible S3 and
    salt-tolerant S13 were enriched in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites,
    Alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway- plant, Plant hormone
    signal transduction pathways, Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, Cutin, suberine, and
    wax biosynthesis, flavonoids, and polyphenols biosynthesis, and peroxisomes which
    implies the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a significant mechanism
    to withstand salt stress in rice. ROS is generated under high salt concentrations
    and scavenging these ROS helps plants adapt to salt stress [52]. Hence, our data
    emphasized that the accumulation of various metabolites under salt stress and
    the biosynthesis and metabolic pathways that involve these various metabolites
    may contribute to increasing the tolerance and adaptability of rice. In our transcriptome
    data, a total of 432 transcription factors (TFs) were differentially expressed.
    Differentially expressed TFs included 41 families of TFs out of which significant
    classes were bHLH, ERF, NAC, WRKY, and MYB, which suggest the major contribution
    of these TFs in salt tolerance in rice. Up-regulation of MYB, WRKY, NAC, and bHLH
    transcription factors is related to increased production of jasmonic acid (JA)
    phytohormone [53]. Surprisingly, the number of differentially expressed TFs in
    salt susceptible S3 was higher than in the salt-tolerant S13. The difference in
    the number of differentially expressed TFs in these genotypes is due to slightly
    different mechanisms of these TFs in salt stress. The greater number of differentially
    expressed TFs suggests that these TFs might help salt-sensitive S3 of GSR to overcome
    the salt stress. Furthermore, the differential expression of TFs belonging to
    the same family implies that different TF members of the same family may have
    different functions to perform in rice response to salt stress. The bHLH genes
    contribute significantly towards the improvement of salt adaptability and are
    implicated in tolerance to salt stress harm [54]. A total of 42 bHLH TFs were
    differentially expressed in our transcriptome data under salt stress. The bHLH
    TFs are shown to be involved in responses to salt, drought, cold, harmful metals,
    and nutrient deficiencies [55]. These TFs regulate the changes in transcriptional
    expression by binding to the stress-related genes at the promoter region. Moreover,
    flavonoid biosynthesis is induced under changing environments and is regulated
    by bHLH TFs in response to abiotic stresses [56, 57]. We have identified 1806
    novel genes in our RNA-seq results. Out of these 1806 novel genes, 391 genes were
    involved in signal transduction mechanisms. This suggests that a significant number
    of genes involved in signaling processes are expressed under salt stress. Signal
    transduction mechanisms under salt stress activate multiple signaling pathways
    which enable plants to survive under salt stress [58]. Future research is required
    to understand the mechanism or functions of these genes through different molecular
    techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9. Conclusion In conclusion, we conducted comparative
    transcriptome analyses to investigate the salt tolerance and adaptability mechanism
    between salt-susceptible and -tolerant genotypes of Green Super Rice (GSR). Results
    indicated that the tolerance and coping mechanism of both genotypes after 12 days
    of stress is not significantly vary even though both genotypes have varying tolerance
    to salt stress. To better investigate the link between salt stress responses and
    gene expression we suggest the use of single-cell RNA-sequencing and gene editing
    technologies like CRISPR-Cas9. Our findings suggest the efficiency of GSR genotypes
    to survive in salt stress conditions. Importantly, findings of this study have
    provided numerous novel genes (1806 DEGs) that are involved in metabolite synthesis
    and metabolism that can be used in breeding salt-tolerant rice varieties. Identified
    novel genes in the present study will be functionally characterized which help
    to understand further genetic mechanism underlying the salt tolerant genotype.
    Further, utilizing these genes in breeding programs will help to develop the salt-resistant
    rice varieties. Data availability The RNA-seq dataset generated and analyzed in
    the present study is submitted in NCBI GEO under the accession GSE210952. References

  description: Over the last few years, most of greenhouses have been managed traditionally
    based on manpower to monitor and maintain the plants, such as watering, fertilizing,
    and using their skill in detecting plant diseases. Thus, this study focuses on
    developing a greenhouse monitoring system by using IoT technology. It aims to
    assist the local farmers in monitoring their greenhouse, instead of applying the
    conventional methods that are tedious and required more labour works. For data
    collection, parameters for chilli plants are measured using temperature and humidity
    sensors, soil moisture sensor, and light dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The
    data are sent to microcontroller and transferred to the Ubidots cloud for the
    monitoring purpose. Watering pump and exhaust fan can be activated to control
    the plant parameters so that the plant remains in its normal condition. The sensor
    data are processed through classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
    analyse the plant condition, whether the proposed method is suitable or not for
    the chilli plant to grow. Overall, a mini greenhouse prototype for chilli plant
    has been successfully constructed with a system interface on Ubidots dashboard
    to monitor the condition of the greenhouse plant. Results show that the developed
    system can be an alternative in monitoring the greenhouse condition with accuracy
    of 94.5%.

  description: Managing soil salinity in arid areas is a challenging task that is
    becoming increasingly difficult. Various management practices include using salt-tolerant
    crops like cotton and sugarbeet, plastic-mulched drip irrigation, intercropping,
    and biochar. However, studying the effectiveness of these practices can be difficult,
    costly, and time-consuming, as obtaining information on soil water and salt dynamics
    can be challenging. Numerical simulations show promise, but have limited application
    in simulating complex field experiments, such as adding ameliorants and intercropping
    systems. This study aimed to use a simulation model called HYDRUS-2D to simulate
    soil water and salt dynamics and root water uptake (RWU) in cotton and sugarbeet
    monocultures and intercropping with biochar application in an arid climate to
    minimize soil water losses through optimal irrigation under plastic-mulched drip
    irrigation systems. The results of a three-year field experiment were used to
    calibrate and validate the HYDRUS-2D model. The soil water and salt dynamics were
    measured in fields with biochar applied at three different rates [0 t ha–1 (CK),
    10 t ha–1 (B10), and 25 t ha–1 (B25)]. The R2, RRMSE and NSE showed that the soil
    hydraulic and solute transport parameters optimized in HYDRUS-2D satisfied simulation
    accuracy requirements. The simulation results showed that biochar application
    increased soil water and salt storage. Simulated RWU ranked as B10>B25>CK, consistent
    with soil water storage and yield. The B10 treatment showed promising application
    potential in RWU enhancement, evaporation and water drainage reduction, irrigation
    water conservation and farmers’ income increment. This study provides a useful
    reference for agricultural production and social benefits in arid and semiarid
    areas.

    content Highlights • Combining biochar with intercropping enhanced production
    and water use efficiency. • The model of soil water and salt dynamics for intercropping
    with biochar was established. • The simulated optimal irrigation quota saved water
    and stabilized yields. Abstract Managing soil salinity in arid areas is a challenging
    task that is becoming increasingly difficult. Various management practices include
    using salt-tolerant crops like cotton and sugarbeet, plastic-mulched drip irrigation,
    intercropping, and biochar. However, studying the effectiveness of these practices
    can be difficult, costly, and time-consuming, as obtaining information on soil
    water and salt dynamics can be challenging. Numerical simulations show promise,
    but have limited application in simulating complex field experiments, such as
    adding ameliorants and intercropping systems. This study aimed to use a simulation
    model called HYDRUS-2D to simulate soil water and salt dynamics and root water
    uptake (RWU) in cotton and sugarbeet monocultures and intercropping with biochar
    application in an arid climate to minimize soil water losses through optimal irrigation
    under plastic-mulched drip irrigation systems. The results of a three-year field
    experiment were used to calibrate and validate the HYDRUS-2D model. The soil water
    and salt dynamics were measured in fields with biochar applied at three different
    rates [0 t ha–1 (CK), 10 t ha–1 (B10), and 25 t ha–1 (B25)]. The R2, RRMSE and
    NSE showed that the soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters optimized in
    HYDRUS-2D satisfied simulation accuracy requirements. The simulation results showed
    that biochar application increased soil water and salt storage. Simulated RWU
    ranked as B10>B25>CK, consistent with soil water storage and yield. The B10 treatment
    showed promising application potential in RWU enhancement, evaporation and water

    water uptakeIrrigation quota 1. Introduction Two main challenges face sustainable
    agricultural ecosystem development: water resource scarcity and soil salinity
    (Meena et al., 2019). Water scarcity induces unhealthy and unfair water exploitation
    leading to degraded ecosystems and greater competition (Xie et al., 2022). The
    global area of saline-alkali soil is 935 million ha, 75% of which is in arid and
    semiarid areas in India, China, and Pakistan (Li et al., 2016). The salinized
    soil area is expanding by 1–2 million hectares per year, and expected to increase
    further in the coming decades due to intensified human activities and climate
    change (Hassani et al., 2021), causing annual global income losses of at least
    US$27.3 billion (Qadir et al., 2014). Improving salt-affected soils and developing
    water-saving agriculture are important strategies to ensure national food security
    and sustainable agricultural development (Srivastava et al., 2016). In the arid
    to semiarid Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the main cotton production area
    in China, about one-third of the arable land is threatened by salinization (Li
    et al., 2021), causing losses of about 720 million kg grain per year (about 8.6%
    of the total grain output) and 130.5 million kg cotton per year (about 9% of the
    total cotton output), equating to about 3.5 billion Yuan per year (8% of the total
    agricultural output value) (http://3w.detts.org/Item/7659.aspx). Due to its location,
    Xinjiang’s food security depends on local crop production, contingent on irrigation
    and groundwater. Thus, it is critical to grow ‘more crop per drop’ by reducing
    water losses and improving irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) to alleviate
    local agricultural development issues and meet food security (Ning et al., 2021).
    Various strategies have been proposed to address these challenges, such as plastic
    mulched drip irrigation (Ning et al., 2021), modifying farm management strategies,
    using soil amendments, and planting salt-tolerant crops like cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) and sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) (Hong et al., 2017, Yang et al.,
    2016). Haas and Défago (2005) reported that monoculture systems, such as continuous
    cotton cultivation, decrease the quality and quantity of produce. In contrast,
    intercropping systems that cultivate two or more crops in the same field at the
    same time can increase land and water use efficiencies, reduce soil erosion, alleviate
    drought risk, and increase yield and farmer income (Gou et al., 2016, Ren et al.,
    2019, Zhang et al., 2018). However, few studies have investigated intercropping
    systems in arid and semiarid climates. Biochar is a widely recommended soil amendment
    for improving soil quality in agricultural production systems (Zhao et al., 2020).
    Biochar is usually a stable carbon-rich porous material produced by pyrolysis
    of waste biomass materials (e.g. plant straw, cinder or wood chips) under oxygen-limited
    or oxygen-free conditions at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000°C or hydrothermal
    carbonization at low temperature. The special characteristics of biochar affected
    the physical and chemical properties of the soil at some extent. The porous structure
    of biochar can reduce soil bulk density and increase soil porosity, which also
    induces biochar to effectively improve soil water capacity and retain more water
    (Abrol et al., 2016, Burrell et al., 2016). Biochar increases the organic carbon
    content of soil, which promotes the binding of polyvalent cations with soil particles,
    thereby improving the soil agglomeration stability and preventing soil degradation
    (Kim et al., 2016). Besides, biochar can also be employed as a source of nutrients
    including available nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium (Laghari
    et al., 2015; Zheng et al., 2021). The effect of biochar on soil nutrient retention
    and utilization was greater than that of direct nutrient supply (Qian et al.,
    2023). Owing to soil quality and nutrient condition, biochar has been regarded
    as an effective ameliorant in promoting plant growth and yield (Mehdizadeh et
    al., 2020, Zhao et al., 2020). However, the performance of biochar mainly depends
    on the source of raw material, pyrolysis parameters and an appropriate application
    amount (Fu et al., 2019, Saifullah et al., 2018), as excessive amounts can aggravate
    soil salinity in arid and semiarid climates with high ash contents (Liang et al.,
    2021) and question the economic feasibility of a production system. Various management
    practices, including salt-tolerant crops under plastic mulched drip irrigation
    in an intercropping system supplied with biochar, have been adopted and tested
    in Xinjiang (Li et al., 2022b, Wang et al., 2022b). However, understanding the
    effects of these measures on soil water and solute transport, RWU, and soil water
    balance is critical for their success. Soil salinity and water scarcity complicate
    irrigation in Xinjiang. A high soil salt concentration reduces the amount of available
    water for RWU for plant function, crop production, and sustainable irrigation
    (Poulose et al., 2021). Soil evaporation and plant transpiration also play a vital
    role in the soil water balance, as do soil water and salt distribution and composition.
    However, monitoring these processes can be challenging, limiting our understanding
    of soil water and salt dynamics and RWU. Numerical simulation is an efficient
    approach to investigating optimal irrigation management practices (Ahmad et al.,
    2018, Aggarwal et al., 2017), using models such as HYDRUS (1D/2D/3D) (Šimůnek
    et al., 1999) with its flexible application conditions including the following.
    (i) Development of reasonable irrigation schedules for salt management. Xu et
    al. (2019) used the HYDRUS-1D model to design an optimal soil desalting irrigation
    plan by simulating salt transport and the effects of different irrigation practices
    on soil desalting. Liu et al. (2021) determined the placement of the subsurface
    pipe below the clay layer to obtain the best water drainage and salt discharge
    effects using HYDRUS-2D simulation results for soil water and salt transport.
    (ii) Soil water movement under additive conditions. Wang et al. (2018a) first
    applied HYDRUS-1D to simulate soil water dynamics in homogeneous and layered water-repellent
    soils. They later simulated the RWU of summer maize grown in water-repellent soils
    and revealed the possible mechanisms of soil water repellency for decreasing yield
    (Wang et al., 2021a). Li et al. (2022a) recommended an optimal amount and mixed
    depth of biochar application according to simulation scenarios in HYDRUS-1D. (iii)
    Soil water and salt dynamics in intercropping systems. Li et al. (2015) simulated
    two-dimensional SWC distributions and designed an optimal irrigation plan for
    a tomato–corn intercropping system with HYDRUS-2D. Chen et al. (2022) used HYDRUS-2D
    to simulate soil nitrogen dynamics in a tomato–corn intercropping system with
    different crop spatial arrangements to determine the most suitable spatial arrangement.
    Overall, the HYDRUS model has been confirmed to simulate soil water and salt dynamics
    under different filed productivity improvement conditions, such as drip irrigation,
    biochar and intercropping. However, the performance of HYDRUS model for simulating
    soil water and salt dynamics under integrated application of plastic mulched drip
    irrigation, biochar-applied soils and intercropping systems need further study.
    This study aimed to (1) calibrate and validate soil water hydraulic and solute
    transport parameters of biochar-applied soils; (2) simulate soil water and salt
    dynamics and RWU in cotton and sugarbeet monocultures and intercropping; (3) optimize
    irrigation schedules to reduce soil water losses under plastic mulched drip irrigation
    in Xinjiang. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental design 2.1.1. Study area
    and soil and biochar properties The field experiments for monoculture and intercropping
    of cotton and sugarbeet with biochar applications were conducted at Bayingol Mongolian
    Autonomous Prefecture in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous, China (86°56′ E, 40°53′
    N) from 2018–2020. The area has a temperate continental desert climate, with an
    annual mean temperature of 10.9°C, precipitation of 34.1 mm, and pan evapotranspiration
    of 2417 mm. Before crop sowing, soil samples were collected from the 0–100 cm
    soil layer. Soil particle composition was determined using a Malvern laser particle
    size analyzer. Soil textures were silty clay loam at 0–60 cm and sand at 60–100 cm
    depth (Wrb, 2006). Soil electrical conductivity (EC) was measured with a DDS-303
    conductivity meter, with the average soil salt content (SSC) at 0–60 cm depth
    ranging from 0.1–0.2%, categorized as a light salinized level (Xu, 1980). Biochar
    was prepared from the processing residue of palm (Trachycarpus fortunei) oil by
    slow pyrolysis at 600 ℃ under anaerobic conditions. The cooled biochar was milled
    to powdery consistency to increase contact with the soil, with a particle size
    <2 mm, bulk density of 0.5 g cm–3, and specific surface area of 217 m2 g–1. The
    initial electrical conductivity (EC1:5) of the biochar was 11.02 mS cm–1. Ferrous
    sulfate was used to acidify biochar to a pH of less than 7 (eventually measured
    at 6.7) to prevent soil pH increasing in saline-alkaline soils following biochar
    application. 2.1.2. Field planting and irrigation systems Three planting systems
    were used in the field experiments: cotton monoculture, cotton–sugarbeet intercropping,
    and sugarbeet monoculture. Xinluzhong #66 and Detian #2 were the cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) varieties, respectively. The planting
    system for cotton monoculture comprised four rows of cotton plants, with one plastic
    film and two drip lines. The intercropping system comprised four rows of cotton
    intercropped with one row of sugarbeet. For sugarbeet monoculture, the planting
    system comprised thre rows of sugarbeet plants, with one plastic film and two
    drip lines. Figure S1 is a schematic diagram of the three planting patterns. The
    average discharge rate of each drip emitter was about 2.0 L h−1. 2.1.3. Biochar,
    irrigation, and fertilizer applications Before sowing, biochar was mixed into
    the top 0–30 cm soil layer. In 2018, the initial biochar application amounts were
    0 t ha–1 (CK) and 10 t ha–1 (B10); in 2019 and 2020, 25 t ha–1 (B25) of biochar
    was added. Each treatment was replicated three times. Each plot had an area of
    6 m×6 m, with the treatment plots in a randomized block design. The experiments
    were carried out between April 11 and September 24 in 2018 and 2019, and April
    15 and September 20 in 2020. The irrigation and fertilization application schedules
    were the same for all treatments each year. The irrigation quota was 260 mm for
    all three experimental years. For each crop growing season, 450, 265, and 100 kg ha–1
    of urea (N≥46%), diammonium phosphate (P2O5≥46%), and potassium sulfate (K2O≥52%),
    respectively, were applied as fertilizers. Table S1 presents the irrigation and
    fertilizer application schedules. 2.2. Data collection and processing 2.2.1. Meteorological
    and groundwater data Meteorological data including rainfall, air temperature,
    relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed were collected using a portable
    small automatic weather station (HOBO U30, USA) installed at the experimental
    field. The average groundwater table in the study area ranged from 1.2–1.8 m.
    The daily groundwater table during crop growing periods was measured with a monitoring
    well. ET0 (mm) was estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al.,
    1998) (Figure S1). 2.2.2. Soil water content and soil salt content Soil samples
    were collected with a steel auger on different days after sowing (DAS), every
    10 cm within 0–40 cm and every 20 cm within 40–100 cm from 2018–2020. The oven
    drying method was used to obtain soil water content (θv). Soil samples were ground
    and passed through a 2 mm sieve. The soil salt content (SSC; g kg–1) was calculated
    as SSC=3.4328EC1:5+1.0513 (R2=0.95) and converted to SSCv as follows: (1) where
    SSCv is the concentration in volume (mg cm–3), and BD is the soil bulk density
    (g cm–3). 2.2.3. Leaf area index and cotton and sugarbeet yields Leaf area index
    (LAI) was measured using a tape, and calculated as the product of the greatest
    length and width (García-Vila et al., 2009): (2) where is actual cotton planting
    density (plant m–2), m is the total number of measured plants, n is the total
    number of leaves on a single plant, L and W are leaf length and width (cm), respectively,
    I and j are the jth leaf on the ith plant, and 0.84 is the conversion coefficient
    (Zong et al., 2021). Three strips (each 6.67 m2) were randomly selected in each
    plot to measure yield. The number of cotton bolls with diameters >2 cm and the
    number of sugarbeet plants were recorded. Twenty cotton bolls were randomly selected
    from each of the lower third, middle third, and upper third of the cotton plants
    to calculate yield. The sugarbeet plants were dug up to weigh tubers and calculate
    yield. The IWUE of the monocultures and intercropping system were calculated as
    follows: (3) where Yc and Ys are yields of cotton and sugarbeet in the monoculture
    system (t ha–1), Pc and Ps are the planting proportion for cotton and sugarbeet
    in the intercropping system, and are the yields of cotton and sugarbeet (t ha–1)
    in the intercropping system, respectively, and IRR is the irrigation amount (mm).
    2.3. Numerical simulation of soil water and solute dynamics 2.3.1. Main theory
    The Richards equation and convection-dispersion equation were used to describe
    soil water and solute transport dynamics: (4) where θv is volumetric soil water
    content (cm3 cm–3), h is matric potential (cm), z is vertical soil depth (cm)
    (downward is positive), x is horizontal distance (cm), t is time (day), K(θ) is
    unsaturated soil water conductivity (cm day–1), S(h) is root water uptake term
    (cm3 cm–3 day–1), C is solute concentration (mg cm–3), D is saturated-unsaturated
    hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient (cm2 day–1), and q is water flux (cm day–1).
    The diameter of the wetted surface area formed with drip irrigation was 10 cm.
    Water flux (q) was calculated as: (5) where is emitter rate (L h–1), is irrigation
    duration (h), and is wetted boundary width (cm). The van Genuchten-Mualem equation
    (Van Genuchten, 1980) describes the soil water retention curve and soil hydraulic
    conductivity: (6) (7) where θs is saturated soil water content (cm3 cm–3), θr
    is residual water content (cm3 cm–3), Ks is saturated hydraulic conductivity (cm
    day–1), saturation ratio Se = (θs –θr)/(θ –θr), l is pore-connectivity parameter
    (fixed at 0.5), α is inverse of the air-entry value, n (>1) is pore-size distribution
    index, and m=1–1/n. A multiplication model was recommended to describe plant RWU
    under water and salinity stress conditions (Feddes et al., 1978): (8) where is
    a dimensionless stress response function, and Lp is the length of the soil surface
    associated with transpiration (cm), Lp values of 50 cm, 50 cm, and 55 cm in cotton,
    sugarbeet, and cotton–sugarbeet intercropping were used, and b(x, z, t) is the
    normalized root water uptake distribution function (cm–2). Tp is the potential
    transpiration rate (cm day–1), estimated as: (9) Tp= ETp–Ep where ETp is potential
    evaporation (cm day–1), and ETp= Kc ET0, where Kc is crop coefficient. Kc for
    the cotton–sugarbeet intercropping system was estimated using a comprehensive
    coefficient without considering the height difference between cotton and sugarbeet
    (Li et al., 2019): (10) where Pc and Ps are planting area proportions of cotton
    (=0.8) and sugarbeet (=0.2) in the intercropping system, and Kcc and Kcs are the
    crop coefficients of cotton and sugarbeet, respectively. Specific values for these
    parameters were adopted from the FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 (Allen et
    al., 1998). Ep is estimated as (Belmans et al., 1983, Goudriaan, 1985): (11) Ep=
    ETp e-k LAI where k is dimensionless plant canopy radiation attenuation coefficient
    (0.35 <k< 0.75), set at 0.55, 0.60, and 0.45 for cotton, sugarbeet, and cotton–sugarbeet
    intercropping, respectively (Aggarwal et al., 2017, Yang et al., 2019). The HYDRUS-2D
    model was used to simulate soil water and solute dynamics. 2.3.2. Initial and
    boundary conditions The model simulation area for soil water and solute dynamics
    was in a rectangular domain (120 cm × 68 cm). The simulation started 55, 55, and
    50 DAS in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, to improve the accuracy and decrease
    root effects during early growth. The observed θv and SSCv were set as the initial
    conditions: (12) where θ0 and c0 are the initial θv and initial salt content,
    respectively. The upper boundary conditions are time-variable flux, no-flux, and
    atmospheric types for the dripper, mulched area, and no-mulched area, respectively.
    The lower boundary is the variable pressure head type to consider groundwater
    table depth changes. No-flux boundary conditions were set for the left and right
    boundaries (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (174KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Modeling domain, boundary condition setting, and observation
    points. 2.3.3. Model calibration, validation, and application The CK treatment
    had two soil layers (0–60 cm, 60–120 cm), while the biochar-applied treatments
    had three soil layers (0–30 cm, 30–60 cm, and 60–120 cm). For initial soil hydraulic
    and salt transport parameters, please refer to Wang et al. (2022a) and Li et al.
    (2018). The parameters were calibrated by θv and SSC values of cotton monoculture
    treatments and validated by θv and SSC for the sugarbeet monoculture and cotton-sugarbeet
    intercropping treatments. The HYDRUS-2D model performance was evaluated using
    the coefficient of determination (R2), relative root mean square error (RRMSE),
    and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE). After calibration and validation,
    the simulated θv and salt results were used to calculate RWU, evapotranspiration,
    soil water storage (SWS), soil salt storage (SSS), and soil water balance components
    from 0–40 cm depth. The optimized irrigation amounts in different years were obtained
    from soil water balance components at different crop growth stages. The distance
    in y direction ( ) was set to 1 cm for ease of understanding. Thus, the digital
    SWS and SSS were obtained as follows: (14) 3. Results 3.1. Crop growth parameters
    The Kc values at seedling, squaring, flower-bolling, and boll-opening stages were
    0.13, 0.69, 1.15, and 0.60 for cotton monoculture, 0.17, 1.16, 0.88, and 0.62
    for cotton–sugarbeet intercropping, and 0.34, 0.80, 1.20, and 0.70 for sugarbeet
    monoculture, respectively. Biochar application affected the LAI and yields of
    cotton and sugarbeet in both monoculture and intercropping systems, and thus IWUE
    (Table 1, Table 2, S2, and S3). The biochar-applied treatments had higher LAIs,
    crop yields, and IWUEs than the CK treatments (Table 3). The IWUE calculation
    for cotton and sugarbeet monocultures indicated the same change rates for yield
    and IWUE. The cotton monoculture yields and IWUE increased by 19.4% in 2018 (B10),
    25.5% and 21.3% in 2019, and 45.5% and 18.2% in 2020 (B10 and B25, respectively)
    compared to CK. For cotton–sugarbeet intercropping, cotton yields increased by
    16.5% in 2018 (B10), 22.5% and 25.0% in 2019, and 25.1% and 34.4% in 2020 (B10
    and B25, respectively), and sugarbeet yields increased by 31.7% in 2018 (B10),
    38.4% and 40.9% in 2019, and 79.4% and 24.3% in 2020 (B10 and B25, respectively).
    The intercropping IWUE increased by 23.1% in 2018 (B10), 29.6% and 32.2% in 2019,
    and 52.4% and 33.2% in 2020 (B10 and B25, respectively). The sugarbeet monoculture
    yields and IWUE increased by 29.5% in 2018 (B10), 39.7% and 24.3% in 2019, and
    33.6% and 23.5% in 2020 (B10 and B25, respectively). The B10 treatment had the
    highest LAI, yield, and IWUE in all planting systems in all years except intercropping
    in 2019. Table 1. Crop coefficient (Kc) and leaf area index (LAI) of cotton at

    biochar application on the HYDRUS-2d simulation parameters (Table 3). Compared
    to the CK treatment, biochar application (B10 and B25) increased θs, Ks, and the
    soil’s longitudinal dispersivity (DL) and transverse dispersivity (DT). The simulation
    results of soil water and salt transport using the HYDRUS-2D model showed good
    agreement with the observed data (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The statistical analysis of
    the observed and simulated values revealed R2 values > 0.75 and 0.83, RRMSE <
    9.4% and 14.2%, and NSE > 0.73 and 0.80 for soil water and salt simulation, respectively.
    Therefore, the calibrated and validated soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters
    of the HYDRUS-2D model accurately captured the soil water and salt dynamics and
    thus could be used to analyze the soil water balance and predict irrigation scenarios.

    and salt dynamics and storage In cotton monoculture (Figure S3), the θv at 0–40 cm
    depth increased rapidly following irrigation and precipitation, gradually decreasing
    during the two consecutive irrigation events. Fig. 4 presents the two-dimensional
    soil water distribution at 0–40 cm depth before and after irrigation. Before irrigation,
    the root zone and no-mulch zone had very low θv. After irrigation, the soil water
    first infiltrated the zone around the dripper and then gradually increased θv
    in the no-mulched zone. The B10 and B25 treatments had higher θv than the CK treatment
    in all three planting systems. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    The contour line units are cm3 cm–3. CK, B10, and B25 denote biochar rates of
    0, 10, and 25 t ha–1. The θv at 60–100 cm depth was less responsive to irrigation
    or precipitation. As soil depth increased, the θv increased the most within the
    0–40 cm layer, followed by the 40–60 cm and 60–100 cm layers. Compared to CK with
    biochar-applied for the same experimental year, the θv in the same soil layer
    increased with increasing biochar application amount (Figure S3). In line with
    θv dynamics, SWS at 0–40 cm depth also fluctuated with irrigation, increasing
    after irrigation and gradually decreasing thereafter until the next irrigation
    (Fig. 5). For example, in 2019, the SWS in the cotton monoculture, intercropping
    system, and sugarbeet monoculture ranged from 117–178, 109–166, and 116–168 cm3
    in the CK treatment, 120–186, 112–168, and 118–172 cm3 in the B10 treatment, and
    116–175, 114–177, and 122–179 cm3 in the B25 treatment, respectively. Across all
    planting systems and experimental years, SWS was ranked B10>B25>CK. Overall, the
    intercropping system had lower SWS than the cotton monoculture. Download : Download

    CK, B10, and B25 denote biochar rates of 0, 10, and 25 t ha–1. Similar to soil
    water dynamics, irrigation and precipitation greatly affected soil salt dynamics
    at 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm, and 30–40 cm depth (Figure S4). However, in contrast
    to θv, soil salt decreased rapidly and then gradually increased during two consecutive
    irrigation events. Owing to the shallow and salty groundwater in the experimental
    site, soil salt content in topsoil fluctuated with seasons. Soil salt was migrated
    to the topsoil in the dry season, leached downward during irrigation and rainfall,
    and gradually accumulated in the topsoil again in late plant growth season when
    soil was dry. Following irrigation, salt in the surface layer was transported
    with infiltrated water, increasing the salt content in deeper layers. With increased
    irrigation time, salt at the surface increased due to soil evaporation. The SSC
    at 40–60 cm and 60–100 cm depth was less affected by irrigation. Biochar application
    increased SSC compared to CK, particularly in the B25 treatment in 2020 (Figure
    S4 h). This was mainly resulted from the rich plant ash content in biochar that
    caused the problem of introducing salt to soils when biochar was applied at a
    large dosage (B25 treatment). Figure S5 presents the two-dimensional soil salt
    distribution at 0–40 cm depth before and after irrigation. Before irrigation,
    soil water evaporation increased the surface salt content in the root zone and
    no-mulched zone. However, following irrigation, salt content in the root zone
    rapidly decreased, while it slightly decreased in the no-mulched zone. Fig. 6
    illustrates SSS at 0–40 cm depth for the cotton monoculture, cotton–sugarbeet
    intercropping, and sugarbeet monoculture. The SSS trends fluctuated with irrigation,
    gradually increasing by the end of the growing period. For instance, the SSS in
    the cotton monoculture, intercropping system, and sugarbeet monoculture in 2019
    ranged 10–13, 7–13, and 10–14 g in the CK treatment, 11–14, 8–14, and 9–16 g in
    the B10 treatment, and 10–14, 11–15, and 12–16 g in the B25 treatment, respectively.
    Across all planting systems and experimental years, the SSS was ranked B25>B10>CK.
    The intercropping system generally had smaller SSS than the monocultures. Download

    Soil water balance components 3.4.1. Root water uptake (RWU) The biochar application
    amount and irrigation affected daily RWU. Figure S6 presents the two-dimensional
    distribution of daily RWU at 0–40 cm depth before irrigation (91 DAS) and after
    irrigation (93 DAS) in 2019. Irrigation greatly increased RWU, both horizontally
    and vertically. Compared to the CK treatment, the B10 and B25 treatments increased
    the RWU of cotton monoculture, cotton–sugarbeet intercropping, and sugarbeet monoculture
    before and after irrigation. Fig. 7 shows the daily RWU fluctuation with irrigation.
    The largest daily RWU values for cotton monoculture were 0.69, 0.38, and 0.41 cm
    in the CK treatment and 0.79, 0.42, and 0.43 cm in the B10 treatment in 2018,
    2019, and 2020, and 0.41 and 0.42 cm in the B25 treatment in 2019 and 2020, respectively
    (Fig. 7). The largest daily RWU values for the intercropping system were 0.88,
    0.41, and 0.44 cm in the CK treatment and 1.55, 0.45, and 0.48 cm in the B10 treatment
    in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and 0.44 and 0.50 cm in the B25 treatment in 2019 and
    2020, respectively. The largest daily RWU values for sugarbeet monoculture were
    0.46, 0.34, and 0.43 cm in the CK treatment and 0.74, 0.46, and 0.45 cm in the
    B10 treatment in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and 0.41 and 0.44 cm in the B25 treatment
    in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Overall, the intercropping system had a larger
    RWU than cotton or sugarbeet monoculture (Fig. 7), and biochar application increased
    RWU compared to CK treatment. The RWU results were generally consistent with crop
    yield (Table 3), indicating that a higher RWU led to higher yield. Download :

    and 0.07, 0.09, and 0.16 cm in the B10 treatment in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and
    0.07 and 0.15 cm in the B25 treatment in 2019 and 2020, respectively (Fig. 8).
    The largest daily Ea for the intercropping system was 0.10, 0.13, and 0.16 cm
    in the CK treatment and 0.06, 0.05, and 0.15 cm in the B10 treatment in 2018,
    2019, and 2020, and 0.06 and 0.13 cm in the B25 treatment in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
    The largest daily Ea for sugarbeet monoculture was 0.19, 0.15, and 0.16 cm in
    the CK treatment and 0.30, 0.12, and 0.15 cm in the B10 treatment in 2018, 2019,
    and 2020, and 0.13 and 0.14 cm in the B25 treatment in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
    The sugarbeet monoculture had a higher Ea than cotton monoculture and cotton–sugarbeet
    intercropping (Fig. 8). Biochar application decreased Ea, with the rates of change
    increasing with increase application amounts (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res

    and 25 t ha–1. 3.4.3. Soil water balance The soil water balance at 0–40 cm depth
    for cotton monoculture system indicated that biochar application increased the
    cumulative RWU (CRWU) more than the CK treatment but decreased cumulative evaporation
    (CE) except for the B25 treatment in 2020 (Table 5). The highest CRWU values in
    2018, 2019, and 2020 were 24.2 cm (B10), 21.9 cm (B25), and 21.1 cm (B10), respectively.
    The highest CE values in 2018, 2019, and 2020 were 1.6 cm (CK), 5.2 cm (CK), and
    3.7 cm (B25), respectively. The B10 treatment had the highest CRWU and lowest
    CE than the other treatments in the three experimental years. The cumulative drainage
    (CD) varied with biochar application amount and experimental year. For the depth
    of the soil under study, positive CD values indicated that soil water drained
    into deeper soil layers, i.e. irrigation water may be wasted, while negative CD
    values indicated that soil water in the deeper soil layer was absorbed, i.e. salt
    in the deep soil would be absorbed by plants. Overall, excessive CD will result
    in a large amount of irrigation water waste, meanwhile, negative CD will threaten
    crop growth because of salt accumulation and water deficit. The B10 treatment
    had a larger CD than the CK treatment in 2018, with contrasting results in 2019
    and 2020. The B10 and B25 treatments decreased CD by 44.6% and 43.1% in 2019 and
    12.4% and 11.5% in 2020, respectively. Soil water balance results of intercropping
    and sugarbeet monoculture were similar to cotton monoculture (Tables S4 and S5).
    3.5. Application of HYDRUS-2D for optimizing irrigation schedule The optimized
    total irrigation amounts for the CK, B10, and B25 treatments were 220, 230, and
    230 mm ha–1 in 2019 and 210, 220, and 220 mm ha–1 in 2020, respectively (Table
    5), saving 40, 30, and 30 mm irrigation water in 2019 and 50, 40, and 40 mm irrigation
    water in 2020. The changes in irrigation amount in the CK, B10, and B25 treatments
    equated to 15.4%, 11.5%, and 11.5% in 2019 and 19.2%, 15.4%, and 15.4% in 2020,
    respectively. According to local irrigation water prices (0.15 Yuan m–3), reducing
    irrigation water by 30 mm (300 m3), 40 mm (400 m3), and 50 mm (500 m3) would save
    45 Yuan (0.15 Yuan m–3 × 300 m3), 60 Yuan (0.15 Yuan m–3 × 400 m3) and 75 Yuan
    (0.15 Yuan m–3 × 500 m3) per hectare. The soil water balance results showed that
    reducing irrigation amounts did not decrease the CRWU in the three treatments.
    The CD values in the CK, B10, and B25 treatments decreased from 6.5 to 0.0 cm,
    2.8–0.2 cm, and 3.7–0.7 cm in 2019, and 7.8 to –0.1 cm, 7.3 to –0.1 cm, and 6.9
    to –0.2 cm in 2020, respectively. 4. Discussion 4.1. Effects of integrating biochar
    and intercropping on soil water, salt, and crops Both observed data and simulated
    results with HYDRUS-2D demonstrated the effects of integrating biochar and intercropping
    on soil water, salt, and crops. The mechanisms of biochar increasing the soil
    water is attributed to the vesicular structure, and high specific surface area
    (217 m2 g−1) enhancing soil water retention capacity. In addition, soil physical
    properties were improved after the application of biochar (Wang et al., 2022b),
    which would enhance salt leaching. Biochar application increased LAI, crop yield,
    and IWUE, attributed to the biochar’s abundant nutrient contents (e.g., N, P,
    and K) (Zhao et al., 2020). The biochar used in this study was confirmed to increase
    soil organic matter (Wang et al., 2022b), which caused a certain buffer effect,
    delayed the return of salt to soil, neutralized soil alkalinity, improved soil
    nutrients due to its high adsorption capacity (Zhao et al., 2020). Furthermore,
    Qian et al. (2023) revealed that the pyroligneous solution, which was a by-product
    of high-temperature pyrolysis to produce biochar, could further alleviate salinity
    pressure. However, the B25 treatment improved cotton and sugarbeet monoculture
    performance less than the B10 treatment (Table 2, Table 3). Similar results have
    been reported in other studies. For instance, Pandit et al. (2018) applied biochar
    at 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 40 t ha–1 to acidic silty loam soil grown with maize,
    reporting an optimal amount of 15 t ha−1 from an agronomic and economic perspective.
    Zhao et al. (2020) applied biochar at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 t ha–1 to maize,
    reporting 20 t ha−1 as the optimal amount based on soil properties and crop yield.
    This is mainly due to that biochar contains large amounts of ash, with many carbonates
    such as alkali and alkaline earth metals, heavy metals, and sesquioxides. When
    biochar is applied at a large dosage, it can increase SSC and threaten crop growth
    (Li et al., 2018). Thus, the biochar application increased the soil salt contents
    in all planting systems, as verified in the simulation results for salt dynamics
    (Figures S4 and S5). LAI influenced Tp (Eq. 13), implying that biochar application
    and planting measures also affected Tp through affecting LAI. Accordingly, biochar
    application and intercropping affected the RWU (Table 4). Biochar increased the
    RWU compared to the CK treatment, likely due to the improved soil physical environment
    increasing LAI (Aggarwal et al., 2017). Cai et al. (2018) reported that silty
    soil had more water available for root extraction and, thus, RWU than stony soils.
    In this study, the biochar’s abundant pores and low bulk density improved soil
    structure to some extent. The crop yield trend was consistent with RWU, i.e.,
    a higher RWU led to a higher yield. Similarly, Aggarwal et al. (2017) reported
    that the treatment with the highest RWU had the greatest productivity. Wang et
    al. (2021) found that soil water repellency decreased the RWU of summer maize,
    further decreasing yield. They also reported that a higher RWU could reduce evaporation,
    as found in our study (Table 4). Table 4. Simulated soil water balance components

    4.2. Simulation of integration of mulched drip irrigation, biochar and intercropping
    The HYDRUS model has been widely used due to its flexibility in boundary, initial,
    and experimental conditions (Yang et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2022). However,
    when it was used to simulate soil water and salt dynamics with additive application,
    it was mostly focused on column infiltration or controlled experiments. Meanwhile,
    the simulations seldomly considered the integration of drip irrigation, additive
    application and intercropping in the field. For instance, Wang et al., 2018a,
    Wang et al., 2018b, Wang et al., 2021a, Wang et al., 2021b conducted a series
    of studies using HYDRUS-1D to simulate water movement in additive applied soils,
    including column infiltration in homogeneous and heterogeneous water-repellent
    soils, and the RWU of summer maize in water-repellent soils under a rain shelter
    and its response to climate change. Wang et al. (2022) applied HYDRUS-2D to simulate
    the effects of biochar strategies, including application level, application depth,
    irrigation water depth, and initial soil moisture, on water loss and IWUE, revealing
    that biochar can slow soil water infiltration, reduce water loss, alleviate the
    waste of irrigation water, and increase IWUE. Li et al. (2022a) simulated soil
    water dynamics with HYDRUS-1D under different biochar application amounts and
    depths and recommended the optimal amount and depth of biochar application according
    to the simulation scenarios. Other studies used HYDRUS-2D to simulate soil water
    and solute dynamics and RWU in intercropping systems (Chen et al., 2022, Li et
    al., 2015). In this study, we enhanced the HYDRUS-2D model for simulating soil
    water and salt transport by considering the effects of biochar on the van Genuchten
    parameters and soil solute transport parameters under mulched and intercropping
    systems (Table 3). The biochar’s low bulk density (0.5 g m–3) and small particle
    size (<2 mm) increased θs and Ks. Moreover, the abundant, large pores in biochar
    increased soil pore size, further increasing Ks, DL, and DT (Wang et al., 2022b).
    After calibration and validation, the simulated soil water and salt content values
    generally agreed with the measured values. The HYDRUS-2D model also successfully
    captured the soil water and salt content dynamics following irrigation or precipitation.
    This study differs from other studies in that it is the first to use the HYDRUS-2D
    model to simulate soil water and salt dynamics and RWU in biochar-applied soils
    for cotton and sugarbeet monocultures and intercropping. Table 5, Table 6, Table

    utilization of agricultural resources The integration of intercropping and biochar
    application in this study demonstrated an efficient utilization of agricultural
    resources, which increased water use efficiency and crop yields compared to monoculture
    crops with the same planting area, irrigation, and fertilizer amounts (Table 2).
    It was confirmed that integration of intercropping system with biochar application
    was an efficiency strategy to improve farmland productivity. Besides, this study
    furtherly conducted simulations with the HYDRUS-2D to optimize irrigation schedules,
    which was an important issue for alleviating water scarcity in the arid and semi-arid
    areas (Li et al., 2023). Previous studies have confirmed reliability of the HYDRUS-2D
    model in optimizing irrigation schedules. Zhang et al. (2022) applied HYDRUS-2D
    simulation results to optimize drip irrigation with alternate use of fresh and
    brackish waters in corn experiments under salt stress. Compared to conservation
    agriculture with flood irrigation and flood-irrigated puddled transplanted rice.
    Rana et al. (2022) used HYDRUS-2D model simulations to recommend conservation
    agriculture with subsurface drip irrigation for precise water utilization and
    reduced water loss. Groenveld et al. (2021) used the modified HYDRUS (2D/3D) model
    to determine the optimal irrigation water, NO3–-N concentration, and seasonal
    NO3–-N application for cucumber. Different from previous studies, this study used
    the HYDRUS-2D model to well simulate soil water and salt dynamics and calculated
    soil water balance, enabling the adjustment of irrigation schedules to save water
    resources under drip irrigation, biochar application and intercropping condition.
    The CD results indicated that irrigation amounts were not always appropriate,
    with large amounts of wasted water induced by draining into the deeper soil layers
    rather than absorbed by plants. Therefore, the simulated CRWU with HYDRUS-2D after
    reducing irrigation water was not decreased, which was owing to reduction of CD
    and insurance of crop available water (3.5 part). It is important to verify the
    adjusted irrigation schedules with crop models to ensure they do not adversely
    impact crop yields. In addition, it should focus on real-time water dynamic simulation
    with the HYDRUS-2D model to provide a more powerful reference for optimizing irrigation
    schedules (i.e. when and how much water to irrigate) in the future study. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, the integration strategy of mulched drip irrigation, biochar and
    intercropping was adopted to enhance agricultural water and soil resources use
    efficiency. Furthermore, the HYDRUS-2D model was applied to optimize irrigation
    schedule under biochar-applied and intercropping conditions, which was seldomly
    studied before. Results showed that biochar application and intercropping could
    effectively enhance crop yields and manage water and soil use. After the calibration
    and validation, the HYDRUS-2D model well-simulated soil water and salt dynamics
    of biochar-applied soils in both monoculture and intercropping systems. It revealed
    that biochar application increased SWS, reduced Ea and water drainage, and improved
    RWU, increasing crop yields. The optimal irrigation schedule was crucial to enhance
    IWUE, reduce production costs for farmers and raise the social economic benefits,
    especially for the arid and semi-arid areas. This study contributes to understanding
    biochar and intercropping mechanisms for the efficient utilization of agricultural
    resources and provides reference for managers to make decisions. In the future,
    it is important to verify the adjusted irrigation schedules with crop models.
    In addition, it also should focus on real-time water and salt dynamic simulation
    to provide a reference for optimizing irrigation schedules during the crop growth
    seasons to maintain agriculture sustainable development. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Globally, the soils underlying managed grasslands are an important
    reservoir of carbon (C), with the management of the land strongly influencing
    whether the soils gain, lose or maintain C. Further, improved grassland management,
    such as rotational grazing and increased sward diversity, are widely promoted
    to increase soil C sequestration despite limited evidence. Using data from New
    Zealand's grazed dairy grasslands, we examined the effect of management practices
    on C stocks through measurement of the net ecosystem C balance (NECB) across 68
    site-years. Management practices tested included year-round rotational grazing,
    differing pasture sward composition, irrigation, periodic supplemental feed cropping
    and pasture renewal. Excluding years where supplemental feed cropping occurred,
    the mean (±95% confidence interval) NECB was −12 ± 30 g C m−2 y−1 (65 site-years;
    the negative value represents C loss), indicating the soil C stocks of these ecosystems
    were likely near steady-state. The processes of pasture renewal and the transition
    between pasture and crops resulted in reduced C inputs from photosynthesis of
    between −232 and −94 g C m−2. This reduced C input was partially overcome with
    the application of effluent or manure at the time of cultivation where applied.
    There was no difference in NECB between irrigated (−26 ± 114 g C m−2 y−1) and
    non-irrigated (−19 ± 198 g C m−2 y−1) pastures. In general, conventional ryegrass/white
    clover pastures were more beneficial for C stocks than alternative pasture species
    and mixes. Periodic cropping for supplemental feed resulted in C losses, with
    the magnitude depending on crop type and management, although data were limited
    to three site-years.

    farmingGrazing 1. Introduction Globally, grassland soils are an important store
    of terrestrial carbon (C), accounting for approximately 22% of terrestrial C stocks
    (Conant et al., 2017, Erb et al., 2018, Friedlingstein et al., 2022). Management
    of these grasslands, including the historic conversion of native vegetation to
    managed grassland, has resulted in considerable C loss (Sanderman et al., 2017).
    This loss highlights the need to avoid future losses and recapture the lost soil
    C, both of which depend on how these ecosystems are managed. Recapture of this
    lost C is frequently proposed as a potential mechanism to mitigate increasing
    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by increasing soil C stocks (Minasny et al., 2017)
    through adopting improved interventions and management practices for grasslands
    and croplands (Soussana et al., 2010, Conant et al., 2017, Bai and Cotrufo, 2022).
    It is, therefore, critical to increase our understanding of how grasslands, particularly
    managed grasslands, are responding to the imposed management practices, and identify
    those practices that have positive impacts while modifying those that are detrimental
    to increasing soil C stocks. Management of grasslands for meat and milk production
    varies globally according to climate and soil conditions. Some of these farming
    approaches, particularly grazing management strategies, are rapidly changing in
    response to the damaging environmental impacts of existing practices. In New Zealand,
    grasslands account for 55% of the land area, with primary land use of the managed
    grasslands being sheep, beef and dairy cattle grazing (Whitehead et al., 2018).
    Furthermore, New Zealand’s agricultural GHG emissions in 2021 accounted for 50%
    of the country’s net emissions (MfE, 2023a), primarily due to ruminant methane
    emissions and nitrous oxide emissions from urine deposition and fertiliser applications.
    Over the past decade, there has been a concentrated effort to identify opportunities
    for mitigation of the GHG emissions from agricultural systems (Leahy et al., 2019),
    particularly from the dairy industry which accounts for 46% of agricultural emissions
    (MfE, 2023b) from only 22% of grassland area (Statistics New Zealand, 2018, Dairy,
    2022). For methane and nitrous oxide, the focus has been on targeted reductions
    (Leahy et al., 2019) while initially increasing soil C was considered to have
    the potential for offsetting emissions (Minasny et al., 2017) through targeted
    management interventions to increase C inputs, such as including more deeper-rooted
    species in grassland swards (Lange et al., 2015, McNally et al., 2015). More recently,
    the soil C research has broadened to include the impacts of other commonly used
    management practices (e.g., periodic cropping, irrigation) on soil C stocks to
    allow for the identification of other mitigation opportunities, and ensure that
    mitigation practices targeting other GHGs do not inadvertently lead to soil C
    losses and thus increased overall GHG emissions (Laubach et al., 2023). Many of
    the management practices employed in New Zealand are not unique and are being
    adopted increasingly to limit environmental impacts globally. These practices
    include maintaining perennial, continuous plant cover, minimising the frequency
    of soil disturbance, and increasing plant diversity and inputs to the soil (Lal,
    2020, Newton et al., 2020, Jordon et al., 2022). Commonplace management practices
    of New Zealand dairy farms over the past several decades include rotational grazing
    (adaptive multi-paddock grazing or mob-grazing), maintaining plant cover including
    for year-round grazing, periodic cropping of pastures (ley farming) and use of
    minimum tillage practices for crop establishment and pasture renewal. Furthermore,
    pastures of alternate or additional species and more diverse mixes (compared to
    the traditional ryegrass/white clover swards) are increasingly being incorporated
    into New Zealand dairy farm systems (Tozer et al., 2017, Dodd et al., 2019). Internationally,
    these practices are promoted to achieve increases in soil C stocks of agricultural
    lands (Conant et al., 2017, Mosier et al., 2021, Bai and Cotrufo, 2022, Chabbi
    et al., 2022), although empirical evidence of changes in soil C stocks remains
    scarce from long-term grasslands. A century of these practices thus likely contributed
    to New Zealand’s pastures having greater soil C stocks than under natural or planted
    forests (McNeill et al., 2014, Schipper et al., 2017). However, it is uncertain
    whether management practices that lead to increased C stocks on degraded soils
    such as former croplands are similarly beneficial on dairy grassland soils with
    generally high soil C stocks. Further, there is uncertainty about the direction
    and magnitude of the impacts of changes in management practices on soil C stocks.
    Data from New Zealand grazing systems will help to inform the adoption of best
    management practices both in New Zealand and elsewhere where outdoor grazing of
    pastures by dairy cows occurs including Australia, Europe and the Americas (McDowell
    et al., 2022). Much of the research focusing on how the management of New Zealand’s
    dairy systems affects soil C stocks has been based on measurements to calculate
    the net ecosystem C balance (NECB) (Chapin et al., 2006). This is achieved by
    combining eddy covariance (EC) measurements of the net CO2 exchange (Baldocchi,
    2014) with measurements and estimates of the other C inputs and losses at the
    paddock scale (Mudge et al., 2011, Hunt et al., 2016, Wall et al., 2020b). The
    NECB approach allows for high temporal data coverage and detection of smaller
    soil C changes in shorter time intervals than can be typically measured using
    alternative approaches such as direct soil sampling (Smith et al., 2020). However,
    CO2 flux measurements require expensive equipment and specialist knowledge (Eugster
    and Merbold, 2015) and often lack replication (Hill et al., 2017). Carbon balance
    studies within New Zealand agricultural systems are no exception with all published
    studies lacking spatial replication but having higher temporal replication typically
    extending over multiple years (e.g. Laubach et al., 2019; Wall et al., 2019).
    Most New Zealand C balance studies have been to test and/or identify mitigation
    options, either by making comparative measurements at different sites, with independent
    EC instrumentation (e.g. Laubach and Hunt, 2018), or using the split-footprint
    method of comparing adjacent study plots (paddocks) using a single EC system (Wall
    et al., 2020b, Laubach et al., 2023). Consequently, considerable data collection
    between 2008 and 2022, can be used to derive insights into the processes regulating
    changes in soil C stocks in relation to the management of New Zealand’s dairy
    grasslands and provide recommendations for potential mitigation options. In this
    study, we bring together all published, and some previously unpublished, NECB
    data from New Zealand dairy grasslands to provide a synthesis of the effects of
    commonly used management practices on C stocks. Specific management-related questions
    to be addressed include: (1) how does the management of rotational grazing dairy
    grasslands affect New Zealand’s soil C stocks? (2) what is the C loss associated
    with the transition between one pasture or crop to another (e.g., pasture renewal)?
    (3) what is the impact of periodic cropping of grasslands for supplemental feed
    on soil C stocks? (4) can increased sward diversity increase soil C stocks? and
    (5) how does irrigation affect soil C stocks? While partly addressed in previous
    individual studies with low replication, we now have an opportunity to combine
    the data and identify emergent findings to provide increased certainty of the
    impacts. Throughout we assume that the NECB is representative of the change in
    soil C stock. 2. Methods 2.1. Field sites The data originated exclusively from
    two of the dominant dairy regions of New Zealand: Waikato in Te Ika-a-Māui / North
    Island and Canterbury in Te Waipounamu / South Island (Table 1). Within the Waikato,
    measurements were made from three dairy farms with one, Troughton Farm, having
    four separate measurement sites. The Waikato study sites were on Allophanic or
    Gley soils (Hewitt, 2010) and had mean annual precipitation between 1126 and 1249 mm
    and mean annual air temperature between 13.3 and 13.8 °C. Data from Canterbury
    were obtained from two dairy farms, with each having two measurement sites. Here,
    the soils were of either the Brown or Pallic soil orders, with mean annual precipitation
    between 640 and 839 mm, and mean annual temperature between 10.9 and 12.1 °C.
    The five farms combined to comprise ten field sites, with management activities
    at three of the sites changing through time. Furthermore, where suitable, EC,
    and thus NECB data, were further disaggregated to individual paddocks (see Section
    2.2.2.2 for more details). In total, 16 individual datasets were available covering
    74.9 total site-years and 68 annual NECBs. In most cases, NECB calculations were
    done to investigate targeted broader management practices that were either already
    occurring on-farm (e.g., irrigation, periodic supplemental feed cropping and pasture
    renewal) or implemented with the cooperation of the farm manager and researchers
    (e.g., altering the sward species). These broader management practices are summarised
    in Table 1, with more detail included in the referenced publications for individual
    studies. Table 1. Summary of field sites and data sets included in the analysis.

    sites Ashley Dene Farm Mix (ADmix) and Ashely Dene Farm RyWC (ADrwc) in January
    2020. All sites were located on rotationally grazed dairy farms. Individual paddocks
    of the farm were grazed over a few hours to a few days and then, depending on
    the time of the year, left to regrow for intervals ranging from three weeks to
    three months before the next grazing event (see: Figures S1 and S2). Day-to-day
    management of the paddocks and farms was at the discretion of the farm manager
    following conventional practices. These management practices included determining
    the timing and duration of grazing, the timing and amounts of fertiliser, manure,
    and effluent applied, and the timing of harvest of the pastures for supplemental
    feed (i.e., grass silage and hay). 2.2. Net ecosystem carbon balance data 2.2.1.
    NECB methodology The general methodology of all data collated here follows the
    NECB concept from Chapin et al. (2006): (1) where: NEP is the summed ecosystem-atmosphere
    CO2 exchange presented as net ecosystem production (same magnitude and opposite
    sign to net ecosystem exchange) measured using EC, Cimport is the non-CO2 imports
    of C to the ecosystem, and Cexport is the non-CO2 exports of C from the ecosystem.
    All the major import and export terms were accounted for, but many minor terms
    deemed negligible were excluded (e.g. C loss from wind erosion). The C import
    and export terms measured in each study varied (see Table S1 for a summary) depending
    on the availability of information, measurement capability and farm management
    (e.g., supplementary feed was not fed on the paddock at the Canterbury sites).
    The major lateral flows of C were due to the cows consuming, processing, and releasing
    C following Eq. (2): (2) where: Ceaten was the C embedded in the pasture and supplementary
    feeds eaten by the cows; Crespiration was the C respired as CO2; Cexcreta was
    the C deposited in urine and dung; Cproduct was the C exported in milk; and Centeric
    methane was the C in the methane eructated by the cows. Except for Scott and Ryan
    Farm’s, Ceaten was considered an export of C, while Cexcreta was an import of
    C, and the terms Crespiration, Cproduct and Centeric methane were not required,
    i.e. by rearranging Eq. (2) as: (3) At Scott Farm, the Crespiration was assumed
    captured by the eddy covariance measurements during grazing, and most Cexcreta
    remained in the paddock. However, both terms were included in the NECB calculation
    as C exports to account for the C respired or excreted outside the paddock, i.e.
    while the cows were walking to/from and at the milking parlour. At Ryan Farm,
    the system boundary was the farm boundary, so there was no Cexcreta term (i.e.
    all excreta remained within the system boundary) and Crespiration was calculated
    as a fraction of total C eaten. For both Scott Farm and Ryan Farm, Cproduct was
    estimated from measurements of farm milk export volume while Centeric methane
    was modelled from animal feed intake. Additional non-cow related fluxes included
    C imported in synthetic fertiliser (including lime application), liquid farmyard
    effluent applied back onto the land, and organic manures (this included: animal
    bedding, solid farmyard manure and composted material). Further C export terms
    included C in harvested biomass, soil methane emissions (sites BFdry and BFirr
    only), pond emissions (Ryan Farm only) and leaching of dissolved organic C from
    the soil zone. Finally, NEP excludes grazer respiration from all datasets except
    for the Scott Farm dataset (as noted above). Throughout, the sign convention used
    is from the perspective of the ecosystem, where a positive value represents a
    net gain in C by the ecosystem, and a negative value a net loss of C. 2.2.2. Data
    included for analysis The analysis presented here used published datasets supplemented
    with unpublished extensions of these datasets where available (see below). Data
    were available at the daily time step for all datasets except from the Ryan and
    Scott Farm sites which were only available annually. For the compilation of annual
    NECBs, the start and end dates of the yearly records matched those of the original
    publications. While much of the focus of this study was on NECB data alone, the
    analysis also utilised CO2 fluxes, including the component fluxes of gross primary
    production and ecosystem respiration, and soil moisture content data. Soil water
    content data were included in the analysis of the pasture and crop transition
    periods (Section 3.2) and were measured at a depth of 0.1 m. 2.2.2.1. Reprocessed
    and unpublished datasets Where we included unpublished datasets, these were extensions
    of data collected at sites since publication. In many publications, the data were
    presented as an annual budget with start and end dates conforming to the beginning
    of a month or year, but often measurements began before this time. Where useful,
    we also included data obtained during this period before the start date used in
    the publication. In all cases, the calculations followed those presented in the
    relevant publications and readers are referred to those for more details (Table
    1). Additionally, data from the Troughton Farm NewRye and Control sites were reprocessed
    with updated procedures similar to that of the NewMix site presented by Wall et
    al. (2020b) and updated from Rutledge et al. (2017a) and Rutledge et al. (2017b).
    The purpose of the reprocessing was to ensure consistency in the presentation
    of all data from those sites used in this study. Unpublished and reprocessed annual
    values of NECB are included from the following sites (with references for the
    relevant publication containing methodology in parentheses): Troughton Farm NewMix
    (TFP31 and TFP32; 2019–2022), OldRye (TFcon; 2012–2019) and NewRye (TFnr; 2013–2017)
    sites (all: Rutledge et al., 2017a; Wall et al., 2020b) and Ashley Dene Farm Irrigated
    (ADirr) and Non-Irrigated (ADdry) sites for the 2018–19 year (Laubach et al.,
    2019). The annual NECBs for these sites are available in the supplementary materials
    (Tables S2 to S7). 2.2.2.2. Split footprint eddy covariance data A recent analysis
    by Wall et al. (2020b) and supported by Laubach et al. (2023) concluded that where
    possible data should be presented for individual paddocks rather than integrated
    across multiple paddocks. Day-to-day management of adjacent paddocks was often
    not identical and differences in e.g., grazing timing can affect estimates of
    NEP and/or NECB. Rather, the split-footprint approach (Wall et al., 2020b) was
    used where EC data collected from a system located on a fence line were assigned
    to a dataset for each paddock dependent on the source area of flux. Values of
    NECB were then calculated for each paddock. Benefits of this approach include
    increasing replication and the ability to test adjacent treatments (e.g., Laubach
    et al., 2023). Where available and suitable, we have used paddock-specific calculations
    of NECB using the split-footprint method, with these sites identified in Table
    1. 2.3. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of the data presented in this
    study takes several forms depending on the purpose. Where data from an individual
    study are presented, such as the supplemental feed cropping and increased pasture
    diversity sections (e.g., Fig. 5, Fig. 6), the uncertainties follow those from
    the original publication. In all cases, the uncertainty of the NECB was calculated
    by propagating the uncertainty of each term used in the NECB calculation, which
    itself was obtained from either replicated measurement and/or estimated from expert
    opinion. In all cases, sites were considered different when the uncertainty estimates
    did not overlap. Similarly, all NECBs are considered C neutral when the uncertainty
    range includes zero and a C sink/source when they do not. Direct comparisons between
    one site and another were only performed when the measurement method and uncertainty
    calculations were the same. For analysis that required aggregation of several
    annual NECB or NEP data, we present the mean and 95% confidence interval of the
    mean. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the significance
    of the difference between the three irrigated pasture species. Paired t-tests
    were used to determine the significance of differences for all other comparisons
    between two datasets. Both ANOVA and paired t-tests were tested at the 95% significance
    level (α = 0.05). All statistical analyses were undertaken using Matlab version
    9.9.0 (2020b) (The MathWorks Inc.., 2020). 3. Results 3.1. Net ecosystem carbon
    balances From the 65 site-years of data where the dominant management was rotational
    grazing (i.e., excluding the periodic cropping years), the mean (±95% confidence
    interval) and median values of NECB were −12 ± 30 g C m−2 y−1 and −17 g C m−2
    y−1, respectively (Fig. 1b). Annually, the minimum and maximum values of NECB
    were −295 and 267 g C m−2 y−1 with most data within the range −200 to +200 g C
    m−2 y−1. As previously noted, most of the NECB data were derived from working
    commercial dairy farms where day-to-day management was at the discretion of the
    farm manager. Accordingly, captured within these statistics are many different
    management activities that occur on dairy farms including application of effluent,
    manure and fertiliser, differing levels of supplemental feed use, occasional harvesting
    of pasture (for supplemental feed), pasture renewal and use of irrigation. The
    near-zero mean and median NECBs are thus likely a fair reflection of the effect
    that rotational grazing of flat-land New Zealand dairy farms has on the annual
    stability of C stocks. Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download : Download

    a), NECB excluding (b) and including (c) cropping years. Data from Scott Farm
    were excluded from the NEP statistics as respiration from grazing animals was
    included in the data and differs from data for all other measurement sites. Boxplot
    statistics show the median and 25th and 75th percentiles within the box while
    whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers (The MathWorks
    Inc.., 2020). Although only a component of the C balance, it is worthwhile considering
    the variability in the CO2 uptake of the pasture (NEP) from the available data.
    The mean (±95% confidence interval) value for NEP was 283 ± 31 g C m−2 y−1 while
    the median value was 285 g C m−2 y−1 from 61 site-years of data (Fig. 1a), noting
    that data from Scott Farm were excluded due to methodological differences. This
    indicates that the pastures were, on average, a net sink of CO2, but C-neutral
    when the fate of the CO2 sequestered in the pasture was included. Furthermore,
    the annual NEP strongly influenced the annual NECB, with a higher NEP generally
    leading to a higher NECB (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (116KB)

    pasture. The dashed grey line represents the linear fit of the data and has an
    r2 value of 0.54. The data from Scott Farm were excluded due to methodological
    differences in the calculation of NEP. More than three-quarters of data site-years
    were generated from Waikato field sites. However, the mean values of NECB suggested
    no regional difference between the Waikato and Canterbury field sites. The mean
    (±95% confidence interval) for the Waikato data subset was −8 ± 31 g C m−2 y−1
    compared with −24 ± 69 g C m−2 y−1 for the Canterbury sites indicating sites from
    both regions were C-neutral. The longest duration datasets from the Troughton
    Farm NewMix (TFP31 and TFP32; 11 years) and Troughton Farm Control (TFcon; 8 years)
    sites all had average annual values of NECB that were C-neutral (−14 ± 73 g C
    m−2 y−1, 29 ± 76 g C m−2 y−1 and 22 ± 64 g C m−2 y−1, respectively). This evidence
    suggests that soil C stocks are to steady state in rotationally grazed dairy pastures
    on New Zealand’s flat land. 3.2. Pasture and crop transitions The need to produce
    sufficient animal feed necessitates the renewal of underperforming pastures and
    the production of supplemental feed crops. Within the dataset, eleven transition
    events occurred, with six from pasture to pasture, three from pasture to crop,
    and two from crop to pasture. To examine the effect of these transitions on C
    stocks, it is important to carefully define the analysis period that applies to
    all data sets. An obvious starting point is the conclusion of the previous pasture
    sward or crop, which is easily identified by a clear management intervention,
    e.g., application of herbicide to kill existing pastures or harvest of the previous
    crop. However, defining an endpoint of the transition process (and the period
    to calculate the net C balance) is more difficult. Previous work by Rutledge et
    al. (2014) used the timing of seedling emergence, while other studies have reported
    annual C budgets where pasture or crop establishment occurs during the annual
    period (Rutledge et al., 2017b, Ammann et al., 2020, Merbold et al., 2021). In
    the following section, we argue for a different metric to quantify the effects
    of pasture and crop transitions on the net C balance and investigate some management
    and climatic drivers. The eleven transition events all displayed a common pattern
    in net C balances. Firstly, the application of herbicide (or non-perennial crop
    removal) caused a rapid cessation of photosynthesis as the existing plants died
    (or were harvested). This decreased photosynthetic C inputs to negligible levels
    and when coupled with ongoing respiratory losses resulted in net C emissions almost
    immediately (Fig. 3). Net C losses due to a lack of photosynthetic inputs continued
    for several weeks, beyond both the planting and seedling emergence phases. Losses
    ceased when daily photosynthesis exceeded daily ecosystem respiration. The timing
    of C uptake exceeding respiration varied with each event but was typically 30–50
    days after planting (Fig. 3). This stage of net C uptake by the new pasture/crop
    provides an easily identifiable endpoint for the establishment phase where the
    new plants are sufficiently well established and, for the examples of pasture
    establishment in Fig. 3a and c, were approaching the timing of the first grazing.
    Accordingly, we chose the period between herbicide application and the first day
    of net C uptake following planting for evaluating the effects of pasture and crop
    transitions and refer to this as the establishment phase. Download : Download

    transition events between pastures and crops illustrating the similarity of cumulative
    NEP and NECB regardless of transition type. The three examples of an individual
    transition event include (a) pasture-to-pasture transition (site TFP54, autumn
    2018), (b) pasture-to-crop transition (site TFmaize, spring 2017), and (c) crop-to-pasture
    transition (site TFP58, spring 2018). The arrows (from left to right) represent
    the day of herbicide application (a and b) or harvest (c) indicating the start
    of the transition event (S, red), the day of seedling emergence (E, green), the
    first day of positive NEP (net uptake) since planting (U, blue), and the day of
    first grazing of the new pasture (G, black, (a) and (c) only). The vertical line
    at day zero is the time of planting of the pasture/crop. Note the jump in NECB
    of (b) on day −16 was due to an import of manure C to the experimental site. While
    the previous paragraph focused solely on the CO2 exchange during the establishment
    phase, it is important to note that other management interventions can also impact
    the C (rather than just CO2) balance. Considerable quantities of manure and/or
    effluent (and its embedded C) may be applied during the preparation of the land
    for maize silage crops (e.g., Fig. 3b). Fertiliser is also often applied during
    or soon after planting and depending on the type of fertiliser used, may also
    be a supply of C. Pasture or perennial crops may also be harvested or grazed in
    the days following herbicide application as occurred at the ADirr and ADdry sites
    (data not shown) representing a loss of C. Thus, the C balance during the establishment
    phase was affected by management decisions that may not have been related to the
    establishment of the new pastures or crops. In many cases, NEP is a more appropriate
    and consistent metric for evaluating the effects of pasture/crop transitions on
    changes in C stocks, except where manure or effluent was applied which likely
    contributes to NEP. All eleven transition events resulted in a net loss of C,
    whether NEP or NECB, during the establishment phase. During this period, the average
    NEP was −178 g C m−2 (ranging from −232 to −94 g C m−2), and the average NECB
    was −155 g C m−2 (ranging between −233 and −36 g C m−2) with an average establishment
    duration of 53 days (Fig. 4a-c). In general, the longer the establishment phase,
    the larger the C loss (both NEP and NECB). Linear regression indicated that NEP
    and duration of the establishment phase were more strongly correlated (p = 0.07)
    than NECB and duration of the establishment phase (p = 0.22). This was primarily
    due to the other management interventions (e.g., application of manure or effluent)
    affecting the NECB as described above. Available data included events with two
    commonly used establishment methods with different tillage intensities: less intense
    direct drilling and more intense full cultivation where the soil was ploughed
    before seeding. The establishment method did not affect either the total (Fig.
    4a) or daily rate of C loss as NEP (p = 0.92 and p = 0.37 respectively). Similarly,
    there is no obvious significant difference (p = 0.52) in C loss (NEP) between
    transition types (e.g., pasture to pasture, pasture to crop, or crop to pasture;
    Fig. 4b) although data were limited. Download : Download high-res image (485KB)

    method (a) and transition type (b). Panel (c) shows the relationships between
    the accumulated net ecosystem C balance (NECB) and the duration of the establishment
    phase. Panels (d) to (f) show the relationship between volumetric water content
    (0.1 m depth) and average daily ecosystem respiration (d), gross primary production
    (e) and NEP (f) for the establishment phase. The dashed grey lines represent the
    linear relationship for all data, while the coloured solid lines in (d) to (f)
    are the separate linear relationships for the Waikato and Canterbury regional
    data subsets. The legend in (b) also applies to (c). We also explored the effects
    of soil water content on the daily rates of ecosystem respiration, gross primary
    productivity and NEP (Fig. 4d-f) following earlier work by Rutledge et al. (2017b).
    The rate of ecosystem respiration increased with increasing soil water content
    (Fig. 4d). With the defined establishment phase including some time with the growth
    of the new plants, some of the respiration C loss was offset by C uptake from
    photosynthesis of the newly emerging pasture or crop. Similar to ecosystem respiration,
    photosynthesis was affected by the soil water content, although in the opposite
    direction such that increased soil water content led to increased gross primary
    production (Fig. 4e). The net effect was that increasing soil water content led
    to both increased ecosystem respiration and gross primary production to a point
    where NEP was not significantly influenced by soil water content (p > 0.2; all
    data; Fig. 4f). Of note, the data from the two different regions (and soils) occupied
    different soil moisture content spaces, but the trends were generally the same
    for both regions. 3.3. Supplemental feed cropping Production of supplemental feed
    within a New Zealand dairy farming system is common, with farmers periodically
    cropping otherwise permanent pastures, and is often incorporated as part of the
    pasture renewal process (described above). In some instances, the crop may be
    established in the same area in subsequent years but is eventually returned to
    a long-term permanent pasture. Within the available datasets, three years contained
    supplemental feed crops and were described in detail by Wall et al. (2020a) and
    Laubach and Hunt (2018). All three supplemental feed crops resulted in a loss
    of C for the period between herbicide application of the existing sward and harvest
    of the maize silage crops or conclusion of grazing for the kale crop. Net C losses
    for the maize silage crops were −731 g C m−2 and −334 g C m−2, while the loss
    for the kale crop was −186 g C m−2, noting that these are not annual NECBs. In
    all cases, additional C could be expected to be lost during the establishment
    of the subsequent pasture or crop. Including the three site-years with periodic
    cropping into the overall dataset reduced mean annual NECB to −32 ± 41 g C m−2
    y−1 (mean ± 95% confidence interval; Fig. 1c) compared with −12 ± 30 g C m−2 y−1
    when excluding the periodic cropping years. This more negative mean annual NECB
    (although still C neutral) was driven by the large C losses from the two maize
    silage cropping years but demonstrates the potential impact that occasional cropping
    of grazed dairy land can have on the average change in C stocks. 3.4. Increased
    pasture diversity Three studies included pastures with increased diversity, all
    established with different objectives. The first study by Rutledge et al. (2017a)
    (referred to henceforth as Study 1) directly tested the hypothesis that increasing
    species diversity leads to increased C stocks through the production of increased
    root biomass at deeper rooting levels. The second study (Study 2; Wall et al.,
    2023a) reported the C balance over four years following maize silage cropping
    where the sown pasture was a nine-species mix. Although not included in Wall et
    al. (2023a), a comparison with a conventional ryegrass/white clover pasture can
    be made by utilising the ongoing measurements of the Troughton Farm NewMix site
    published in Rutledge et al. (2017a) and Wall et al. (2020b). Finally, the third
    study (Study 3; Laubach et al., 2023) compared the C balance and N2O emissions
    from a 5-species pasture mix with those from a ryegrass/white clover control.
    Table 2 summarises the study periods, control sites used, and species included
    in the increased diversity mixes. Table 2. Summary information of the studies

    Wall et al. (2023a) Laubach et al. (2023) * Data presented from Study 1 have been
    reprocessed from the original publication of Rutledge et al. (2017a) The change
    in C stocks during the published study periods, which excluded the transition
    period (see below), all showed similar trends. Firstly, the values of NECB for
    the diverse pasture sites indicated they were all either C-neutral (Study 1) or
    a net C source (Studies 2 and 3). Similarly, when compared with the ryegrass/white
    clover controls, whether renewed or existing, values of NECB for the diverse swards
    were all lower than those for the ryegrass/white clover swards, although the difference
    was not always significant (Fig. 5a). For Study 1, where there was both an existing
    and renewed ryegrass/clover sward, it is worth noting that the NECB was similar
    for both sites despite renewal occurring at one site. When considering the combined
    establishment and study reporting period (Fig. 5b) the more diverse mixed pastures
    were all sources of C, while the ryegrass/white clover controls were C sinks or
    C-neutral. Download : Download high-res image (223KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Summary of the three studies where the NECB of a pasture of increased
    diversity (Mix) was compared with that of a conventional pasture of ryegrass/white
    clover (RyWC). The number of pasture species in each mix was 8, 9 and 5 for studies
    1, 2 and 3 respectively (see Table 2 for details). Panel (a) displays the NECB
    for the published study period (excluding the establishment/transition period),
    and (b) NECB when the establishment/transition period is included. The number
    of months included within the x-axis label refers to the length of time the NECB
    is accumulated. Error bars are the uncertainty in the NECB as calculated using
    methods relevant to the individual study (see reference publications in Table
    2 for details). Unsurprisingly, the transition period resulted in a source of
    C for all renewed pastures (both ryegrass/white clover and more diverse pastures).
    Including this period in the analysis led to a larger C loss from the diverse
    pasture (−385 to −136 g C m−2). Similarly, the NECB of the renewed ryegrass/white
    clover swards changed from positive to negative although these were not significantly
    different from zero (Fig. 5b). 3.5. Irrigation Carbon balance data for irrigated
    pastures were only available from the Canterbury Region, which has the largest
    areal extent of irrigated land in New Zealand (Statistics New Zealand, 2018).
    The datasets from Laubach and Hunt (2018), Laubach et al. (2019) and Laubach et
    al. (2023) provide 11 site-years of data from irrigated land, and four site-years
    from adjacent non-irrigated pastures (excluding the year of winter kale cropping
    covered in Section 3.3). The mean annual NECB of all 11 irrigated site-years was
    −26 ± 114 g C m−2 y−1 (mean ±95% confidence interval) and similar to the mean
    value of −12 ± 30 g C m−2 y−1 obtained for all available data (see Section 3.1).
    Although only four site-years of data from non-irrigated Canterbury pastures were
    available, the mean annual NECB was likewise very similar (−19 ± 198 g C m−2 y−1).
    When directly compared, the irrigated pasture at Beacon Farm had a greater NECB
    than the non-irrigated pasture although only from one year of data. In contrast,
    the opposite pattern was observed for the Ashley Dene Farm lucerne pasture, i.e.,
    the non-irrigated lucerne had a greater NECB than for the irrigated lucerne (Fig.
    6a). For these four comparative site-years, the average NECB for irrigated pasture
    was −143 ± 252 g C m−2 y−1 compared with −19 ± 198 g C m−2 y−1 for the non-irrigated
    pastures, although these results should be treated with caution due to the dominance
    of data from Ashley Dene Farm. Download : Download high-res image (138KB) Download

    data where a direct comparison was made between adjacent irrigated and non-irrigated
    sites, where BF is Beacon Farm and compares sites BFirr and BFdry, and AD is Ashley
    Dene Farm and compares sites ADirr and ADdry. The final bar pair in panel (a)
    is the mean from the four irrigated and non-irrigated pairs. Panel (b) displays
    the mean NECB for the different pasture swards from which the data were collected,
    where RyWC is ryegrass/white clover, and Mix is a 5-species mixture (see Study
    3 in Table 2 for the species). Uncertainties in panel (a) are those associated
    with the measured NECB. The 95% confidence bounds for “All data” in panel (a)
    and panel (b) in its entirety are omitted due to their large magnitude but are
    stated in the text. The inclusion of a third study targeting increased species
    diversity (Study 3 from Section 3.4) conducted on irrigated land, but not considering
    the irrigation effect itself, provides useful additional information on the combination
    of irrigation and different pasture species. Irrigated pasture NECB data were
    obtained from pastures with three different sward compositions: ryegrass/white
    clover (five site-years), lucerne (four site-years) and a 5-species mixed pasture
    (two site-years; see study 3 in Table 2 for the species composition). Interestingly,
    the average annual NECB for ryegrass/white clover under irrigation was positive
    (91 ± 145 g C m−2 y−1; five site-years), while both the lucerne (−145 ± 246 g C
    m−2 y−1; four site years) and mixed pastures (−82 g C m−2 y−1; two site-years;
    no uncertainty calculated) were negative. Due to inter-annual variability and
    limited data for the mixed pasture, there was no significant difference (p= 0.09)
    in the mean NECB for the three data subsets. However, there was a significant
    difference (p = 0.03) when comparing the ryegrass/white clover and all other species
    (i.e., combining the lucerne and mixed pasture NECB data) suggesting that irrigated
    ryegrass/white clover may lead to more favourable values of NECB than alternative
    species and mixes. 4. Discussion 4.1. Effects of management practices on ecosystem
    C stocks Many of the broad management practices employed on New Zealand dairy
    farms, including the overarching practice of rotational (or adaptive multi-paddock)
    grazing, are considered best practices and beneficial for soil C. Moreover, these
    practices also form the basis of regenerative agricultural management (Lal, 2020,
    Rehberger et al., 2023) and are being promoted globally (e.g., Bai and Cotrufo,
    2022; Phukubye et al., 2022; Sherren et al., 2022). We found no evidence that
    management practices commonly considered to result in increased C sequestration
    in other parts of the world such as no or minimum tillage (Conant et al., 2007,
    Haddaway et al., 2017, Prairie et al., 2023), ley cropping (Jordon et al., 2022)
    and increased pasture diversity (Bai and Cotrufo, 2022) resulted in increased
    C stocks for New Zealand dairy grassland sites. Potentially, this may be a consequence
    of the existing high soil C stocks (Schipper et al., 2017) that have stabilised
    under decades of consistent management, predominantly under rotational grazing
    of ryegrass/white clover (see Section 4.2) rather than cropping. Whole farm management
    incorporates a wide range of management practices (including some or all analysed
    here) that have positive or negative effects on soil C stocks. For example, on-site
    grazing of pastures (or crops) allows for substantial returns of C through excreta
    deposition, whereas harvest and removal of pasture or cropped biomass does not
    (Soussana et al., 2010). However, production of supplemental feed is often required
    to overcome periods with low pasture growth but generally comes at a soil C cost.
    These various management practices are required to maintain a productive and profitable
    business, and thus occasional C loss is, in essence, the cost of doing business.
    However, the adaptation of management practices to emphasise those more promising
    for soil C sequestration is possible, although many other environmental, production
    and financial factors need to be considered by the farm managers. In the following
    sections, we discuss the key findings from our synthesis related to specific management
    practices. 4.1.1. Pasture renewal and crop establishment Transitioning from one
    pasture or crop to another results in a period with no or limited photosynthetic
    C inputs and thus C loss. The magnitude of net C loss is primarily affected by
    the duration of the establishment phase. Earlier work by Rutledge et al. (2017b)
    suggested that soil water content was also important for determining the rate
    of C loss, but our analysis with more data has shown this not to be the case.
    Reasons for this new finding include our comparison of soil water content against
    NEP rather than ecosystem respiration as used by Rutledge et al. (2017b) and the
    increase in the defined duration of the establishment phase (time until net CO2
    uptake rather than the time of seedling emergence). The longer establishment phase
    included some time when photosynthesis by the new plants occurred but was less
    than the respiration rate. While ecosystem respiration rates increased with increased
    soil water content, consistent with findings by Rutledge et al. (2017b), the rate
    of gross primary productivity also increased with increasing soil water content
    and thus partially offset ecosystem respiration C losses. The importance of soil
    water content is, therefore, limited to when the soil is bare, and the duration
    of the establishment phase is a better predictor for total C losses. From a C
    balance perspective, the application of effluent or manure can also offset some,
    or all, of the C lost from respiration. However, these C additions do not prevent
    C loss during the establishment phase, and indeed much of these C amendments are
    later lost through the decomposition of the manure or effluent (Maillard and Angers,
    2014). Finally, it is also important to note that the full effects of pasture
    renewal or periodic cropping on soil C stocks may take several years to be realised
    (Ammann et al., 2020, Merbold et al., 2021, Feigenwinter et al., 2023). 4.1.2.
    Periodic supplemental feed cropping Although only limited data from periodic cropping
    of grazed pastures were available from the datasets, the loss of C from these
    crops was consistent with global data (e.g., Béziat et al., 2009; Poyda et al.,
    2019). Periodic cropping of pastures, often as part of the pasture renewal process,
    leads to C loss through two processes: (1) the establishment phases of both the
    crop and subsequent pasture (as detailed above), and (2) allocation of greater
    photosynthate to above-ground biomass (that is harvested) rather than belowground
    allocation that contributed to soil C. Generally, the primary goal of supplemental
    feed cropping within dairy farms is the rapid production of large quantities of
    dry matter to increase milk production (de Ruiter et al., 2009, Ma et al., 2019),
    and often the species chosen have low root to shoot ratios (Bolinder et al., 2007,
    Ordóñez et al., 2020) to maximise above-ground biomass production. Thus, when
    removed through grazing or harvest, a large proportion of the C allocated to the
    above-ground biomass is lost from the ecosystem. In contrast to the harvested
    maize silage crop, the winter-grazed kale crop allowed for some C return through
    excreta deposition during grazing, reducing the net C loss. As with the long-term
    effect of pasture renewal, the true effect of supplemental feed cropping also
    needs to consider the period following a return to permanent pasture. It is possible
    that lost C may be recaptured by the pasture, similar to the conversion of permanent
    cropland to permanent pasture (Smith, 2008, Conant et al., 2017). However, no
    recovery of the lost C after the first four years following maize silage cropping
    was observed at the one site where measurements were made (TFP58; Wall et al.,
    2023a). It may be that C is also being recaptured at other sites within the available
    datasets from historic periodic supplemental feed cropping prior to the recent
    known history. To resolve this question there is a need for longer-term studies
    to determine if and at what rate lost C is recaptured following periodic cropping
    events to quantify the total effect on C stocks. 4.1.3. Pasture diversity We consistently
    observed that pasture swards with increased diversity did not lead to increased
    C stocks relative to conventional ryegrass/white clover pastures. Despite these
    consistent findings, the international literature remains equivocal as to whether
    increased species diversity of pastures under grazing management increases, decreases
    or maintains soil C stocks (Bonin et al., 2014, Skinner and Dell, 2016, Alemu
    et al., 2019). Further, maintaining species diversity under conditions of a working
    dairy farm can be challenging, particularly when it has been shown that high-density
    grazing results in decreased diversity (Reed and Morrissey, 2022). Practically,
    this was observed in Study 1, where Rutledge et al. (2017a) observed a decrease
    in the contribution to the dry matter production of all species other than ryegrass/white
    clover after two years, and by the end of the third year, the sward was almost
    exclusively ryegrass/white clover. This increasing dominance of ryegrass in temperate
    pastures such as those reported here is perhaps not surprising given they are
    noted cool-season species and can outcompete other species leading to a loss of
    diversity (Reed and Morrissey, 2022). Furthermore, as described above, reestablishing
    diversity through site disturbance (e.g., pasture renewal) likely leads to large
    losses of C that would need to be considered before recommending increased use
    of more diverse pastures. A second potential explanation for the larger C loss
    from the more diverse sward may be the allocation of more C to above-ground biomass
    (Laubach et al., 2023) similar to some supplemental feed crops. In the absence
    of increased photosynthetic C input, greater above-ground biomass likely leads
    to lower below-ground C inputs for the same total C input. For all three studies
    presented here, the aboveground biomass production from the diverse swards was
    greater than that from the ryegrass/white clover swards (Rutledge et al., 2017a;
    data not shown for Study 2; Laubach et al., 2023). This hypothesis contrasts with
    the findings from McNally et al. (2015) who reported greater root biomass under
    a moderately diverse pasture relative to a ryegrass/white clover pasture in the
    Waikato, although above-ground production was not reported. Regardless of the
    mechanism, our data did not provide evidence that increasing pasture diversity
    led to increased soil C stocks. 4.1.4. Irrigation Information from the NECB data
    gathered from irrigated pastures was generally inconclusive but highlighted some
    useful insights and needs for further exploration. The generally lower, but not
    significantly different, values of NECB observed from irrigated pastures compared
    with values for non-irrigated pastures under the same management in the same year
    confirmed the findings from paired-site soil sampling data (Mudge et al., 2021).
    However, when considering all NECB data from irrigated pastures, the average values
    of NECB for both irrigated and non-irrigated pastures were similar (−26 and −19 g C
    m−2 y−1, respectively). Possible explanations for these inconclusive findings
    include complex interactions between the duration of irrigation and the pasture
    species sown. Annual C loss has been shown to decrease with increasing duration
    of irrigation (Mudge et al., 2021), and measurements from Beacon Farm were made
    several years after conversion to irrigated pasture where C loss may have already
    occurred in the years before the measurement period. In contrast, measurements
    at Ashley Dene Farm followed the transition from irrigated to non-irrigated pastures.
    Coupled with the differing pasture mixes used at the two farms (Table 1; Fig.
    6b), the differing site history likely contributed to our inconclusive findings.
    Introducing irrigation to a site shifts the management of the pasture by increasing
    biomass production and thus supporting higher stocking density. Therefore, it
    is difficult to provide a direct comparison of irrigated vs. non-irrigated pastures
    under the same management. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of large changes
    in NECB due to irrigation despite much greater pasture production (above-ground
    biomass). 4.2. Importance of ryegrass/white clover swards A recurring theme within
    this synthesis of all New Zealand flatland dairy NECB data is the importance of
    ryegrass/white clover pastures for C stocks. When directly compared, values of
    NECB were always greater for ryegrass/white clover pastures than those for alternative
    pasture mixes. Furthermore, under irrigation, the average NECB of the ryegrass/white
    clover swards was greater than those for all other pasture mixes. Historically,
    New Zealand farmers almost exclusively used perennial ryegrass/white clover swards
    due to their good performance and ability to withstand a wide range of farm management
    practices (Charlton and Stewart, 1999). Soil C stocks have likely reached an equilibrium
    under these pastures, and any intervention to modify the sward composition may
    disrupt long-standing C cycling patterns. Additionally, well-established management
    practices optimised for ryegrass/white clover swards may not be suitable for the
    alternative species and diverse swards, this may be a contributing factor to the
    observed differences between the swards. In the context of the experimental work
    described in this synthesis, the introduction of other pasture swards has been
    to test the hypothesis that increased species diversity leads to increased soil
    C stocks or to identify trade-offs with N2O emission. However, practically, the
    farming industry is now considering the suitability of ryegrass/clover pastures
    due to factors that include improving dry matter production to increase resilience
    to climate change impacts (e.g., Babylon et al., 2023), and reducing nitrogen
    leaching (Simon et al., 2019). Consequently, pastures with differing sward compositions
    are now being trialled regularly (Woodward et al., 2013, Romera et al., 2017,
    McCahon et al., 2021). Our data suggest that soil C stocks should be carefully
    scrutinised where pasture sward alternatives to ryegrass/white clover are established
    to ensure there is no trade-off for net soil C loss. 4.3. Carbon balances relative
    to soil C stock changes One objective of reviewing all C balance data was to generate
    an estimate for the magnitude and direction (positive values indicate a gain of
    C by the ecosystem) of soil C stock changes in New Zealand dairy pastures. The
    mean (and 95% confidence interval) NECB of −12 ± 30 g C m−2 y−1, collected across
    a range of commonly used management practices but excluding periodic cropping,
    indicated that the soil C stocks of these flat land dairy pastures were near steady
    state. Previous soil C stock change measurements in New Zealand have been made
    by direct measurement of soil C stocks from measurements made initially and then
    resampled after several or more years (Schipper et al., 2007, Schipper et al.,
    2010, Schipper et al., 2014, Parfitt et al., 2014). Schipper et al. (2017) summarised
    that the change in soil C stocks of long-term flat land pastures was dependent
    on soil order, with losses of soil C for Allophanic, Gley and Organic soil orders
    (−54, −32 and −290 g C m−2 y−1 respectively between sampling times), while there
    were no changes for Recent, Brown, Pumice and Pallic soils (mean rate of change
    −13 to 12 g C m−2 y−1). NECB data from the Canterbury sites on Brown or Pallic
    soils (mean NECB of −24 ± 70 g C m−2 y−1) supported the findings of Schipper et
    al. (2017) for those soil orders. Data collected from the Waikato and derived
    from Gley and Allophanic soils, however, provides some more nuanced findings,
    and perhaps an explanation for the loss observed by Schipper et al. (2017) for
    these soil orders. When excluding the years with periodic cropping, the average
    value of NECB for the Waikato sites suggested that the soil C stocks were at steady-state
    (−8 ± 31 g C m−2 y−1). However, when including the two maize silage cropping years,
    this mean decreased to −35 ± 49 g C m−2 y−1. While the mean including the cropping
    years cannot be distinguished from zero, the absolute value is similar to the
    rate of loss for Gley and Allophanic soils reported by Schipper et al. (2017).
    It is, therefore, possible that under typical grazing management, the soil C stocks
    for flat land dairy pastures on Gley and Allophanic soils are at or near steady-state,
    but periodic cropping may lead to a gradual decline depending on cropping frequency
    and soil C recovery rates. 4.4. Limitations This synthesis provides insights that
    findings from individual studies cannot provide. However, there remain several
    limitations to our interpretations. Notably, while a total of 68 site-years of
    data were available, geographically these were restricted to the two regions of
    Waikato and Canterbury. Furthermore, most of the data were generated from two
    individual farms: Troughton Farm in the Waikato (43 site-years) and Ashley Dene
    Farm in Canterbury (11 site-years). Eddy covariance measurements and the subsequently
    calculated values of NECB are inherently limited to flat land sites, so the conclusions
    drawn here may not apply to rolling hill country dairying systems. The combination
    of limited geographical spread and restriction to flat land also limited the soil
    orders on which these measurements were made to Gley and Allophanic soils at the
    Waikato study sites and Brown and Pallic soils at the Canterbury study sites.
    Particularly when examining management practices that increase soil C stocks (e.g.,
    increased species diversity) soil order may be an important consideration concerning
    the potential for C stocks to increase (Beare et al., 2014, McNally et al., 2017).
    Furthermore, there may be the influence of additional biophysical factors on the
    management-associated change in C stocks that were outside the scope of this study.
    Finally, in many cases, the measurement period was limited to a few years reducing
    the likelihood of capturing the complete impact of the management practice on
    NECB. 4.5. Future directions Future measurements should continue to target specific
    management practices (with comparative controls), particularly if they are disruptive,
    rather than business-as-usual farming systems. For example, quantifying the effect
    of periodic cropping for both winter and summer supplemental feed production,
    including a range of cropping species, and determining the consequences of growing
    alternative species with and without irrigation. Expansion of these measurements
    to different geographical regions and/or soil orders would also be useful to understand
    the effects on C stocks. Investment in longer-term (decadal or longer) measurements
    from individual sites under conventional management can provide baseline data
    for future comparisons and for tracking inter-annual variability, something that
    short-term studies of only a few years cannot. Additionally, longer-term measurements
    following disruptive management practices such as pasture renewal or periodic
    cropping will provide a more complete picture of the impact of these practices.
    Where feasible, carbon balance studies should be combined with measurements of
    net methane and nitrous oxide emissions to estimate or at least approximate the
    net GHG effects of the investigated management practices. Such combined studies
    indicate whether trade-offs or synergy effects are likely (Laubach and Hunt, 2018,
    Laubach et al., 2023, Wall et al., 2023b). While compiled from a New Zealand perspective,
    the above concepts are globally applicable and should be considered when designing
    any NECB study of grazed pastures. 5. Conclusion Carbon balance estimates from
    New Zealand dairy farms were collated for 68 site-years between 2008 and 2022
    with high-level management practices that included irrigation, pasture renewal,
    periodic supplemental feed cropping, and a range of pasture species and mixes
    that are alternative or additional to conventional ryegrass/white clover. Under
    grazed pasture management the mean value of NECB was not significantly different
    from zero, implying that the C stocks of soil underlying the grazed pastures were
    near steady-state. None of the management practices assessed indicated increases
    in soil C stocks, although the data show that NECB can be increased by importing
    C (e.g., manure, effluent, etc.) noting that this may result in C loss at the
    site of production. Periodic supplemental feed cropping can quickly reduce C stocks
    while, unsurprisingly, pasture renewal also leads to net C loss. In both cases,
    some or all of the C loss may be recovered during subsequent years to decades,
    although this is difficult to quantify and remains uncertain. Although proposed
    as a potential mechanism to increase soil C stocks, we found no evidence that
    pastures with increased diversity and/or alternative species to ryegrass/white
    clover increased C stocks. The impact of irrigation on C balances was inconclusive,
    with no difference between irrigated and non-irrigated pastures from Canterbury
    despite large increases in biomass production. Finally, the clearest trend across
    all management practices was that the use of ryegrass/white clover swards, the
    most common sward for dairy farms over the past century, provides the best opportunity
    to maintain soil C stocks in New Zealand’s temperate climate, while also producing
    sufficient biomass for dairy cows. It is an open question whether this will remain
    so under a climate that is warming and characterised by more extreme rainfall
    and drought events. CRediT authorship contribution statement Aaron Wall: Conceptualization,

  description: Cover cropping is associated with multiple ecosystem and agronomic
    benefits. However, in irrigated orchards and vineyards of the dry, Western United
    States, cover crop adoption rates are low, often owing to concerns over their
    uptake of critical soil water. Regional concerns, such as this, must be addressed
    to identify sustainable agricultural practices that meet unique needs of diverse
    growing regions. A two-year study was conducted to determine the impacts of cover
    crops on soil water dynamics, soil health, and crop growth during the establishment
    of an Autumn King table grape vineyard in a semi-arid, Mediterranean climate,
    specifically the Central Valley of California. Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia),
    a plant species native to the region, and an introduced species, rye (Secale cereale
    L. ‘Merced’), were planted as cool season cover crops in the interrow spaces of
    the grapevines and compared to a standard management practice of no cover crop
    interrow spaces. The cover crop treatments differentially impacted soil microbial
    biomass and soil aggregate stability, with the phacelia treatment enhancing both
    metrics from the first season. The phacelia treatment plots resulted in higher
    soil moisture beneath the vines in both years, while the rye treatment showed
    similar benefits only after two consecutive years of cover cropping. Vine vigor
    was also higher in the phacelia treatment, which was likely consequential of enhanced
    soil moisture in the rows. Compared to the rye, the phacelia had lower plant tissue
    carbon to nitrogen ratio and higher above ground plant biomass, which may underpin
    the soil health benefits associated with the phacelia, although variances in soil
    total carbon and nitrogen and ammonium and nitrate were not determined for any
    treatment. Altogether, we present information on cover crop plant traits that
    show quicker return on investment with regards to soil health improvements and
    water savings. Further, we demonstrate that cool season cover crops offered benefits
    for vineyard water productivity. In summary, for Mediterranean vineyards, cover
    crops can promote vineyard soil quality and be a component of sustainable water
    management.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Interrow cool-season cover crops enhanced
    vineyard soil biological health. • Cover crop 2-year impacts on soil chemical
    properties and bulk density were negligible. • Table grape vineyard water dynamics
    and vine vigor were enhanced by cover crops. • A native plant, phacelia, had greater
    vineyard benefits than rye, an introduced species. Abstract Cover cropping is
    associated with multiple ecosystem and agronomic benefits. However, in irrigated
    orchards and vineyards of the dry, Western United States, cover crop adoption
    rates are low, often owing to concerns over their uptake of critical soil water.
    Regional concerns, such as this, must be addressed to identify sustainable agricultural
    practices that meet unique needs of diverse growing regions. A two-year study
    was conducted to determine the impacts of cover crops on soil water dynamics,
    soil health, and crop growth during the establishment of an Autumn King table
    grape vineyard in a semi-arid, Mediterranean climate, specifically the Central
    Valley of California. Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), a plant species native
    to the region, and an introduced species, rye (Secale cereale L. ‘Merced’), were
    planted as cool season cover crops in the interrow spaces of the grapevines and
    compared to a standard management practice of no cover crop interrow spaces. The
    cover crop treatments differentially impacted soil microbial biomass and soil
    aggregate stability, with the phacelia treatment enhancing both metrics from the
    first season. The phacelia treatment plots resulted in higher soil moisture beneath
    the vines in both years, while the rye treatment showed similar benefits only
    after two consecutive years of cover cropping. Vine vigor was also higher in the
    phacelia treatment, which was likely consequential of enhanced soil moisture in
    the rows. Compared to the rye, the phacelia had lower plant tissue carbon to nitrogen
    ratio and higher above ground plant biomass, which may underpin the soil health
    benefits associated with the phacelia, although variances in soil total carbon
    and nitrogen and ammonium and nitrate were not determined for any treatment. Altogether,
    we present information on cover crop plant traits that show quicker return on
    investment with regards to soil health improvements and water savings. Further,
    we demonstrate that cool season cover crops offered benefits for vineyard water
    productivity. In summary, for Mediterranean vineyards, cover crops can promote
    vineyard soil quality and be a component of sustainable water management. Graphical

    Changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and the frequency of extreme climate
    events (i.e. heatwaves, floods, and droughts) threaten the future of food security
    (Nabhan et al., 2020). Both actively growing cover crops and mulch from cover
    crop residues provide multiple ecosystem services that can promote agronomic resilience
    in light of climate extremes (Power, 2010). Optimal crop water productivity is
    especially critical in the Southwestern United States, wherein large-scale agricultural
    production is dependent upon irrigation water resources, which have become increasingly
    limited (Nelson et al., 2016, Wada et al., 2010). Cover crops have demonstrated
    an array of soil health benefits that in turn support crop productivity. For example,
    Belmonte et al. (2018) reported that organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools,
    microbial biomass, and soil aggregate stability all increased with cropping systems
    that included cover crops and no-till farming. Stine, et al. (2002) reported that
    higher soil C and aggregate stability was correlated with higher crop yields.
    In addition to improving the chemical and biological health of soils, cover crops
    can also enhance soil physical properties, improving plant available water, water
    infiltration, and soil water retention. For example, García-González et al. (2018)
    reported that soil water-holding capacity and infiltration rates were enhanced
    by cover crops. Higher infiltration can decrease the portion of rainwater or irrigation
    inputs that is lost to runoff or ponding and evaporation, consequently increasing
    the portion that becomes plant-available (Abu-Hamdeh et al., 2006). Therefore,
    irrigation and rainwater are potentially used more efficiently in soils with cover
    crops, promoting water conservation. Although studies have indicated the benefits
    of cover crops for soil health and soil water dynamics, cover crop adoption rates
    are low in dry climates compared to temperate and continental climates (LaRose
    and Myers, 2019). In wine grape vineyards, cover crops can be planted under grapevines
    to reduce excess vine vigor by allowing competition for water (Novara et al.,
    2021). Thus, a common perception of cover crops in vineyards is that they will
    uptake soil water resources. In table grape production, where higher soil moisture
    is critical through production to allow berries to take on size, and irrigation
    supplies are increasingly challenged, the value of cover crops is debated. Further,
    the impacts of cover crops in early and mature vineyards can differ (Fourie et
    al., 2006), but there is a disparity of research evaluating cover crops in young
    table grape vineyards. Therefore, empirical data demonstrating cover crop impacts
    on water budgets and crop productivity are critical to evaluate the feasibility
    of cool season cover crops in semi-arid, perennial agriculture and during vineyard
    establishment. Thus, the main goal of this study was to determine how cover crops
    impacted a water budget during establishment of a table grape vineyard in a semi-arid
    climate. Further, we evaluated mechanistic underpinnings of variances in water
    demands from the treatments by assessing soil health properties across two years
    and cover crop residue chemistry. Soil health in this context refers to soil C
    and N, nitrate, ammonium, and nitrate leaching potential, bulk density, aggregate
    stability, and soil microbial biomass (SMB). We quantified vine vigor to reveal
    treatment impacts on the cash crop in 2020 and 2021. Two cover crop treatments
    were assessed; Lacy phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), a broad leaf, cool season
    annual forb native to California and Secale cereale cv. Merced, a cool season
    annual rye grass plant species introduced to the region. Both treatments were
    compared to a control wherein interrow spaces were maintained bare using herbicide.
    We hypothesized that the native forb plant would be best adapted to the local
    climate and be more likely to support mutualistic, symbiotic relationships with
    the biota of the landscape, thereby it may have better outcomes as a cover crop
    for soil health and vine vigor. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental design
    and vineyard management This study was conducted from Winter of 2019 to Spring
    of 2022 to evaluate the effects of two cover crop plant species in a table grape
    vineyard in Parlier, CA, USA (36.5960049, −119.5119173). This is an intensively
    cultivated area in a Mediterranean climate with precipitation levels well below
    grapevine evapotranspiration requirements during the growing season. Soil across
    the vineyard is a Hanford fine sandy loam with 0–2 percent slope and organic matter
    content typically less than 1%. Each treatment plot was 22 m long and 11 m wide
    and included four rows of grapevines and three interrow spaces, and these plots
    were organized in a 47.5 m x 65.8 m area field. The experimental design was a
    randomized complete block, where three rows of grapevines (running from west to
    east) were a block, and the block was subdivided into three plots in which the
    treatments were randomized (Figure S1A). There were four blocks in the experiment,
    i.e., four replications of each treatment. In December 2019, seed mixes, containing
    5 species each (either introduced or CA native plant species) were broadcasted
    over recently disked soil in interrow spaces. The introduced species mix was comprised
    of Flecha tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum), 35%; Berber orchardgrass (Dactylis
    glomerata), Merced Rye (Secale cereale L. ‘Merced’), 25%; Birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus
    corniculatus), 10%, and sour clover (Trifolium facatum), 10%. While the California
    native mix included California brome grass (Bromus carinatus), 40%; Blue wildrye
    (Elymus glaucus), 25%; Lacy-leaf Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), 15%; Arroyo
    lupine (Lupinus succulentus), 10%; and Common yarrow (Achillea millefolium), 10%.
    A seeding rate of 33.6 kg ha−1 was used for both mixes, applied to the center
    1.8 m of the interrow space between the 3.6 m spaced vine rows. After broadcast,
    seeds were shallowly incorporated ∼ 1 cm by a drag harrow approach. For each mix
    an early emerging species dominated (> 90% of planted emerged seedlings). Thus,
    this study focuses on comparisons of “Lacy leaf’ Phacelia (native species cover
    crop treatment, Figure S1B) and ‘Merced’ Rye (introduced species treatment, Figure
    S1C). A no-cover crop bare ground control treatment (Figure S1D) was also included
    and maintained using herbicides. Autumn King grapevines on Freedom variety rootstock
    were planted in May 2020. Before planting the grapevines, the plots were disked,
    but they were not tilled thereafter. A modified T cable trellis system was used
    to support the grapevines, and sleeves were applied to the young plants for protection
    from pests. A cane pruning strategy adapted from El-kereamy and Kurtural (2022)
    for use on a T cable trellis was applied to all the vines in 2021. The grapevine
    rows were irrigated via metered drip irrigation, independent for each treatment,
    and supplemental irrigation was applied via a microsprinkler system to the interrow
    spaces with cover crops during January- March to ensure establishment. Microsprinkler
    irrigation was applied using 180° fan jets facing interrow spaces, thus was not
    applied in the vine rows. Vine rows were irrigated with single line drip lines
    with emitters with flow rates of 3.79 L hr−1 spaced every 0.9 m. To present comparable
    units for each system, the volume of water applied on a per hectare basis was
    divided by the number of vines per hectare. Quantities of irrigation inputs (L
    vine−1 day−1) applied across both years via microsprinklers or drip irrigation
    systems are included in Table S1. All berms and alleys with no cover crop treatment
    were sprayed with glufosinate-ammonium (Lifeline®) herbicide at 3.5 L ha −1 each
    spring. A foliar fungicide and insecticide spray program was implemented in vine
    rows (Table S2), and gopher traps and an owl box were used for gopher control.
    2.2. Soil moisture and weather monitoring Continuous measurements of volumetric
    soil moisture were made via capacitance sensors (METER Group Inc., Pullman, WA,
    USA) installed at 20, 50, and 150 cm depths belowground in both the vine rows
    and in the interrow space of each treatment plot. Weekly average soil moisture
    content 20 cm below the vine row soil surfaces were analyzed to inform irrigation
    scheduling and for data reporting in this study. A target of ∼20% volumetric soil
    moisture, based on weekly average soil moisture at 20 cm in the grapevine rows
    for all 4 replicate plots, was used for irrigation scheduling. Owing to treatment-induced
    variances in soil moisture in response to the same irrigation inputs, differential
    irrigation programs were applied to the field in 2020. Monthly averages of irrigation
    inputs (for both cover crop interrow microsprinklers and vine row drip systems)
    and soil moisture were calculated to approximate irrigation inputs and soil moisture
    trends for years 2020 and 2021. Monthly averages of precipitation and air temperatures
    were gathered from the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS)
    (2023) at Station 39, Parlier, CA, USA. 2.3. Field soil sampling The procedure
    for sample collection and analysis was outlined in a previously published paper
    by Hale et al. (2021). Briefly, soil samples for each treatment were composites
    of 3 probes taken from the top 20 cm of soil and were collected approximately
    3.6 m apart from each other in both the grapevine rows and in the interrow locations.
    Grapevine row samples were taken approximately 0.6 m from the grapevine trunks
    to reduce bias from drip emitters and from the grapevine roots. Samples were collected
    in December 2019, to serve as baseline samples prior to cover crop establishment.
    In 2020 and 2021 soil samples were collected in April, to capture cover crop peak
    growth, June, when grapevines are growing vigorously, and in September, during
    version. Subsets of composite soil samples were stored at −80 °C and lyophilized
    for phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, oven- dried at 55 °C for chemical
    analyses, or air dried and used for measurements of wet aggregate stability. 2.4.
    Water stable soil aggregate quantitation Air dried 70 g subsamples from field
    soil samples of phacelia, rye, and no cover plots both in vine rows and interrows
    were assayed using a wet sieving method (Kemper and Rosenau, 1986). Soil was submerged
    in water for five minutes on a 2 mm sieve, then oscillated in water for 2 minutes
    at a rate of 1 oscillation per second. Soil which fell through the 2 mm mesh sieve
    was collected then oscillated in water on a on a 0.25 mm mesh for two minutes.
    Roots and gravel were removed from the soil remaining in both sieves. The two
    soil portions remaining in the sieves and the soil that passed through both sieves
    were then washed into separate, pre-weighed coffee filters, and after water drainage,
    samples were dried for 1–2 days at 50 °C. All three portions of soil were weighed,
    and the equation was used to calculate the percent soil aggregation in each size
    fraction. Mx was the mass of one of the three portions of dried soil, M1 was the
    soil which remained in the 2 mm sieve, M2 was the soil which remained in the.25 mm
    sieve, and M3 was the soil which fell through the mesh of both sieves. 2.5. Phospholipid
    fatty acid (PLFA) analysis After freeze drying field soil samples, 2 g (dry weight)
    subsamples were spiked with an internal standard. The standard was composed of
    10,000 pmol of 19:0 phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA)
    dissolved in 1:1 chloroform:methanol. The samples were processed using a high
    throughput PLFA extraction procedure (Buyer and Sasser, 2012), which used a solid
    phase extraction 96-well plate (Supelco 50 mg Discovery Plate, Millipore Sigma,
    Darmstadt, Germany) to purify PLFAs, which were then esterified to generate fatty
    acid methyl esters (FAMEs). FAMEs were then dissolved in hexane (100 μL) and run
    on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA)
    with peak naming software and a library of standards (PLFAD1) from MIDI Inc. (Newark,
    DE, USA) to analyze extracted FAMEs. With reference to the internal standard,
    total SMB in nmol PLFA extracted g−1 dry soil was determined for each soil sample.
    2.6. Soil chemical and analyses Approximately 20 g of dried soil samples were
    ground with mortar and pestle, sieved (840 µm mesh), and dried at 50 °C for 24 hours
    prior to TC and TN analyses. A 0.25 g subsample of the 20 g sample was analyzed
    on a TruMac CN Leco analyzer (LECO Corp., St. Joseph, MO). The TC and TN percentages
    were used to calculate C:N ratios. In addition, soil pH was determined for field
    fresh soil in a 1:5 soil-to-water solution using a standard pH probe. To determine
    soil mineral nitrogen species; nitrate (NO3-) plus nitrite (NO2-), and ammonium
    (NH4+), frozen, field-wet, soil samples were extracted with 2 M KCl at a 1:2.5
    dry weight equivalent (w/v) ratio. Analysis of KCl extracts were performed using
    a colorimetric method (Mulvaney, 1996) on a Lachat QuikChem Flow Injection Analysis
    System (Lachat Instrument, Loveland, CO, USA). Nitrogen leaching potential was
    quantified using resin collectors installed at 50 cm depth in vine rows of all
    treatment and control plots. Resins were installed on 15 November 2019, and collected
    on 19 November 2020, followed by a second set installed on 19 November 2020, and
    collected on 20 October 2021. A subsample of the resin material in each recovered
    collector was extracted three times with 2 M KCl at >90% recovery and analyzed
    for NO3- using a method described by Gao et al., (2020). 2.7. Soil plant available
    water holding capacity and bulk density To determine the plant available water
    holding capacity (θAWHC) of soils in vine rows and interrow spaces, soil cores
    were collected from 0 to 20 cm depth from 4 replicate plots per treatment and
    two locations: the centers of interrow spaces and within the vine rows, 0.6 m
    from vine trunks. After drying and processing the samples through a 2 mm sieve,
    soil samples were shipped to The University of Kentucky Soil Testing Laboratory.
    In accordance with published protocols ∼ 50 g of soil were packed into columns,
    saturated, and placed under 0.33 atm or 15 atm using a pressure plate apparatus
    to determine the soil moisture content at wilting point and field capacity, respectively
    (Klute, 1986; Elrick, 1955). Similar to Bagnall et al. (2022), volumetric water
    content and both field capacity (θFC) and permanent wilting point (θPWP) were
    calculated by multiplying gravimetric water content by the mean soil bulk density
    across all plot surface soils, assuming a density of water of 1.0 g cm−3. Soil
    θAWHC was considered to be the difference in θFC and θPWP. Bulk density measurements
    were taken for each location (interrow spaces and vine rows) in all treatment
    and control plots. A bulk density core was hammered into the soil surface and
    soil within the core was oven dried at 40 °C for one week, then weighed (Blake,
    1965). Dry bulk density was calculated as the mass of soil divided by the volume
    of the cylinder collection core. 2.8. Cover crop stoichiometry and biomass To
    examine aboveground properties of the cover crop plants, samples of cover crop
    biomass were collected during Spring 2022. A 0.5 m x 0.5 m polyvinyl chloride
    (PVC) quadrat was tossed randomly twice in each cover crop treatment plot for
    a total of 8 samples per treatment. The cover crops growing inside the area of
    the quadrat were clipped at the surface of the soil and collected. After bagging,
    drying, and weighing the samples, cover crop aboveground biomass was compared
    between the phacelia and rye treatments. Dried biomass samples were ground with
    a coffee grinder and evaluated on a TruMac CN Leco Analyzer (Leco Corporation,
    St. Joseph, MO, USA) to determine %N, %C, and C:N ratios. 2.9. Grapevine vigor
    Grapevine vigor measurements were performed yearly, during the dormant season,
    in December 2020 - January 2021 and March 2022. For the 2020 season, ten plants
    in the middle rows of each treatment plot were assessed. Shoot counts and total
    length were determined for canes before pruning and trunk diameters 12.7 cm above
    the grafting points were measured. After pruning, ten pruning samples (of the
    same grapevines) were taken from each plot and weighed, and two of the ten samples
    were dried. Regression analysis was used to calculate dry weights from wet weights.
    The average shoot weight (calculated by dividing the dry pruning weight by the
    number of shoots) and the pruning weight per length of shoot was only determined
    for 2020 season, because large grapevine canopies in 2021 resulted in tangled
    shoots and inability to distinguish shoot counts per vine. After the 2021 season,
    the dry pruning weight and the trunk diameter of 10 vines per plot replicate were
    determined. 2.10. Statistical analysis To compare variances in samples based on
    location of samples (under vines or interrow) or the cover crop treatment, we
    used analysis of variance (ANOVA) in R (version 4.0.5) and Sigma Plot 14.0 (Systat
    Software, Palo Alto, CA, USA). For data sets with multiple timepoints per year,
    a repeated measure ANOVA was used. Before analyses, normality and homogeneity
    assumptions of ANOVAs were tested. When the assumptions were not met, appropriate
    transformations were performed. A square root transformation was applied to the
    cover crop biomass data set, and a reciprocal transformation was applied to the
    nitrate vine row dataset for 2020. Log transformations were applied to pruning
    weight and average shoot mass data sets for the first year vine vigor and vine
    row carbon measurements. Soil moisture and pruning weight per length measurements
    did not show normal distribution even after transformation, so a nonparametric
    test (Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks) was used to test for
    significance. Because this test measures significant differences between median
    values of treatments, medians along with means were presented in tables when this
    test was used. When treatment differences were significant at the 0.05 level,
    LSD, Holm-Sidak method, and Bonferroni t-tests were used for pairwise multiple
    comparison procedures. SigmaPlot 14.0 was used to prepare graphs. 3. Results and
    discussion 3.1. Water dynamics Irrigation inputs and soil moisture were monitored
    to determine cover crop influence on water dynamics in the vineyard. In both 2020
    and 2021 supplemental irrigation was supplied to the cover crop treatments in
    the spring, but by May, when cover crops were mowed and vine irrigation was initiated,
    the volumetric soil moisture contents were not significantly different in treatment
    and control vine rows. This is an indication that the supplemental irrigation
    in the interrow did not drive variances in vine row soil moisture during grapevine
    irrigation. In 2020, irrigation inputs were consistent in volume from mid May
    to early June (Fig. 1A), yet vine row soils of the phacelia treatment maintained
    significantly higher soil moisture at the 20 cm depth than that in the rye and
    the no cover crop treatments (p =0.002). The average volumetric water contents
    during this period were 23.6%, 20.2%, 19.31% for the phacelia, rye, and the no
    cover crop treatment, respectively (Table S2). Since volumetric soil moisture
    in the treatments varied significantly in the early season (Fig. 1A), a differential
    irrigation program was applied to the vineyard in July 2020 to maintain vines
    at similar soil moisture status. Irrigation timings were reduced in the phacelia
    plots on 2 July 2020 and in the rye plots on 9 September 2020, resulting in less
    water required weekly to maintain these treatments at ∼20% volumetric water content
    (Fig. 1A). In 2021, vine row soil moisture values at 20 cm were not significantly
    different during any given week, so differential irrigation programs were not
    scheduled. However, across the summer irrigation season, both cover treatments
    (phacelia and rye) had significantly higher vine row soil moisture at the 20 cm
    depth (repeated measures ANOVA, p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). Altogether, in 2020 and 2021,
    the interrows of both cover crop treatments were irrigated to ensure cover crop
    establishment, although in 2021, the amount of water applied to the cover crops
    was much lower (Fig. 1B). Both cover crop treatments resulted in higher vine row
    soil moisture, well after the cover crops were terminated, indicating some benefits
    to soil water dynamics. However, the late season reduced irrigation inputs did
    not overcome the water used to establish the cover crops. Download : Download

    of the phacelia (blue), rye (red), and no cover (green) treatment plots (n=4)
    in year 1 (A) and year 2 (B). Different letters indicate that soil moisture was
    significantly different across the growing season (May- Oct) in 2020 (capital
    letters) or 2021 (lowercase letters) based on a repeated measures ANOVA (p < 0.05).
    White and red bar plots indicate monthly average daily temperature minimum (white
    fill) and maximum (white + red fill) (left y axis) and line plots indicate monthly
    accumulated precipitation (right y axis) in year 1 (C) and year 2 (D). The seasonal
    timing of irrigation may be important to note for growers considering implementing
    cover crops. Because cool season cover crops were used, supplemental irrigation
    for cover crops was applied in early spring. In Mediterranean climates, the spring
    season is generally associated with higher precipitation and lower temperature,
    but in 2020 and 2021 there was lower than average rainfall in the cool season
    (63% and 71% of average, respectively) (Figs. 1C and 1D). Thus, in years with
    average or above average precipitation, supplemental irrigation is likely not
    necessary for good cover crop establishment, particularly if cover crops are well
    adapted to this climate. Further, surface water resources for irrigation may be
    more available in early spring, compared to late summer, which has implications
    for reduced groundwater pumping. Thus, water savings during the late summer months
    suggest a substantial advantage of cover crops in landscapes where irrigation
    water resources are limited or rely on extraction of groundwater in mid- late
    summer. The objective of many growers in dry regions is to maintain grapevine
    health and productivity while sustainably using soil and water resources. Previous
    reports indicated that cool season cover crops enhanced available water content
    after just one and two seasons in a Mediterranean apricot orchard with clay soil
    (Demir, et al., 2019). However, in this study the sandy loam soil in both interrow
    and vine row locations had similar θAWHC in treatment and control plots (p = 0.11),
    indicating that soil water retention was not yet discernable (Table S4). The overall
    soil moisture trends in the cover crop treatments suggest benefits of cover crops
    in semi-arid climates, especially considering additional soil health and ecosystem
    benefits associated with the cover crops. 3.2. Soil properties Soil aggregation
    is an important component of soil health and influences soil water retention (Guber
    et al., 2003). The phacelia treatment had a significantly greater percentage of
    soil maintained in water-stable aggregates as compared to the rye and no cover
    treatments in both vine row and interrow spaces (p = 0.005) (Figs. 2A and 2C).
    The average percentages of soil aggregates > 2 mm were 14.9%, 7.6%, and 7.0% for
    the phacelia, rye, and no cover crop plots, respectively (Table S4). This finding
    corroborates a study reporting that cover crops and no tillage can increase aggregate
    stability in loamy Mediterranean soils (Belmonte et al., 2018). But our finding
    revealed that the phacelia cover crop, in particular, was effective at increasing
    the aggregate stability compared to the rye cover crop. Traits of the cover crop
    plant species including rooting strategies and depth, symbiotic associations,
    biomass and growth strategies may differentially impact desirable outcomes associated
    with their use (Brasier et al., 2021, Griffiths et al., 2022). Interestingly,
    the impact of phacelia on aggregate stability occurred in both interrow and vine
    row locations; although, the effect of cover crops on soils in vine row locations
    was primarily limited to shade or mowed residue, but not likely impacted by cover
    crop roots during first year of the study. While aggregate stability was significantly
    higher in the phacelia treatment plots, soil bulk density was not significantly
    different in any treatment or control plots within the vine rows or interrow spaces

    in vine row (B) and interrow (D) soils in the phacelia (blue), rye (red), and
    no cover (green) plots (n=4). Different letters indicate significant differences
    in means based on treatment within each year in 2020 (capital letters) or 2021
    (lowercase letters), (ANOVA, Holm-Sidak, P < 0.05). Similarly, in both years across
    the growing season, soil TC and TN were not affected by the cover crop treatments
    in vine or interrow locations (repeated measures ANOVA, p > 0.05, Table S5). Nitrate
    leaching potential in vine rows and soil NH4+ in vine rows nor interrows did not
    differ based on treatment in either year (Table S5). However, soil NO3- was significantly
    higher in interrows of the phacelia treatment in 2020, but in 2021 was lower in
    the phacelia treatment compared to the no cover control plots. While this variance
    was not observed beneath vine rows, it is an indication of the cover crop turnover
    and nutrient uptake may shift soil fertility status from year to year in interrow
    spaces. In drip irrigated vineyards, vine roots are largely consolidated beneath
    drip lines, thus reduction in interrow space soil fertility may have negligible
    impacts on vine health, but could have consequences for vineyard replant or the
    success of the following year’s cover cop. Use of leguminous interrow cover crop
    were shown to enhance soil nitrogen and vine nitrogen uptake in an Italia table
    grape vineyard (Ferrara et al., 2021). Thus, cover crop species selection could
    be modified to reduce likelihood of potential detrimental impacts of cover crop
    nutrient uptake. While cover crop root exudates have been shown to lower soil
    pH, which can destabilize soil carbon and influence nutrient availabilities (Dijkstra,
    et al., 2021), in this study, soil pH was not impacted or was marginally higher
    under the cover crop Total SMB in the interrow spaces across the 2020 season was
    significantly higher in the phacelia treatment compared to the rye treatment or
    control plots (Table S5), but the average annual SMB was not significantly different
    between phacelia and control plots (Fig.2B and D). The same trend occurred in
    the vine row soils with the phacelia, rye, and control plots (Fig. 2B and D, Table
    S5). In the second year there was no significant differences in SMB in vine row
    soils (p = 0.71), however there was a treatment effect on soils in the interrow
    location (p <.001). The phacelia and rye treatment had a significantly higher
    average SMB compared to the no cover treatment with values of 24.0, 22.6, 19.3
    nmol PLFA g−1 soil for the phacelia, rye and no cover treatments, respectively
    (Fig. 2B and D, Table S5). The influence of phacelia on the biological components
    of the soils may underpin shifts in soil aggregate stability and soil moisture
    associated with this cover crop treatment. Microbial activity, such as bacterial
    production of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and fungal hyphae and glycoproteins
    can bind soil particles together, thus promoting soil aggregate stability and
    moisture retention (Costa et al., 2018). Notably, SMB has been demonstrated to
    increase in response to cover crops in California orchards (Rodriguez-Ramos et
    al., 2022) and broadly, by 27%, in a global meta-analysis when cover cropping
    was compared to bare fallow (Kim et al., 2020). The higher SMB in the phacelia
    plots may indicate higher activity in chemical cycling, influencing nutrient bioavailability
    to the grapevines. Previously, Augé, et al. (2001) reported increases in plant-growth-promoting
    soil bacteria and mycorrhizal fungal populations through the use of cover crops,
    which promoted conversion of mineral-bound or organically-complexed nutrients
    into to plant-available forms. Altogether, these findings suggest soil health
    benefits associated with cover crops in a table grape vineyard, not only beneath
    the cover crops, but beneath the vines as well, suggesting an important return
    on investment for growers using cover crops. 3.3. Cover crop traits Both cover
    crops were seeded as part of seed mixtures, but were singularly dominant with
    more than 95% of the seedlings emerged. The seeding rate of 33.6 kg ha−1 was likely
    too high and thus crowding and shading by a fast growing and/or early germinating
    species was possible. Further, the seed mixes were generated on a mass basis.
    The small seed mass for both phacelia and rye likely contributed higher seed numbers
    for both of these species. To achieve cover crop mixtures, using a 1000-seed weights
    conversion of the species components to base the percentages of each component
    in the mixtures would likely be ideal (Brennan et al., 2011). The rye aboveground
    biomass had higher portions of C in the collected residues than did the phacelia
    cover crop, 37.5% and 40.5%, respectively while the phacelia residues had higher
    portions of N with average %N of 0.9% and 1.8% in the rye and phacelia residues,
    respectively (Table 1). Thus, the C:N ratio was lower in the phacelia than the
    rye cover crop plant material, with mean values of 22.2 for phacelia and 48.0
    for rye (p <.001). The C:N ratio in plants has been inversely correlated with
    the rate of decomposition of plant matter (Wortman et al., 2006). While a lower
    C:N ratio for the cover crop and faster decomposition would mean that soils would
    lose the protective cover of the plant residues more rapidly, the faster rate
    of decomposition would increase the rate of nutrient inputs into the soil from
    the plant matter. Because the phacelia cover crop litter had a lower C:N ratio
    this treatment likely had more rapid decomposition in the soil compared to rye
    (Henriksen and Breland, 1999). Also, the cover crop biomass was greater in the
    phacelia than the rye plots (p = 0.05), averaging 308 g m−2 and 221 g m−2, respectively
    (Table 1). As mentioned previously, we found that the phacelia treatment was associated
    with higher SMB in both vine row and interrow spaces. Both phacelia and Merced
    rye were previously attributed with robust root systems, readily decomposable
    residues, and stimulatory impacts on soil microbial biomass carbon, particularly
    in phacelia plots (Wyland et al., 1996). The greater plant biomass along with
    the faster decomposition rate of the phacelia residue may indicate that this species
    is more favorable than rye as a cover crop when short-term boosts to soil microbial
    populations are desirable. Likewise, the low C:N ratio and high biomass of phacelia
    could be indicators that this species is both successful in its establishment
    and has tendency to readily decompose. Further phacelia is an exceptional attractant
    of pollinators and beneficial insects (Pontin, et al., 2006), providing additional
    benefits in agroecosystems. Notably, treatment impacts in both vine row and interrow
    soils of the phacelia treatment were revealed during cover crop growth and after
    its termination, suggesting that cover crop mediated impacts in vines and orchards
    extend beyond the interrow and cool season. Table 1. Cover crop plant traits.

    Captions 3.4. Grapevine vigor Grapevine vigor, including trunk diameter and shoot
    growth parameters, are common metrics used to approximate vine health and are
    important during the establishment phase of the vines. For the first year, pruning
    weight, trunk diameter, average shoot weight and pruning weight/cane length were
    greater in grapevines in the phacelia plots than rye and no cover crop treatment
    plots (Fig. 3 A-D; Table S6). For the second year, pruning weight per vine was
    greater in both the phacelia and no cover plots compared to the rye plots (Fig.
    3A) and trunk diameter was greater in the phacelia plots than in the other two
    treatments (Fig. 3B). The underlying mechanism behind the enhanced vine vigor
    in response to phacelia may be the higher soil moisture in that treatment. Also,
    although, aggregate stability does not directly impact the health of the grapevines,
    this property of soil can affect water movement and thus nutrient movement, by
    creating pore spaces in soils (USDA-NRCS, 2008). Together, these data indicate
    that impacts of the phacelia cover crop on soil water dynamics and resources for
    SMB co-varied with enhanced vine vigor in these treatment plots. These vine vigor
    trends also confirm that the higher soil moisture in the phacelia treatment was
    not due to small or weak vines in that treatment extracting less water. Previously,
    a phacelia cover crop treatment was demonstrated to increase yield of a subsequent
    broccoli crop, wherein its benefit was associated with enhanced soil N mineralization
    and SMB (Wyland et al., 1996). However, we revealed similar benefits of the phacelia
    cover crop treatment when seeded in interrow spaces of a vineyard. In order to
    confirm the positive effect of a native cover crop like phacelia on grapevine
    health, the berry yield and quality needs to be assessed. Download : Download

    differences in means based on treatment within each year in 2020 (capital letters)
    or 2021 (lowercase letters) ANOVA, Holm-Sidak, P < 0.05). 4. Conclusions In the
    first year of the study, it was observed that the use of phacelia as a cover crop
    resulted in greater soil moisture and grapevine vigor as compared to rye and no
    cover crop treatments. The phacelia treatment also resulted in greater SMB than
    rye. The soil moisture in the vine rows of the phacelia plots were on average
    15% higher than the rye plots and 41% higher than in the no cover crop plots,
    a trend which was retained even after the irrigation input was decreased in the
    phacelia cover crop treatment plots. In the second year, soil moisture was similar
    in the cover crop plots, both of which were higher than no cover crop plots. The
    mass of soil in 2 mm or larger stable aggregates was 7–8% higher in the phacelia
    treatment plots compared to the rye and no cover crop treatment plots. The observed
    grapevine vigor, soil aggregation, and soil moisture benefits in plots with phacelia
    were not expected to be seen so definitively in the first years of vineyard establishment.
    These outcomes may be attributed to the higher cover biomass and lower C:N ratio
    of the phacelia plant material. Potentially the phacelia has a greater ease in
    establishment since it is a native species, and its broad leaf structure protects
    or shades the soil more effectively as compared to an erect-growing grass species,
    rye. The lower C:N ratio of phacelia likely resulted in more rapid decomposition
    of its residues, as evidenced by enhanced SMB, suggesting higher soil nutrient
    turnover and greater stimulus to the soil food web. This study demonstrated greater
    benefits in soil moisture and soil health aspects with the use of a native species,
    phacelia than an introduced species, rye as a cover crop. Nevertheless, in general,
    both cover crops had added benefits to the vineyard compared to the no cover crop
    system. CRediT authorship contribution statement Margaret Fernando: Data curation,

    the Eastern Gangetic Plain (EGP) soil hydrology is a major determinant of land
    use and also governs the ecosystem services derived from cropping systems, particularly
    greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rice fields. To characterize patterns of soil
    hydrology in these, daily field monitoring of water levels was conducted during
    the monsoon (kharif) season in a comparatively wet (2021) and dry (2022) year
    with flooding depth and drainage tracked with field water tubes across 47 (2021)
    and 183 (2022) locations. Fields were clustered into hydrologic response types
    (HRT) which can then be used for land surface modelling, land use recommendations,
    and to target agronomic interventions that contribute to sustainable development
    outcomes. Clusters based on two methods of summarizing a single information source
    were compared. The information source was a time-series of field water-level observations,
    and the two methods were (1) the original time-series and their first differences
    and (2) a set of derived hydrologic descriptors that are conceptually related
    to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Clustering was (1) by k-means with an optimization
    of cluster numbers and (2) by hierarchical clustering with the same number of
    clusters as identified by k-means. Hydrologic behaviour shifted dramatically between
    growing seasons, and it was not possible to identify consistent HRT''s across
    years. The clusters had only a weak relation with soil properties, almost no relation
    with farmer perception of relative landscape position, and no relation with rice
    establishment method. Clusters based on time-series were moderately well predicted
    in the dry year 2022 by optimized random forest models, with the most important
    predictors being the number of irrigations, seasonal precipitation, pre-monsoon
    groundwater levels, seasonal groundwater level change, and pH, this latter as
    a surrogate for landscape position and other soil properties. In the wet year
    2021 clusters were (poorly) predicted by just seasonal precipitation and pre-monsoon

    Cambisols, Fluvisols, Vertisols In the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) soil hydrology
    is a major determinant of the spatial distribution of land use systems. These
    are mainly rice-based systems: dominantly rice-wheat with rice-pulse and rice-maize
    annual rotations also practised in the monsoon (kharif) and dry winter seasons
    (rabi), respectively. In the lower Ganges Plain, double rice crops are also common
    (Timsina and Connor, 2001). Rice is especially adapted to saturated soil conditions
    and periodic shallow flooding that other crops without physiological traits like
    aerenchyma cannot survive (Miro and Ismail, 2013). As such, soil hydrology during
    the monsoon season governs the distribution and production risks faced by rice
    and non-rice crops (Urfels et al., 2021; McDonald et al., 2006). The source of
    soil water (rain, floods, lateral flow, through flow), inter-annual variation,
    seasonal pattern, and within-season time series of water levels in and above the
    soil greatly influence crop management (e.g. timing of crop establishment) as
    well as yield outcomes (McDonald et al., 2022) Soil hydrology is also a major
    determinant of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these systems (Kraus et al.,
    2015). Many global assessments of GHG emissions in rice assume that systems are
    flooded for the duration of the cropping season, and that major reductions in
    GHG emissions are achievable if water management is changed to favor periodic
    or occasional drainage (Bo et al., 2022). Accurate modelling of soil water dynamics
    is crucial to simulate GHG-drivers parameters such as pH, redox potential (Eh),
    and substrate concentrations (Yin et al., 2020). The landscape of the IGP has
    clear differences in soil hydrology due to local landscape position and the relation
    to fluvial systems (Sinha et al., 2005) and groundwater resources (Bonsor et al.,
    2017). This is recognized by the local perception of landscape position as “upland”,
    “medium land”, “lowland”, although these terms have no precise definition and
    vary across sub-regions. Soil profile characteristics (e.g., hydraulic conductivity,
    porosity, bulk density, layering) also affect soil hydrology, irrespective of
    landscape position. Some of these effects can be seasonal or transient in nature.
    For example, temporal differences in hydraulic conductivity may control early-season
    patterns of soil moisture variation but have no influence on the field water balance
    later in the season, when landscape and shallow groundwater factors exert more
    influence. Management practices including irrigation, puddling and compaction
    also have impacts on dynamic soil properties that can vary within a season, notably
    water balance and hydraulic conductivity varying with degree of saturation (McDonald
    et al., 2006). The totality of the time series of soil hydrology is termed the
    soil hydrological response. This is expressed both within and between seasons.
    Clusters of sites with similar soil hydrology are termed hydrological response
    types (HRT). The hydrology of the Bihar portion of the eastern IGP is complex.
    The Ganges River flows across the centre of the State, and has several major tributaries
    coming from the Himalayan foothills to the north and Jharkand State to the south
    (Jain and Sinha, 2003). These have formed terraces and abandoned channels, and
    are further drained by smaller streams and canals. These factors contribute to
    the observed spatial variability of the time-series of soil-water relations. The
    objective of this work is to identify and characterize soil hydrological response
    types (HRT) for the cropland of the IGP in Bihar state, where rice is the kharif
    component. This landscape segmentation is intended for use in models where soil
    hydrology dynamics are important, e.g., GHG emission models. Once identified,
    the HRT could be used to select representative sites for modelling, allowing extrapolation
    of results to other sites with the same HRT. The HRT can also be used for suitability
    evaluation for alternative rice-based systems, including new technologies (e.g.,
    direct-seeded rice, adjusted planting dates, variety maturity class) or management
    strategies, including opportunities for irrigation-led intensification (Balwinder-Singh
    et al., 2019). This work is part of the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia
    (CSISA) of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in partnership
    with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the International
    Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and the International Water Management Institute
    (IWMI) (CIMMYT, 2017). Among CSISA''s goals are (1) to accelerate widespread adoption
    of resource-conserving practices, technologies and services that increase yields
    with lower water, labour and input costs and (2) to disseminate new knowledge
    on cropping system management practices that can withstand the impacts of climate
    variability and change. To achieve these goals, CSISA and the Indian Council of
    Agricultural Research (ICAR) have initiated a partnership to characterize crop
    production systems at the national scale (McDonald et al., 2023). This initiative,
    termed the ‘Landscape Crop Assessment Survey (LCAS)’ endeavours to enrich basic
    data stacks on yield and agronomic production practices with environmental data,
    including weather, soils, and hydrologic characterization information. 1. Soil
    hydrologic response types Several efforts have been made to group soils by their
    hydrologic behaviour. An early example is the “hydrology of soil types” (HOST)
    system developed for the United Kingdom (Boorman et al., 1995; Lilly et al., 1998).
    HOST groups soils by the dominant pathways and rate of water movement through
    soil, and was designed primary for watershed hydrology modelling. Another common
    classification is the USDA''s hydrologic soil groups (HSG) (USDA Natural Resources
    Conservation Service, 2020), which have been mapped at Global scale (Ross et al.,
    2018) and in smaller regions (Faouzi et al., 2023) in support primarily of rainfall-runoff
    relations for RUSLE-based soil erosion modelling using the curve number (CN) method
    (Garen and Moore, 2005) or as an enhancement to DNDC using the related MUSLE soil
    erosion model (Deng et al., 2011). Classifications for specific model types include
    those of Quisenberry et al. (1993), who grouped South Carolina (USA) soils based
    on their behaviour for water and chemical transport. The close relation between
    soil hydrology and landscape position within a watershed was proven by, among
    others, Park and van de Giesen (2004). Landscape segmentation of wetlands is well-developed
    as a hydrogeomorphic (HGM) classification (Semeniuk and Semeniuk, 2018) based
    on geomorphic setting, dominant water source and transport, and hydrodynamics
    of moving water. However, in the IGP, neither watershed nor soil erosion modelling
    are of primary importance, and most of the agricultural area is not developed
    from reclaimed wetlands, rather from alluvial plains and terraces. Here the interest
    is in the time sequence over the year of presence of water in and over the soil
    profile, potentially influenced by the dynamic interactions between landscape
    position, soil properties, groundwater, irrigation, and soil management. Hence
    a new approach is needed. 2. Study area The Indian state of Bihar is at the eastern
    end of the IGP, bisected by the Ganges from west to east, and with several major
    tributaries: the Sone, Ghaghara, Gandak and Koshi. The State is of low relief
    except for some hilly areas bordering Nepal to the northwest and Jharkhand to
    the south. Agriculture is the dominant land use, with rice-wheat systems in the
    wet (kharif) and dry (rabi) seasons as the dominant land use. Maize and pulses
    systems are found in some areas in the winter cropping cycle. A wide variety of
    secondary crops are grown, especially in areas with good access to major markets
    such as the capital city Patna. This State is a priority area for the activities
    of CSISA. In this study only the areas planted to kharif rice are characterized.
    3. Data sources The identification of HRT is based on clustering observations
    from direct field measurements. Observations from two contrasting kharif seasons
    (July – October) were used to determine if HRT are consistent over years, or must
    be recalculated for each year. Year 2021 had more precipitation than long-term
    (1901–2017) area-weighted statistics (904 mm, standard deviation 156 mm) for the
    four kharif months (June–September) in Bihar (Government of India, 2022). In this
    year the kharif rainfall over six stations near the field locations had a mean
    of 474 mm and a standard deviation of 130 mm for the three months recorded (July–September),
    however June 2021 had so much rainfall that gauges were not monitored and rice
    could not be established. By contrast for 2022 the 23 rainfall gauges averaged
    only 354 mm for the season. This was less than any previous amount in the 1901–2017
    period.. Field observations were made as part of the Landscape Crop Assessment
    Surveys (LCAS). This survey included farmer-reported information on hydrology-related
    management practices at each site: rice establishment method (2022 only), number
    of irrigations, timing of irrigations (early vegetative, mid vegetative, flowering
    and grain filling), reason for irrigating (visible crop stress, soil cracking,
    disappearance of flood water, crop growth stage), tubewell depth, pump type and
    power. In 2021 the management practices were consistent among sites, likely due
    to the very wet conditions than limited options and made irrigation irrelevant.
    At 47 (2021) and 160 (2022) LCAS points, a set of so-called pani-pipes (“pani”
    is the Hindi word for “water”) were installed in farmer''s fields during the kharif
    season in 2021 and 2022. These are 30 cm long by 10 cm diameter plastic tubes
    inserted to a depth of 15 cm in the soil, so that 15 cm are above the soil surface,
    with 5 cm diameter holes, spaced 2 cm apart (edge to edge) both horizontally and
    vertically, in the section below the soil surface. At each pani-pipe location
    the farmer was asked for the perceived landscape position, one of “upland”, “medium
    land”, “lowland”. These terms refer not to the actual local elevation, but rather
    the farmers'' perception of relative differences in hydrology in a local context
    that also pertains to the types of crops that can be cultivated during the wet
    kharif season. “Lowland” is often flooded with poor drainage; “upland” allows
    a full range of crops, with irrigation if necessary and also good drainage; “medium
    land” is intermediate. These terms are not used consistently across the study
    area, but are commonly-used local terms. In 2022 many sites were paired or closely-spaced,
    for comparison of direct-seeded rice (DSR) and transplanted rice (TPR). In the
    smaller study of 2021 all sites were TPR. Pipes were installed at representative
    locations in the field at the technician''s discretion. The water levels in the
    pipes were measured each morning during the cropping season. The measured levels
    thus ranged between −15 to +15 cm from the soil surface. In 2022 water levels
    above the pipe top were also measured. The pani-pipes show the water level, but
    not the soil moisture status in the 0 to −15 cm range. In addition, rain gauges
    (2021: 6, 2022: 23) were installed near sets of pani-pipes and read daily. The
    2021 dataset consists of 47 pani-pipes, all in West Champaran district in northwestern
    Bihar (Fig. 9). These were read from 21-July through 07-November-2021. The 2022
    dataset consists of 160 pani-pipes from 15 districts of Bihar and three districts
    of the adjacent eastern Uttar Pradesh State (Fig. 10). These were read from 06-July
    until rice harvest in mid-October-2022. Groundwater levels pre- and post-monsoon
    (2021: mid-January and late November; 2022 late May and early November) were obtained
    from the National Water Informatics Centre (NWIC) for 596 (2021) and 781 (2022)
    monitoring wells distributed over Bihar and eastern UP. Each pani-pipe location
    was matched with its closest well using the st_distance function of the sf R package.
    This distance ranged from 2400 to 24,000 m, median 11,450 m (2021, 10 wells) and
    650 to 16,300 m, median 4900 m (2022, 34 wells). Using the same method, each pani-pipe
    was matched with its closest rain gauge, for which the in-season total rainfall
    was computed. This distance ranged from 46 to 45,600 m, median 4040 m (2021, 6
    gauges) and 0 to 35,600 m, median 810 m (2022, 23 gauges). The terrain elevation
    of each pani-pipe was extracted from the Amazon Web Services Terrain Tile service
    (Amazon Web Services, 2023) using the elevatr R package, at zoom level 11 (approximately
    120 m horizontal resolution). Elevation differences were not large in this plain
    area, but did range from 63 to 120 m.a.s.l. (2021) and 38–117 m.a.s.l. (2022).
    Differences within the 120 m tile in these rice-growing areas are minor in comparison,
    around 3 m maximum. At the pani-pipe location soil samples were also collected
    and analysed in the soil chemistry laboratory of the Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central
    Agricultural University, Pusa, Bihar, and the Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour,
    Bihar, for the 2021 and 2022 datasets, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the basic
    soil properties. There was a fairly wide total and inter-quartile range for most
    properties. Table 1. Soil properties, 2021 (left), 2022 (right); sand, silt, clay,

    All computation was with packages of the R environment for statistical computing
    (R Core Team, 2023). An R Markdown (Allaire et al., 2023) document was developed
    to ensure reproducible results. 4.1. Characterizing time series of pani-pipe measurements
    The time series of water levels in the pani-pipes were considered two ways: (1)
    as a combined time series of water levels and their first differences; (2) as
    a set of descriptors of hydrologic conditions. These are both used to characterize
    the time series and as inputs to clustering algorithms. The water levels show
    the sequence of unsaturated, saturated and flooded conditions at different heights
    and depths. This is especially important for inferring redox conditions for GHG
    models. The first differences of the time series are the one-day lag changes in
    the water level in the pani-pipes. They show the speed at which water level changes.
    This is related to the “flashiness” of the hydrology. The 17 descriptors are meant
    to represent and summarize the hydrologic behaviour of field water level to be
    easily associated with management and models outcomes, for example when estimating
    GHG emissions using process-based models. The descriptors are of three general
    types, according to the aspect of the hydrology that they characterize. 1. Flood
    periods: (1) percent of days flooded, i.e., water is above the soil surface (days.flood.pct,
    %); (2) percent of days of soil flooded at depths of 0–5 cm (flood.0.5.cm, %);
    (3) at depths of 5 to 10 cm (flood.5.10.cm, %); (4) at deeper than 10 cm (flood.10.cm,
    %); (5) Percent of days of flood events with duration less than two days (flood.events.one.day,
    %); (6) same, within a week (flood.events.one.week, %); (7) same, within one month
    (flood.events.one.month, %); (8) same, more than one month (flood.events.more.month,
    %). 2. Drainage periods (water level ): (9) percent days of with the water level
    between −5–0 cm (flood.5.0.cm, %); (10) same, −10–-5 cm (flood.10.5.cm, %); (11)
    same, deeper than −10 cm (flood.10.minus.cm, %); (12) average duration of soil
    drainage at −5–0 cm (avg.duration.dry.5.0, days); (13) same, −10–-5 cm (avg.duration.dry.10.5,
    days); (14) same, deeper than −10 cm (avg.duration.dry.10.minus, days). 3. Transition
    between potentially saturated/unsaturated conditions: (15) number of flood events
    (flood.events, count); (16) number of days when water level drops from 5 cm to
    −5 cm (days.redox, count); (17) number of days when the water level drops more
    than 15 cm (days.quick.drain, count). Although the pipes only show the water level,
    and the saturation status and redox potential is not an instantateous response
    to water level, this approximation is the closes we can come with our information
    to estimating saturated/unsaturated conditions. Several of these descriptors have
    special significance for GHG modelling and land management. For example, descriptor
    (16) represents the transition from potentially reducing to potentially oxidizing
    conditions near the soil surface, while descriptor (17) represents quick drainage.
    However, all are useful for clustering into groups from which representative sites
    can be selected for GHG models. Tables 2 (2021) and 3 (2022) show the summary
    statistics for the descriptors. Table 2. Summary of descriptors, 2021. See text

    and absolute water levels) and their descriptors were used to cluster the pani-pipes
    into functional groups. Before attempting any clustering, we checked the clustering
    tendency with the Hopkins statistic calculated with the hopkins R package, and
    only proceeded if this indicated that clustering is sensible. We clustered using
    two approaches. The first was k-means clustering, implemented by comparing the
    kmeans function of the stats package with the default Hartigan-Wong algorithm
    and 24 random starting positions. An optimum number of clusters was determined
    by comparing the Beale, silhouette, elbow and gap statistic indices computed by
    the NbClust function of the NbClust R package (Charrad et al., 2014). The relative
    importance of the descriptors for k-means clustering was evaluated with the FeatureImpCluster
    R package, which implements permutation feature importance as described by Molnar
    (2022). The second approach was hierarchical clustering implemented by the hclust
    function of the stats R package to produce a dendrogram, with the “Ward.D2” linkage
    method, which produces compact, spherical clusters. For this, we used the number
    of clusters determined by comparing the indices for k-means clusters. The dendrograms
    reveal the distance between clusters, but also show potential clusters at coarser
    and finer levels of detail. Cluster assignments were compared with cross-classification
    tables, and the agreement between methods or years was quantified as the average
    of the weighted (by total in a cluster) matches to the dominant cluster of the
    other classification (Eq. 1): (1) where is an individual matrix entry in row and
    column of the matrix, are row and column sums, respectively, and is the total
    number of observations. This clustering quality index is for perfect agreement
    (whether the cluster numbers are the same), and from for a random assignment to
    clusters, indicating no correspondence. Representative pani-pipes were identified
    for each cluster, for both methods and both data sources, by finding the closest
    observation, in Euclidean feature space, to the k-means cluster centroids. 4.3.
    Comparison with landscape descriptors and soil properties The clusters were used
    as one margins (row or column) of cross-classification tables, with the other
    margin being landscape descriptors (farmer''s perception of landscape position)
    or the rice management system (DSR and TPR). This was quantified by the clustering
    quality index developed for comparing clusters (§4.2). The cluster assignments
    were also used as factors in one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means separation
    of soil properties. This reveals to what degree soil properties are related to
    the empirically-derived clusters based on hydrologic behaviour. A more general
    question is which factors (e.g., soil, groundwater resources, terrain elevation,
    irrigation management) can best explain the differences in hydrologic behaviour
    between clusters. For this, random forest models were built to predict the empirically-derived
    cluster number from these factors. Management choices (only for 2022) included
    as predictors in the models were planting method (direct-seeded or transplanted),
    number of irrigations, timing of irrigations (early vegetative, mid vegetative,
    flowering and grain filling), reason for irrigating (visible crop stress, soil
    cracking, disappearance of flood water, crop growth stage), depth of tube well
    (shallow or deep), pump type and power. Note that these factors are not necessarily
    direct causes of a site''s being in a given cluster – the random forest model
    is predictive, not explanatory. But their importance in the fitted model may be
    useful for interpretation. Other predictors were pre- and post-monsoon water levels
    and their difference (seasonal change) in the nearest groundwater well, terrain
    elevation, and annual rainfall at the nearest rain gauge. Certainly, other factors
    could be important predictors, notably subsoil properties that affect water movement.
    Unfortunately these were not included in the experimental design. Random forest
    classification models were built with the ranger R package (Wright and Ziegler,
    2017) and optimized by recursive feature elimination with the caret package (Kuhn,
    2008). Random forest probability models were also built, to evaluate the uncertainty
    of class assignment. The sets of class probabilities for each observation were
    quantified by the Confusion Index and Shannon entropy. The Confusion Index (Burrough
    et al., 1997) (Eq. 2) is defined as: (2) where is the probability of the most
    probable class, and is the probability of the second most probable class. It shows
    how well the classification is separated from its alternative. Shannon entropy
    (Eq. 3) shows the information uncertainty. For a variable with classes, each of
    which has estimated proportion : (3) The reason to use base- logarithms is so
    that 0 represents no uncertainty, and 1 maximum (Kempen et al., 2009). Paired
    (within 200 m) DSR and TPR plots were identified and their time-series of water
    levels compared visually. 5. Results 5.1. Clusters and their hydrologic regimes
    5.1.1. Water levels Using the water levels and their first differences, in both
    2021 and 2022 the optimum number of clusters using k-means was two; however, it
    is clear that there are more response units on the agricultural landscape. From
    the plots of number of clusters vs. indices we found that four (2021) and five
    (2022) clusters were quite close to the optimum, and so continued the analysis
    with these groupings. The various optimization criteria did not give consistent
    recommendations for optimization, showing that clustering was not clear-cut. The
    model efficiency coefficient (MEC) of k-means clustering on time-series were (2021,
    four clusters) and (2022, five clusters). This shows that 2022 (dry conditions)
    was a less consistent year with more poorly-defined clusters, and that in 2021
    (wet conditions) fewer clusters were indicated. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 show the first
    differences of the time-series of water levels for 2021 and 2022 at the cluster
    centroids, followed by the absolute levels. There are clear differences between
    the cluster centroids in both years. Download : Download high-res image (670KB)

    2 had standing water at least 15 cm deep for the entire monitoring period. Cluster
    1 was completely flooded, or nearly so, through the early part of the growing
    season, then had a 20-day dry-down phase, followed by one more flooding and final
    dry-down towards harvest. Cluster 3 was similar to Cluster 1 but with shallower
    flooding and earlier first dry-down. The water levels in Cluster 4 had many rapid
    changes from a few cm above to a few cm below the soil surface in the early part
    of the growing season, and then were quite dry except for a single event matching
    the late-season spikes of Clusters 1 and 3. In 2022 (dry year) the most interesting
    cluster is 2, with rapid transitions between quite wet and quite dry conditions.
    This cluster is quite “flashy”, with sharp short-term changes in water levels.
    Cluster 1 was mostly dry, with only small fluctuations between −15 and − 10 cm.
    Cluster 3, 4 and 5 had similar temporal patterns: dry early, then water reaching
    or somewhat exceeding the soil surface, followed by a late-season dry-down. These
    three differ in the timing and magnitude of the wetter periods. All clusters had
    an initial dry period. Another visualization is given by the hierarchical clustering
    of the time-series shown in Figs. 3 (2021) and 4 (2022). This shows the hydrological
    response of all of the sites and the variability within each cluster. Reading
    the vertical axis (all sites) at any given day on the horizontal axis reveals
    events that affect different numbers of sites. Examining the lengths of dendrogram
    stems shows how different are the clusters, and the members within each cluster.
    For example, in 2021 Cluster 2 (as identified by k-means) is uniform: always completely
    flooded. However, Cluster 1 has some variability in the timing and magnitude of
    the dry-down, although the overall pattern is consistent. There is not much difference
    between members, as evidenced by the short stems. In 2022 the differentiation
    between the clusters is not so apparent, and there is more fine-scale variability
    within them. However, Cluster 2 is clearly differentiated by its short-term fluctuations
    (“flashy” behaviour). Download : Download high-res image (617KB) Download : Download

    clustering of time series, 2022. 5.1.2. Descriptors Many of the 17 hydrologic
    descriptors were correlated (Fig. 5), but the pattern of correlation differed
    among years. While descriptors of flood duration were positively correlated with
    the total days flooded in 2021, this correlation was only observed for flood duration
    of one day in 2022. The lack of consistent correlation patterns between descriptors
    is associated with the occurrence of a given descriptor. For instance, flood durations
    of one month or longer were less frequent in 2022 than floods lasting between
    one day and one week. Hence, the positive correlation of floods is linked to the
    most common flood duration. The direction and strength of correlations are both
    associated with how well the descriptor can describe the hydrologic behaviour
    characterizing the season. Download : Download high-res image (712KB) Download

    2021 (left), 2022 (right). For the k-means clustering using hydrologic descriptors
    as input, the several optimization measures were not consistent. A reasonable
    compromise was five clusters for 2021 (as opposed to four from the clustering
    based on time-series), as well as 2022 (in agreement with the time-series). The
    MEC for these was (2021) and (2022), again showing that clusters were better-defined
    in the wet year, 2021. Fig. 6 shows the positions of each observation in the space
    spanned by the first two standardized principal components (PC) of the descriptors,
    along with the convex hulls of the cluster groups. In 2021 the first two PCs account
    for 60.5% of the total information in the descriptors and the clusters are mostly
    well-separated in this space; in 2022 this is only 52.3%. and there is more overlap
    of the convex hulls. This again shows that the cluster structure is stronger in
    the wetter year. Download : Download high-res image (571KB) Download : Download

    space (PC1, PC2), 2021 (left), 2022 (right). The relative feature importance for
    k-means clustering is shown in Fig. 7. For both years, the number of flood events
    of more than one month and week were the most important descriptors, but in reverse
    order: the longer period for 2021 (wet year) and the shorter for 2020 (dry year).
    After these two there is a clear difference between the years: in the wet year
    the number of days flooded to at least 10 cm and the proportion of flooded days
    but in the dry year one-day flood events. Download : Download high-res image (333KB)

    for k-means clustering, 2021 (left), 2022 (right). Boxplots show the distribution
    among trees in the random forest. Descriptors that summarize flooding depth and
    timing proved to be the most relevant for k-means clustering. The key change is
    that non-averaged descriptors not only exhibit higher representation during the
    season, but are also more sensitive across clusters. On the contrary, average
    duration of drained periods and transitions between saturated and unsaturated
    conditions are mostly irrelevant for clustering in both years. In both years many
    descriptors are irrelevant, and several are irrelevant in both years: days of
    transition to reducing conditions, days of quick drainage, and average duration
    of dry periods. Some of this is due to the strong correlation between descriptors,
    so if one is permuted, another one can replace it in the clustering. In addition,
    some descriptions are indeed well-correlated with water dynamics but do not vary
    across clusters in a given year, so are not important in clustering. Examples
    are descriptors of long-term flood duration in sites with overall dry conditions,
    or the number of drainage days at deeper soil layers in predominantly saturated
    conditions. Another visualization is given by the of hierarchical clustering of
    the descriptors are shown in Fig. 8. As with the hierarchical clustering from
    time-series, 2021 shows a much stronger differentiation between clusters than
    2022, and much more consistency within clusters, as shown by the shorter stems.

    is how well do the clusters in each of the two years match (1) between methods
    with the same source information (time-series vs. descriptors), (2) between different
    source information, for the two methods. This reveals whether there are consistent
    HRT between and within years. Table 4 shows the cross-classification between clustering
    on time-series by k-means and hierarchical clustering for both years. The agreement
    between methods in 2021 (wet year) is very good, in 2022 somewhat less so but
    still good. Table 4. K-means (rows) vs. hierachical (columns) clustering on time

    between clustering on descriptors by k-means and hierarchical clustering for both

    agreements are less than when clustering by time-series. Table 5. K-means (rows)

    the same for hierarchical clustering. The k-means clusters based on the two information
    sources is again better in 2021 than 2022, but in neither case is the match particularly
    good. A similar result is found for hierarchical clustering. This shows that the
    information contained in the two sources are different, and the choice between
    them depends on how the analyst conceptualizes the soil hydrology: directly from
    a time-series or as descriptors that can be interpreted in terms of hydrologic
    behaviour related to a specific land management objective. Table 6. K-means clustering

    with soil properties For both clustering methods (k-means and hierarchical clustering)
    and both data sources (time-series and descriptors), there was quite a poor separation
    of soil properties by cluster, as measured by the adjusted of a one-way ANOVA,
    despite the fairly wide range of the soil properties at the observation sites.
    For 2021, only soil organic matter concentration (SOC, 0.13–0.16), electrical
    conductivity (EC, 0.10–0.18) and pH in water (pH, 0.04–0.11) were even weakly
    separated by cluster; for 2022 again pH ( 0.24–0.35) and EC ( 0.11–0.14) but not
    SOC, as well as silt concentration ( 0.11–0.29), sand ( 0.05–0.09), and clay (
    0.05–0.15). Differences in soil texture were not associated with hydrologic behaviour
    in 2021 (the wet year) but were in 2022 (the dry year), showing that soil texture
    does have some influence on soil hydrology under drier conditions, as the finer
    textures are associated with greater water-holding capacity, but this is not important
    when water is abundant. This shows that the hydrologic behaviour in this landscape
    is only weakly related to soil properties. 5.1.6. Comparison with landscape descriptors
    For both clustering methods (k-means and hierarchical clustering) and both data
    sources (time-series and descriptors), there was quite a poor relation with farmer
    perceptions of landscape position. This was assessed by the cross-classification
    clustering quality index (§4.2). For 2021, the index ranged from 0.49 to 0.60
    (based on all 43 observations), for 2022 from 0.46 to 0.62 (based on 58 of the
    160 observations). The closest matches for the two years are shown in Table 8.
    No clear relation can be seen either within a cluster or a farmer-perceived class,
    except in the wet year (2021) when one cluster represented the permanently-flooded
    sites, is all farmer-perceived “lowland”; however this includes only 11 of the
    20 perceived “lowlands”. Table 8. Farmer perceptions vs. k-means clusters from
    descriptors, 2021 (left), 2022 (right). Quality of match 0.468 (2021), 0.621 (2022).

    for each site. There was almost a random relation between the clusters and the
    planting method; the cross-classification quality index ranged from 0.34 to 0.46
    for the different clustering methods. Table 9 shows the closest match, for k-means
    clustering from descriptors. There is some differentiation: clusters 1, 3 and
    4 have more TPR, whereas cluster 5 has more DSR. Table 9. 2022: Rice planting

    DSR plots had a TPR plot within 200 m. These were considered as paired plots.
    The number of irrigation events differed somewhat among pairs, from −6 to +6 (with
    one outlier due to river irrigation) but with 70% of the pairs within 2 irrigations.
    Despite the close spacing, substantial differences in soil properties were found
    between the pairs: the interquartile ranges were − 7.5–10% (sand), −10–5% (silt),
    −2.5–3.1% (clay), −0.4–1.3 pH, 0.04–0.49% (OC). Fig. 11 shows the paired time-series
    of water level for six of the pairs. In several of these (e.g., locations 124/125)
    management (perhaps soil puddling in TPR) control much of the hydrology, whereas
    in others (e.g., locations 150/157) the two series are similar, implying that
    hydrology is controlled by rainfall and/or irrigation. 5.2. Predicting soil hydrology
    with soil, agronomic management, and landscape characteristics The optimized random
    forest models for 2021 included only two predictors: precipitation and pre-monsoon
    groundwater level. No soil properties were selected. This is likely because the
    sites were flooded for most of the period and so the water supply (precipation
    and groundwater) was sufficient to explain the response. For clusters based on
    descriptors, both k-means and hierarchical clustering gave OOB classification
    errors from 60% (k-means) to 68% (hierarchical), i.e., almost no skill. The models
    for the clusters based on the time-series of water levels and their first differences
    were better, 36% (hierarchical) to 40% (k-means) OOB error, still very poor predictive
    power. Total precipitation was the most important predictor, closely followed
    by pre-monsoon groundwater level. The optimized random forest models for 2022
    included (1) landscape features: total rainfall, pre-monsoon groundwater level,
    within-season difference in groundwater level, tubewell depth, and terrain elevation;
    (2) soil properties: pH, EC, clay and silt concentration; (3) management: number
    of irrigations and whether irrigation was (partly) decided based on crop stress,
    visible soil dryness, or crop growth stage. These models had quite uneven success,
    depending on the clustering method used to establish the clusters. For clusters
    based on descriptors, both k-means and hierarchical clustering gave OOB classification
    errors in around 36% of cases. The models for the clusters based on the time-series
    of water levels and their first differences were much better, around 23% OOB classification
    error for k-means but only 15% for hierarchical clustering. Variable importance
    for the latter model is shown in Fig. 12 and the level at which predictors are
    used in the various trees of the random forest in Fig. 13 The number of irrigations
    and the total rainfall have a large influence in this very dry year. Groundwater
    level and the seasonal difference are also important. The high importance of pH
    is likely because it can substitute for silt concentration. The probability random
    classification forests for 2021 and 2022 revealed quite high uncertainty in assignment
    to hierarchical clusters based on time series. For 2021, maximum probabilities
    ranged from 0.35 to 0.85, median 0.56. The Confusion Index ranged from 0.21 (moderate
    difference in probability between the two most probable classes) to 0.95 (the
    highest-probability class almost certain), median 0.73. Normalized Shannon entropy
    ranged from 0.36 (moderate uncertainty) to 0.82(high uncertainty), median 0.62.
    For 2022, maximum probabilities ranged from 0.39 to 0.98, median 0.86. The Confusion
    Index ranged from 0.03 (almost no difference in probability between the two most
    probable classes) to 0.96 (the highest-probability class almost certain), median
    0.23 Normalized Shannon entropy ranged from 0.08 (almost no uncertainty) to 0.85
    (high uncertainty), median 0.35. Thus, for both years there was a wide range in
    classification uncertainties: some observations were well-predicted, others quite
    poorly. This shows that clusters do not cleanly divide the observations into HRT,
    consistent with other evidence to this effect. 6. Conclusion Hydrologic response
    at the pani-pipes could be fairly successfully clustered, both by examining the
    time-series (water levels) and their first differences (changes in water levels)
    and a set of descriptors of hydrologic response. K-means clustering was able to
    establish sets of similar behaviour. Hierarchical clustering also did this, but
    in addition showed the distance in feature space between and within clusters.
    Clustering was more successful in a wet year (2021) than in a dry year (2022).
    However, the two years could not be directly compared, because the observation
    sites were not the same. The spatial-temporal distribution of water levels in
    the field responds to various drivers. While the distribution of flooding in 2021
    can be attributed to natural factors like rainfall and horizontal flows, in 2022
    the observed water levels resulted from a combination of both natural and anthropogenic
    drivers. During 2022 the frequency of floods might correspond to several irrigation
    criteria, which may not necessarily align with large-scale patterns. This suggests
    that defining HRT must be per-year. However, the inconsistent results with the
    various clustering methods, even within a year, suggests that there may be no
    consistent way to define HRT in this landscape. We had hoped to establish a grouping
    that could be extrapolated across years and across the eastern IGP. The inconsistency
    between the years, and the disappointing results of the attempt to identify predictive
    landscape factors, show that this is, so far, not feasible. It may be that subsoil
    properties, not accounted for in the predictive factors set, would result in a
    more successful model. Clustering was only moderately consistent among methods
    and information sources. Part of the problem is when the water level is below
    ground, but we have no estimate of the water content in the “dry” section above
    the water table. Depending on the porosity and structure, and the time since drainage,
    the water content can be anywhere from almost saturated to the permanent wilting
    point. Thus, the indicators for the drained conditions at the various levels in
    the profile only roughly track the measured water levels. Clustering showed very
    weak relations with farmer perceptions of landscape position and a weak relation
    with rice planting method. Clusters for 2022 based on time-series could be fairly
    well predicted by optimized random forest models. The most important predictors
    were the number of irrigations, seasonal precipitation, pre-monsoon groundwater
    levels, seasonal groundwater level change, and pH, this latter as a surrogate
    for landscape position and other soil properties. This shows the complex relation
    of soil hydrology with landscape position and land management. The use of a set
    of descriptors to summarize the time series was here specific to presumed relation
    with GHG emissions. Another set of descriptors could be developed to reflect other
    land use issues affected by soil hydrology, e.g., wet-up at the beginning of the
    kharif season to allow rice planting, or water levels related to weed management.
    This study was opportunistic, using sets of field observations that had not been
    designed to characterize hydrology. Sites were selected for agronomic and landscape
    ecology interest, not as transects to characterize hydrology. Further, only two
    years were characterized and the observation areas differed among years, so that
    the difference between years may be partially confounded with the difference in
    location. Still, these preliminary results suggest that a study fit for purpose
    would be interesting. A proper characterization of soil hydrology to land management
    in the IGP is a worthy challenge, to which this study is a first step. Funding

    was surveyed for barley production with different irrigation systems. • The ReCiPe2016
    method was used to determine environmental impacts. • Drip irrigation systems
    were found to have lower greenhouse gas emissions. • Drip irrigation is the most
    efficient system in terms of water usage. Abstract This study aims to assess the
    energy audit and environmental impact of barley production throughout its life
    cycle under different irrigation systems. The case study focuses on the comparison
    of three irrigation systems: flood (FI), sprinkler (SI) and drip (DI). Data for
    the study will be collected from a barley farm in a representative region. Field
    measurements, interviews with farmers, and literature reviews will be conducted
    to gather the necessary information. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology will
    be used to analyze the energy audit and environmental impacts of each irrigation
    system. The energy audit will analyze the energy inputs and outputs at each stage
    of barley production, including land preparation, planting, irrigation, fertilization,
    pest control, harvesting, and transportation. The energy inputs will be quantified
    in terms of fossil fuel consumption, electricity usage, and other energy sources.
    The energy outputs will be measured in terms of barley yield and energy content.
    The environmental impacts assessment will consider various environmental indicators,
    such as greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, soil erosion, and pesticide
    use. These indicators will be quantified for each irrigation system to determine
    their environmental footprint. The results of this study will provide valuable
    insights into the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of different
    irrigation systems. It will help farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders make
    informed decisions regarding irrigation practices and promote sustainable agriculture.

    systemsSustainability 1. Introduction The impact of climate change on crop irrigation
    and food security is a critical issue that requires attention. As climate patterns
    change, the demand for water by crops is expected to rise, leading to the need
    for adjustments in agricultural practices to maintain sustainable food production.
    The use of supplemental irrigation for traditionally non-irrigated crops is becoming
    more common in response to these changing climate conditions. Climate change is
    expected to have a significant impact on various aspects of agriculture, with
    its influence varying throughout the farming cycle. Therefore, it is important
    to model the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity by considering
    the interconnected physical, technical, and economic factors. This often involves
    using indicators that summarize the environmental factors that farmers consider
    when planning their activities (Dono et al., 2013). Additionally, it would be
    beneficial to mention the potential impact of climate change on the water availability
    for these crops, and how supplementary irrigation can help mitigate the effects
    of water scarcity. This would provide a broader context for the importance of
    the research and its potential implications for agricultural sustainability in
    the face of changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, it would be helpful
    to briefly mention the current methods of irrigation for autumn-winter cereals
    and how they may not be sufficient to meet the water requirements of the crops,
    especially during critical growth stages. This would set the stage for the discussion
    of the need for supplementary irrigation and the potential benefits it can provide
    for crop yields. Overall, by providing a more comprehensive introduction that
    highlights the broader significance of the research and its potential applications
    beyond barley cultivation, the article can effectively engage a wider audience
    and emphasize the relevance of the proposed approach in addressing important agricultural
    challenges (Konapala et al., 2020). Barley (Hordeum vulgar L.) is a versatile
    cereal grain that is well-suited to various environmental conditions, including
    drought, salt, and cold. It has played a vital role in transforming the field
    of agriculture. Barley was one of the earliest crops to be cultivated by humans
    (UnNisa et al., 2022). Over time, dedicated barley breeders have made significant
    advancements in enhancing its qualities, such as improving seed dormancy, seed
    vigor, and resistance to diseases like rusts and scald. These improvements have
    resulted in increased yield per unit of land (Pardo et al., 2022). In addition
    to its agricultural significance, barley offers numerous health benefits and is
    widely utilized in the process of malting. Barley, a prominent cereal crop globally,
    holds the second position in Europe, right after bread wheat. In the world, the
    production of barley reached 48, 941, 020 ha and 145, 623, 914.5 tons. Specifically
    in Iran, the cultivation of barley covered 2,108,193 ha, yielding 2,814,263.68
    tons (FAO, 2021). The quantity of water needed to achieve the highest yield in
    a barley crop is not constant. It varies depending on factors such as temperature,
    relative humidity, wind, and soil moisture, which influence the rate of evaporation
    from the soil and transpiration from the plant. In ideal growing seasons, the
    water requirement can be as low as 320–420 mm. However, during hotter and drier
    years, this requirement may increase to 360–470 mm in order to achieve maximum
    yields (Khan et al., 2010). The crop''s yield is heavily reliant on moisture availability
    during this stage. If there is moisture stress lasting more than a few days, it
    will lead to a decrease in both grain yield and quality. The amount of barley
    to plant in irrigated areas depends on the barley price, available water, and
    irrigation plan. If water is not a limiting factor, the goal is to maximize yield
    by scheduling irrigations to meet the crop''s water needs and prevent stress throughout
    the growing season (Payandeh et al., 2021). This necessitates careful monitoring
    of soil moisture after secondary root development has finished. In order to increase
    production, it is essential to effectively manage irrigation. This entails having
    a comprehensive understanding of various factors, including soil fertility, the
    relationship between soil, water, and plants, the type of crop being grown, the
    crop''s sensitivity to water stress, the different stages of crop growth, the
    availability of water supply, and the impact of climatic conditions such as rainfall,
    temperature, humidity, and net radiation (Morandini et al., 2020). Additionally,
    it is important to consider the capabilities and limitations of the irrigation
    system. A successful and efficient irrigation management strategy should be tailored
    to the specific crop being cultivated. By implementing crop-specific irrigation
    management strategies, water can be utilized effectively to meet the specific
    water requirements of each crop, thereby maximizing water productivity (Jones
    et al., 2012). Increasing the irrigation management root zone from 50 cm to 100
    cm during the late boot growth stage has several benefits. It allows for less
    frequent but larger irrigation volumes, resulting in increased water availability
    for the mature barley roots. The amount of irrigation required to replenish the
    root zone after reaching the allowable depletion soil water level will vary depending
    on soil texture and growth stage (Hassanien et al., 2016). To assess the effectiveness
    of different irrigation schedules, the apparent water productivity index is used.
    This index measures the returns from each drop of irrigation water application
    under various methods and schedules of irrigation. Drip irrigation, specifically
    at 80% of crop evapotranspiration with 80% of the recommended dose of fertilizers,
    is not only economically viable but also offers higher water and energy productivity
    compared to absolute control methods (Khan et al., 2010). The environment and
    irrigation system have a significant impact on energy input, energy output, and
    greenhouse gas emissions. It is reported that drip irrigation has the highest
    energy input (75.59 GJ ha−1), followed by flood irrigation (62.67 GJ ha−1) and
    sprinkler irrigation (49.81 GJ ha−1). In the case of drip irrigation, the primary
    energy-consuming component is polyethylene pipelines, accounting for approximately
    one-third of the total input energy. On the other hand, diesel fuel consumption
    is the main energy consumption factor in furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems,
    accounting for 32.77% and 36.2% of energy consumption, respectively (Jamali et
    al., 2021). In recent decades, the adoption of water-efficient agriculture has
    led to a significant rise in energy usage for irrigation. This surge in energy
    costs has now posed a threat to the sustainability of many irrigation systems.
    Although the energy required for irrigation is only a small portion of the overall
    energy consumption in human activities, it has emerged as a crucial concern for
    the irrigation sector and a vital determinant for ensuring food security (Gillani
    et al., 2010). Around the world, crop irrigation accounts for about 70% of the
    total fresh water supply, with 90% of this irrigation occurring in arid and semi-arid
    regions. Statistics show that irrigation pumps directly consume 23–48% of the
    global agricultural energy consumption, and the continuous rise in energy usage
    in these areas is becoming a significant concern for irrigation availability (Uysal
    and Atiş, 2010). Thus, the objective of this research is to assess the energy
    consumption and environmental consequences of barley production through different
    irrigation systems, utilizing energy audits and life cycle assessment (LCA). This
    examination will offer valuable information regarding the sustainability of the
    irrigation methods and pinpoint areas where energy efficiency and environmental
    effectiveness can be enhanced. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data collection and
    study area The research took place in the Mahyar plain, which is located in Shahreza
    city in the Isfahan province, Iran. The village of Mahyar is situated at an elevation
    of 1665 m above sea level, with coordinates of 32° 16′ North latitude and 51°
    350 East longitude in relation to the Greenwich meridian (Fig. 1.). Despite experiencing
    drought conditions, the Mahyar plain has a significant amount of land suitable
    for farming. Specifically, 1500 ha are used for growing wheat and 3500 ha are
    dedicated to malting barley cultivation (Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture of Iran,
    2020). The Cochran method, as described in Equation (1) (Cochran, 1977), is used
    to determine the sample size, which is 20 farms. (1) Download : Download high-res

    of the region under investigation in Esfahan Province, Iran. Let''s denote the
    required sample size as n, the number of farms per target population as N, the
    reliability coefficient as z (equal to 1.96 for a 95% confidence level), the estimated
    proportion of an attribute present in the population as p (equal to 0.5), the
    complement of p as q (equal to 0.5), and the permitted error ratio deviation from
    the average population as d (equal to 0.05). 2.2. Description of irrigation systems
    In this study, the effects of three major irrigation methods, namely, flood (FI),
    sprinkler (SI) and drip irrigation (DI) were examined. The traditional forms of
    irrigation, known as flood, surface or gravity irrigation, involves the distribution
    of water over the ground via gravity. Pressurized irrigation, on the other hand,
    can be categorized into rain and DI methods. Rain irrigation involves the use
    of sprinklers to splash water in drops similar to rain, while DI delivers water
    through droppers in drops, irrigating only the area around the plant''s root.
    This makes DI a local irrigation method, unlike rain irrigation, which covers
    the entire field. DI localized approach reduces water consumption and increases
    irrigation efficiency compared to rain irrigation. Water pressure is another distinguishing
    factor between the two methods, with rain irrigation systems requiring more pressure
    than DI systems. In this research, the fixed classic rain irrigation and tubular
    tape DI systems are investigated. 2.3. Energy audit An energy audit is a procedure
    designed to evaluate the energy usage of a system, pinpoint areas of high, due
    to its high and intensive consumption of energy sources, poses significant environmental
    energy consumption, propose solutions, and identify opportunities for reducing
    energy consumption. The agricultural sector challenges such as depletion of resources,
    contribution to global warming, and risks to human health (Kaab et al., 2019a,
    b). Reducing environmental damage is a crucial challenge in the agricultural sector''s
    energy use. The irrigation system heavily relies on energy and water, which are
    essential inputs for both social and economic development (Ghasemi-Mobtaker et
    al., 2020a). Modern irrigation methods in agriculture can be examined from various
    perspectives, but the primary focus is on the significant portion of energy dedicated
    to irrigation systems, which involve extracting water from wells and pumping stations
    for agricultural crop production (Taherzadeh-Shalmaei et al., 2021). Energy equivalences
    are calculated by documenting all inputs used in the production of malting barley,
    including diesel fuel, fertilizers, human labor, agricultural machinery, seed,
    biocides, and electricity. These inputs are both direct and indirect and are recorded
    throughout the growing season. The resulting outputs are barley grain yield and
    straw. Electricity is utilized for pumping water from wells, while agricultural
    machinery is powered by diesel fuel. Table 1 provides the energy coefficients
    for different operations involved in barley production. By analyzing the energy
    inputs in barley cultivation and applying the energy coefficients, energy equivalences
    can be determined. Table 1. Energy coefficients and energy inputs-outputs in various

    which comprises the diesel engine and the wheel-move system. Energy indices including

    2.4. LCA steps LCA, is a systematic and organized method employed to assess the
    ecological repercussions of diverse systems. It is also valuable for comparing
    alternative choices and determining the most advantageous option based on their
    environmental consequences. The LCA procedure entails scrutinizing and appraising
    the complete resources utilized, outputs generated, and environmental impacts
    incurred throughout every phase of a product''s lifespan (Rattanatum et al., 2018).
    LCA is a tool used for environmental management, which evaluates the environmental
    impacts of production services or systems from start to finish. The LCA process
    typically involves four stages: establishing the scope and objective, conducting
    a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis, performing a Life Cycle Impact Assessment
    (LCIA), and interpreting the findings (Peiró et al., 2010). The study employs
    the ReCiPe2016 method, which associates each damage category with a specific path.
    These pathways are dependent on the type of damage, either to humans, ecosystems,
    or resource availability (Huijbregts et al., 2017). The study has identified three
    categories of damage, namely human health, ecosystem, and resource availability.
    The human health category includes respiratory diseases, various types of cancer,
    and malnutrition. The severity of these diseases is evaluated using DALY, which
    considers both premature death and reduced quality of life due to illness. The
    ecosystem damage category covers harm to freshwater, terrestrial, and marine species,
    and the unit of measurement used is species year. Lastly, the study measures the
    damage caused to resource availability by increased extraction costs, and the
    unit of measurement used is United States dollars for the year 2013 (USD 2013)
    (Fernández-Tirado et al., 2016). In Fig. 2, the connections between midpoint impact
    categories, damage pathways, and endpoint areas of production are depicted in
    the ReCiPe 2016 method. The midpoint indicators in this method specifically address
    distinct environmental issues like climate change or acidification. Conversely,
    the endpoint indicators provide a comprehensive evaluation of the overall environmental
    impact on three broader levels: human health, biodiversity, and resource scarcity.
    The conversion of midpoint indicators to endpoint indicators facilitates the interpretation
    of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results. However, it is important to note
    that each step of aggregation introduces more uncertainty into the final outcomes.

    2. The correlation between midpoints and endpoints is determined using the ReCiPe2016
    method of LCA. 2.4.1. First step in LCA The initial stage of an LCA investigation
    involves establishing the functional unit, which acts as the foundation for quantifying
    inputs and outputs. In this specific study, the focus is on evaluating the production
    per metric ton of barley. To establish the objective in LCA studies, a strategy
    is implemented, which entails delineating the system boundaries to ascertain the
    extent of the research. The system boundaries are determined based on the study''s
    scope and the information available in the area. The subsequent calculations are
    carried out while taking these boundaries into account (Mouron et al., 2006, Van
    Zutphen and Wijbrans, 2012). In this particular study, the system boundary is
    depicted in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (814KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. System boundary of barley production in Esfahan province,
    Iran. 2.4.2. Second stage in LCA The life cycle impact analysis was conducted
    using Simapro version 9.0.0 software. Once the study''s purpose and scope were
    defined, the LCI implementation in LCA was carried out. The LCI analysis phase
    generally consists of three key sections: collection, calculation, and data allocation.
    Quantitative and qualitative data for each unit within the system boundary were
    collected and recorded in the report. The gathered data could be measured, calculated,
    or estimated (Renaud-Gentié et al., 2015). The study assessed the environmental
    harm caused by the production process of various inputs used in malting barley
    production, known as indirect emissions. These inputs included machinery, diesel
    fuel, chemical fertilizers, manure, biocides, and electricity. Additionally, the
    study considered several categories associated with the direct use of inputs on
    the farm for malting barley production to calculate direct emissions. Data from
    the EcoInvent database were used to calculate these direct emissions (Bartzas
    et al., 2015, Brentrup et al., 2000). Environmental emissions can pose a threat
    to the quality of water, air, and soil. An important source of emissions is the
    utilization of diesel fuel in machinery during different stages. Barley production
    commonly relies on diesel fuel for activities such as spraying and fertilizing
    to protect against pests, fungi, and other harmful elements. On farms, emissions
    are also generated through the use of chemical fertilizers, human labor, and biocides.
    Additionally, the application of manure and chemical fertilizers in barley production
    can directly release heavy metals into the environment (Ahlgren et al., 2013).
    Table 2 shows the coefficients related to the burning of one MJ of diesel fuel,
    while Table 3 exhibits the coefficients associated with the utilization of chemical
    fertilizers, human labor, and biocide application. Furthermore, Table 4 provides
    comprehensive information about the usage of manure and chemical fertilizers.

    In order to align with the other stages of LCA, it is essential for this step
    to be consistent. To effectively accomplish the objectives and scope of the study,
    LCA should be carefully organized to assess the impacts across the entire life
    cycle of the product. The objective of LCIA is to provide additional interpretation
    of the inventory data (Alaphilippe et al., 2013, Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al., 2019).
    The ReCiPe2016 method defines the 17 mid-point impact categories assessed, as
    depicted in Fig. 2. Additionally, this method suggests endpoint categories to
    assess harm to human health, ecosystems, and resources (Huijbregts et al., 2017).
    2.4.4. Fourth step in LCA The final step in product life cycle evaluation is result
    analysis. This includes evaluating the outcomes of previous stages and pinpointing
    the production and consumption stages of barley crop that have the highest and
    lowest negative environmental impacts. Ultimately, conclusions and solutions are
    examined (Sherwani et al., 2010). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Energy use results
    Table 5 and Fig. 4 presents data on the energy consumption for various inputs,
    as well as the energy consumption per hectare for each input. The table is divided
    into two sections, one for the energy used for inputs and the other for the energy
    used for production, which includes barely and straw. According to the table,
    nitrogen fertilizer and electricity are the two factors that contribute the most
    to energy consumption in all three irrigation methods: FI, DI, and SI. The energy
    consumption for nitrogen fertilizer in the FI, DI, and SI methods is 42,991, 45636.60,
    and 41888.67 respectively. Therefore, the SI method is considered the most suitable
    option due to its lower nitrogen fertilizer energy consumption. Additionally,
    when considering electricity consumption, the amounts for the FI, DI, and SI methods
    are 38,712, 27619.20, and 21,964 MJ ha−1 respectively. In terms of electricity
    consumption, the SI method is the most cost effective irrigation method. The research
    findings on the environmental impacts of energy use in wheat tillage systems indicate
    that the total average energy consumption was estimated to be 30,000 MJ ha−1.
    This energy consumption was primarily attributed to fertilizers, diesel fuel,
    water, and seed inputs. Among the different tillage systems studied, the conservation
    tillage system (reduced tillage) demonstrated the highest output-input energy
    ratio and energy productivity. This was followed by the no-tillage system and
    the moldboard plough and combined seeder system (Houshyar and Grundmann, 2017).

    image Fig. 4. Shares of energy sources in malting barley production under different
    irrigation systems. The information depicted in Fig. 4 emphasizes that nitrogen
    chemical fertilizer usage has the most significant influence on energy consumption
    among the three irrigation methods. Electricity consumption closely trails behind.
    Hence, to decrease overall energy usage, it is recommended to reduce the usage
    of nitrogen fertilizer or explore alternative options that require less energy.
    Additionally, it is advisable to conduct research to assess the impact of reduced
    nitrogen fertilizer consumption on production levels, considering factors like
    economics, environment, and community health. The study evaluated energy-environmental
    indicators in various wheat production systems. The findings indicated in Table
    6, that the irrigated conservation tillage system had favorable energy ratio (2.12)
    and energy productivity (0.18 kg MJ−1) compared to conventional irrigated and
    rainfed tillage, as well as conservation rainfed tillage. The consumption of nitrogen
    fertilizer (55%–68%) and diesel fuel (15%–31%) significantly influenced the energy
    consumption across the four wheat cultivation systems (Khalaj et al., 2023). Table

    1.20 1.79 1.70 According to the results presented in Table 6, the SI method ranks
    first, while the DI and FI methods rank second and third, respectively. This ranking
    indicates that the Sprinkler method outperforms the others in terms of energy
    efficiency, yield per unit of energy consumption, energy consumption per unit
    of production, and the difference between output and input energy. In other words,
    the SI method is the most effective irrigation method in terms of energy consumption.
    Therefore, it is recommended to promote the use of the SI method. To support and
    enhance the adoption of this method, the following solutions are proposed. 1.
    Provide operator training to ensure proper implementation of the SI method. 2.
    Offer government support, such as subsidies or grants, to encourage farmers to
    adopt the SI method. 3. Introduce incentive packages for stakeholders who choose
    to use the SI method. 4. Facilitate access to low-interest rate loans for investment
    in SI method equipment. 5. Support manufacturers of SI method equipment to ensure
    availability and affordability. 6. Reduce or exempt taxes for individuals and
    businesses involved in the agricultural and industrial sectors, particularly those
    utilizing the SI method. By implementing these solutions, the adoption and development
    of the SI method can be promoted, leading to increased energy efficiency and productivity
    in irrigation practices. 3.2. LCA results 3.2.1. Analysis of on-farm emissions
    Table 7 presents the discharge of substances into water, air, and soil resulting
    from each of the efficient inputs. The findings indicate that the application
    of fertilizers results in the release of pollutants into the soil and air. Diesel
    fuel is identified as one of the primary contributors to emissions. The Sprinkler
    system emits the most CO2 from diesel fuel, while the DI system has the lowest
    diesel fuel discharge and the highest nitrate emissions. Additionally, the DI
    system is responsible for the highest heavy metal emissions from chemical fertilizers.

    methods on various damage categories are presented in Table 8. The human health
    damage category is calculated as 0.22 DALY in DI, 0.24 DALY in SI, and 0.28 DALY
    in FD. The ecosystem damage category is calculated as 0.0001 for each of the three
    irrigation methods. The results show that FI has the highest physical amount of
    resources damage category with 84.18 USD2013 yield, followed by SI with 55.29
    USD2013 yield, and DI with 54.42 USD2013 yield. Fig. 5 presents the contributions
    of different inputs to the damage categories for the three irrigation systems.
    The results indicate that direct emissions and nitrogen fertilizers have the highest
    contributions to the degradation related to environmental parameters in all three
    irrigation types. The analysis of human health reveals that direct emissions account
    for about 95% of the share in all types. The ecosystem category results illustrate
    that direct emissions account for about 95% of the share. Moreover, the shares
    of nitrogen in human health, ecosystems, and resources are about 4%, 10%, and
    50%, respectively. Nitrogen and electricity are the main hotspots of the resource
    damage category in all irrigation methods, as shown in Fig. 5. In a study about
    environmental impacts of irrigated and rain-fed barley production using LCA, results
    indicated irrigated barley production has a greater environmental impact than
    rain-fed barley production, but this impact can be reduced through alternative
    practices such as soil conservation tillage and biomass consumption (Houshyar,
    2017). Table 8. Values of the damage assessment per one ton in malting barley

    environmental impact throughout the life cycle of barley production under various
    irrigation systems in the case study, several conclusions can be drawn. 1. The
    study found that the energy consumption varied significantly among different irrigation
    systems. Sprinkler irrigation was found to be the most energy-efficient system,
    followed by DI and FI. This suggests that adopting sprinkler irrigation can lead
    to significant energy savings in barley production. 2. DI was also found to be
    the most water-efficient system, with the highest water use efficiency. This indicates
    that dropping irrigation can effectively reduce water consumption in barley production
    and help conserve water resources. 3. The study observed that greenhouse gas emissions
    were lower in drip irrigation compared to SI and FI systems. This implies that
    drip irrigation can contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing the release
    of greenhouse gases during barley production. 4. The overall environmental impact,
    including water pollution and soil degradation, was found to be lower in drip
    irrigation compared to other irrigation systems. This suggests that adopting drip
    irrigation can help minimize negative environmental consequences associated with
    barley production. 5. Although the study did not directly assess the economic
    viability of different irrigation systems, the findings indicate that adopting
    drip irrigation can lead to cost savings in terms of energy and water consumption.
    This can potentially improve the economic sustainability of barley production.
    In conclusion, the assessment of energy audit and environmental impact throughout
    the life cycle of barley production under various irrigation systems highlights
    the benefits of adopting drip irrigation. DI not only reduces energy and water
    consumption but also minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact.
    These findings support the promotion and adoption of DI as a sustainable irrigation
    practice in barley production. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ali Kaab:

  description: Water accessibility is necessary for agricultural and socioeconomic
    development in the area. One of the best solutions to the water crisis in the
    Kohat region is to build rainwater harvesting structures (RWH) to collect water
    from local watersheds for artificial groundwater recharge. Our main objective
    was to identify suitable RWH locations in the study area. However, the optimum
    site selection for RWH in regional areas is crucial. In such a case, geospatial
    techniques have revealed decisive in optimum site selection for RWH structures.
    In the current study, we have used GIS-based models like the Analytical Hierarchy
    Process (AHP) and Weight of Evidence (WOE) to identify suitable sites for rainwater
    harvesting. Seven influential parameters, i.e., LULC, rainfall, drainage density,
    slope, lineament density, soil, and lithology, were considered, reclassified,
    and assigned ranks according to literature for analysis to produce potential site
    maps for RWH structures. The findings of the current study indicate that, based
    on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), 44% (1320 km2) of the study area is classified
    as highly suitable for rainwater harvesting, while 40% (1200 km2) is considered
    moderately appropriate, and 16% (470 km2) is deemed unsuitable. In contrast, when
    utilizing the Weight of Evidence (WOE) approach, the high suitability class encompasses
    32% (956.8 km2) of the area, the moderate suitability class covers 43% (1285.7
    km2), and the low suitability class accounts for 25% (748 km2) of the study area.
    The outcome of the current study aims to contribute and assist the planner, manager,
    and officials in finding sites for RWH structures to overcome the water table,
    irrigation demand, and agricultural issues in the study area.

    for agricultural and socioeconomic development in the area. One of the best solutions
    to the water crisis in the Kohat region is to build rainwater harvesting structures
    (RWH) to collect water from local watersheds for artificial groundwater recharge.
    Our main objective was to identify suitable RWH locations in the study area. However,
    the optimum site selection for RWH in regional areas is crucial. In such a case,
    geospatial techniques have revealed decisive in optimum site selection for RWH
    structures. In the current study, we have used GIS-based models like the Analytical
    Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Weight of Evidence (WOE) to identify suitable sites
    for rainwater harvesting. Seven influential parameters, i.e., LULC, rainfall,
    drainage density, slope, lineament density, soil, and lithology, were considered,
    reclassified, and assigned ranks according to literature for analysis to produce
    potential site maps for RWH structures. The findings of the current study indicate
    that, based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), 44% (1320 km2) of the study
    area is classified as highly suitable for rainwater harvesting, while 40% (1200
    km2) is considered moderately appropriate, and 16% (470 km2) is deemed unsuitable.
    In contrast, when utilizing the Weight of Evidence (WOE) approach, the high suitability
    class encompasses 32% (956.8 km2) of the area, the moderate suitability class
    covers 43% (1285.7 km2), and the low suitability class accounts for 25% (748 km2)
    of the study area. The outcome of the current study aims to contribute and assist
    the planner, manager, and officials in finding sites for RWH structures to overcome
    the water table, irrigation demand, and agricultural issues in the study area.

    and RSAHPWOEKohat plateau 1. Introduction Water is one of the foremost valued
    characteristic assets essential for anthropogenic animals and plants and socioeconomic
    expansion (Haile and Suryabhagavan, 2019; Mahmood et al., 2020). Freshwater scarcity
    has become a crucial problem for sustainable development, with communities struggling
    to sustain domestic water needs and challenges in agriculture and industry (He
    et al., 2021, Wahla et al., 2022a, Wahla et al., 2023). Consequently, it is crucial
    to manage freshwater resources carefully (Huang et al., 2019a). The five main
    global factors (water pollution, overuse, changing weather patterns, lack of infrastructure,
    and water scarcity) that are employing compression on the obtainability of safe
    water worldwide are population growth, climate change, quick industrial development,
    and extreme use of ground-water (Tiwari et al., 2018). The global climate change
    has resulted in spatial and temporal variations in precipitation patterns at regional
    and local scales. The occurrence of the dry season, food crises, and unforeseen
    changes in daily events have been seen and are predicted to persist in the future
    (Li et al., 2020). According to Ali et al. (2023), variations in the water cycle
    may impact on the environment and society. Rainfall, a crucial factor, straight
    impacts drought, water supplies and floods (Tariq and Qin, 2023). In recent decades,
    a considerable body of scholarly research has been dedicated to analyzing spatio-temporal
    variability in rainfall patterns. The above studies have consistently demonstrated
    that rainfall characteristics have undergone substantial modifications. Specifically,
    the impact of climate change has been identified as a critical driver behind the
    observed changes, resulting in increased precipitation levels. This alteration
    in rainfall patterns has profound implications for water resources, affecting
    their quality and quantity. Furthermore, the ecosystem is also at risk due to
    these shifts in rainfall patterns (Lin et al., 2023). However, to combat the issue
    of water scarcity, academics worldwide have employed various alternative strategies
    (Esmaeili et al., 2024; Yin et al., 2023). RWH (Rainwater Harvesting) is taking
    one of the innovative, profitable, and environmentally advantageous for the availability
    and accessibility of water while also lowering the threat of flash floods and
    resolving the issue of groundwater exploitation. RWH controls the runoff to store
    water and promote aquifer recharge in the area to boost the groundwater table
    (Lu et al., 2024, Wahla et al., 2022a, Wahla et al., 2022b). It has become a common
    practice in many waters'' scarce areas to enhance these regions'' living standards
    (Bokhari et al., 2023; Felegari et al., 2023; Tariq and Qin, 2023; Yin et al.,
    2023a). The primary challenges encountered in the implementation of RWH technologies
    are closely linked to factors such as fluctuations in precipitation patterns,
    the characteristics of the drainage network, soil qualities, geological conditions,
    vegetation cover, land use and land cover (LULC), as well as innovative approaches
    and socioeconomic circumstances (Mao et al., 2022a, Mao et al., 2022b, Yin et
    al., 2023b). Since 4000 BCE, people have used the RWH method to collect and store
    rainwater from a catchment area and conserve water in a reservoir for daily consumption
    (Sejrup et al., 2001). Several organizations and water-related management agencies
    worldwide are aggressively striving to explore and manage river properties, emphasizing
    RWH as a means of acquiring water supply (Cheng et al., 2023; Jamil et al., 2023;
    Lin et al., 2023; Tariq et al., 2023c). The integration of Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing presents a cutting-edge
    approach to identify potential sites for rainwater harvesting structures. By employing
    machine learning techniques, the system can autonomously recognize and interpret
    patterns in spatial and spectral information, contributing to a more efficient
    and accurate identification of suitable locations for rainwater harvesting structures.
    The synergy of AI, GIS, and Remote Sensing not only enhances the precision of
    site selection but also expedites the decision-making process, allowing for proactive
    and sustainable water resource management strategies. Integrating machine learning
    methods with RWH systems through the utilization of Analytic Hierarchy Process
    (AHP) (Saaty, 1990) and Weight of Evidence (WOE) (Ahmad et al., 2013), offers
    a novel approach to optimize water management strategies. Machine learning algorithms,
    such as decision trees or neural networks, can be employed to analyze historical
    rainfall patterns, climate data, and other relevant variables to predict future
    precipitation trends. AHP serves as a valuable tool in prioritizing the importance
    of different factors influencing rainwater harvesting, allowing for a more informed
    decision-making process (Pande et al., 2021). Additionally, the incorporation
    of WOE facilitates the assessment of uncertainties and provides a statistical
    framework to evaluate the reliability of data in the decision-making model. By
    combining machine learning, AHP, and WOE, one can enhance the efficiency and accuracy
    of rainwater harvesting systems, ultimately contributing to supportable management
    of hydro resources in a climate change (Zhu et al., 2022). The integration of
    machine learning techniques, Frequency Ratio (FR) (Regmi et al., 2014), WOE (Tahmassebipoor
    et al., 2016), Random Forest (RF) (Prasad et al., 2020), Support Vector Machine
    (SVM) (Lee et al., 2018), Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) (Naghibi et al., 2016),
    Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Lautz et al., 2014), Classification and Regression
    Tree (CART) (Zhao et al., 2024), with RS and GIS and holds profound significance
    in the identification of potential sites for rainwater harvesting structures.
    This interdisciplinary approach harnesses the strengths of each field to address
    water scarcity challenges and promote sustainable water resource organization.
    One of the primary benefits lies in the ability of MLA to examine vast datasets
    derived from RS and GIS (Wu et al., 2022). These technologies provide an extensive
    spatial and temporal understanding of the landscape, including factors such as
    land cover, topography, and precipitation patterns. Machine learning algorithms,
    when applied to these datasets, can uncover complex patterns and relationships
    that may not be readily apparent through traditional methods. This enables a more
    nuanced identification of areas with optimal conditions for rainwater harvesting
    (Zhou et al., 2022). Pakistan has been ranked in the \"red zone\" by the Asian
    Development Bank regarding the effects of urbanization and population growth (Wahla
    et al., 2023). In addition, Pakistan was designated a nation with a water shortage
    in 2007 and a country with a water shortage in 1991 with a 1000 m3/capita accessibility
    (Raza et al., 2023). Pakistan relies heavily on a pronounced seasonal monsoon
    precipitation period; nonetheless, this region is susceptible to flood hazards.
    Moreover, the heightened susceptibility to climatic risks and the projected expansion
    of urban areas have contributed to the worsening of urban flooding in major cities.
    Additional serious challenges include deforestation, poor land use practices,
    and soil erosion from inadequate watershed management. Their actions have resulted
    in the degradation of approximately 65% of infrastructure dedicated to the storage
    and distribution of drinkable water. Consequently, sediments originating from
    productive land have been eroded and deposited into water reservoirs (Zhao et
    al., 2024). The Kohat region also has groundwater stress issues; however, it has
    yet to be investigated thoroughly to identify potential RWH sites to empower policymakers
    to adopt this system to mitigate these critical issues. Several methods have been
    developed for the optimum site selection of RWH structures (Ahmad et al., 2013).
    The most popular technique for small areas is field surveys. Finding suitable
    locations for the various RWH technologies on a regional scale is arduous (Zheng
    et al., 2023). Geospatial technology and techniques are excellent and innovative
    ways to conduct more thorough and accurate analyses in water management research
    for regional-scale investigations (Buraihi and Shariff, 2015). In this perspective,
    geospatial data are applied (Wahla et al., 2022b), Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA)
    integrated with GIS (Tariq et al., 2023a), AHP with GIS (Shah et al., 2021), and
    Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) and Boolean methods were applied (Mary et al.,
    2023, Tariq et al., 2023c). Tariq (2023) considered precipitation, soil depth,
    soil texture, slope, LULC, and river network as influential parameters to select
    the optimum site for RWH. The purpose of this study is to locate areas in the
    Kohat region of Pakistan that have the potential to accommodate RWH constructions.
    Our current research used rainfall, slope, lithology, Lineament, soil texture,
    drainage network, and LULC as input parameters in the GIS-based AHP and WOE method.
    The main objective of the current research is to identify potential sites for
    the RWH structures in the study area for sustainable development. The results
    of the present research will help policymakers construct check dams, percolation
    tanks, farm ponds, and Nala bunds in the study area. 2. Material and methods 2.1.
    Study area The present study is conducted in District Kohat, in the southern region
    of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, as shown in Fig. 1. The geographic coordinates
    of Kohat are 33° 35′ 13″ North and 71° 26′ 32″ East (Hussain, 2014). The current
    research is situated at an altitude of up to 2000m, as mentioned in Fig. 1. Islam
    et al. (2023) state that the study area has a regional steppe climate with sporadic
    annual precipitation. The Kohat region geologically occurred in the Kohat Plateau,
    with fold and thrust belt structures. The plateau is vulnerable primarily to compressional
    facilities. The southern Kohat plateau is where strike-slip faulting occurs (Hussain
    and Zhang, 2018). The Kohat Plateau is concerned chiefly with the geological formations
    of Eocene limestone, shale, evaporites, subordinate clays, and younger stratified
    rocks of the Miocene–Pliocene age (Hussain et al., 2021). The era of stratified
    strata in the plateau is comprised of Paleocene to Pliocene. Download : Download

    area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, (c) study area with elevation and drainage network.
    The district experiences a predominantly arid to semi-arid climate with limited
    and irregular rainfall. The monsoon season, typically from July to September,
    is the primary period for precipitation. During this time, Kohat may receive moderate
    to heavy rain, contributing to the annual precipitation totals. On average, the
    district gets around 400–600 mm of rainfall annually, with variations in different
    localities. The terrain and topography of the region can influence precipitation
    distribution, with some areas receiving more rain due to their geographical features.
    It''s essential to note that precise precipitation figures can vary yearly, and
    climate conditions may be subject to change. Local meteorological records or government
    weather agencies can provide more accurate and up-to-date information on precipitation
    patterns in District Kohat (Hussain and Zhang, 2018). 2.2. Selection of the data
    layers In this study, we incorporated eight parameters'' including slope, rainfall,
    lithology, lineament density, fault, drainage density, soil, and LULC, as per
    existing literature, to determine the most suitable location for RWH buildings
    in the Kohat region of Pakistan. The present research acquired RS and ground data
    from different open-source satellites in Pakistan, both public and private organizations.
    The details of the data and source are shown in Table 1. The proper national and
    international research platforms were used to obtain the ground and satellite
    data to generate seven influential parameters for the site selection of RWH structures.

    the required parameters of the study were prepared from acquired data. Furthermore,
    the parameters were reclassified according to the literature. The factors were
    reclassified according to their significance to RWH, and primary and minor importance
    were determined using the multi-influencing factor equation (1). In contrast,
    the major and minor significance are shown in Table 2 (Selvam et al., 2015). (1)

    was computed in GIS-based AHP. Then, the output weightage was added in weighted
    overlay analysis (WOA) to generate an RWH map of the study area and categorize
    it into three classes, i.e., Low, medium, and high potential classes. Finally,
    the RWH structure (check dam, farm ponds, percolation tank, and Nala bund) site
    was identified using WOA in the ArcGIS 10.8. The thoroughly planned methodology
    for the current research has been displayed in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res

    the comprehensive details for the site selection of RWH structures. 2.3. Preparation
    and collection of data layers The subsequent section provides an overview of the
    process of parameter preparation and its subsequent impact. 2.3.1. Rainfall The
    precipitation parameters are significant factor in surface runoff production (Khan
    et al., 2022). Rainfall is considered to play a substantial role in water recharge
    and is a principal contributor to RWH mapping (Aziz et al., 2023). The precipitation
    map of the present study area is produced from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
    Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS) from 2010 to 2023 using Kernel machine
    learning techniques in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The average rainfall in the
    study area during 2010–2023 is 889–1147 mm/year. According to the literature,
    the generated rainfall map was reclassified into five classes in ArcGIS pro, as
    shown in Fig. 3a. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    (d) lineament, (e) fault, (f) soil, (g) drainage (h) LULC. 2.3.2. Slope Slope
    is also important factor in the site selection of RWH structures. High-slope locations
    may not be ideal if much water is required to meet irrigation demand. The storage
    structure may be more expensive (Preeti et al., 2022). The capital expense of
    a storage facility can be reduced more efficiently in a region with a medium to
    low slope (Alwan et al., 2020). Because a higher slope allows for a rapid runoff
    area and reduces water infiltration while a lower slope encourages water infiltration
    and potential recharge areas, a steep slope gradient has a detrimental effect
    on groundwater reservoirs (Kamali Maskooni et al., 2020). The highest slope in
    the present study area is 78°. The slope of the present study is computed from
    SRTM-DEM of 12.5m resolution using the GEE platform and reclassified into five
    classes using ArcGIS pro, as mentioned in Fig. 3b. 2.3.3. Lithology Lithology
    is a vital parameter in groundwater research because it influences the strata''s
    water infiltration by absorbency and absorptivity of beds (Tariq et al., 2023a).
    In actuality, the geological features control the passage of groundwater from
    surface streams to subterranean aquifers and the opposing movement (Khan et al.,
    2022). Fig. 3c depicts the Kohat region''s lithological map, prepared from the
    Northern Geological Map of Pakistan using georeferencing and digitization methods
    in the ArcGIS environment. 2.3.4. Lineament density Lineament is crucial for identifying
    the area''s micro and macro-level tectonic trends. It has a significant role in
    the enhanced performance of structural elements by regulating surface and groundwater
    mobility in the texture and fracture of strata (Maina and Raude, 2016). The present
    research computed the Lineament from the SRTM-DEM hill shades. The calculated
    lineament density was generated using the line density tool in ArcGIS pro. Finally
    reclassified into five classes using the reclassification technique, as shown
    in Fig. 3d. 2.3.5. Fault density Fault density, in the context of land and surface
    features, is crucial in determining the effectiveness of rainwater harvesting
    systems. When assessing areas for rainwater harvesting potential, understanding
    the distribution and intensity of faults is essential. High fault density areas
    can significantly impact rainwater harvesting in several ways. Firstly, fault
    zones may act as preferential pathways for rainwater to infiltrate the ground
    (Islam et al., 2023, Zheng et al., 2023). This can either enhance or hinder rainwater
    harvesting, depending on the permeability of the fault materials. If fault zones
    consist of highly porous materials, they can facilitate rapid groundwater recharge,
    which may reduce surface runoff and make rainwater harvesting more challenging.
    Moreover, fault density can also impact the availability of suitable locations
    for rainwater harvesting infrastructure. High fault density areas may limit the
    installation of rainwater harvesting structures, such as infiltration basins,
    due to the risk of structural damage caused by ground movements associated with
    faults. The fault map was scanned and digitized from the Northern map of Pakistan,
    as shown in Fig. 3e. 2.3.6. Soil It is necessary and essential to have a soil
    map of every watershed to comprehend its land use and geology (Gavit et al., 2018).
    The soil type is a crucial factor when choosing an RWH location to deliver water
    for irrigation (Al-Adamat, 2008). The soil map of the current research is prepared
    from the scanned map of Pakistan''s soil survey by georeferencing and digitization
    methods in ArcGIS 10.8 to extract the region of interest, as mentioned in Fig.
    3f. 2.3.7. Drainage density The drainage pattern reflects the surface characteristics
    and the existing subsurface hydrological structure. It demonstrates the surface
    material''s properties and the channel spacing''s closeness. The region with a
    high-density drainage network will have a high runoff and vice versa (Khudhair
    et al., 2020). RWH site is generally chosen in an area with a high drainage network
    because the water flows through this network fast and is confined (Al-Adamat,
    2008; Fagbohun, 2018). We used 30m DEM in Arc Hydro tool and reclassified in ArcGIS
    pro to extract the drainage density as shown in Fig. 3g. 2.3.8. LULC The land''s
    natural characteristics can be deduced from its land cover, while its purpose
    can be determined from its use. Critical data can be collected using the LULC
    form, which pertains to the spreading of runoff. Compared to bare land and built-up
    regions, which encourage high runoff production, green area linked to higher infiltration
    rates and absorption (Fagbohun, 2018; Hashim and Sayl, 2021). When vegetation
    density rises, runoff volume decreases due to higher interception losses, infiltration,
    and retention rates. The size of the area covered by flora can be used to determine
    vegetation density. Environmental factors presented by LULC substantially impact
    groundwater because they affect surface runoff and penetration (Bui et al., 2019).
    The LULC map of the study area is generated from sentinel-2 imageries using the
    Random Forest machine classifier in the GEE platform and exported to ArcGIS Pro,
    as shown in Fig. 3h. 2.4. Methods 2.4.1. AHP method Groundwater potential zone
    delineation with GIS is commonly achieved by multi-criteria decision analysis
    utilizing the Analytical Hierarchical Process (Hussain et al., 2021; Pande et
    al., 2020). AHP is a mathematical method that considers a challenging decision
    considering various factors (Baghel et al., 2023). The weights for the criterion
    are determined using the AHP technique, which was first proposed by Saaty (1990).
    The consequences for each measure are defined via pairwise comparisons in a matrix
    (Das et al., 2022). When assessing whether two factors are appropriate for a given
    goal, pairwise comparisons establish the relative weights of the two elements.
    Two variables are compared and scored on a continuous 9-point scale, as mentioned
    in Table 3 (Wedley, 1993). Eight parameters were chosen for the AHP evaluation
    based on earlier research and professional judgment. Shared values like 1/3, 1/5,
    1/7, and 1/9 were employed where the column criteria were more important than
    the row norms. 3–9 arbitrary Saaty products were offered in exchange for the opinion.
    The matrices established the consistency of AHP frameworks to incorporate for
    the analysis of potential sites for rainwater collection and were time-planned
    (Omolabi, P. O., & Fagbohun, 2019). Saaty (1990) provided a consistency metric
    known as the Consistency Index (CI) as a deviation or degree of consistency using
    equation (2): (2) where n = number of classes, and max = greatest eigenvalue of
    the pairwise comparison matrix. The consistency of the pairwise comparison matrix
    is measured by the consistency ratio (CR) provided by Equation (3). (3) Where  =
    Consistency Index, and is the Ratio Index. Table 3. The scales of pairwise comparison.

    Extreme 2, 4, 6, 8 Intermediate Values 2.4.2. Weight of Evidence (WOE) The WOE
    approach is a data-driven strategy that uses the Bayesian principle to evaluate
    and compute the strength of the spatial relationship between the training data
    (such as the locations of springs, landslides, and probable groundwater sources)
    and predictor maps (Tahmassebipoor et al., 2016). The WOE approach allows for
    predicting new binary trends by integrating several binary configurations (GF,
    1990). This approach, which primarily uses the Bayesian likelihood concept to
    determine the significance of evidence using quantitative means, has many advantages
    over other forms of statistical analysis because it is data-driven (Falah and
    Zeinivand, 2019). The crucial parameters that must be computed to apply WOE are
    positive weight (W+) and negative weight (W−). This method calculates the weight
    for each class of groundwater precondition parameter''s presence or absence (
    ) based on the absence or presence of the inventory pixels ( ), as stated in (Bull
    and Kirkby, 1997; Gayen and Saha, 2017; GF, 1990), as equations (4), (5)): (4)
    (5) In this scenario, p stands for probability, M for groundwater characteristics,
    M* for groundwater pixels, N for inventory, and N* for well. The weights of the
    evidence are positive weight (W +) and negative weight (W−), respectively, depending
    on whether a component exists or is omitted. 2.4.3. Validation The result of the
    current study is validated using the Area Under Receiving Operating Characteristic
    technique. The AUROC has been used to assess models'' effectiveness and reliability
    (Islam et al., 2022). It represents the quality of probabilistic and deterministic
    detection and forecasting systems (Vu Dinh et al., 2021). It describes a prediction
    system''s quality by indicating how well it can predict the occurrence or non-occurrence
    of pre-defined \"events.\" A quantitative indicator of a model''s quality, the
    area under the ROC curve (AUC) can be classified as poor (0.5–0.6), average (0.6–0.7),
    good (0.7–0.8), very good (0.8–0.9), and excellent (0.9–1) (Chen et al., 2018).
    Using integral calculus''s trapezoidal rule, one may determine the AUC as shown
    in equation (6) (Pontius and Schneider, 2001). (6) where is the AUC and indicates
    1-specificity while indicates sensitivity. 3. Results The concluding findings
    of the current research were achieved using various influential parameters. According
    to our methodology in the present study, the spatial output includes identifying
    potential RWH sites and proposals of relevant major RWH structures, such as check
    dams, percolation tanks, ponds, farm and Nala bunds. Additional analysis comparing
    spatial findings to data from government agencies and field surveys on this region.
    3.1. Optimum potential sites of rainwater harvesting Groundwater alone cannot
    supply all of the area''s water needs. Consequently, the potential locations for
    RWH storage are crucial as options for increased surface water storage (Ramakrishnan
    et al., 2009). Different factors were applied to the current study region to find
    possible RWH locations. Field surveys show excellent potential for RWH regarding
    yearly rainfall patterns, topographic, geologic, and hydrologic factors, etc.
    As a result, we have identified RWH sites as part of our study. The final RWH
    potential map was divided into three zones: low, medium, and high potential zones.
    The final output RWH map of the Kohat region using the AHP (Fig. 4a) and WOA (Fig.
    4b) technique were used to identify RWH structures for the study area. The various
    RWH structures, i.e., Farm ponds, nala bund, percolation tanks, check dams, and

    area''s potential for rainwater collection had been examined, identifying prospective
    RWH structures was a crucial next step. To point out the potential RWH structures,
    we used the required criteria and applied the WOA. The details of the results
    for RWH structures are mentioned in Table 4. Table 4 revealed that 2746.62 km2
    and 93.23% area are not suitable for check dams, while 199.91 km2 and 6.78% are
    suitable for check dams in the study area. The analysis for site selection of
    Farm ponds was performed according to the literature, and the final output map
    was divided into two groups, i.e., suitable and not suitable, using the different
    color schemes as shown in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, the results illustrated
    that unsuitable zones cover 2870.81 km2 and 96.66% of the region. However, the
    100.16 km2 and 3.37% area is the suitable zone for a potential Farm Pond structure
    in Kohat. The results for the possible sites of RWH structures are mentioned in
    Table 4. The results showed that the unsuitable Nala bund zones had occupied 2606.23
    km2 (93.01%). However, 196.16 km2 and 7% zone region are suitable for Nala Bund
    in Kohat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Table 5. RWH structures area in km2 and

    were analyzed with RWHS, and the association of variables with RWHS was computed.
    The selected parameters were considered according to the literature, and each
    variable has a significant association with RWHS. In this study, the slope is
    the most influential parameter. WOE values for <05°, 05–15°, 15–25°, 25–40° and
    >40° are 2.73, 2.68, 1.53, 0.43 and −0.9 respectively. The results shown in Table
    6 revealed that gentle slope, i.e., <05°, is the most suitable class for RWHS
    and vice versa. The results mentioned in Table 6 illustrate that drainage density
    is the influential parameter in the current research. The results show that the
    drainage density region is suitable for RWHS, while the less dense part of drainage
    is a minor potential class for the RWHS. In the present study, precipitation contributes
    very well to the structure''s development in the area of investigation. Table
    6 explains that the area with more rainfall is suitable for rainwater harvesting
    compared to the region with less precipitation. The results show that >1000 mm/year
    having WOE range is 0.91 while <850 mm/year region have negative association which
    clearly exhibit that it''s unsuitable for RWHS. In the ongoing research, LULC
    was prepared using Sentinel-2 to compute the relationship of each LULC class with
    RWHS. The results in Table 6 comprehensively explain that range and barren land
    have the most potential for RWHS development. In contrast, urban and water classes
    have the most damaging relationship with variables, illustrating that these two
    classes are unsuitable for mentioned structures. In this study, we observed from
    the results shown in Table 6 that fractures and faults adversely impact RWHS.
    The results revealed that the <300 m class negatively correlates with RWHS, followed
    by 500–1000m while the >3000 m class shows a strong positive association with
    RWHS. The results mentioned in Table 6 illustrated that Loamy and shallow soil
    positively correlate with RWHS, while mainly loamy soil shows the slightest relationship
    with RWHS. Table 6. Bivariate analysis WOE model for RWHS in Kohat region, Pakistan.

    GIS and RS analysis will always require ground-based verification to validate
    the output results. After completing the research for RWH, we verified the output
    with existing RWH structures constructed by various organizations in the Kohat
    region. Throughout the survey, we discovered that some rainwater collection solutions
    had previously been built in appropriate locations, but more was required. Areas
    for various water conservation strategies were noted using GPS coordinates to
    verify the results. GPS readings were acquired in proper places and compared to
    already-built interventions. Additionally, various locations were noted for potential
    future rainwater-gathering interventions throughout the physical ground data-based
    survey in the study area. Besides ground-based data validation, we used the AUROC
    technique to check the model''s accuracy by applying the testing dataset. The
    validation results of AHP and WOE are 86% and 91%, respectively, shown in Fig.
    6. The validation results revealed both models performed well, but WOE performed
    very well compared to AHP, as shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image

    of WOE and AHP models. 4. Discussion The parameter levels must possess congruent
    scales and units for the AHP and WOE methodologies to be effectively utilized.
    Lineament and stream are two types of vector layers that must be transformed into
    a raster format to facilitate more sophisticated classification techniques. Fig.
    6 shows the research area''s reclassification map and distribution of yearly rainfall
    averages. The rainfall distribution across the research region is displayed on
    a rainfall map, although this does not always mean potential harvesting is concentrated
    there (Zhou et al., 2023). The present study also revealed that some regions have
    less precipitation with high potential RWH sites and vice versa. The precipitation
    map of the study area is mentioned in Fig. 3a. In this research, there are several
    different slopes in the area, ranging from gentle to steep. The slope was categorized
    into five classes, as shown in Fig. 3b. One of the most crucial aspects to consider
    while selecting and implementing RWH structures is the slope, which affects surface
    water runoff, groundwater recharge, and mobility. Adham et al. (2019) show an
    optimal slope is less than 5%. In the current study, 46.73% of potential sites
    for RWH occurred in the flat slope region. The suitability of slope classes for
    rainfall is mentioned in Table 7. This association of slope with rainwater storage
    illustrated that a flat slope (<5°) is the most suitable slope for RWH in the
    current research area. Table 7. Parameters suitability for RWH using AHP. Parameter

    The reclassification map of drainage density is mentioned in Fig. 3g. Higher drainage
    density has a strong positive association with water storage. Therefore, locations
    with higher drainage density are more likely to have RWH (Ammar et al., 2016).
    In this research, drainage density has a strong relationship with RWH. A higher-density
    region is the most suitable for the optimum site selection of RWH. Fig. 4 shows
    the LULC map for the research region and lists the seven major categories: built-up
    areas, waterbodies, trees, scrub/shrub, crops, grass (mixed forest), barren land,
    and flooded vegetation. The reclassification map illustrates how these groups
    are split into five introductory classes based on suitability, as shown in Fig.
    3h. Most of the research area (84.12%) is a Scrub/Shrub and urban region, with
    9.50% crops in the study area followed by water and urban class (5.33%) of LULC
    in the Kohat area. It is frequently recommended to use land-use types like bare
    ground and thinly vegetated land for water harvesting zones and structures (Wu
    et al., 2022, Xu et al., 2022). The results of the present study illustrated that
    water bodies and urban classes occupying around 5.33% should be more appropriate
    for collecting rainwater. It is evident that the scrub/shrub class of LULC, which
    together make up 84.12% of the study territory, is the best place to gather rainwater
    for irrigation (Zhu et al., 2022). The chosen sub-areas for the RWH structure
    were categorized based on their suitability. This was accomplished by weighting
    the suitability classes into the following regions, i.e., low, medium, and high,
    as revealed in Fig. 4a. These places are ranked according to their suitability,
    with 3 representing the ideal zone and 1 representing the unsuitable zone of the
    study area. Fig. 5 shows that the moderately appropriate locations comprised 44%
    of the total area and were most strongly represented in the study area. The lowest-scaled
    regions with 22.40% regional coverage were considered inappropriate for RWH. The
    highest suitable region occupied 33.46% of the whole area. Regarding precipitation,
    slope, lithology, Lineament, soil, drainage density, soil, and LULC, most parts
    received the most attention when identifying the RWH structures (Cheng et al.,
    2023, Huang et al., 2019b). Moreover, integrating machine learning enhances the
    accuracy and efficiency of site selection. Traditional methods often rely on manual
    interpretation of GIS and Remote Sensing data, which can be time-consuming and
    prone to human error. Machine learning algorithms, on the other hand, can rapidly
    process large datasets and autonomously learn from patterns, significantly streamlining
    the identification process (Mokhtar et al., 2021, Yin et al., 2023). This efficiency
    is crucial, especially in regions facing pressing water scarcity issues, where
    timely decision-making is imperative. The predictive capabilities of machine learning
    models also contribute to proactive planning and resource allocation (Tariq et
    al., 2023b). By leveraging historical data and real-time observations from Remote
    Sensing, these models can forecast potential changes in precipitation patterns
    and identify areas susceptible to water stress. This foresight empowers decision-makers
    to implement rainwater harvesting structures preemptively, mitigating the impact
    of droughts and ensuring a more resilient water supply (Thanh Noi and Kappas,
    2017). Furthermore, incorporating machine learning in GIS and Remote Sensing facilitates
    adaptability to changing environmental conditions. As climate patterns evolve,
    machine learning models can continuously update and refine their predictions based
    on new data inputs. This dynamic nature is vital for maintaining the relevance
    and effectiveness of rainwater harvesting initiatives over time (Chen et al.,
    2020). Ultimately, the synergy between machine learning, GIS, and Remote Sensing
    in identifying potential sites for rainwater harvesting structures represents
    a cutting-edge approach to addressing water scarcity challenges. This integrated
    study improves the precision and efficiency of site selection. It empowers decision-makers
    with predictive insights, contributing to sustainable water resource management
    in the face of evolving environmental conditions. 4.1. Limitations Despite the
    efficacy of RWH techniques utilizing AHP and WOE methodologies in water-scarce
    arid and semi-arid regions, certain limitations should be acknowledged. Although
    this inquiry employs a cost-effective scientific approach to analyze many aspects
    of natural resources, it is essential to accept certain limitations. The primary
    constraints are outlined as follows. a. This study''s diverse satellite and field
    data are obtained from satellites provided by multiple agencies and departments.
    Nevertheless, the majority of this map is highly prevalent in rural areas. The
    highest disparity in these variables can be observed locally or on a small scale.
    As a result of this problem, the groundwater potential maps generated could have
    been more accurate at the same local scale. b. AHP is a practical method in which
    the prioritization of criteria is determined based on expertise. Despite the high
    accuracy demonstrated by this research, it is possible to generate a more comprehensive
    map by rearranging the rankings in a unidirectional manner. c. The accuracy of
    MIF and AHP findings is confirmed by comparing them with water level data. However,
    it should be noted that groundwater levels vary from region to region. On the
    other hand, the ROC plot has provided more accurate results at local, international,
    and national levels. d. The sustainable planning and development of groundwater
    have been formulated based on the results of the AHP. However, implementing planning
    for soil and water conservation structures in the field poses a significant challenge.
    e. This inquiry focuses only on AHP, MIF, and RS techniques to assess potential
    groundwater zones and create comprehensive planning maps. Nevertheless, ground
    survey-based geophysical methodologies are highly advantageous for conducting
    precise and dangerous comprehensive valuations. Nevertheless, the process of determining
    groundwater potential zones using ground-based geophysical surveys and field surveys
    is not only costly but also exceedingly time-consuming. 5. Conclusion The current
    study examined the identification of potential zones in the basin utilizing the
    WOE and AHP. This research uses two distinct methodologies to demarcate GWPZ.
    RWH is a practical strategy for controlling water deficiency challenges by boosting
    water availability over the long term. This issue was addressed in the current
    study by utilizing the GIS-based AHP and WOE techniques to identify the potential
    site for RWH in the study area. With the help of the GIS-based AHP and WOE approach,
    we gathered data on the necessary factors (rainfall, slope, lithology, Lineament,
    fault, soil, drainage density, LULC) to design an appropriate dam/reservoir map
    for the study area. The current AHP model study shows that 22.40% of the research
    region needs to be more suitable for RWH. In addition, it is moderately ideal
    for RWH, which contains 44% of the whole study area. Furthermore, 33.46% of the
    study area is distributed throughout the region, which suits RWH. Furthermore,
    according to the results of the WOE model, the high class occupied 32% (956.8
    km2), moderate 43% (1285.7 km2), and the low class of RWH occupied 25% (748 km2)
    of the study area. This study also suggests including other geological, groundwater,
    and meteorological aspects to enhance the outcome. This article examined and established
    a correlation between the two methodologies, determining which technique is most
    suitable for identifying possible groundwater zones. The groundwater potential
    area maps were validated by comparing them with the groundwater depth data using
    the ROC and AUC models. The cross-validation results identified the AHP as a superior
    method (with an accuracy of 86%) for delineating possible groundwater zones in
    the basin area. The cross-validation results indicate that the WOE method is moderately
    effective, with an accuracy of 91%, for extracting groundwater potential maps
    in the area. The outcome of the current research will help the decision-makers
    and authorities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa emphasize their long-term development plans
    for handling water scarcity in the Kohat region. The established methodology of
    the present research can be used on a national and international level for terrain
    with similar characteristics. Funding This research was funded by the Researchers

    BiodiversityConventional farmingMicroorganismOrganic farmingPaddy field 1. Introduction
    Soil microorganisms serve as soil health indicators, reflect natural and anthropogenic
    activities, and are essential in supplying soil nutrients via global chemical
    and biological cycles (Wang et al., 2016; Hermans et al., 2017; Zhang et al.,
    2019; Suman et al., 2022). Furthermore, some soil microorganisms, such as Bacillus
    and Penicillium, promote crops in absorbing nutrients and directly and indirectly
    affects crop growth by improving stress resistance and suppressing pathogens (Wang
    et al., 2016; Rasheeda et al., 2017; Hao et al., 2020; Suman et al., 2022). Specifically,
    soil microorganisms in the farming process potentially significantly enhance agricultural
    productivity and quality, promote soil health, and contribute to food security
    and safety (Park et al., 2011). Organic farming positively impacts the conservation
    of agricultural ecosystems by promoting biodiversity, improving crop health, and
    reducing the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers through the use of organic
    materials. In contrast, conventional farming, which is widely practiced in many
    agricultural areas worldwide, uses synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to achieve
    increased crop yields with relatively lower labor input. Depending on the farming
    approach, organic farming positively influences the biological aspects of soil
    health, including microbial activity and diversity. In contrast, conventional
    farming is associated with soil alterations due to the use of synthetic fertilizers
    and pesticides, which negatively affects biodiversity (Lupatini et al., 2017).
    However, the microbial species diversity in conventional farming soils is similar
    to that in organic farming (Lopes et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2015). Xu et al.
    (2022) conducted a comparative analysis of microbial diversity in relation to
    soil depth, revealing that organic soils at depths of 10 cm–20 cm exhibited higher
    microbial diversity compared to conventional agricultural soils. Additionally,
    Tian et al. (2015) compared the impact of organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers
    using a control group, indicating that both organic and inorganic nitrogen fertilizers
    did not exert a significant influence on soil bacterial diversity. This is considered
    to be due to changes in species diversity, which are influenced by differences
    in farming practices as well as the collective influence of abiotic factors, such
    as temperature, moisture, and soil nutrients, affecting microbial community changes
    (Fierer et al., 2012; Corneo et al., 2013; García-Orenes et al., 2013; Hartmann
    et al., 2015; Peltoniemi et al., 2021) Accordingly, microorganisms have recently
    attracted increasing attention as important factors in increasing biodiversity
    and sustainable agriculture (Suman et al., 2022), with studies being conducted
    to determine the relationship between changes in soil microorganisms owing to
    energy inputs such as fertilizer and compost (Giovannucci et al., 2012; Tian et
    al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019; Rhew et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2022). In South Korea,
    there is increasing interest in understanding the impact of soil microbial ecosystems
    in organic farming cultivation sites, and studies comparing them with conventional
    farming cultivation sites have been conducted (Choi et al., 2011; Kang et al.,
    2019; Kim et al., 2020). Unlike cultivated land such as paddy fields and orchards,
    Korean rice fields are cultivated for a certain period during crop growth, and
    many physicochemical and biological changes occur along with repeated changes
    in the oxidation and reduction environments in freshwater conditions, providing
    an ecosystem for various microorganisms to inhabit (Wang et al., 2021). Because
    of this specific ecosystem, it is important to understand the interaction between
    microorganisms, soil, and microorganisms in rice paddies compared to other agricultural
    lands. However, microbiological research data from domestic rice paddies remain
    insufficient. Considering the variations in each study, such as the surveyed locations,
    weather conditions, and farming practices, a significant amount of basic data
    is required. To understand the functional impacts of farming methods, understanding
    the mechanisms of microbial community interactions that change according to physicochemical
    and biological characteristics such as moisture, pH, inter-species competition,
    and cooperation is important (Lauber et al., 2009; Kodera et al., 2022; Nawaz
    et al., 2022). The objective of this study is to assess the ecological soil properties
    of organic and conventional paddy fields, elucidating the distinct characteristics
    of soils in both agricultural systems, and comparing the differences in microbial
    community composition and functions. Accordingly, this research 1) specifies the
    physicochemical and microbiological attributes of domestically cultivated organic
    and conventional paddy soils, and 2) compares the health status of these soils
    based on soil microbial diversity using biodiversity assessment indices, including
    Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description
    and sample collection Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province, As in national statistical
    data for the year of 2022 indicating the rice paddies account for 47% of the total
    cultivation, in this research area. To compare the differences in microbial diversity
    between organic and conventional paddy fields, we chose the following survey locations:
    organic paddy farming (OP) located in Buyong, Yangseo (37°33′16.71″ N, 127°20′25.90″
    E), and conventional paddy farming (CP) located in Yangsu, Angseo (37°33′21.23″
    N, 127°19′50.94″ E) (Fig. 1). Organic paddy fields have been utilizing certified
    organic materials for the past 20 years and cultivating Milqueen, whereas conventional
    paddy fields are dedicated to growing Chamdreams. The planting distance for both
    the organic and conventional paddy soils was 23 cm × 23 cm, and the soil slope
    was 27%. The soil was characterized by a loamy texture. Four field surveys were
    conducted from August to November 2022: two during the farming season (August
    17 (#1), September 27 (#2)) and two during the harvest season (October 18 (#3),
    November 15 (#4)). The meteorological conditions during the survey period in 2022
    included an average temperature of 12.2 °C and a total precipitation of 2143.4
    mm. In the specific sampling sites (#1-#4), the temperatures and precipitation
    were as follows: 24 °C, 10.4 mm; 17.7 °C, 0 mm; 7.8 °C, 0 mm; and 5.7 °C, 2.6
    mm. Additionally, the 10-year antecedent precipitation (2011–2021) averaged 1264.4
    mm, and during the survey year, the precipitation during the survey year was higher
    than the annual average (Korea Meteorological Administration). During the field
    surveys, soil samples were randomly collected from three locations within a single
    site at a depth of 0–30 cm using an auger. The collected samples were placed in
    polyethylene bags, mixed, and immediately transported to the laboratory. After
    air-drying for seven days, the samples were sieved through a 2 mm mesh and used
    for analysis. Additionally, for DNA extraction, 3 g of soil samples were stored
    in 5 mL Eppendorf tubes at −50 °C. Download : Download high-res image (727KB)

    characteristics of soil samples For the physical properties (Table 1), we measured
    particle size, bulk density, and porosity. Particle size was analyzed using a
    Particle Size Analyzer, with the soil samples sieved to 1 mm. The measured results
    were classified according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
    methods, and the soil texture was determined using a soil triangle. The bulk density
    was calculated by dividing the weight of dried soil, obtained after conditioning
    the collected core at 105 °C for 18 h, by the core volume (100 mL). The soil moisture
    content was measured using a soil moisture sensor (ZL6) at a depth of approximately
    15 cm from the ground. Table 1. The statistical characteristics of soil physicochemical

    ± 3 Regarding the soil chemical properties (Table 1), pH, electrical conductivity
    (EC), organic matter (OM), available phosphorus (Av. P2O5), exchangeable cations
    (Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were analyzed using the
    soil chemical analysis methods of the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences
    (Kim et al., 2010). The pH and EC were measured after shaking by adding 25 mL
    of distilled water to 5 g of air-dried soil. OM was measured using the Walkley–Black
    method, and Av. P2O5 was prepared using the Bray No. 1 method. Ca2+, Mg2+, K+,
    and CEC were stirred for 30 min after adding 30 mL of 1 N NH4OAc to 3 g of 2 mm
    sieved soil samples. After stirring, 15 mL of the filtrate was added to HM No.
    50 filter paper, and the cation concentration was measured using ICP-OES. 2.3.
    DNA extraction, qPCR, and sequencing In this study, 0.25 g of a soil sample was
    used to extract DNA following the DNA extraction protocol of the DNeasy Power
    Soil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). gDNA (2 ng) was PCR-amplified using Herculase
    II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) with 5 × reaction
    buffer, 1 mM dNTPs, and universal F/R PCR primers at 500 nM each. The first PCR
    cycle conditions involved heating at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles at
    95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, with a final extension step
    at 72 °C for 5 min. The initial PCR product was purified using AMPure beads (Agencourt
    Biosciences). Following purification, a 2 μL aliquot of the first PCR product
    was subjected to a second PCR amplification to construct the final library with
    included indices using NexteraXT Indexed Primers. The cycling conditions for the
    second PCR were the same as those for the first PCR, except for 10 cycles. The
    PCR product was purified using AMPure beads, and the final purified product was
    quantified according to the qPCR Quantification Protocol Guide (KAPA Library Quantification
    kits for Illumina Sequencing platforms). Quality was verified using a TapeStation
    D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Sequencing was performed
    using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Microbial community analysis
    was conducted using metagenome amplicon sequencing, a next-generation sequencing
    method that amplified and sequenced the 16S rRNA V3V4 (341F 805R) region and fungal
    amplification and sequencing of the ITS 3F 4R region. After completing the sequencing
    process, Illumina MiSeq raw data were sorted by sample using the index sequences,
    and sample-specific paired-end FASTQ files were generated. We conducted a preprocessing
    step using Cutadapt (v3.2) to remove sequencing adapter sequences and F/R primer
    sequences from the target gene regions. Subsequently, for 16S rRNA, the forward
    sequences (Read1) were trimmed to 250 bp and the reverse sequences (Read2) to
    200 bp, while for ITS, both Forward and Reverse sequences were trimmed to 250
    bp (Martin, 2011). To correct for errors in the amplicon sequencing process, we
    employed the DADA2 (v1.18.0) package within R (v4.0.3), excluding sequences with
    expected errors greater than two in paired-end reads (Callahan et al., 2016).
    After completing the preprocessing phase, batch-specific error models were established
    to remove sample-specific noise. The corrected paired-end sequences were assembled
    into a single sequence, and the DADA2 Consensus method was used to eliminate chimeric
    sequences and form Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). For 16S rRNA, ASVs less
    than 350 bp were excluded using R (v4.0.3), whereas, for ITS analysis, a length
    filter was not applied to the generated ASVs. To perform a comparative microbial
    community analysis, we employed QIIME (v1.9) to normalize the entire set of samples
    by subsampling based on the read count of the sample with the lowest number of
    reads (Caporaso et al., 2010). Each ASV sequence was subjected to a BLAST+ (v2.9.0)
    search against the reference database (NCBI 16S Microbial DB) to assign taxonomic
    information to the organism with the highest similarity to the subject. In this
    process, taxonomy information was not assigned if the query coverage of the best
    hit was less than 85% or if the matched region''s identity was less than 85% (Camacho
    et al., 2009). In the ITS analysis, each ASV sequence was subjected to UCLUST
    against the reference database (UNITE 8.2 2020-02-04 UNITE + INSD All Eukaryotes
    & UNITE 8.2 2020-02-20 Fungi2 99% clustering) to perform taxonomic assignments
    based on the organism information of the most similar reference. In this process,
    the assigned references had a sequence similarity of 90% or higher with the query
    (Edgar, 2010). Furthermore, for multiple alignments of ASV sequences, we used
    the MAFFT (v7.475) program and generated a phylogenetic tree using the FastTreeMP
    (v2.1.10) program (Price et al., 2010; Katoh et al., 2013). Using the aforementioned
    ASV abundances and taxonomic information, we conducted various microbial community
    comparative analyses using QIIME. Additionally, to assess species diversity and
    evenness within the microbial clusters in our samples, we calculated Shannon and
    Inverse Simpson indices and explored alpha diversity using rarefaction curves
    and Chao1 values. 2.4. Comparative analysis of soil microbial community diversity
    and statistical assessment We employed alpha diversity analysis as a metric to
    evaluate the richness, evenness, and overall diversity of species within our samples
    (Table 3). Chao1 was calculated to assess species richness in soil microbial communities
    between organic (OP) and conventional (CP) treatments, whereas Shannon and Simpson
    indices were computed to compare species diversity. We used SPSS (version 26)
    to perform Mann–Whitney t-tests to examine differences in the distribution proportions
    and diversity indices of the organic and conventional soil microbiota. Furthermore,
    we applied the Venn Diagram packge in R (version 4.3.1) to show the shared and
    unique genera in organic and conventional farming (Fig. 3), and the Corrplot package
    in R (version 4.3.1) to construct a correlation matrix based on Spearman''s correlation,
    highlighting the relationships between microbial species and chemical properties
    at significance levels of p<0.05, p<0.01, and p<0.001 (Fig. 4). Table 2. The seasonal

    ± 0.78 0.961 ± 0.020 Chao1 is an indicator used to estimate species richness in
    a given sample based on ASV values. A higher Chao1 value suggests a greater richness
    of species, indicating the presence of many unanalyzed species (Kielak et al.,
    2009; Han et al., 2022), as represented by Equation (1): (1) where is the estimated
    richness, is the observed number of species, n1 is the number of ASVs in one sequence,
    and n2 is the number of ASVs shared between two sequences. The Shannon index was
    used to assess the uncertainty of the predictions regarding random species in
    the target area. An increasing Shannon index value signifies higher species diversity
    within the target area (Lee et al., 2018), as represented by Equation (2): (2)
    where is the proportion of species i within the total number of individuals in
    a cluster, and H′ is the Shannon index. The Simpson index signifies the probability
    that two randomly selected individuals in a sample belong to the same species,
    with a value close to one indicating lower diversity. In this context, a Simpson
    index value approaching 1 represents a higher diversity, as in Equation (3): (3)
    where is the proportion of species i within the total number of individuals in
    a cluster, and C is the Simpson index. 3. Results 3.1. Analysis of soil physicochemical
    characteristics in the study area We sampled organic and conventional soils four
    times in each season, and the results for the physicochemical characteristics
    of the soil are presented in Table 1. The textures of the organic and conventional
    soils were classified as sandy or loamy. For soil physical properties, bulk density
    in organic fields was highest at #2 and #3 (1.45 g cm−3), while in conventional
    fields, it was highest at #2 (1.24 g cm−3), and on average, bulk density was 1.4
    g cm−3 in organic paddy fields and 1.03 g cm−3 in conventional paddy fields. Water
    Content in organic fields reached its peak at #4 (41.2%), whereas in conventional
    fields, it was highest at #1 and #2 (38.7%), and on average, water content was
    35.4% in organic fields and 38.2% in conventional fields. For soil chemical properties
    (Table 1), pH was highest in organic fields and conventional fields at #4 (6.9)
    and #2 (5.8) respectively, and on average, pH was higher in organic paddy fields
    at 6.6 compared to 5.4 in conventional paddy fields. EC was highest in organic
    fields at #2 and #3 (0.33 dS m−1), while conventional fields recorded the highest
    value at #3 (0.56 dS m−1). On average, EC was higher in conventional paddy fields,
    measuring 0.42 dS m−1 compared to 0.29 dS m−1 in organic fields. Av. P2O5 was
    highest in organic fields at 346 mg kg−1 and in conventional fields at 242 mg
    kg−1, both at #2. On average, Av. P2O5 was 137 ± 145 mg kg−1 in organic fields
    and 146 ± 99 mg kg−1 in conventional fields. Soil organic matter was highest in
    organic fields at #2 (3.8%) and in conventional fields at #4 (3.3%). On average,
    OM content was 2.7% in organic fields and 1.9% in conventional fields. Additionally,
    Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ were 4.94, 0.96, and 0.23 cmol+·g−1 in organic paddy fields
    and 3.08, 0.82, and 0.22 cmol+·g−1 in conventional paddy fields, respectively.
    CEC was 11.03 cmol+·g−1 in organic fields and 10.46 cmol+·g−1 in conventional
    fields. 3.2. Soil microbial community composition In the organic paddy soils,
    337,731 bacterial and 474,319 fungal raw data reads were processed, resulting
    in the inclusion of 6026 bacterial and 3951 fungal ASVs (#1 to #4). In conventional
    paddy soils, 363,181 raw bacterial data and 438,209 raw fungal data reads were
    processed, resulting in the inclusion of 6637 bacterial and 3960 fungal ASVs (#1
    to #4). To compare the soil bacteria and fungi community composition ratios between
    OP and CP, we illustrated the results in Fig. 2. In the Bacteria graph, species
    other than the top 8 dominant species and those with Query Coverage less than
    85% or Identity Percentage less than 85% under Blast conditions were classified
    as ''Other''. In the Fungi graph, species appearing as ''Unassigned'' or ''Unidentified''
    were categorized as ''Other''. At the phylum level (Fig. 2), both organic and
    conventional paddy soils showed Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria,
    Firmicutes, and Nitrospirae as dominant phyla, with additional analyses revealing
    the presence of Verrucomicrobia and Planctomycetes (Fig. 2, OP#1b to CP#4b). Organic
    paddy soils were dominated by Proteobacteria (34.4%), Chloroflexi (15.6%), Actinobacteria
    (12.0%), Acidobacteria (7.3%), Firmicutes (6.5%), Nitrospirae (4.1%), Verrucomicrobia
    (1.8%), Planctomycetes (1.5%), and Bacteroidetes (1.4%). Conventional paddy soils
    were dominated by Proteobacteria (31.9%), Chloroflexi (14.3%), Actinobacteria
    (13.5%), Firmicutes (9.4%), Acidobacteria (7.0%), Bacteroidetes (3.0%), Nitrospirae
    (2.9%), Verrucomicrobia (1.6%), and Planctomycetes (0.9%). At the phylum level
    (Fig. 2, OP#1f to CP#4f), Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungal
    phyla, with additional analyses revealing the presence of Mucoromycota and Mortierellomycota.
    In the organic paddy soils, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota (4.7%), Basidiomycota
    (1.4%), Mucoromycota (0.53%), and Mortierellomycota (0.07%). In conventional paddy
    soils, the dominant phyla were Ascomycota (18.1%), Basidiomycota (0.46%), Mortierellomycota
    (0.14%), and Mucoromycota (0.01%). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    and genus levels and soil chemical properties (N = 8, A:Phylum level, B: Genus
    level, p<0.05: *, p<0.01: **, p<0.001: ***). Furthermore, at the bacterial genus
    level, Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio, Vicinamibacter, and Clostridium
    were the most commonly distributed genera in both agricultural soils (Table 2).
    At the genus level, the top three species of Thermomarinylinea, Thermodesulfovibrio,
    and Vicinamibacter, were dominant in organic paddy soils, whereas Clostridium,
    Thermomarinylinea, and Vicinamibacter were dominant in conventional paddy soils
    (Table 2, Group of Bacteria). At the fungal genus level, Clohesyomyces, Sirastachys,
    and Penicillium were the most commonly distributed genera in both agricultural
    soils. The top three species of Limnoperdon, Tomentella, and Clohesyomyces were
    dominant in organic paddy soils, whereas the top three species of Ustilaginoidea,
    Plectosphaerella, and Pyrenochaetopsis were dominant in conventional paddy soils
    (Table 2, Group of Fungi). Other microbial species classified as ''Other'' with
    high distribution were excluded. 3.3. Microbial communities and diversity 3.3.1.
    ASV venn diagram We analyzed the distribution of unique and shared species of
    bacteria and fungi in the organic and conventional paddy soils by representing
    the analyzed ASVs in a Venn diagram (Fig. 3). When comparing the bacterial clusters
    in conventional paddy soils, the ASV numbers for #1 to #4 were 1117, 1065, 1085,
    and 1365, respectively, whereas those for organic paddy soils were 1141, 667,
    856, and 1357, respectively (Fig. 3, (a)–(d)). Notably, organic paddy soils exhibited
    a more sensitive response to temporal variation than conventional paddy soils.
    When comparing fungal clusters in conventional paddy soils, the ASV numbers for
    #1 to #4 were 1106, 746, 340, and 836, whereas in organic paddy soils, they were
    889, 626, 803, and 668, respectively (Fig. 3, (e)–(h)). Conventional paddy soils
    exhibited a more sensitive response to temporal variations than organic paddy
    soils. Shared species refers to the number of microbial species commonly observed
    in both organic and conventional paddy soils during the growing season, showing
    a decreasing trend, followed by recovery after harvest. 3.3.2. Microbial alpha
    diversity We assessed the microbial diversity of organic and conventional paddy
    soils across seasons (#1 to #4) using the Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices.
    The results are presented in Table 3. Additionally, Good''s coverage for bacteria
    ranged from 0.998 to 0.999, and for fungi, it ranged from 0.999 to 1, indicating
    that the sequences adequately represented the respective environments. Although
    variations existed in the diversity index results across seasons, when comparing
    bacterial alpha diversity (Table 3, Group of Bacteria), an average of 1507 ± 419
    and 1659 ± 259 ASVs were found in the organic and conventional soils, respectively.
    Chao1 was 1513 ± 426 in organic and 1666 ± 259 in conventional soils, while the
    Shannon index was 9.71 ± 0.35 and 9.94 ± 0.24, respectively. The average Simpson
    index was 0.998 for both species. Comparing fungal alpha diversity (Table 3, Group
    of Fungi), the number of ASVs was 988 ± 170 in organic and 990 ± 409 in conventional
    soils. Chao1 values were 988 ± 169 and 990 ± 409, Shannon index values were 7.27
    ± 0.20 and 6.89 ± 0.78, and Simpson index values were 0.971 ± 0.004 and 0.961
    ± 0.020, respectively. 3.4. Effects of soil chemical properties on microbial communities
    We conducted a comparative analysis of seven soil chemical properties (pH, EC,
    AP (Av. P2O5), OM, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+), and dominant species in the soil (At the
    Phylum level, nine at the bacteria and two at the fungi, at the Genus level, four
    at the bacteria and three at the fungi) (Fig. 4). The statistically significant
    taxa (p < 0.05) included Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes,
    Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes at the bacterial phylum level,
    and at the fungal phylum level, the significant taxon (p < 0.05) was Ascomycota
    (Fig. 4A). At the genus level (Fig. 4B), we selected four dominant bacteria and
    three fungal taxa that were dominant during seasons #1–#4. Taxa that exhibited
    statistical significance included Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio, and
    Clostridium genera for bacteria, and the genus Ustilaginoidea for fungi. 4. Discussion
    4.1. Soil physicochemical properties Soil bulk density affects aeration and water
    retention and reduces microbial populations as it increases (Li et al., 2002,
    2021; G. B. Li et al., 2021). According to Cho et al. (2012), the average bulk
    density of paddy soils in South Korea is 1.22 g cm−3 for topsoil and 1.47 g cm−3
    for subsoil. Compared to our research results on the subsoil, the organic paddy
    soil investigated in this study showed values similar to the typical bulk density
    of paddy soils in South Korea, whereas lower values were observed for conventional
    paddy soils. However, the standard for improving the physicality of paddy soil
    is recommended to be 1.20 Mg m−3 or less based on topsoil (Kim et al., 2013; Cho
    et al., 2018), and for conventional paddy soil, except for #2, all other seasons
    satisfy this standard. However, organic paddy soils exceeded the criteria in all
    seasons, indicating the need for appropriate soil management to reduce bulk density.
    pH is one of the factors that can limit microbial growth and influence the survival
    of specific bacterial or fungal species (Rousk et al., 2010; Fan et al., 2022).
    Rousk et al. (2009) demonstrated that pH is correlated with bacteria and fungi,
    showing an increase in bacteria and a decrease in fungi at higher pH levels. However,
    our study presented contrasting results, as pH was lower in conventional paddy
    soils (5.4 ± 0.3) compared to organic paddy soils (6.6 ± 0.2); however, bacteria
    showed a higher distribution in conventional paddy soils, and fungi exhibited
    a higher distribution in organic paddy soils. These results suggest that pH is
    not the dominant factor driving changes in microbial communities and can be considered
    as one of the factors that exert an indirect influence. When compared to the soil
    fertility adequacy standards set by the Rural Development Administration, organic
    paddy soils showed values higher than the appropriate range (5.5–6.5). In contrast,
    conventional paddy soils did not meet the adequacy standards and showed values
    below the appropriate range. In the organic paddies, there was a trend of increasing
    pH over time, whereas a decreasing trend was observed for the conventional paddies.
    This phenomenon is attributed to the use of inorganic fertilizers in conventional
    farming, which tend to acidify the soil, and organic fertilizers, which are associated
    with shifting the soil pH to neutral (Rachwał et al., 2021). Av. P2O5 in organic
    and conventional paddy soils was 137 ± 145 and 146 ± 99 mg kg−1, respectively.
    Except for OP #4, all other periods exceeded the optimal range (80–120 mg kg−1),
    indicating the need for proper soil management during the crop-growing season.
    In the case of conventional paddy soils, OM was below the optimal range (2–3%)
    during the crop growth stages (#1 and #2). The values of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ showed
    seasonal differences in both organic and conventional paddy soils and the properties,
    excluding K+ did not meet all of the appropriate criteria (5.0–6.0, 1.5–2.0, and
    0.2–0.3 cmol+·g−1). 4.2. Microbial communities in soil Microorganisms play a crucial
    role in maintaining soil health, and their functional impact on soil and crops
    varies depending on the classification of the soil microorganisms. Among them,
    bacteria contribute significantly to plant health and soil fertility and are considered
    early warning indicators of soil health because of their sensitivity to environmental
    changes (Hayat et al., 2010; Rachwał et al., 2021). In this study, the dominant
    phyla, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes,
    accounted for approximately 76% of the total population. This trend is similar
    to the dominant phyla observed in previous studies by Xu et al. (2022) and Zhang
    et al. (2019). The most abundant group in paddy soil, Proteobacteria, is a Gram-negative
    bacteria and is considered the most abundant microorganism in soil ecosystems,
    playing a central role in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. Metabolically,
    they possess diverse capabilities (Mhete et al., 2020). The second most abundant
    group, Chloroflexi, is involved in carbon cycling and can break down plant compounds
    through cellulose, starch, long-chain sugars, and pyrogallol degradation pathways
    (Hug et al., 2013). In addition, the phylum Acidobacteria is involved in soil
    organic carbon cycling and nutrient mineralization, particularly in low-fertility
    areas, acting as a keystone microorganism and facilitating nitrogen supply source
    metabolism (Kang et al., 2019; Kalam et al., 2020). The phylum Actinobacteria
    is essential in the cycling of organic compounds and is associated with soil organic
    matter production, including melanin and soil humic acid (Mhete et al., 2020).
    Nitropirae can oxidize nitrite and convert NO2− to NO3−, making nutrients available
    to plants. It also appears to be relatively abundant at high pH, and the higher
    the ratio, the more active the soil nitrogen circulation (Zhang et al., 2019).
    Furthermore, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia,
    Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi are recognized as microorganisms capable of producing
    alkaline phosphatase and play crucial roles in nutrient cycling (Durrer et al.,
    2021). Fungi, which function as decomposers and symbionts, play a pivotal role
    in the decomposition of organic matter, carbon and nitrogen cycling, and in promoting
    plant growth and suppressing plant pathogens (Karanja et al., 2020). Moreover,
    they can thrive under a range of soil pH, temperature, and moisture conditions,
    and fungal diversity is regulated by both biological factors, such as plants and
    organisms, as well as abiotic factors, such as soil pH, temperature, and moisture
    levels (Frąc et al., 2018). In this study, the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota
    were detected in organic and conventional soils, the phylum Mucoromycota was analyzed
    in organic soils, and the phylum Mortierellomycota was analyzed in conventional
    soils. Ascomycota, which emerged as the dominant phylum in both organic and conventional
    soil, exerts beneficial effects such as improved root and plant establishment,
    nutrient cycling, soil structure enhancement, increased resistance to stress,
    and enhanced slow ion absorption, making it an important microbe for the decomposition
    of lignocellulosic organic matter in soils (Frąc et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019).
    The phylum Basidiomycota is known for its role in lignin decomposition and is
    considered to accelerate nutrient uptake through ectomycorrhizal formation (Hervé
    et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022). In contrast to previous studies that indicated
    a prevalent distribution of Ascomycota in organic agricultural soils, this study
    found a high prevalence of Ascomycota in conventional agricultural soils. In CF#3f,
    the phylum Ascomycota constituted approximately 36% of the total bacterial population.
    The high prevalence in this sample was attributed to the significant distribution
    of the genus Ustilaginoidea, a subordinate taxon within the phylum Ascomycota.
    In this study, the average microbial distribution ratios of the organic and conventional
    soil samples from periods #1 to #4 were compared using t-tests. However, no significant
    differences (p>0.05) were observed among the eight dominant bacterial species.
    In contrast, of the dominant 4 fungal species, only the phylum Mucoromycota exhibited
    a significant difference (p<0.05) between the two agricultural soil types. At
    the genus level, organic paddy fields were predominantly characterized by the
    dominance of the genera Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio, and Vicinamibacter
    throughout the survey period, with Clostridium becoming the dominant species in
    period #2. In the conventional paddy soils, the genera Thermomarinilinea, Thermodesulfovibrio,
    Vicinamibacter, Bellilinea, Clostridium, and Acidobacterium were observed, and
    all four monitoring periods (#1 to #4) exhibited variability in the dominant cluster
    composition (Table 2, Group of Bacteria). The genus Thermomarinilinea, observed
    in organic and conventional paddy soils, is capable of methane production through
    anaerobic metabolism (Yang et al., 2021), and the genus Thermodesulfovibrio is
    a sulfate-reducing microbe, utilizing sulfate as an electron acceptor to generate
    sulfides (Liang et al., 2016). Furthermore, the genus Vicinamibacter contributes
    to soil nitrogen cycling and solubilization (Wu et al., 2021). The genus Clostridium,
    which is abundant in conventional paddy soils, is an anaerobic microorganism found
    in various environments, including the host''s intestines, excreta, and soil,
    capable of nitrogen fixation without a host, and promotes crop growth and produces
    antimicrobial metabolites (Polyanskaya et al., 2002; Pahalagedara et al., 2020).
    At the fungal genus level, Clohesyomyces, Penicillium, Mucor, and Sirastachys
    were predominant in the organic paddy fields, whereas Clohesyomyces, Ustilaginoidea,
    Penicillium, and Plectosphaerella were dominant in the conventional paddy fields
    (Table 2, Group of Fungi). This indicates a distinct microbial community composition
    between organic and conventional paddy fields. The genera Mucor and Sirastachys
    were found exclusively in the organic paddy soils, while the genus Ustilaginoidea
    was found exclusively in the conventional paddy soils. Among them, the genus Ustilaginoidea
    is a plant pathogen that causes false smut in rice, which negatively affects both
    yield and quality, and its toxins can adversely affect humans and animals (Shim
    et al., 2001; Fan et al., 2020; G. Li et al., 2021). Additionally, the genera
    Mucor and Sirastachys are commonly found in the soil and decaying crops (Ziaee
    et al., 2016; Samarakoon et al., 2021), and the genus Penicillium is a key soil
    fungus contributing to soil nitrogen cycling, producing siderophores and plant
    hormones, and playing a biological control role against plant pathogens (Hao et
    al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2021). These results at the microbial
    genus level indicate that conventional agriculture may be more susceptible to
    biological control and pest suppression compared to organic agriculture. In rice
    paddy cultivation in South Korea, irrigation and drainage processes significantly
    influence the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in organic and conventional
    paddy soils. Under flooded conditions, the soil is reduced, and the soil microbial
    community is composed of anaerobic microorganisms that utilize compounds such
    as nitrates and sulfates as electron acceptors (Hester et al., 2022). Furthermore,
    at the genus level, this study found that anaerobic microorganisms such as Thermomarinilinea,
    Thermodesulfovibrio, and Clostridium dominated the microbial community. Additionally,
    changes in bacterial and fungal communities during the drainage period occur unpredictably,
    and shifts in the fungal community appear to be more sensitive to the drainage
    period than those of bacteria (Xue et al., 2021). The paddy soils in this study,
    influenced by freshwater-induced reducing conditions, primarily shaped the dominant
    species distribution as anaerobic microorganisms, resulting in similar bacterial
    community composition in the two agricultural soils. However, at the fungal genus
    level, variations were observed, showing a trend similar to that reported in previous
    studies. The fungal species that exhibited sensitivity to freshwater-induced community
    changes require further research, as there have been limited investigations into
    their impact on the soil compared to bacterial species. This study emphasizes
    the importance of identifying the subordinate taxa species occurring in each agricultural
    soil and verifying the functions of the occurring species. 4.3. Microbial community
    structure and diversity analysis Biodiversity is associated with and contributes
    functionally to ecosystems and is used as an indicator to assess the state of
    soil (Reese et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022). Microbial diversity is related to
    ecosystem functions, such as biogeochemical cycling, and ecosystem functions have
    been reported to become more active when microbes are abundant and diverse (Wagg
    et al., 2019). Alpha diversity measures the richness, evenness, and diversity
    of the microorganisms within a sample (Liu et al., 2022). The bacterial diversity
    exhibited a decreasing trend over time, followed by recovery, as shown in Fig.
    3. H. Li et al. (2021) investigated the effects of watering frequency on bacterial
    community composition and diversity. As the frequency of watering increased, the
    proportion of specific bacterial phyla also increased. This suggests that with
    continued frequent watering, the community composition of facultative microorganisms
    shifts towards more anaerobic microorganisms, resulting in a decrease in microbial
    richness and an increase in the dominance ratio of certain microbes, ultimately
    leading to a reduction in the Shannon index. When comparing organic and conventional
    soils, differences in ASV decline over time were observed (Fig. 3, Table 3), and
    bacterial communities appear to be modulated by organic farming practices, while
    fungal communities are regulated by conventional farming. This was attributed
    to changes in soil properties owing to the use of organic and inorganic fertilizers.
    Suzuki et al. (2019) reported temporal changes in the bacterial community composition
    under organic management during crop growth, and some studies have suggested that
    the microbial community composition in paddy soils is influenced by the use of
    organic and inorganic fertilizers (Wang et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2018; Suzuki
    et al., 2019). Wang et al. (2017) and Kumar et al. (2018) reported that the use
    of organic and inorganic fertilizers altered the physicochemical characteristics
    of the soil and indirectly influenced microbial community composition. In terms
    of fungal diversity, the differences were more pronounced numerically than those
    in bacterial diversity. Similarly, it was inferred that the changes and compositional
    differences in the microbial community in the present study were influenced by
    freshwater and organic and inorganic fertilizers. Comparing bacterial and fungal
    diversity of organic and conventional paddy soils, the richness (ASVs and Chao1)
    in bacterial diversity was higher in conventional paddy soils (1659 ± 259 and
    1666 ± 259) than in organic paddy soils (1507 ± 419 and 1513 ± 426). Shannon index
    showed a higher value in conventional paddy soils (9.94 ± 0.24) compared to organic
    paddy soils (9.97 ± 0.35), and the Simpson index resulted in the same value of
    0.998. In terms of fungal diversity, richness (ASVs, Chao1) and diversity (Simpson)
    were not significantly different between the organic and conventional paddy soils.
    The Shannon index was higher in organic paddy soils (7.27 ± 0.20) compared to
    conventional paddy soils (6.89 ± 0.78). Consequently, fungi in organic and conventional
    paddy soils exhibited no differences in richness, while organic paddy soils showed
    a more even and diverse distribution of fungi than conventional paddy soils. This
    contradicts the results of some studies that have shown higher fungal diversity
    in conventional agriculture (Chen et al., 2022). However, when a t-test was performed
    at a significance level of p<0.05, the diversity (ASVs, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson
    indices) of organic and conventional agricultural soils showed no significant
    differences. The findings of this study revealed contrasting results to previous
    research indicating higher microbial diversity in organic soils compared to conventional
    farming practices. This contradicts some studies suggesting that microbial diversity
    in organic soils tends to increase initially but gradually decreases over the
    first few years (van Diepeningen et al., 2006; Hartmann et al., 2015; Bonanomi
    et al., 2016; Khatri et al., 2023). In light of such cases, our study suggests
    that the prolonged 20-year practice of organic farming has influenced a decline
    in microbial diversity. Furthermore, comparing microbial diversity in organic
    and conventional soils is challenging due to variations in field conditions, experimental
    designs, and other factors, as demonstrated by Khatri et al. (2023). 4.4. The
    correlation between soil chemical properties and microorganisms Understanding
    the effect of microorganisms on soil properties and the influence of physicochemical
    factors on microbial communities is essential. Proteobacteria, representing the
    majority of the phylum Bacteria, showed a significant positive correlation (p<0.05)
    with OM, with a correlation coefficient of 0.74. Nitrospirae, which plays a crucial
    role in soil nitrogen cycling, exhibited significant positive correlations (p<0.05,
    p<0.01) with pH, Ca2+, and Mg2+, with correlation coefficients of 0.76, 0.64,
    and 0.48, respectively, whereas EC and K+ showed significant negative correlations
    (p<0.05) with values of −0.55 and −0.05, respectively. Furthermore, other microbial
    taxa were significantly correlated with the chemical properties. At the phylum
    level, factors such as pH, EC, Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ had a substantial influence
    on the microbial community composition, whereas at the genus level, EC, Ca2+,
    Mg2+, and K+ affected the microbial distribution. The genus Thermomarinilinea,
    which accounts for a significant proportion of organic and conventional paddy
    soils, belongs to the subtaxon of the phylum Chloroflexi and is strongly influenced
    by EC. The genus Ustilaginoidea, a subtaxon of the phylum Ascomycota, exhibited
    significant correlations (p<0.05) with pH and EC and a distinct negative correlation
    (p<0.01) with Ca2+. Furthermore, the genus Ustilaginoidea exhibited a negative
    correlation with pH and Ca2+ but a positive correlation with EC. This suggests
    that the presence of Ustilaginoidea was influenced by nitrogen fertilizer, as
    observed when the impacts of nitrogen fertilizer on the soil (pH, Ca2+ decrease,
    and EC increase) were considered (Bae et al., 2015). Understanding the relationship
    between soil chemical properties and microbiota allows us to determine the appropriate
    fertilizer application during the rice growth process, which can help regulate
    beneficial or detrimental microbial communities for soil and crop health. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, we compared the physical, chemical, and microbial characteristics
    of soils under organic and conventional farming practices on paddy from the farming
    season to the harvest period. It is essential to understand the changes in soil
    microorganisms over time. Our study revealed a gradual decrease followed by recovery
    in the abundance of Bacteria species in organic farming, and a similar trend was
    observed in the Fungi communities in conventional farming. This suggests that
    the Bacteria communities is regulated by organic farming, while the Fungi communities
    is influenced by conventional farming practices. The microbial community analysis
    revealed that the bacterial communities exhibited a similar communities composition
    between organic and conventional farming. However, the fungal communities showed
    distinct differences at the genus level. In organic soil, the predominant genera
    included Penicillium, Clohesyomyces, Mucor, and Sirastachys. In contrast, conventional
    soil during the same period was predominantly dominated by genera such as Clohesyomyces,
    Ustilaginoidea, Penicillium, and Plectosphaerella. Additionally, Mucor and Sirastachys
    were exclusively observed in organic soil, while Ustilaginoidea was exclusively
    observed in conventional soil. Notably, Ustilaginoidea is reported as a pathogen
    causing rice false smut, implying that changes in soil characteristics due to
    conventional farming practices may induce the proliferation of pathogens. These
    research findings emphasize that organic farming has potential advantages compared
    to conventional farming practices in terms of crop disease resistance and overall
    health. However, microbial diversity did not show significant differences between
    organic and conventional farming for both bacteria and fungi (p>0.05). The increase
    in microbial species diversity has been reported to have a positive impact on
    agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, evaluating the ecological value of organic
    and conventional agricultural soils solely based on diversity index analysis is
    challenging due to various factors such as experimental design and soil characteristics
    that can influence microbial diversity. To address this, identifying microbial
    taxa at lower taxonomic levels and understanding their functions and impacts on
    soil is important. The results of this study are expected to provide foundational
    data for establishing microbial databases of organisms present in organic and
    conventional paddy soils. Continuous monitoring is necessary to identify the indicator
    species specific to organic and conventional paddy soils. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Agricultural irrigation using reclaimed urban wastewater (RWW) represents
    a sustainable practice to meet the ever-increasing water stress in modern societies.
    However, the occurrence of residual antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria
    (ARB) in RWW is an important human health concern. This study applied for the
    first time a novel Simple-Death dose-response model to the field data of Escherichia
    coli and Pseudomonas spp. collected from three greenhouses for cultivation of
    tomatoes irrigated with RWW. The model estimates the risk of infection by enteropathogenic
    E. coli associated with consumption of tomatoes and the risk of eye-infection
    caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cultivation soil through hand-to-eye contacts.
    The fraction of antibiotic resistant (AR)-E. coli measured in irrigation water
    and AR-Pseudomonas spp. in soil was incorporated in the model to estimate the
    survival of ARB and antibiotic susceptible bacteria in the presence of trace level
    of antibiotics in human body. The results showed that the risk of E. coli infection
    through consumption of tomatoes irrigated with RWW is within the WHO and USEPA
    recommended risk threshold (<10−4); Pseudomonas aeruginosa eye-infection risk
    is at or below the acceptable risk level. The presence of residual antibiotic
    in human body reduced the overall risk probabilities of infections but selectively
    enhanced the survival of ARB in comparison to their susceptible counterparts,
    which resulted in antibiotic untreatable infection. Therefore, the outcomes of
    this study call for a new risk threshold for antibiotic untreatable infections
    and highlight the key importance of adopting work safety measures for better human
    health protection.

    • E. coli risk through tomato consumption is within WHO recommendation. • Pseudomonas
    eye infection risk through soil contact is greater than that of E. coli. • The
    presence of residual antibiotics reduces the overall risk. • Antibiotic resistant
    infections increase in the presence of antibiotics. Abstract Agricultural irrigation
    using reclaimed urban wastewater (RWW) represents a sustainable practice to meet
    the ever-increasing water stress in modern societies. However, the occurrence
    of residual antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in RWW is an important

    collected from three greenhouses for cultivation of tomatoes irrigated with RWW.
    The model estimates the risk of infection by enteropathogenic E. coli associated

    The results showed that the risk of E. coli infection through consumption of tomatoes
    irrigated with RWW is within the WHO and USEPA recommended risk threshold (<10−4);

    simulationSimple-death modelWater management 1. Introduction Globally, there has
    been a rapid growth in the number of initiatives aimed at advancing more sustainable
    water use, including the recycling and reuse of treated wastewater. Recycled,
    or reclaimed wastewater is applied to flush toilets and urinals, irrigate parks,
    golf courses, crops, and for industrial cooling and ornamental fountains or water
    features. Reclaiming wastewater, as a non-traditional water source, can alleviate
    water stresses in municipal and agricultural areas alike and diversify water supply
    portfolios. Treated wastewater is already a common water source for irrigation
    in many semi-arid regions of France, Spain, Italy, Israel, Cyprus, Malta, and
    the United States (US). The growth and extension of the wastewater reuse practice
    for agricultural irrigation also led to an increase in the health and environmental
    concerns associated with this practice. To promote the safe implementation of
    this sustainable practice, the EU has recently published the minimum quality requirements
    for water reuse (Regulation (EU) 2020/741). Nevertheless, this EU regulation,
    similarly to other existing guidelines and regulations, establishes the compliance
    requirements at the water delivery point, but not at the point of use. Understanding
    the behavior of pollutants and the potential for water quality deterioration from
    the point of delivery to the end user is paramount for risk assessments and should
    be addressed with field data under real conditions. Antibiotic resistance (AR)
    is a worldwide growing public health concern, while funding and research for new
    antibiotic development are predicted to decrease (Kelly et al., 2016). The US
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Centre for Disease
    Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimate that more than 2.8 and 0.67 million AR
    infections and more than 35,000 and 33,000 associated deaths occur every year
    in the U.S. and Europe, respectively (CDC, 2019; WHO, 2022). Urban wastewater
    treatment plants (UWWTPs) have been identified as contributors to increased AR
    since human waste can carry antibiotics, heavy metals, and pharmaceuticals as
    well as diverse bacterial communities. UWWTPs become hotspots of enriching antibiotic
    resistant bacteria (ARB) and spreading the antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) through
    different mechanisms such as selective pressures and horizontal gene transfer
    (Guo et al., 2017). Therefore, the use of reclaimed wastewater for irrigation
    poses a human health threat for acquiring of ARB and ARGs through the food chain.
    Soil and water in farming environments may further contribute to proliferation
    of ARB (Christou et al., 2017). In fact, exposure to ARB through the food chain
    and their isolation from irrigated agricultural soils have increasingly been reported
    (Rahman et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the risk of developing AR infections associated
    with the agricultural reuse of reclaimed urban wastewater is still unknown due
    to the gaps in quantitative ARB data in the food chain and ARB risk models. The
    application of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) in various agricultural
    scenarios, where crops were irrigated with reclaimed wastewater, related to enteric
    viruses and other pathogenic bacteria or parasites have been documented (Bailey
    and Sobsey, 2022). Nevertheless, the lack of microbial data collected at the point-of-use
    of these wastewater reuse fields increases the uncertainty associated with QMRA
    studies, and studies to estimate the health risk of agricultural workers is practically
    absent. Moreover, there is a significant gap in the assessment of risk and exposure
    to ARB due to the previous lack of models to quantify the human dose-response
    to such bacteria. In this regard, this gap was recently filled by a new approach
    to dose-response models for ARB reported by Chandrasekaran and Jiang (2019), which
    can predict the risk of illness as well as if it is treatable or not by antibiotic
    therapies based on a stochastic simple death process for a mixed population of
    antibiotic susceptible and resistant bacteria (common in environmental samples)
    and the presence of residual and sub-inhibitory antibiotics concentration (Chandrasekaran
    and Jiang, 2019). Nevertheless, this potentially useful ARB model framework has
    not yet been applied to risk assessment in an environmental scenario. With this
    backdrop, the aim of this study is to estimate the ARB infection risks for consumers
    and farmers associated with different reclaimed wastewater management scenarios
    for tomato irrigation in three greenhouses. Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli data
    collected from research fields were analyzed using the Simple-Death dose-response
    model for QMRA. The results demonstrated the relationship between the fraction
    of ARB and the risks of developing AR infection. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Risk scenarios for irrigation water and soil The risk assessment was performed
    based on the experimental data collected in a field study in intensive agriculture
    (Nahim-Granados et al., 2023). In this study, three family-based agricultural
    greenhouses for tomato cultivation by drip irrigation with RWW were monitored
    during a full cultivation cycle (ca. 7 months). These greenhouses were selected
    to represent risk scenarios associated with different management practices for
    reclaimed water. Briefly, irrigation water in Greenhouse 1 (G1) was used as directly
    received from the RWW distribution system of the water reclamation plant (chlorination
    treatment) without previous storage. Greenhouse 2 (G2) was irrigated with RWW
    after its storage in a secondary reservoir open to air for ca. 1 month. Storage
    of RWW is the most common practice to balance the treated effluent flow and irrigation
    needs. Finally, Greenhouse 3 (G3) was irrigated by a mixture of groundwater and
    RWW in a proportion of ca. 3:1 that was stored in a secondary reservoir. The risk
    characterization of the RWW was based on the concentrations of E. coli and AR-
    E. coli (resistance to cephalosporin and carbapenem class of antibiotics, see
    Table S1 for names and concentrations of antibiotics used in the inhibition test)
    collected from the irrigation (dropper) water. Pseudomonas spp. and AR-Pseudomonas
    (resistance to carbapenem class of antibiotic, Table S1) were collected from the
    soil samples in each greenhouse. Note that, in QMRA calculations, bacterial concentration
    that was reported as “non-detected” was replaced with the value of half of the
    quantification limit, a common strategy for managing “non-detected” results. 2.2.
    Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) QMRA was conducted based on
    the four main components outlined by the WHO (World Health Organization): (i)
    hazard identification; (ii) hazard characterization; (iii) exposure assessment;
    and (iv) risk characterization (WHO, 2021). A diagram illustrating the overall
    QMRA approach specific for this study is shown in Fig. S1. All calculations and
    algorithms were implemented using MATLAB version R2022b. Monte Carlo simulation
    was used to represent the propagation of variability and uncertainties through
    randomized selection of the distribution-based input parameters according to their
    probability distributions and generating output values by computation of 10,000
    iterations (or until attaining steady state distributions). 2.2.1. Hazard identification
    ARB poses a hazard to human health through a wide range of exposure sources and
    pathways. Nevertheless, consumer exposure to ARB contaminated vegetables (frequently
    associated with RWW irrigation) is a major concern due to the potential colonization
    of the human gastrointestinal tract and the possible ARG transfer to other bacteria
    strains or species in the human gastrointestinal tract (Hölzel et al., 2018).
    Among the different antibiotic resistant foodborne pathogens, AR-E. coli stands
    out as a major concern due to E. coli prevalence at high concentrations in the
    environment and the frequency of human exposures (Aiello et al., 2007). Besides
    E. coli, Pseudomonas spp. is a ubiquitous bacterium with the ability to colonize
    multiple niches due to its metabolic versatility and its broad adaptation to different
    conditions. Pseudomonas is commonly associated with eye infections, ear infections
    (swimmer''s ear), and hospital-acquired respiratory infections. Its ability to
    form biofilms can explain the wide persistence and detection of this species in
    soils and food-related products (Moradali et al., 2017; Allydice-Francis and Brown,
    2012). AR- E. coli and Pseudomonas, including carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas,
    have been reported in tomatoes (Obeng et al., 2018; Estepa et al., 2015). Therefore,
    both E. coli and Pseudomonas spp. are useful indicators for farm-related ARB.
    Human infection by ARB could lead to treatment failure and the imposition of additional
    health hazards that decrease the therapeutic options to treat the infection. In
    line with the potential indicators of foodborne ARB species mentioned above, 3rd
    generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas
    spp. are the most important threat to human health. They are included as ARB indicators
    by the European Commission as well as in the priority 1 (critical category) list
    of antibiotic resistant pathogens by the WHO, which consists of 12 bacteria considered
    to pose the greatest threat to human health (ECDC-EFSA-EMA, 2017; WHO, 2017).
    According to a recent report, cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and carbapenem-resistant
    Pseudomonas are responsive to ca. 300,000 and 62,000 annual infections and ca.
    9000 and 4000 deaths, respectively (Cassini et al., 2019). Tomato is considered
    a high-risk vegetable for pathogen contamination because it is frequently consumed
    raw, and bacteria are frequently detected in agricultural soils and on raw tomatoes
    (Remington et al., 1981). Potential internalization of the bacteria inside the
    fruit body further increases the human exposure risks (Hirneisen et al., 2012).
    Nevertheless, it is important to note that the risks associated with tomatoes
    are lower than for other vegetables which are closer to the contamination source
    or/and have higher surface area, such as leaves and root vegetables. Based on
    the above assessments, cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and carbapenem-resistant
    Pseudomonas were selected as the microbial hazards of this study. Human exposure
    through consumption of raw tomatoes contaminated by E. coli and through soil contact
    to Pseudomonas during agricultural practices were identified as the exposure pathways.
    In the QMRA model, only the risk of the 3rd generation cephalosporins-resistant
    E. coli was assessed, although all AR- E. coli isolates were also resistant to
    the 1st generation cephalosporins (i.e., cephalexin) antibiotic (Nahim-Granados
    et al., 2023). The 3rd generation cephalosporins antibiotic is more effective
    against gram-negative bacterial infections, thus resistance to this class of antibiotics
    has greater health implications. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) of
    E. coli responses to cefixime (a 3rd generation cephalosporin) was used to estimate
    the death rate in the presence of this antibiotic in the dose-response assessment
    (Section 2.2.2, supplementary information S1). The imipenem resistant Pseudomonas
    was used to represent Pseudomonas resistant to carbapenems class of antibiotic
    although the isolates were resistant to both imipenem and meropenem. Imipenem
    resistance seems to be a logical assumption for environmental Pseudomonas because
    the resistance is due to the loss of a substrate-specific outer membrane porin
    and the expression of a chromosomal β-lactamase. In comparison, meropenem resistance
    in Pseudomonas includes overexpression of multidrug efflux pumps and membrane
    permeability changes, which is less likely to occur in-vivo (Zhanel et al., 2007).
    The PK/PD of Pseudomonas responses to imipenem was used to estimate the death
    rate in the presence of this antibiotic in the dose-response assessment. 2.2.2.
    Hazard characterization (dose-response assessment) The hazard characterization
    involves the application of a dose-response model to quantify risks through exposure
    to both ARB and antibiotic-susceptible bacteria (ASB). A novel Simple-Death dose-response
    model previously reported by Chandrasekaran and Jiang (2019) was adopted to analyze
    the response of individual ARB and ASB in the presence of residual antibiotic
    concentrations. The model computes the total risk and predicts the health outcomes,
    i.e., if illness is treatable with antibiotics or not. The extinction of ARB indicates
    antibiotic treatable illness, while the survival and proliferation of ARB indicates
    antibiotic untreatable infection. The Simple-Death dose-response model can be
    expressed in the similar form as the classical exponential and beta-Poisson dose-response
    models with the best-fit parameters derived by Chandrasekaran and Jiang (2019).
    A summary of the models relevant to this study is presented in the supplementary
    information S1. The model parameters used in the model and sources are presented

    tomatoes Microbial contamination of vegetables during cultivation can occur through
    several different pathways (O''Flaherty et al., 2019). Irrigation water was considered
    as the contamination source in this QMRA study, where ASB and ARB concentrations
    of E. coli in irrigation water (Cw, CFU/100 mL, Nahim-Granados et al. 2023) were
    fitted with a non-parametric cumulative distribution function (CDF) curve. The
    probability of encountering specific ASB and ARB concentrations during tomato
    irrigation were generated by Monte Carlo random sampling of the CDF. Bacterial
    concentrations reported as below the detection limit of 1 CFU/100 mL were replaced
    with ½ of the detection limit. Since enterotoxigenic E. coli is only a fraction
    of total E. coli, we collected literature data of E. coli and those carrying the
    Shiga toxin gene (stx) in wastewater from eight Spanish wastewater treatment plants
    (Blanch et al., 2003; García-Aljaro et al., 2004). The amount of enterotoxigenic
    E. coli in the irrigation water was estimated using an additional Monte Carlo
    simulation based on their distributions (FE) in the wastewater (Blanch et al.,
    2003; García-Aljaro et al., 2004). To estimate the retention of irrigation water
    (W) on tomatoes, we adopted a value of 0.00016 mL/100 g previously reported by
    (Oron et al., 2015) and bound it by a triangular distribution between 0 and 0.0036
    (water retention measured for cucumbers) for uncertainty. The adoption of this
    low probability of vegetable-water contact in our specific scenario is to consider
    that: (1) surface drip irrigation applied in the study has a lower probability
    of water contact with plant than other methods such as spray irrigation, and (2)
    tomatoes as hydrophobic hanging fruits in the plant has a lower water contact
    rate than roots and leaves (Oron et al., 2015). The bacterial natural decay on
    tomato surfaces from the time of harvest to consumption was experimentally determined
    using a 3-day holding time, according to previous studies reporting that ca. 80%
    of the people store fresh vegetables more than 3 days before consumption (Jacxsens
    et al., 2015). For decay estimation, the tomatoes were submerged in isotonic water
    (0.9% NaCl w:v) spiked with E. coli for 5 min. The surface contaminated tomatoes
    were then split into two equal groups. For the first group, the bacteria were
    eluted from tomatoes and were analyzed by culture assay to determine the initial
    bacterial load (day 0). The same procedure was performed for the second group
    of tomatoes on day 3. The resulted 3-day holding decay (λh) was calculated as
    −1.02 ± 0.09 log CFU/100 g for E. coli. The reduction of the microbial contamination
    on tomatoes surfaces after home washing (λw) was according to a previous report;
    2.1 ± 0.33 log CFU/g reduction after 15 s was included in the computation of exposure
    (Kilonzo-Nthenge et al., 2006). Both inactivation rates were inserted into the
    model as normal distributions (Table 2). Since the recommendation of washing vegetables
    before consumption is not practiced by all consumers, the literature reported
    percent of people who wash vegetables at home prior to consumption (%wash = 84.7%)
    was also integrated in the exposure model (Barker et al., 2013). Table 2. Parameters

    average bodyweight for an adult (68.5 kg) (Brancato et al., 2019). Finally, the
    exposure dose of E. coli through consumption of RWW irrigated tomatoes can be
    calculated with: (1) All values and definitions of parameters used in the exposure
    models are listed in Table 2. 2.2.3.2. Hand-to-eye transfer of soil Several studies
    have indicated the concern for exposure and eye infection risk of Pseudomonas
    due to handling contaminated water or soil (Balfour-Lynn (2021). While newsworthy
    outbreaks of Pseudomonas often stem from eyedrops or contact lenses (U.S. Centers
    for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023), the CDC warns of potential risk from
    soil contact and transfer (CDC, 2019). Based on this concern and the high abundance
    of Pseudomonas in the greenhouse soils, we assessed the risk of human eye exposure
    to Pseudomonas in soil through hand-to-eye contact while working in the field.
    Eye exposure to Pseudomonas can result in severe eye infection or corneal ulceration.
    The corneal exposure model represents a very different infection risk from the
    tomato scenario, which focuses on field workers rather than consumers. According
    to Lawin-Brüssel et al. (1993), the beta-Poisson dose-response model fits best
    to the clinical data of Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced ocular infection. Therefore,
    Simple-Death dose-response in the form of beta-Poisson model dose-response was
    used for risk characterization. The hand-to-eye exposure for Pseudomonas is modelled
    after the hand-to-face model of Dean and Mitchell''s (2020). Briefly, the model
    integrates the concentration of bacteria in the soil ( , the soil adherence to
    the hands ( , the surface area of the fingertip ( , the transfer efficiency from
    finger to eye ( , and the number of transfers ( ) over a set exposure time ( ).
    The surface area of the fingertip used here is from measurements of the volar
    area of the index finger, and half of the mean surface area was used to represent
    the fingertip (Murai et al., 1997; Rusin et al., 2002). The transfer efficiency
    (Et) applied is from various studies of hand-to-face transfer, applying the efficiency
    from hand-to-lip membrane to exposures of both mouth and eye (Table 2). The number
    of transfers (TR, rate over time) is based on observations of face touching (both
    eye and mouth) and was halved for our study to represent eye touching only, per
    the findings of Nicas and Best (2008). As the identified dose-response model and
    causative agent of keratitis is known to be specifically P. aeruginosa, our empirical
    soil data for Pseudomonas spp. was attenuated in a similar fashion as the E. coli
    model for pathogenic portion of the bacteria. A ratio of P. aeruginosa to total
    Pseudomonas spp. (FP) was identified from treated wastewater effluent (Limayem
    et al., 2019) and included in our exposure model (Eq. (2)). All parameter values
    or empirical distributions for Monte Carlo sampling of Pseudomonas concentrations
    in soil are listed in Table 2. The equation combining these parameters (denoted
    above) to calculate the dose of eye exposure is: (2) 2.2.4. Risk characterization
    The probability of infection (P(d)) is calculated based on the dose for a single
    (one tomato meal per day) or one day (working in filed) exposure event, which
    is equivalent to the daily risk of infection. However, the common risk benchmark
    used by risk management agencies (i.e., EPA and WHO) is the annual infection risk
    (Pannual), a parameter that considers the risk of multiple exposures through several
    events in a year. This parameter is calculated according to the independence theorem
    previously reported (Eq. (3)) and computed using the Monte Carlo method (Haas
    et al., 2014). (3) Where P(d) is the distribution of the daily risk, the subscript
    i represents the ith iteration and N represents the total number of iterations,
    i.e., the number of exposure occasions per year. The number of meals that involves
    tomato consumption per year (N = 292) was estimated by dividing the total annual
    of tomatoes ingested in a year (15 kg/year) by the average serving size (M, 51.38
    g) (EC, 2022). Five days were used as the number of days that workers were exposed
    to soil contaminated by Pseudomonas during the first stage of the cultivation
    based on the information provided by the farmers and considering the worst scenario.
    All parameters for the risk assessment are listed below in Table 2. 3. Results

    Pseudomonas in greenhouse soil are shown in Fig. 1 with raw data presented in

    detection limit for measurements below the detection limit (Table S1) before Monte
    Carlo simulation. The AR- E. coli (red) and AR- Pseudomonas (green) concentrations

    and AR-E. coli, respectively; Blue and green represent total Pseudomonas and AR-Pseudomonas,
    respectively. Both the measured data and simulated concentrations span several
    orders of magnitude. The fraction of ARB ( ) was low in most of the cases: less
    than 0.20 in ca. 60 % of the data for Pseudomonas measured in soil, and less than
    0.20 in ca. 75 % of the data for E. coli in water. The simulated total bacteria
    and ARB concentrations were paired to provide for estimation of the extinction
    probability of ARB and ASB during infection, bounded at a maximum . The results
    of annual infection risk from E. coli through consumption of raw tomatoes are
    shown in Fig. 2. The quantitative risk is illustrated as the median with shaded
    areas for 50, 75, and 95 % confidence intervals for the 10,000 iterations as they
    change with the residual antibiotic concentration, . As expected, in the presence
    of the trace amounts of antibiotic in the body ( ), the overall risk of infection
    decreases, as the likely exposure dose is a mixture of both ASB and ARB. However,
    as illustrated by the change from black to red of the median risk line (Fig. 2),
    the infection outcome also changes from antibiotic treatable (black) to antibiotic
    untreatable (red). In other words, at higher sublethal antibiotic concentrations
    C, any bacteria that survive and go on to cause infection are more likely to be
    ARB. This is represented in all three greenhouse scenarios in Fig. 2. Download

    Median annual risk of enteropathogenic E. coli infection (solid line) through
    consumption of raw tomatoes irrigated with RWW for each of the three greenhouses.
    The 50, 75, and 95 % confidence intervals are shown as gray shaded areas from
    dark to light. The transition from black to red in the solid line indicates the
    transition of infection outcome from antibiotic treatable to antibiotic untreatable
    as the antibiotic concentration in human body varies from 0 to 0.3 mg/L. In general,
    the annual risk of infection values for all the greenhouses complies with the
    WHO/USEPA recommended level (< 10−4) highlighting the safe consumption of tomatoes
    irrigated with RWW. No significant differences in the annual risk of infection
    for greenhouses 2 and 3 were observed, while the annual risk of infection for
    the greenhouse 1 fell to 0 or near 0 for all simulations due to low detections
    of E. coli (Fig. 1) and far lower concentrations of pathogenic strains after inactivation.
    Similar results are illustrated in Fig. 3 for annual risk of severe eye infection
    (eye ulceration) due to exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the soil through
    hand-to-eye contact during farming. A low annual risk of eye-infection below 10−4
    with the median risk plateauing around 10−7 to 10−6 for C > 0 mg/L was observed.
    Again, the overall risk is the highest when C = 0, but as it is reduced by antibiotic,
    the infection is more likely to be untreatable by said antibiotic. The risk plateaued
    at antibiotic concentration ca. 0.05 mg/L which is much sooner than E. coli risk
    which plateaued at antibiotic concentration approaching ca. 0.2 mg/L, indicating
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa eye-infection through soil exposure is more sensitive to
    trace amounts of antibiotic in the human body and so more easily treated. Download

    of infection outcome from antibiotic treatable to untreatable as the antibiotic
    concentration in human body varies from 0 to 0.1 mg/L. 4. Discussion This QMRA
    study investigated two likely and unique scenarios of exposure to pathogens in
    RWW used to irrigate tomato crops in greenhouses. The outcomes of the study showed
    that annual infection risk for enteropathogenic E. coli was very low, less than
    10−9 in the absence of antibiotics, especially as compared with other QMRA studies
    for viral risks associated with consumption of RWW irrigated produce. This result
    suggests that RWW irrigation for tomatoes is within the acceptable risk threshold
    (< 10−4) if AR is not included into the consideration. Comparison of the risk
    outcomes from three greenhouses, each adopted a different RWW management practice,
    showed that G1 had the lowest risk because G1 had the lowest E. coli concentrations
    (Fig. 1). Although the irrigation water was originated from the same RWW, only
    G1 did not store the RWW in open ponds. The higher bacterial concentrations found
    in G2 and G3 irrigation water may be due to the regrowth of E. coli or recontamination
    of RWW by wildlife during storage in open ponds. This result indicates that direct
    application of RWW from treatment facility is the safest practice. Onsite storage
    can increase the bacterial concentration and therefore the risks. Moreover, the
    negative impact of storage was not completely diminished when blending the storage
    water with groundwater as shown in the case of G3. This comparison highlights
    the importance of considering water quality at point of end-use not only at the
    point of RWW discharge although the results obtained indicated an acceptable risk
    threshold for all three water management options. The higher risk outcomes reported
    in previous QMRA studies for consumption of vegetable irrigated with RWW are mainly
    focused on pathogenic human viruses (Gonzales-Gustavson et al., 2019; Mok et al.,
    2014). Human norovirus in RWW presented the highest risk for consumers with risk
    level at ca. for annual consumption of lettuce (Gonzales-Gustavson et al., 2019).
    Not only the concentration of the target pathogen plays a critical role in the
    risk outcome, but also the unique dose-response relationship that is applicable
    to each hazard is critically important. A much lesser dose of a virus, for example,
    could correlate with a higher probability of illness than an equal-or-greater
    dose of a bacteria. One example is the exponential dose-response model for enterovirus
    in which a dose of viruses represent a 50 % probability of response, while the
    same probability requires a dose of CFU E. coli (Cliver, 1981). Moreover, none
    of the previous QMRA studies used viral pathogen data measured directly in irrigation
    water. The viral pathogen concentrations were estimated using the viral concentration
    in the untreated wastewater with estimated pathogen reduction through engineering
    treatment processes and decay through water distribution (Hamilton et al., 2006).
    Using empirical data collected directly from irrigation water at the point-of-use,
    as carried out in the current study, represents the most creditable data of hazard
    concentration in QMRA. Another contribution of the higher risk estimations in
    previous QMRA studies is the type of fresh vegetable used in the exposure pathway
    analysis. The choice of vegetables that are consumed raw for possible contamination
    is apparent, with leafy greens, cucumber, and tomato being the most common. These
    vegetables differ in amount consumed per year, by region, and by age group, but
    one remarkably variable parameter is the amount of water holding for each respective
    vegetable. The reported value for water holding on lettuce leaves (mL/g) is 0.108,
    while for cucumbers it is around 0.0036 (Hamilton et al., 2006; Shuval et al.,
    1997), and for tomatoes it is estimated as 0.00016 (Oron et al., 2015). The ability
    of leafy vegetables to hold more water lends them to better transport pathogens
    from the farm to the consumer. The orders-of-magnitude difference in the mass
    of water holding per mass of vegetable is reflected in the reduction of risk for
    the smoother and highly hydrophobic surfaces of cucumber and tomato plants (this
    study), ultimately due to a large disparity in the final dose the consumer may
    be exposed (Mok et al., 2014). The Pseudomonas exposure model was conducted to
    highlight the possible health risks for workers in the greenhouses in addition
    to the consumers. Research in this area is significantly lacking in comparison
    with consumer-focused risk analysis. Farm workers can be exposed directly to pathogens
    in soil during planting, plant defoliation and secondary stems removal through
    the observed high rates of hand-to-soil and then hand-to-mouth contacts (Antwi-Agyei
    et al., 2016). The prevalence of Pseudomonas spp. and AR- Pseudomonas spp. in
    the greenhouse soil motivated the hand-to-eye model in this study for a severe
    eye infection (or eye ulceration) as endpoint. However, it is important to note
    that the Pseudomonas spp. and AR-Pseudomonas load detected in all three greenhouses
    cannot be only attributed to the water-soil transfer after irrigation with RWW.
    Manure of soils is a common practice in the intensive greenhouse agriculture and
    several studies reported the enrichment of Pseudomonas spp. and AR-Pseudomonas
    in soils after manure treatment even at higher concentrations that those detected
    in this study (Udikovic-Kolic et al., 2014; Riber et al., 2014). Therefore, the
    calculated risks for farmers include all sources of Pseudomonas spp. in soil and
    are not only those attributed to RWW irrigation. Although the outcomes of this
    analysis indicate higher annual risk probabilities to farmers/workers from soils
    than the consumer risk for tomato consumption in all three greenhouses, it is
    important to point out that conservative conditions which can overestimate the
    related risk were adopted in the soil risk scenario. These conditions include
    considering the maximum numbers of days per year with soil contact (5 days/year),
    and assuming no preventive measures such as handwashing or the use of Personal
    Protective Equipment (PPE) including gloves or eyes protection. Overall, the results
    indicate that eye infection risk from soil exposure does not have to be directly
    related to irrigation with RWW and that the overall risk can be drastically decreased
    if preventive measures like education/ training on hygiene and PPE are adopted.
    This study is the first application of the novel Simple-Death dose-response model
    to field data for assessing the risk of antibiotic resistant infections. This
    study demonstrates that while using this new type of dose-response models introduces
    new variables, it does not fundamentally change how a QMRA is conducted, yielding
    results comparable to that of a “traditional” exponential or beta-Poisson dose-response
    model (See Supplementary Information Fig. S2). The risk outcome (annual risk)
    is the same when there is no antibiotic present in the host body, results that
    validate the Simple-Death dose-response model. The development of infections that
    are untreatable by antibiotics depends on the trace level of antibiotic in the
    human host. There is a critical antibiotic concentration for the transition from
    a treatable to an untreatable infection and the critical antibiotic concentration
    for such transition varies from one pathogen to another. The trace level of antibiotic
    in human host could be from food, water, or past use of antibiotic for treatment
    of infection. There have not been reports of trace level of antibiotic in human
    body except the dose in the days following antibiotic treatment. The clinical
    study, however, suggests that antibiotics are rapidly clearing out after antibiotic
    therapy, but residual level of antibiotic has not been measured and cannot be
    discarded (Legrand et al., 2008). In this study, the antibiotic concentration
    C was varied at low concentrations to demonstrate its impact on the results. Therefore,
    the overall results of this study indicate that high concentration of pathogen
    exposure and high fraction of ARB increase the overall risk of infection, while
    the residual concentration of antibiotic in human system impact the transition
    from antibiotic treatable to antibiotic untreatable infection. 5. Conclusions
    A Simple-Death dose-response model for ARB was applied to two different exposure
    models for QMRA for the first-time using field data of E. coli, AR- E. coli, Pseudomonas
    and AR- Pseudomonas in water and soil collected from three greenhouses that adopted
    RWW for irrigation. The following conclusions are made based on the outcomes of
    this study: • The risk outcome (annual risk) from Simple-Death dose-response model
    yields the same results of a “traditional” exponential or beta-Poisson dose-response
    model when there is no antibiotic present in the host body. • The overall risks
    of E. coli infection through tomato consumptions are low and within the recommended
    values in all three greenhouses regardless of water management practices. • Onsite
    storage of RWW has the potential to increase the overall E. coli infection risk
    through consumption of tomatoes. • The development of antibiotic resistant infection
    is highly sensitive to the concentration of trace amount of antibiotics in human
    body and varies from one pathogen to another. Although the trace antibiotic concentration
    in human host can lower the overall infection risk, their presence significantly
    increases the risk of developing infections that are not treatable by antibiotic
    therapy. • Preventive/hygiene measures should be promoted among farmworkers to
    reduce the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant eye-infection. • The policy
    guidelines for water reuse in agriculture irrigation should include a new threshold
    of antibiotic resistant infections for better human health protection. CRediT

    science 1. Introduction Countries with arid climates tend to irrigate their croplands,
    but this requires the development of methods for restoring soil carbon restoration.
    To solve this problem, the multifunctional agricultural systems are simulated.
    Unlike field or laboratory studies, simulations enable researchers to minimize
    their resources and time costs. The drawback is that simulations can overlook
    some contributory factors. The insufficient database of practical research findings
    leads to inaccuracy. When simulating the recovery process of soil carbon, the
    entire carbon cycle must be considered. Carbon (C) is present in the biosphere
    in inorganic and inorganic forms, such as carbon dioxide and caustobioliths, respectively.
    In a simplified carbon cycle, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
    via photosynthesis as well as from water to produce organic matter. These plants
    are consumed by herbivorous animals, and herbivorous animals are in turn eaten
    by carnivores and humans. As heterotrophs carry out respiration, some amount of
    carbon dioxide cycles back into the atmosphere. The decomposition of dead plants
    and animal corpses by fungi and microorganisms also returns carbon into the atmosphere.
    Soil microorganisms and plant roots both participate in the soil respiration process,
    whereby they significantly increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the
    troposphere (Nekos et al., 2010). As carbon dioxide interacts with rocks, carbon
    becomes part of various minerals. It returns into the atmosphere through natural
    rock weathering; this is especially true for carbonate minerals and those enriched
    with organic matter (Muršec and Leveque, 2023). The concentration of carbon dioxide
    in the air increases due to human activities, such as fossil fuel combustion,
    transport operation, exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits, and more (Safranov,
    2022). Carbon plays a direct role in soil fertility, for humus is formed by the
    incomplete decomposition of biomass. Under the influence of bacteria and fungi,
    humus can break down into carbon dioxide and mineral compounds (Nekos et al.,
    2010). All of the above processes that cycle carbon between the air and the surface
    must be taken into account in the simulation. According to some researchers, the
    influence of the environment is extensive and complex, while the simulation models
    are too simplified; consequently, the results of the simulation and the actual
    experiment do not correspond to each other (Chen and Tian, 2007). Furthermore,
    some researchers highlight the need to investigate how soil carbon degradation
    can be prevented (Han and Li, 2018). The present study attempts to evaluate the
    impact of rationed irrigation on carbon recovery within the soil. In an attempt
    to systematize the body of simulation studies, some authors found that even though
    the comparison of multiple model structures yielded a wide range of soil organic
    carbon (SOC) projections, the existing experimental measurements of carbon dioxide
    fluxes and SOC were not sufficient to either eliminate or validate any of the
    individual model outcomes. Such uncertainties are justified by the lack of objective
    information on the multiple ways microbes and minerals interact (Tosi et al.,
    2022; Sulman et al., 2018). Therefore, more research in these areas is required.
    The research is imperative within the context of escalating climatic instability
    and increasing demand for agricultural products. Its significance lies in the
    necessity to devise effective irrigation strategies for countries with arid climates,
    ensuring not only high yields but also the preservation of soil carbon stock crucial
    for its fertility. The study also highlights the significance of employing contemporary
    simulation models, which enable efficient analysis of the impact of various factors
    on soil carbon dynamics. By identifying specific factors and their influence,
    irrigation strategies can be refined, ensuring sustainable agricultural practices
    in conditions of limited resources. Therefore, this research not only makes a
    significant contribution to the development of irrigation in arid climates but
    also underscores the importance of considering the carbon cycle for sustainable
    agricultural production. This study seeks to add to the solution by investigating
    the carbon cycle and changes in the soil carbon content in irrigated agricultural
    systems. The goal is to find out how compliance with irrigation norms affects
    changes in soil carbon concentration. The secondary objective is to assess the
    potential and possible limitations of the LPJ-GUESS models used for the said purpose.
    The objectives of the study are (1) To analyze the latest research on soil carbon
    dynamics in irrigated agriculture. (2) To identify the most successful methods
    for increasing soil carbon. (3) To simulate carbon dioxide fluxes in three different
    biomes. (4) And to compare simulation results with data from other researchers.
    The present findings can be used for irrigated agriculture planning and in land
    reclamation projects. 2. Methods and materials 2.1. Configuration of the modeling
    This study uses the dynamic ecosystem model (LPJ-GUESS Education 3.0) to simulate
    the response of agricultural vegetation to changes in air temperature, rainfall,
    solar radiation, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. The LPJ-GUESS Education
    3.0 model was employed to conduct simulations that account for aspects of water
    regime and irrigation. This is achieved through the following steps: 1. Parameterization:
    Users can define parameters related to the water regime, such as the intensity
    and distribution of irrigation, as well as other parameters influencing the water
    cycle, including initialization times and visible simulation phases. 2. Input
    of environmental data: Climate data, atmospheric CO2 concentration, atmospheric
    nitrogen deposition, and soil type are read from an environmental driver file.
    This file can represent climatic conditions at any point on Earth. 3. Environmental
    changes specification: Users can define environmental changes, such as temperature
    increases or CO2 concentration rises, to study their impact on the system. 4.
    Text file generation: After parameterization, the model generates a text file
    containing data for simulations, which is used to initiate dynamic simulations
    of carbon fluxes. 5. Carbon flux simulation: The model conducts simulations, taking
    into account the influence of the water regime and irrigation on carbon cycles
    in the system. Results include data on carbon balance in the soil, carbon fluxes
    in the ecosystem, and changes in carbon in plants. Such an approach allows investigation
    of how changes in the water environment and irrigation practices affect the dynamics
    of carbon exchange in agricultural systems using the LPJ-GUESS Education 3.0 model.
    The parameters of the LPJ-GUESS Education 3.0 model included simulation duration,
    temperature anomalies, CO2 concentrations, and irrigation rates for three different
    biomes. These parameters enable the consideration of contemporary climate changes
    and their impact on agricultural ecosystems, rendering the obtained results both
    high-quality and pertinent. LPJ-GUESS Education provides researchers with the
    ability to alter parameters in a manner that fits the purpose of the study. Users
    can specify the number of simulation years for the static (initialization) and
    transitional (visible) phases of the simulation in the Simulation protocol field.
    Note that the static scenario must be at least 500 years. The overall changes
    to environmental drivers (% or ppm) can also be proposed in the Anomalies field.
    Once the parameters are specified, LPJ-GUESS Education generates a text file with
    simulation data, which is then used to run dynamic simulations of carbon fluxes.
    This file is the environmental driver file. Before running a simulation, one must
    decide between the population simulation mode and the cohort simulation mode.
    This study seeks to investigate the carbon cycle and carbon accumulation in the
    soil. Therefore, results from the simulation encompass these processes only. The
    output folder contains data on carbon balance within the soil, carbon fluxes within
    the ecosystem, and patterns of plant carbon. 2.2. Selected areas and biomes Three
    irrigated land plots were chosen for the simulation, each located in a different
    ecosystem. The biomes included in the study were the desert (Republic of Kalmykia),
    the semi-desert (Republic of Kalmykia), and the steppe (Saratov region). The selected
    biomes demonstrate significant sensitivity to the water regime and replicate various
    agro-climatic conditions, thereby providing the research with a broad applicability
    range and extending its suitability for practical implementation in the domain
    of water resource management in agriculture. This study analyzes the experience
    of more than ten scientific institutions. Among them are educational institutions,
    such as the Kazakh National Agrarian Research University, the Auburn University,
    the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Hainan University,
    the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, and the Arunachal University
    of Studies. The theoretical framework also includes research by the following
    organizations: the US Department of Agriculture; the Key Laboratory of Agro-Forestry
    Environmental Processes and Ecological Regulation of Hainan Province; the Helmholtz
    Center for Environmental Research (Germany); the Volgograd Branch of the Russian
    Federal Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO); the Kostychev
    Agrotechnological University (Ryazan); All-Russian Research Institute of Feeds;
    All-Russian Research Institute of Agricultural Mechanization; Federal Scientific
    Center of Agroecology, Integrated Land Reclamation and Protective Afforestation;
    and the Institute of Irrigated Agriculture (National Academy of Sciences, Ukraine).
    Here, the simulation process consisted of a 500-year static phase followed by
    a 10-year transitional phase. In view of global warming, the following anomalies
    were proposed: a 1 °C increase in temperature and a 100-ppm increase in atmospheric
    carbon dioxide concentration. The irrigation norms for each area were taken as
    precipitation anomalies; they were distributed equally between the summer months.
    The irrigation rates were 150 mm (steppe), 500 mm (semi-deserts), and 700 mm (deserts)
    (Parfenova et al., 2001). The selection of temperature anomalies (+1 °C) and CO2
    concentrations (+100 ppm) is justified by their relevance in the context of global
    climate change. This approach allows for the consideration of actual warming trends
    and the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations that impact agro-ecosystems.
    The chosen anomalies reflect contemporary challenges and help elucidate the potential
    consequences of climate change on carbon exchange in different biomes. 2.3. Data
    analysis methodology The data analysis process builds on the usage of the analogy
    method. The variations of carbon in the wild-growing boreal summer grasses were
    projected onto crops. Additionally, a correlation regression analysis was conducted
    for the dynamics of carbon balance in the modeled agroecosystems. 2.4. Limitations
    The study is confined to three selected biomes (desert, semi-desert, steppe) and
    specific geographic regions in Russia. The findings may be specific to these regions
    and may not fully represent other agro-climatic conditions. 3. Results The carbon
    balance of the ecosystem or its components can be either positive or negative,
    and sometimes carbon neutrality is reported. Carbon positive means that carbon
    entered the system, and carbon negative means that it has gone. Carbon neutrality
    refers to an equal balance between the carbon that enters the system and how much
    is removed from it. The augmentation of soil carbon is crucial for agriculture
    and sustainable development, as it promotes enhanced fertility and quality of
    soils. Carbon serves as a key component of organic matter and humus, which improves
    soil structure, ensures moisture and nutrient retention, and enhances its permeability
    to water. However, the reduction in carbon exchange can pose a problem, as this
    process determines the efficiency of photosynthesis and plant growth. This can
    lead to decreased crop yields and impact agricultural productivity. Additionally,
    decreased carbon exchange can affect ecosystem services and the stability of agro-ecosystems.
    Thus, managing these processes becomes a key task for achieving a balance between
    practical benefits and potential challenges that may arise in agriculture. LPJ-GUESS
    simulated irrigated fields sheltered by native tree species (boreal deciduous
    trees, temperate broadleaf trees, and evergreen coniferous trees) as well as the
    boreal summer grass cover. The latter refers to an area of the ground surface
    covered by herbaceous vegetation native to the temperate regions of the Northern
    Hemisphere, which grow during the warm season. This study draws an analogy between
    boreal grasses and crops. Yet, it is worth noting that wild-growing plant species
    have higher tolerance for changes in environmental drivers compared to cultivars,
    as well as higher resistance to diseases and pests. The 500-year static phase
    (initialization) is for the system to reach the state of balance; therefore, it
    will be ignored. This study analyzes data from the 10-year transition period.
    The results of the simulation for the desert biome show a slight increase in soil
    carbon accumulation, from 0.23 to 0.25 kg C/m2/year, likely caused by the soil
    microorganisms being more active during irrigation. The amount of carbon in the
    ecosystem carbon exchange first increased by 0.01 kg C/m2/year and then hit a
    negative value of −0.21 kg C/m2/year as the simulation ended. The likely reason
    for this dramatic change could be that the carbon accumulated in the soil did
    not move through the carbon cycle and that the plants in the area were less active
    under high summer temperatures. The boreal grass cover was found to be carbon-positive
    throughout the entire simulation period, ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 kg C/m2. Finally,
    the amount of carbon in boreal deciduous trees ranged from 1.3 to 2.2 kg C/m2.
    In general, the standard irrigation process would be suitable for this biome.
    As for the semi-desert biome, the soil carbon accumulation has increased from
    0.28 to 0.3 kg C/m2/year. The ecosystem carbon exchange dropped from 0.07 to −0.08
    kg C/m2/year. The reasons for this variation are similar to those of the desert
    biome. The carbon content of the boreal grass cover increased rapidly from 0.1
    to 0.2 kg C/m2, and that of the temperate broadleaf tree cover increased slightly
    in comparison, shifting from 0.001 to 0.02 kg C/m2. The steppe biome had a positive
    carbon balance within the soil (0.28 kg C/m2/year), which increased slightly throughout
    the simulation period, reaching 0.29 kg C/m2/year. The ecosystem carbon exchange
    decreased from 0.02 to −0.02 kg C/m2/year; the reasons are similar to those of
    other biomes. Results also show a slight increase in the carbon accumulation rates:
    from 0.1 to 0.15 kg C/m2, boreal grass cover; from 1.2 to 1.7 kg C/m2, evergreen
    coniferous tree cover; from 0.7 to 1.0 kg C/m2, temperate deciduous tree cover.
    Fig. 1 shows a comparison of soil carbon levels and their dynamics across biomes.
    As can be seen, there is an upward trend of carbon accumulation. The semi-desert
    and steppe biomes are very similar in this regard, whereas the desert biome shows
    the smallest increase in the rate of soil carbon accumulation, which may be due
    to high summer temperatures affecting the soil-forming microorganisms. Download

    Dynamics of carbon balance in simulated agroecosystem soils. In the conducted
    correlation-regression analysis, the significance level is R = 1 for different
    biomes, indicating that the model accurately describes the available data. Fig.
    2 shows a comparison of ecosystem carbon exchange dynamics. The models simulated
    a negative shift for all three biomes; the rate of decrease correlated with the
    stability of the ecosystem. The highest estimates of the ecosystem carbon exchange
    were simulated for the steppe biome, most likely because this biome has the highest
    biodiversity among the three. The main argument in support of this assumption
    is that the desert biome had the lowest ecosystem carbon exchange. Download :

    is important to note that the obtained coefficients of determination (R) are equal
    to 1, indicating that the model precisely describes the data. Fig. 3 shows the
    dynamic carbon balances of the boreal grass cover. All simulated biomes demonstrated
    an increase in the carbon balance, but the semi-desert biome stands out with an
    extremely high increment. Presumably, this biome had the most favorable relationship
    with environmental drivers. As confirmation, the coefficients of determination
    (R) are equal to 1, indicating that the model perfectly aligns with the data and
    can accurately predict observed values. Download : Download high-res image (122KB)

    summer grass cover in simulated agroecosystems. The causes of changes in carbon
    balance may encompass the influence of temperature conditions, uneven distribution
    of moisture, seasonal variations, nutrient deficiencies, as well as alterations
    in gas emissions. Factors contributing to increased soil carbon include plant
    decomposition and species, zonal belts, biological activity, natural recycling
    processes, plant carbon utilization, and cultivation of perennial herbaceous plants.
    The current simulations follow the irrigation norms for agricultural lands. The
    idea is that these norms ensure a favorable environment for plants and soil-forming
    microorganisms. To achieve the best environmental and economic results possible,
    the simulation was based on the lowest permissible norms. The effect turned out
    to be positive, increasing the soil carbon storage and enhancing the growth of
    the boreal grass cover. This study, employing the LPJ-GUESS Education 3.0, model,
    thoroughly examines the impact of irrigation levels on carbon exchange in the
    desert, semi-desert, and steppe biomes of Russia. By analogy, the obtained results
    indicate a positive effect of irrigation use in these agroecosystems, increasing
    carbon accumulation in the soil. Modeling results underscore the significance
    of the water regime in supporting ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, this study
    contributes a novel insight into ecological science by presenting a meticulous
    analysis of the impact of irrigation levels on carbon exchange in various biomes,
    specifically deserts, semi-deserts, and steppes. The primary discoveries and contributions
    can be outlined as follows: 1. Optimization of irrigation for different biomes:
    The research indicates the effectiveness of developed irrigation levels for deserts,
    semi-deserts, and steppes, leading to increased carbon accumulation in the soil.
    This innovative discovery could inform recommendations for optimal water resource
    utilization in the agricultural sector. 2. Expansion of data for agroecosystems:
    The study utilizes expanded data and the LPJ-GUESS Education 3.0 model to simulate
    the impact of irrigation on agricultural ecosystems in different climatic conditions.
    This aids in broadening the understanding of carbon exchange processes and the
    interaction of water regimes with the soil. 3. Consideration of comprehensive
    impact: The research takes into account the entire carbon cycle in agroecosystems,
    including carbon exchange processes, accumulation in the soil, and within the
    ecosystem. This is crucial for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the ecological
    implications of irrigation in different biomes. These findings expand the understanding
    of water regimes in agricultural systems and may play a key role in shaping strategies
    for sustainable water resource utilization in agriculture. Additionally, the obtained
    results corroborate the positive impact of increased soil carbon on agriculture,
    particularly in irrigated areas. Developing optimal irrigation strategies and
    considering carbon exchange can contribute to increased yields and ecological
    resilience of agricultural lands. The research data open up prospects for sustainable
    development and optimization of resource utilization in irrigated agriculture.
    4. Discussion The 10-year simulation with specific irrigation rates demonstrated
    carbon accumulation within the soil and an increase in plant biomass. Similar
    results were obtained in the Volgograd region, where researchers achieved arable
    land productivity of 11.0–13.0 units per hectare in the crop-rotation system without
    using fertilizers (Melikhova et al., 2016; Khasanov et al., 2020a). Some other
    researchers found that soybeans grown in the same region can yield 3.05 t/ha and
    5 t/ha when irrigated using sprinklers and drip irrigation systems, respectively
    (Borodychev, 2016). Artificial irrigation was calculated to have a positive effect
    on the humus condition of soil in the steppe zone of Ukraine. The negative humus
    balance was observed under non-irrigated conditions and amounted to 0.56 t/ha.
    Under irrigated conditions, this indicator decreased by 57.1 % to 0.24 t/ha. The
    factors that were taken into account during the calculation process include but
    are not limited to, precipitation, irrigation rates, water uptake by plants, soil
    surface moisture, water movement between soil horizons, and groundwater/surface
    water interaction (Vozhegova et al., 2016). Treated wastewater can also be used
    for irrigation, as shown by around 50 countries in the world (Khilchevsky, 2021).
    Many researchers across the world investigated soil carbon recovery. According
    to their findings, soils in arid and semi-arid regions are prone to organic and
    inorganic soil carbon mineralization, which causes land degradation and desertification
    (Yin et al., 2011). Around 92 % of the world''s inorganic carbon is present in
    arid and semi-arid regions. In northwest China, soil inorganic carbon (SIC) pools
    are 2–5 times larger compared to organic carbon (SOC) stocks (Yin et al., 2011).
    The likely explanation is that the SOC content is indirectly affected by the physicochemical
    properties of the soil (Su et al., 2020). In particular, the lack of soil moisture
    and unfavorable physical and chemical conditions limit the activity of microorganisms,
    keeping the SOC content of cultivated lands low. The rate of SIC accumulation
    would be high in these conditions (Yin et al., 2011). A three-year experimental
    study of carbon dioxide exchange in irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems
    found an increase in litter-C pools (including roots, stalks, leaves, and cobs)
    at irrigated continuous maize sites and in the irrigated maize-soybean rotation
    (by 230 and 200 g C m−2 year−1, respectively). The future soil carbon balance
    in these systems was reported to depend on the fate of carbon in these accumulating
    litter pools (Verma et al., 2005). More significant differences in SOC accumulation
    between rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems were detected in Colorado.
    Specifically, carbon accumulation rates were about three times higher in the irrigated
    system (Saito et al., 2023; Giannini et al., 2023; Mosier et al., 2005). Another
    experiment was devoted to measuring humus building efficiency. As reported, the
    carbon of plant material had a half-life between 39 and 54 days, animal manure
    had a half-life that ranged from 37 to 169 days, and for sewage sludge, the half-life
    was 39–330 days. At the same time, all mature substrates and animal feces demonstrated
    a higher humus-building efficiency compared to plant materials except fine roots
    (Gasser et al., 2021). Organic fertilizers cannot be used in large quantities.
    The same applies to mineral fertilizers and lime which farmers utilize to accelerate
    soil reclamation. The main task of farmers is to maximize profits from fertilizers
    while minimizing the negative impact on soil and groundwater (Ilves et al., 2020).
    In Poland, farmers are required to prepare a fertilization plan under the Nitrate
    Directive, which aims to protect waters from nitrates from agricultural sources.
    One of its provisions sets the upper limits for the amount of fertilizers that
    can be applied at 170 kg per hectare. These restrictions help to reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions (Acosta-Martinez et al., 2023; Syp et al., 2021). Thus, environmental
    requirements act as a factor affecting soil carbon accumulation. Some researchers
    argue that for a more accurate simulation of soil carbon accumulation, the following
    must be taken into account: SOC fractions in fresh residues (Hong et al., 2021),
    air temperature and precipitation (Bolinder et al., 2012), and plant carbon input
    rate (Guo et al., 2006; Khasanov et al., 2020b). The SOC cycling in the topsoil
    can be simulated using the RothC model. The inputs of this model include monthly
    precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (mm); average temperature (°C);
    clay content (%), DPM/RPM ratio; degree of soil cover (bare or vegetated); monthly
    crop carbon inputs from crop residues (t C ha−1); monthly manure inputs (t C ha−1);
    and thickness of the soil layer (cm). The RothC model was run to simulate the
    turnover of organic carbon in both surface and subsurface soil layers. With its
    help, scientists discovered different patterns of SOC accumulation. Specifically,
    the application of manure at sites representing a semi-arid climate was reported
    to cause the SOC content to grow, as seen in India (Emde et al., 2021; Bhattacharyya
    et al., 2013). Another researcher found SOC accumulation under cover crop and
    catch crop residues (Autret, 2017). A similar outcome was reported by a meta-analysis
    (Sulman et al., 2018). A simulation study by Russell and Mohan Kumar (2019) was
    rather interesting. They found that agricultural systems without trees had higher
    carbon storage that did not require spending money on fertilizers or irrigation
    (Russell and Mohan Kumar, 2019). In this study, simulation models do not take
    artificial fertilization into account; here, the accumulation of soil carbon is
    due to dead plant decomposition. This method for boosting fertility was reported
    effective by other researchers. For instance, Baeva (2018) found that converting
    arable lands into fallow lands initiates the natural succession process, which
    intensifies the accumulation of organic carbon. The highest concentration of soil
    carbon was detected in the upper soil layer within a depth of 10 cm (Baeva, 2018).
    Another study reported the positive impact of perennial grasses on organic carbon
    content within the soil. The study in point suggested filling organic fertilizers
    with crop stubble and root residue. A four-year experiment conducted on soddy–podzolic
    sandy loamy soils under perennial grasses revealed a 0.1 % increase in the humus
    content, mainly in the arable layer. The assumed cause was the presence of root
    residues in the upper soil layers, which the soil biota converted into organic
    matter (Gurina et al., 2014). Similar observations were made in the Central Chernozem
    region, the North Caucasus, and the Volga region where humus reserves under perennial
    grasses increased to 0.06 kg/m2 (Trofimova, 2017). Irrigation and plant decomposition
    are not the only factors that increase the soil carbon gain; shelterbelts also
    matter. According to the study conducted in the Kamennaya steppe (Voronezh region),
    shelterbelts reduce the intensity of drought by creating a favorable microclimate
    (Bobylev, 2005). Other benefits include, but are not limited to, water retention,
    reduced wind erosion, biodiversity conservation, and higher soil fertility. Another
    evidence to support the positive impact of shelterbelts on soil fertility in irrigated
    areas is that the average grain yield near shelterbelts is higher by 34 % compared
    to control plots (Ruleva and Ovechko, 2017). The results of this study coincide
    with studies that had similar climatic conditions. The models used here, however,
    had their limitations: (1) the simulation of the carbon cycle only took into account
    the interaction of wild vegetation, and (2) the organic and inorganic forms of
    soil carbon were not examined separately. In addition, the simulation began with
    the year 1992, with the initialization phase being 500 years, which means that
    the 10-year period under analysis falls between 2492 and 2502. The simulation
    algorithms, however, correspond to processes that occur at the present time; therefore,
    the first limitation can be ignored. If the current climate changes persist at
    their pace, then in ten years, similar results can be detected in the biomes under
    consideration, provided that adequate irrigation is provided and that enough stubble
    and root residues decompose. The shelterbelts should also be kept intact. The
    conducted study using the dynamic model LPJ-GUESS Education 3.0 to simulate the
    impact of irrigation on vegetation in arid biomes provides important insights
    into ecosystem responses to changes in internal and external factors. The analysis
    results indicate that, despite the high temperatures in the desert and semi-desert,
    irrigation contributes to a slight increase in carbon accumulation in the soil.
    However, a significant deviation in ecosystem carbon exchange has proven to be
    crucial, possibly linked to the peculiarities of plant functioning under the influence
    of summer temperatures. The analysis of biomes indicates variations in vegetation
    responses to irrigation. In the steppe, there is observed a positive increase
    in the natural carbon balance in the soil, indicating the high productivity of
    this biome. On the other hand, in the desert, where the smallest change in the
    carbon balance occurs, the highest summer temperatures might have the most significant
    impact. The positive effect of irrigation identified in the desert and semi-desert
    may be associated with increased soil microbial activity and improved conditions
    for plant photosynthesis. In the steppe, a positive carbon balance is observed,
    which may be attributed to high biodiversity and more efficient carbon exchange.
    Temperature conditions play a crucial role in regulating the efficiency of irrigation.
    An increase in summer temperatures in the desert and semi-desert may lead to less
    effective carbon exchange and plant activity. Conversely, in the steppe, where
    temperature may be a less limiting factor, the irrigation effect appears more
    favorable. The importance of considering biodiversity is evident in the steppe,
    where high diversity contributes to more efficient carbon exchange. The application
    of minimal irrigation rates confirms the effectiveness of rational water use for
    preserving soil carbon balance and promoting plant growth. Finally, the static
    initialization phase is crucial and should be considered when analyzing the long-term
    effects of irrigation. Considering these factors helps understand the complex
    relationships between climate change, irrigation, and biological processes, contributing
    to a better understanding of sustainable development in arid ecosystems. It is
    complicated to compare the results of this study with previous research. The dynamics
    of the carbon balance reflect the total amount of carbon in the soil without dividing
    it into inorganic and organic carbon. Yet, only the latter is actively involved
    in soil fertility formation. The growth of plant biomass may be indicative of
    an increase in organic carbon content within the soil. Future research can analyze
    the key drivers behind the simulated increase in the soil carbon content. 5. Conclusions
    Results from the LPJ-GUESS simulation are presented for three different biomes:
    desert, semi-desert, and steppe. Carbon accrual rates in semi-desert (0.3 kg C/m2/year)
    and steppe (0.29 kg C/m2/year) biomes were similar. The desert biome had the smallest
    carbon gain (0.25 kg C/m2/year). Results also show a decrease in the ecosystem
    carbon exchange for all biomes: desert, −0.21 kg C/m2/year; semi-desert, −0.08
    kg C/m2/year; steppe, −0.02 kg C/m2/year. The accumulation rates of carbon for
    boreal grass cover were found to increase from 0.1 to 0. 2 kg C/m2 in the desert
    biome and from 0.1 to 0.2 kg C/m2 in the semi-desert biome; for the steppe biome,
    it increased from 0.1 to 0.15 kg C/m2. Carbon accumulation for boreal deciduous
    tree cover became higher over the past 10 years, reaching the following values:
    desert, 2.2 kg C/m2; semi-desert, 0.02 kg C/m2; steppe, 1 kg C/m2. As for the
    evergreen coniferous cover, the increase in the carbon accumulation rates was
    as follows: the carbon accrual rate of the steppe soil increased from 1.2 to 1.7
    kg C/m2. These findings suggest that irrigation rates developed for desert, semi-desert,
    and steppe biomes were effective. An increase in the SOC content was due to the
    impact of shelterbelts and dead plant decomposition. The results of this study
    portray the carbon cycle under the current climate change conditions and thus
    can be useful in agricultural management and food security projects. The present
    findings can be applied in irrigated and rainfed agriculture. Specifically, farmers
    may improve the productivity of irrigated lands in three different ways: through
    compliance with irrigation norms, by planting shelterbelts to provide water retention
    and a favorable microclimate, and by converting arable lands to fallow lands to
    restore fertility. Future research directions may involve expanding the investigation
    to other regions and biomes to obtain more universal results that account for
    the diversity of climatic and geographic conditions. Funding The authors received

  description: The significance of large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) to climate
    science, water resources management, flood routing, irreversible desertification,
    and crop yield is not in dispute. Current large-scale ET models combine empirical
    formulations with a suite of remotely sensed data products that include meteorological
    variables, vegetation indices and/or soil moisture. In recent years, solar-induced
    chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been proposed as an indicator of photosynthetic
    activity but its potential to constrain transpiration (Tr) or ET remains under-explored
    and frames the scope here. A large-scale terrestrial ET model driven by SIF is
    developed based on leaf water‑carbon exchange complemented with an outcome for
    intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration derived from optimality theory for
    stomatal conductance. The model parameters are first calibrated across FLUXNET
    sites and then extrapolated globally using their dependence on climatic variables
    and plant functional types. The model, hereafter referred to as ETSIF, requires
    SIF data, leaf area index, land use type, and basic meteorological variables that
    include net radiation, air temperature and relative humidity. Global ETSIF estimates
    computed on a 4-day window for the period spanning 2003 to 2018 was 625 mm yr−1
    in general agreement with other independent global ET estimates, but discrepancy
    in the spatial distribution still exists implying that global ET estimation remains
    subject to large uncertainty. ETSIF exhibited a tantalizing positive trend over
    the same period but this trend was not statistically significant. One of the major
    advantages of this new approach, is that the model requires few parameters, reduce
    the parameterization of stomatal conductance and can be immediately used to constrain
    spatially extended ET estimates.

    A novel approach using SIF and carbon-water relations is developed to model evapotranspiration.
    • The developed model does not need to parameterize stomatal conductance. • The
    developed model has very simple model structure. • The work provides the first
    global evapotranspiration estimates driven by SIF. Abstract The significance of

    hydrological cycle 1. Introduction Evapotranspiration (ET) is the main terrestrial
    pathway by which precipitation is recycled back to the atmosphere. The significance
    of this water flux in regulating the climate system has been recognized since
    the late 1970s (Eagleson, 1981) and much recent attention is focused on its interaction
    with the terrestrial carbon cycle (Jung et al., 2010). Because of the large latent
    heat of vaporization value of water, the ET cooling effects also regulate land-surface
    and near-surface air temperatures (Oki and Kanae, 2006; Gentine et al., 2010,
    Gentine et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2020). Estimates of global ET are required
    for assessing shifts in the hydrological cycle, drought monitoring (McEvoy et
    al., 2016), and climate change model evaluation. Unsurprisingly, estimating ET
    at spatially extended scales using remote sensing products continues to receive
    research interest (e.g., Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Su, 2002; Mu et al., 2007,
    Mu et al., 2011; Yuan et al., 2010; Martens et al., 2017). Barriers to estimating
    ET at such large spatial scales include difficulties in capturing heterogeneity
    in soil-vegetation activity and the complex interactive effects of biochemical
    and biophysical processes regulating transpiration (Tr). Prior remote sensing-based
    approaches to estimating ET at global scales fall into two broad categories: (i)
    meteorologically based semi-empirical methods and (ii) surface energy balance
    residual methods. The meteorologically based methods employ a Penman equation
    (Penman, 1948) or variants such as the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation (Monteith,
    1965) or a Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation (Priestley and Taylor, 1972) to estimate
    global ET using remotely-sensed vegetation properties, meteorological conditions,
    near-surface soil water content, among other variables. Mu et al., 2007, Mu et
    al., 2011 produced a widely used global ET dataset (i.e., MOD16) employing the
    PM equation, yet in this approach, the stomatal conductance must be parameterized
    leading to uncertainties in the retrieval. Fisher et al. (2008) modified the PT
    eq. (PT-JPL) and partitioned ET into three components: evaporation from the soil
    or forest floor, evaporation of canopy intercepted water, and transpiration Tr.
    These methods are subject to uncertainties given the difficulty in representing
    these processes, especially Tr. Another limitation encountered by these models
    is their ability to reproduce the hysteresis response of ET to radiation load
    or vapor pressure deficit variation (Zhang et al., 2014c; Lin et al., 2019; Wan
    et al., 2023). To overcome some of these issues, Yang et al. (2013) used the water
    - carbon gas exchange relation at the leaf level to link leaf transpiration to
    photosynthesis, though uncertainties in describing carbon fluxes and their bridge
    to water fluxes remain. The energy balance residual methods also gained attention
    because of their simplicity as in the SEBS model (Su, 2002), SEBAL (Bastiaanssen
    et al., 1998), and other multiple water sources models (e.g., two sources - TSEB,
    Norman et al., 1995; three sources - 3SEB, Burchard-Levine et al., 2022). Such
    energy balance residual methods are sensitive to estimates of land-surface temperature
    and air temperature given that their differential value drives sensible heat fluxes
    (Zhang et al., 2016b). Moreover, accurate parameterizations do require turbulent
    flow statistics rarely available at large scales (Katul et al., 1998). Solar-Induced
    chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) provides a novel way of monitoring large-scale
    photosynthetic vegetation activity (Sun et al., 2023). Since stomata regulate
    leaf gas exchange of carbon dioxide and water vapor with the atmosphere, SIF offers
    a promising way to indirectly infer Tr, framing the scope here. Plants utilize
    absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) for photosynthetic activities
    and dissipate the excessive radiation through non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)
    processes, and the remaining unexploited APAR in the 400–700 nm spectral range
    is re-emitted by chlorophyll molecules at longer wavelengths, which is known as
    solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (or SIF). As such, SIF contains key information
    on plants'' photosynthetic activities (Sun et al., 2023) that shows great potentials
    to constrain Tr. SIF has already been widely used to reconstruct large-scale photosynthesis
    (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2015; Yoshida et al., 2015; Zhang et al.,
    2016a) after Guanter Palomar (2006) performed the first space-based SIF retrieval.
    From then on, several satellite projects have been launched with equipment allowing
    for SIF retrievals on board such as the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT)
    (Hamazaki et al., 2005; Guanter et al., 2012) and GOSAT2 (Imasu et al., 2023)
    missions, Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) (Joiner et al., 2013),
    Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) (Frankenberg et al., 2014) and OCO-3 (Taylor
    et al., 2020), and TROPOMI (the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) (Köhler et
    al., 2018), among others. Because SIF can reflect plants'' activity, the observed
    remotely sensed SIF has the potential to constrain large-scale Tr, and thus ET
    as transpiration is usually the largest fraction of ET, without extensive data
    needs for meteorological variables and vegetation conditions and their empirical
    calibrations. The accuracy of the corresponding Tr and ET logically depends on
    the quality of remote sensing SIF retrievals. A handful of prior studies already
    used SIF to model ET empirically. Alemohammad et al. (2017) showed that SIF observations
    could be used to constrain variations in ET; Damm et al. (2018) found a non-linear
    relation between ET and SIF while other studies also found that the radiation
    and meteorological conditions such as Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR),
    Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), and Air Temperature (Ta) impact the empirical relation
    between ET and SIF (e.g., Lu et al., 2018); other studies applied the Penman-Monteith
    equation by parameterizing canopy conductance (or resistance) using SIF and reported
    good performance in ET modelling (e.g., Shan et al., 2019; Damm et al., 2021).
    Utilizing the photosynthetic information contained in SIF products at FLUXNET
    sites, a method based on water‑carbon relations was earlier proposed to estimate
    ET and tested across these sites (Zhou et al., 2022). In particular, the transpiration-SIF
    relation was improved when scaled by VPD. The key advantage of the aforementioned
    model is that it does not require explicit accounting for stomatal conductance.
    The model reliably reproduced site-level ET when complemented with a soil evaporation
    model across all land use types. Expanding on this work, the aim here is to (1)
    determine the ET-SIF model parameters at FLUXNET sites; (2) derive global distributions
    of the model parameters using their dependences on climatic properties and land
    use types as derived from FLUXNET analysis; (3) use the outcomes in (1) and (2)
    to produce a first global terrestrial ET dataset using SIF. Comparison with other
    global ET products are also discussed at annual and seasonal time scales. It is
    to be underscored that sublimation over snow and ice and open-water evaporation
    were not incorporated. 2. Data and method 2.1. Model description of ET using remotely
    sensed SIF The ET model proposed here considers three components: Transpiration,
    Tr, soil evaporation Es and canopy intercepted water evaporation Ei (ET = Tr +
    Es + Ei). For simplicity, the ecosystem is assumed to be well coupled with the
    atmosphere and the water flux from leaves, soil surface and wet canopy are treated
    as total evapotranspiration. The three components Tr, Es and Ei are modeled separately
    but only Tr, the dominant term in ET, is linked with remotely sensed SIF. The
    Tr model is based on water‑carbon relations and commences by linking gross primary
    productivity (GPP) to SIF linearly (Zhang et al., 2014a; Zhang et al., 2016b;
    Guanter et al., 2014) as, (1) where is a vegetation specific parameter that relates
    GPP (μmol m−2 s−1) to SIF (mW m−2 nm−1 sr−1), (μmol m−2 s−1) is an intercept to
    be determined. Though some studies adopted a nonlinear relation between GPP and
    SIF (e.g., Guanter et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2018; Gu et al., 2019), we found
    no discernible difference in the model accuracy for ET when using a more complicated
    model structure (e.g., Guan et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2019) when compared to a
    linear one as shown in prior studies (Zhou et al., 2022). Therefore, the linear
    form in Eq. (1) is adopted throughout to describe the relation between GPP and
    SIF at all FLUXNET sites. A plausibility argument for Eq. (1) is that the GPP
    - SIF relation should be close to linear at large spatial scales and over extended
    (e.g., 4 day in this study) time intervals due to inherent space-time averaging
    that ‘smooths-out’ nonlinearities (Zhang et al., 2014a; Gu et al., 2019). To describe
    plant photosynthesis at the canopy scale (presumed to approximate GPP), carbon
    dioxide supply from the atmosphere to the canopy is assumed to be described by
    a Fickian diffusion that is path-averaged and given as (Katul et al., 2000), (2)
    where (mol m−2 s−1) is the canopy stomatal conductance to CO2, Ca is the ambient
    atmospheric CO2 concentration (ppm), and Ci is the intercellular CO2 concentration
    (ppm). Measured Ca above the canopy was used in all FLUXNET site calibration stages,
    while the global averaged Ca over time was adopted in the global ET modelling
    stage (described later). Similarly, Tr can be described using Dalton''s law as,
    (3) where (mol m−2 s−1) is the stomatal conductance to water vapor ( =1.6 ) when
    CO2 and water vapor share the same pathway (Katul et al., 2000), D is the water
    vapor deficit fraction expressed by the molar ratio determined from / , is the
    atmospheric pressure set as a constant 100 kPa for simplicity, and VPD is, as
    before, the vapor pressure deficit (kPa). Combing Eqs. (1), (2), (3) to eliminate
    stomatal conductance results in, (4) Re-arranging Eq. (4) to obtain Tr yields,
    (5) A major advantage of this approach is that it eliminates the need for modelling
    and its associated uncertainty; however, must be externally supplied instead or
    estimated using models. The simplest model assumes is a constant determined empirically
    for each plant functional type. Alternatively, stomatal optimization theories
    can be adopted instead without adding new parameters. In these theories, stomata
    are assumed to operate to maximize carbon gain but are constrained by water loss
    from the soil (Farquhar et al., 1993). In their most simplified form, and upon
    assuming a linear biochemical demand function, these stomatal optimization theories
    predict Ci/Ca as (Farquhar et al., 1993; Katul et al., 2009, Katul et al., 2010;
    Way et al., 2014), (6) where (mol mol−1) is the inverse of the marginal water
    use efficiency presumed to depend on PFTs, (ppm) is the leaf CO2 compensation
    point in the absence of mitochondrial respiration, and is a parameter that distinguishes
    C3 from C4 plants and is related to the strength of the CO2 pump in C4 plants.
    The parameter is set to unity for C3 plants (no CO2 pump) but for C4 plants as
    discussed elsewhere (Way et al., 2014). Hereafter, it is assumed throughout that
    C3 plants are the dominant species ( ) for simplicity and for pragmatic reasons.
    With these simplifications, and upon replacing Ci/Ca in Eq. (5) into Eq. (6) yields,
    (7) A number of features are now pointed out about the final outcome in Eq. (7).
    Eq. (7) predicts a Tr - scaling instead of Tr - VPD scaling (i.e., Dalton''s law)
    but the linear scaling emerges when setting Ci/Ca to a constant. As discussed
    elsewhere (Katul et al., 2010), the Tr - scaling is an emergent outcome of the
    optimization theory for all C3 plants and is not an outcome of any model calibration
    or empirical fit to gas exchange measurements. Detailed optimality theories that
    resolve all the non-linearities in the biochemical demand function have also been
    derived but their performance is commensurate with outcomes such as Eq. (6) (Katul
    et al., 2010; Volpe et al., 2011). The compensation point is assumed to vary only
    with air temperature (Ta) and is calculated using standard equations (Sellers
    et al., 1996), (8) where (Pa) is the leaf interior partial O2 pressure treated
    as a constant set to 2.09 × 104 Pa (Sellers et al., 1992). Inserting Eq. (8) into
    Eq. (7) and converting the unit of Tr from mol m−2 s−1 to W m−2 using the latent
    heat of vaporization (=2.45 × 106 J kg−1), an expression for Tr can be derived
    and is given as, (9) At first glance, Eq. (9) appears to be independent of LAI
    though the effects of LAI are implicit in the coefficients and together with the
    SIF signal. The is assumed to be stationary over time for most plant species (Lloyd
    and Farquhar, 1994). Values from published gas exchange studies are used in Eq.
    (9) (Lloyd and Farquhar, 1994, see Table S1 in the supplementary information).
    Before proceeding further, several points must be raised when invoking a constant
    . It is now established that can vary with progressive hydraulic limitations and/or
    large changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration as discussed elsewhere (Ellsworth
    et al., 1995; Manzoni et al., 2011; Manzoni et al., 2013; Mrad et al., 2019).
    Eq. (6) shows that holding constant while increasing results in an increase in
    Ci/Ca not congruent with stable isotope measurements at Free Air CO2 Enrichment
    experiments that predict a near-constant Ci/Ca independent of (Ellsworth et al.,
    1995). As such, should scale with as discussed elsewhere (Katul et al., 2010)
    and as theoretically argued using dynamic optimality theories (Manzoni et al.,
    2013). However, to keep the number of parameters to a minimum for global ET estimates,
    it is assumed that did not change appreciably over the calibration period so as
    to justify its inclusion as a modifier for . Moreover, scales sub-linearly with
    (i.e., ∼ ) and small modifications to due to minor increases in have minimal impact
    on . With regards to soil evaporation, the Es formulation used in prior work (Zhou
    et al., 2022) is used. This formulation employed the surface available energy
    and relative humidity complemented with vegetation properties (Leaf Area Index).
    This formulation is given by (Yan et al., 2012), (10) where RH (no unit) is the
    mean air relative humidity, is the slope of saturation vapor pressure - air temperature
    curve, is the psychrometric constant, Rn is net radiation above the canopy, G
    is the ground heat flux and is neglected relative to Rn, and a plausibility argument
    is that at a 4 day timescale, the temporal value of G is near-zero. Excluding
    G can bring about some uncertainty, but the overall effect should be minimum given
    that G usually accounts for under 6% of Rn when evaluated by using FLUXNET sites
    (data not shown). The here is the light extinction coefficient and the synthesized
    values by Zhang et al. (2014b) are adopted in this study. In particular, the value
    is 0.62 for croplands, 0.59 for broadleaf forests (evergreen broadleaf & deciduous
    broadleaf & mixed forests), 0.45 for needleleaf forests (evergreen & deciduous
    needleleaf forests), 0.56 for shrublands (open and closed shrublands), and 0.50
    for grasslands (grasslands & savannas); the mean value of 0.56 of all ecosystems
    in the study by Zhang et al. (2014b) is adopted for cropland/natural vegetation
    mosaic and wetlands in this study; LAI is leaf area index (m2 m−2). When combining
    Eqs. (9), (10), the modeled transpiration and soil evaporation can be combined
    and expressed as, (11) Here, the Tr + Es part has only two ‘free’ parameters -
    and that must be externally calibrated for each site. Also, it is noted that multiplies
    and – and hence – it cannot be readily disentangled from them if treated as a
    third fitting parameter. The conversion factor of 44.10 for the Tr expression
    is to ensure these fluxes are in units of W m−2. The and parameters were calibrated
    at FLUXNET sites during dry periods with rainfall events excluded (see 2.2). The
    evaporation of canopy intercepted water was calculated using a modified analytical
    model (Gash, 1979; Gash et al., 1995). Here, the canopy and the trunk are assumed
    to be the entire interception surface so as to simplify the calculation. Remote
    sensing data are used to calculate the global canopy intercepted evaporation (Zheng
    and Jia, 2019). The Gash model describes the volume of water that is intercepted
    by the canopy, and the intercepted water is considered as the interception re-evaporation.
    The intercepted water is calculated as, (12) where c is the canopy cover fraction
    evaluated using (Zheng and Jia, 2019), and kA is the light extinction coefficient
    as aforementioned and the same parameterization is adopted (Zhang et al., 2014b);
    (mm hr−1) denotes the mean rainfall rate which can be directly evaluated by using
    the rainfall records, and (mm hr−1) denotes the mean evaporation rate during rainfall
    and can be evaluated by using a Dalton type evaporation equation where the evaporation
    rate is driven by water vapor concentration gradient between the canopy surface
    and the air; note that both and are evaluated for certain fixed periods (e.g.,
    1 month, 2 months, among others); (mm) is the gross rainfall for each rainfall
    event; (mm) is the rainfall threshold for saturating the canopy and can be evaluated
    as (13) where Sveg denotes the vegetation canopy storage capacity (mm) and can
    be evaluated as, (14) where Sv (mm) is the specific storage capacity (see Cui
    et al., 2015). The VAI (m2 m−2) is the vegetation area index approximated by using
    LAI and the area index of dead leaves, branches, stem and trunk, Ls (m2 m−2),
    (15) where Ls varies with LAI and can be quantified as, (16) Here, and denote
    the nth and (n-1)th Ls of the time series, respectively, and Ls, min is the minimum
    value of Ls; LAIn and LAIn-1 denote the nth and (n-1)th green LAI of the time
    series, respectively; denotes the left rate of residuals and 1- denotes the removal
    rate. The parameterizations of Ls, min and are taken from Cui et al. (2015). The
    unit of Ei was ultimately converted to W m-2 using latent heat of vaporization
    (=2.45 × 106 J kg−1). 2.2. Deriving the and parameters over the globe The contiguous
    SIF product (CSIF) is used (Zhang et al., 2018) to constrain transpiration and
    the model parameters and are calibrated against latent heat flux measurements
    reported by the FLUXNET2015 dataset (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/).
    CSIF was produced using a machine learning algorithm trained using the Orbiting
    Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) SIF measurements and the MODIS reflectance product.
    The CSIF employed here has a spatial resolution of 0.05°at the 4-day temporal
    resolution from January 2000 to December 2018. The FLUXNET site is paired with
    CSIF pixel in which the meteorological tower resides and the parameters of the
    models were optimized at the flux site level. FLUXNET2015 is a worldwide network
    of eddy-covariance turbulent flux measuring stations, which include near-surface
    fluxes of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy (Pastorello et al., 2020). For
    each site, the following variables were selected in the parameter determination:
    latent heat flux (W m−2), VPD (kPa), Ca (in ppm), net radiation (W m−2), air temperature
    (in °C), and air relative humidity (unitless). Inconsistency usually exists between
    the flux tower footprint (usually 3 to 5 km2) and remotely sensed SIF coverage
    due to land heterogeneity. We used Net Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to select
    sites satisfying the following two requirements: (1) The maximum, minimum, and
    standard deviation of NDVI (MOD13Q1) of the grid point in which the site is located
    is within 20% of the difference of the corresponding statistical index of the
    adjacent area (5 × 5 km2 area in the center of which the flux site is located);
    (2) The maximum of NDVI of the target grid point must be >0.2 to exclude the sites
    with barren land in the growing season (see Zhou et al., 2022). Here the growing
    season is determined by using 50% thresholds of annual SIF data series, in particular,
    the spring onset is determined by 50% of the annual maximum of SIF, and the last
    fall day is defined as the date when the seasonal SIF drops to 50% of the annual
    maximum (Jeong et al., 2017). Sites with temporal coverage longer than 2 years
    are included in the analysis. These selection criteria resulted in 68 flux sites
    (Table S2) for parameter calibration, and the sites covered all land types under
    the IGBP land classification except for deciduous needleleaf forest (DNF), cropland/natural
    vegetation mosaic (CVM), water bodies (WAT) and urban and built-up land (URB).
    The land use types of water bodies and urban and built-up were not considered
    here. The temporal resolution of all flux site variables was aggregated to 4 days
    to be consistent with that of the CSIF data. To reduce uncertainty, we removed
    data when the meteorological variables over the 4 days'' period missed >10% data.
    The model parameters and were calibrated at the site level using the least square
    method and later employed to derive the global distribution based on the IGBP
    vegetation type classification. Here, the MODIS product MCD12C1 was used for global
    vegetation distribution, which has a spatial resolution of 0.05° (See Fig. S1).
    The parameters of and describe the relation between GPP and SIF, where represents
    the ratio of light use efficiency to fluorescence yield (Yang et al., 2015) and
    is the intercept of this relation. Thus, any factor that influences light use
    efficiency and fluorescence yield affect these parameters. Vegetation type, canopy
    structure, meteorological conditions impact these two parameters as well (e.g.,
    Pierrat et al., 2022). In constructing the spatial distribution of these two parameters,
    we only considered the vegetation type by using global plant functional type (PFT)
    and the environmental variables of mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual
    temperature (MAT) and Dryness Index (DI). The parameters of and were first calibrated
    at the 68 FLUXNET sites, and then two methods were used to determine the spatial
    distribution of these parameters over the terrestrial globe using PFT as follows:
    (1) Mean value model: For PFTs with limited number of sites (0 < N < 5) including
    Closed Shrublands (CSH), Deciduous Broadleaf Forests (DBF), Mixed Forests (MF),
    Open Shrublands (OSH) and Wetlands (WET), a PFT-based mean value approach similar
    to the parameterization method commonly used in land surface models is used and
    given as (17) where is the value of the parameter or at the ith flux station in
    the jth PFT, is the average of the parameter of all flux stations in the jth PFT,
    and is the error. (2) Regression model: For PFTs with at least 5 available sites,
    a regression model was employed to construct the global distribution of the model
    parameters, including Cropland (CRO), Grassland (GRA), Evergreen Needleleaf Forest
    (ENF), Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (EBF), Savannas (SAV), and Woody Savannas (WSA)
    (See Table S3 for the 58 sites). The regression model was developed by correlating
    the parameters with environmental variables for each PFT as, (18) Here, is the
    regression coefficient matrix for the jth plant functional type. The is the matrix
    of selected environmental variables of the ith flux site. The environmental variables
    here include MAT, MAP, and Dryness Index (DI) evaluated as the ratio of Potential
    Evapotranspiration (PET) and MAP, all of which are factors that commonly control
    local climate, as well as photosynthesis and plant transpiration. At the FLUXNET
    sites, MAT and MAP were obtained by averaging long-term precipitation and temperature
    records available in the FLUXNET2015 datasets, where the site DI was evaluated
    and the PET was calculated by using Priestley-Taylor model (Fisher et al., 2008;
    Zhang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022). The global distribution of MAT and MAP
    were obtained as long-term averages of ERA5 temperature and precipitation records.
    Since the magnitude of land precipitation is usually below 3000 mm yr−1 in most
    areas, extreme precipitation records (>3000 mm yr−1) were replaced by 3000 mm
    yr−1. The global distribution of DI was calculated using MAP and PET estimated
    from the Priestley-Taylor model (see Fisher et al., 2008; Purdy et al., 2018 for
    details). The global distribution of model parameters was determined using either
    the mean value model or the regression model with MAT, MAP and DI. For those PFTs
    with limited sites, the mean value of the parameters of the PFT was used; for
    the DNF and CVM PFTs, as no flux sites were available to calibrate the parameters,
    we used the average of the site-calibrated parameters of ENF for DNF, and the
    average of CRO for CVM. 2.3. Drivers of the global ET model Meteorological input
    from the ERA5 terrestrial meteorological reanalysis data (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/)
    was used to drive the ET calculations. ERA5-Land is the latest generation of meteorological
    reanalysis data operated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
    (ECMWF) (Hersbach et al., 2020). Covering all conventional meteorological data
    from 1950 to the present, it assimilates remote sensing products, surface and
    upper atmosphere meteorological data, including different regions of the globe
    with varying time scales. We used the hourly meteorological variables at a spatial
    resolution of 0.1°, including air temperature (Ta, °C), dew point temperature
    (Tdew, °C), net short-wave radiation and net long-wave radiation (W m−2). The
    VPD was calculated as (19) where esat (kPa) is the saturation vapor pressure and
    ea (kPa) is the actual water vapor pressure derived using Tdew. Because most plant
    photosynthesis occurs during daytime, we averaged the meteorological records between
    06:00 and 18:00 local time to the 4-day window. Such treatment brings about some
    uncertainty to nighttime evaporation. However, the effect should be low as nighttime
    evaporation accounts for 6% of the total ET on average as evaluated using the
    original latent heat flux measurements provided by FLUXNET2015 database (data
    not shown). These estimates also match other reported nighttime ET estimates in
    the literature (Novick et al., 2009). To match the resolution of the SIF data,
    we resampled the ERA5 radiation data from 0.1° to 0.05° using a spline function
    interpolation. Leaf area index (LAI) was obtained from the MODIS leaf area index
    product (MCD15A3H V006) for the period 2003–2018 to support the Es calculations
    in Eq. (10) and the canopy interception evaluations. This LAI product has a spatial
    resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 4 days. At the stage of site
    parameter calibration, the LAI grid points were extracted to match the flux sites.
    For global ET calculations, the global LAI was aggregated to 0.05° to match the
    spatial resolution of the SIF data. To conceptualize the global ET estimation

    resolutions of the original inputs are listed on the left and all the variables
    during the intermediate processing are at 0.05° resolution. The ERA5 precipitation
    record is used when deriving the dryness index (DI). The global precipitation
    dataset MSWEP (Beck et al., 2019) was used to drive the Gash model for global
    Ei estimates. The MSWEP dataset has a spatial resolution of 0.1° and a temporal
    resolution of 3 h by optimally merging multiple data sources ranging from gauge
    measurements, satellite observation, to reanalysis production. The high quality
    of MSWEP guarantees the quality of the canopy interception evaporation estimate.
    Before running the Gash model, the mean rainfall rate ( ) was evaluated using
    the original 3-hourly data for every 28 day-window (i.e., 7 × 4-day windows of
    the calculation step of ET), then the Gash model was run at the daily time step
    that was finally aggregated to 4 days to agree with other ET component calculations.
    To match the spatial resolution of 0.05° for the transpiration and soil evaporation
    estimates, the four 0.05° pixels within the 0.1° pixel directly adopted the corresponding
    interception evaporation value. 2.4. Global evapotranspiration products used for
    comparison Three widely used meteorologically-driven global ET products were used
    for comparisons with the proposed . The first product is the GLEAM ET data (Martens
    et al., 2017). GLEAM calculates PET using the Priestley-Taylor equation (Priestley
    and Taylor, 1972) with observed surface available energy and surface temperature.
    GLEAM estimates actual ET by imposing a constraint on PET. In particular, GLEAM
    combines observations of Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) and estimates of root-soil
    moisture that impose ET limitations using an empirical reduction factor. Different
    from other ET products used for comparisons in this study, GLEAM explicitly considers
    snow sublimation. The GLEAM ET data has a spatial resolution of 0.25° and a temporal
    resolution of 1 day. The second ET product is derived from the PT-JPL model (Fisher
    et al., 2008) that employs the Priestley-Taylor formulation assumed to represent
    PET (Priestley and Taylor, 1972). The PT-JPL model then employs multiple constraints
    to convert the corresponding PET into actual canopy transpiration, canopy interception
    evaporation and soil evaporation. The constraints for canopy transpiration include
    leaf area index, green fraction of the canopy, plant temperature and plant moisture;
    the constraint for soil evaporation is evaluated using relative humidity and vapor
    pressure deficit; the constraint for the interception evaporation is defined as
    the fraction of time when the surface is wet evaluated using relative humidity.
    The model description is featured elsewhere (Fisher et al., 2008) and is not repeated
    here. Unlike GLEAM, all the model parameters of PT-JPL are preset, thus no calibration
    is needed when using the model. The PT-JPL model is run on monthly timescales
    and these monthly ET estimates from 2003 to 2018 at spatial resolution of 36 km
    (or 0.25°) are used for comparison with the proposed . The third ET product is
    the land MOD16, which was derived by Mu et al., 2007, Mu et al., 2011 using a
    modified Penman-Monteith equation with parameterized stomatal conductance formulation.
    The dataset is built on MODIS-reported land cover, albedo, LAI, meteorological
    forcings, etc. Note that MOD16 only evaluates ET over vegetated areas, and all
    sparsely vegetated or non-vegetated areas are left as blank. The MOD16 has a spatial
    resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 8 days. When comparing the proposed
    with the three products with varying spatial and temporal resolutions, the finer-resolution
    datasets were aggregated to agree with the lower-resolution ones. 3. Results 3.1.
    Calibrating parameter at flux site level and constructing the parameters over
    the globe The and were calibrated for each of the 68 sites from the FLUXNET2015
    dataset. The model-data comparisons were not independent of PFTs as shown in Fig.
    2. The performance of the ETSIF model is also presented for the selected site
    for each PFT (see Fig. S2). In particular, R2 of the calibration is higher than
    0.50 for 53 sites, and higher than 0.70 for 34 sites; however, R2 at some sites
    are low and fall in the range of 0.1–0.3. The low R2 was mainly at CSH, EBF and
    SAV sites. The model parameters are featured by PFTs in Fig. 3. The parameters
    are statistically uniform across sites for some of the PFTs (i.e., MF, WSA, SAV,
    EBF, DBF), whereas they showed variability for other PFTs (i.e., ENF, SAV, CRO,
    OSH, CSH). In particular, of ENF showed substantial variability among different
    sites. For those PFTs with limited sites (N < 5), the average of the parameters
    from available sites were employed (Table 1). For PFTs with at least 5 sites,
    a multiple linear regression model was used to relate and to MAP, MAT and DI (Fig.
    4; Table 1). For most PFTs, the multiple linear regression captures the variability
    of parameters among different sites (R2 = 0.6–0.8); but for PFTs such as DBF and
    GRA, the performance was poor with R2 < 0.3. Given that the value of R2 > 0.1,
    the climatic and environmental variables of MAP, MAT and DI are used in the regression
    model to determine and in lieu of using an ad-hoc mean values set by a PFT. Therefore,
    the regression model was used for each of the 6 PFTs to produce the global distribution
    of α and β (Fig. 5). Note that the lower boundary of β was artificially set to
    0 when estimating the global ET to avoid negative values of photosynthesis and
    transpiration due to the false parameters on a 4-day interval. We tested setting
    β = 0 when calibrating the parameters at flux sites and found the overall performances
    showed no discernible difference (See Table S2). The constructed spatial distribution
    of α showed clear lower values over tropical area (∼10–20 μmol m−2 s−1/mW m−2
    nm−1 sr−1) and higher values over the boreal forests (∼50–70 μmol m−2 s−1/mW m−2
    nm−1 sr−1). On the contrary, the parameter β showed high values over the tropical
    area (∼4–8 μmol m−2 s−1). Download : Download high-res image (134KB) Download

    2018 The global was produced from 2003 through 2018 and spatial maps of the annual
    means are featured in Fig. 6. Globally, mean annual ranged from 0 to 150 W m−2
    (Fig. 6). The higher values were in eastern North America, South America, South
    Africa, Southeast Asia, Southern China, and part of Australia. The mean annual
    in most part of the Amazon forest region ranged from 100 to 150 W m−2, while in
    most African regions except for the Sahara Desert and the dry climate of South
    Africa, the mean annual >75 W m−2. The can be higher than 125 W m−2 for some regions
    in central Africa and some parts of the Amazon forest. The U.S. Corn Belt and
    the eastern U.S. also have relatively higher (>100 W m−2) resulting from cropland
    irrigation and intense crop agriculture. Similar values were computed for North
    America, North and South China where large amounts of croplands are available.
    In sparsely vegetated regions and drier regions such as the western United States,
    the Middle East, North Africa, and at higher latitudes, was lower, typically <50
    W m−2. The global annual ET/Rn ratio (Fig. S3) showed that ET was mostly dominated
    by radiation in tropical area (i.e., Amazon forest, Central Africa, Southeast
    Asia) and intensely irrigated area (e.g., Midwest of U.S., India, North part of
    China) with a higher ET/Rn ratio, while in the arid region (e.g., North Africa,
    Middle East, Northwestern China) ET was mostly dominated by water availability
    with a lower ET/Rn ratio. The maximum and minimum 4-day averaged ETSIF are shown
    in Fig. S4, and a maximum of about 500 W m−2 appeared at higher latitudes of Eurasia,
    Southeastern China, India, part of the Amazon forest, Mideast U.S.. The minima

    averaged global was also computed and seasonal variations across the whole globe
    evaluated (Fig. 7) to assess controls of leaf area dynamics on ET. For the Northern
    Hemisphere spring (Fig. 7a-c), was low in Northern China, Southern China, Eastern
    U.S., and across Europe as vegetation greening commences. At the same time, remained
    high in South America along the Amazon rainforest and southern South America,
    Indonesia and Congo. In the Northern Hemisphere summer (Fig. 7d-f), the reached
    a peak, especially in the Eastern U.S., Northern and Southern China, and Europe,
    where as high as 150 W m−2 was computed. In the Amazon forest, remained high during
    the spring. In southern South America, overall was low as the southern hemisphere
    entered winter at this time. Similarly for the southern part of South America,
    the overall in Australia was also low due to the winter season. As the Northern
    Hemisphere approached fall (Fig. 7g-i), began to decline in North America, most
    parts of Europe, northern China, and southern China. Near the U.S. Corn belt,
    dropped from over 150 W m−2 in the summer to about 50 W m−2. In Europe, dropped
    from about 100 W m−2 in summer to about 25 W m−2. In China, the overall dropped
    to about 100 W m−2. As the southern hemisphere entered spring, increased to about
    100 W m−2 in most parts of South America and Australia. The Amazon rainforest
    and parts of Southeast Asia still maintained high due to low seasonal variations
    in this region. In the Northern Hemisphere winter (Fig. 7j-l), remained low in
    North America, Europe, and China. In the Amazon rainforest and Southeast Asia,
    remained relatively high throughout the year. As summer progressed in the Southern
    Hemisphere, the overall remained high for all parts of Australia and southern
    South America. The lower coefficient of variation (CV) of ETSIF in the tropical
    area implies that ET is generally stable all year round, and the higher CV in
    the higher latitude of the Northern Hemisphere and the arid area (Northern Africa,
    Middle East) implies that the ET is subject to high seasonal variation (Fig. S5).
    To sum up, the overall spatial and temporal patterns of global appear consistent
    with logical expectations. It must be underscored that LAI data product did not
    enter into the transpiration calculations explicitly and was only used in the
    soil- and intercepted water evaporation. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    4.1. Comparison with other ET products Using global SIF products complemented
    with meteorological inputs and land cover properties, a new global product for
    the period of 2003–2018 was developed and compared to prior global ET products.
    The global distribution of derived here are comparable with other common meteorologically-driven
    ET products of GLEAM, PT-JPL model and MOD16 though discrepancies exist as shown
    by the differences in Fig. 9. The differences between and prior algorithms is
    typically about −20 to 20 W m−2 (Fig. 9) – or under 0.7 mm d−1. This difference
    is deemed acceptable given the differences in input variables and the differences
    in model complexities and assumptions. The proposed showed evident differences
    from MOD16 and a bimodal curve pattern existed in the probability density function
    of those differences (Fig. 9). Substantial differences between and some of the
    other products are found in the Amazon rainforest, some parts of central Africa
    and Indonesia where the rainforest is dominant as well as Eastern India, where
    agriculture is dominant, and in central and western Australia, part of Africa,
    part of South and Southeastern Asia where the estimated residuals ranged from
    20 to 60 W m−2. Part of the uncertainty may be related to the parameters that
    adopt the average of the PFTs in most regions of western Australia, Africa and
    part of Asia, where eddy-covariance flux sites over the major PFTs remain insufficient
    for accurate GPP-SIF parameterization. But the difference may also result from
    the limitations in other products. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    between ETSIF and GLEAM (a), PT-JPL (b) and MOD16 (c) on annual mean time scale;
    the inset panels show the probability density function (pdf) of these differences.
    The comparisons with GLEAM, PT-JPL and MOD16 were conducted for the periods of
    2008–2018, 2008–2017 and 2003–2018, respectively. Note that MOD16 does not include
    sparsely vegetated or non-vegetated areas. The comparison between the proposed
    ETSIF and GLEAM in Fig. 9 suggests the two ET methods agree on spatial patterns
    as the probability density function (pdf) of the corresponding difference is centered
    around 0 W m−2; however, the comparisons with PT-JPL and MOD16 products imply
    that ETSIF is significantly different. We compared these three ET products (GLEAM,
    PT-JPL and MOD16) and also found pronounced differences among themselves (Fig.
    S6). In general, for the four ET products evaluated in this study (ETSIF, GLEAM,
    PT-JPL and MOD16), ETSIF and GLEAM have similar spatial pattern with pronounced
    difference mainly emerging in tropical regions (e.g., Amazon forest), while PT-JPL
    and MOD16 agree on their spatial pattern; only GLEAM explicitly considers snow
    sublimation, but ETSIF at high latitudes with snow cover is very close to GLEAM,
    implying that the omission of such component of ETSIF does not impact the total
    ET estimate. Compared to PT-JPL and MOD16, the ETSIF and GLEAM are consistently
    lower at high latitude in Northern Hemisphere, but are higher at sub-tropical
    regions (e.g., Southeast America, Southeast Asia). These differences probably
    result from different model structures and varying input variables among these
    models. As there is no direct ‘measurement’ of global ET, we have no basis to
    judge which is right and which is wrong. Thus, we note here that all global ET
    products, including ETSIF, should be treated with caution. The climatological
    zonal distributions of annual and other ET products are compared in Fig. 10 and
    the general patterns are similar with the highest values appearing around the
    equator. However, clear differences emerge for most latitudes of the globe. At
    latitudes between −5° and 5° (near the equator), was close to GLEAM and higher
    than the other two ET products, whereas between −25° and − 5° Southern Hemisphere
    as well as 5° and 20° Northern Hemisphere, the was higher than all three ET products.
    At the mid-latitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere (25°-50°), the general
    patterns across all products agree but with differences emerging in the magnitude.
    At high latitudes (50°-75°) of the Northern Hemisphere, the four ET products showed
    clear divergent values, indicating that ET estimation at high latitudes remains
    subject to high uncertainty. Around 15–25° Northern Hemisphere, together with
    GLEAM and PT-JPL showed pronounced deviations from MOD16 estimates (Fig. 10),
    which yielded higher ET values compared to the other three products. But such
    higher values of MOD16 at 15°-25° and 50°-75° of the Northern Hemisphere probably
    result from statistical biases as MOD16 ET of sparsely vegetated and non-vegetated
    areas (e.g., Sahara Desert and the permanent snow cover) was not evaluated (Mu
    et al., 2007, Mu et al., 2011), potentially elevating the corresponding latitudinal
    average because ET in these omitted areas is usually lower than the vegetated
    areas. The pronounced differences among the four ET products imply that estimating
    global ET remains challenging, especially at the higher latitudes (>60°) and the
    zone of 5–25° of the Northern Hemisphere (see the high Root Mean Square Difference
    in Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (294KB) Download : Download full-size

    all available records of the corresponding ET products are used for this evaluation,
    but MOD16 ET product does not include sparsely vegetated and non-vegetated areas.
    4.2. Advantages and limitations of the SIF-based ET model The proposed is based
    on two physiological relations: (i) the GPP-SIF and (ii) an optimality hypothesis
    that predicts as a function of vapor pressure deficit for C3 plants (but can be
    extended to C4 plants). Compared with other detailed vegetation-transpiration
    relations, no stomatal conductance models are required in and the effect of stomatal
    closure is indirectly captured by . The optimality hypothesis requires the inverse
    of the marginal water use efficiency ( ) that is related to the Lagrange multiplier
    of the optimality problem. We assumed the marginal water use efficiency is constant,
    but this quantity is regulated by the variation in the soil-plant hydraulic conductance
    (Anderegg et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020), which is not considered in this study.
    In the case of C4 plants, an additional parameter ( ) related to the C4 pump strength
    is also required. developed here used based on literature values and plant functional
    types for C3 plants. This assumption ignores hydraulic limitations and, to a lesser
    extent, the effects of on . The model calculations set (C3 plants) even in croplands
    that may be occasionally dominated by corn (a C4 crop). The work here did not
    consider such variations in . A partial justification for setting over large areas
    and extended time periods is that corn is frequently rotated with other C3 crops
    (wheat or soybeans). Accounting for such rotation makes the specification of across
    the globe a formidable challenge even when the numerical value of is known. Advantages
    of a simplified model structure and a small number of ‘free parameters’ bring
    about potential uncertainties as well, especially in spatial upscaling. When PFT
    is not covered by sufficient flux measuring sites for model calibration, a mean
    value was adopted. The dominant PFTs in central and western Australia is OSH (Open
    shrublands), i.e., shrubs cover 10%–60% of the total land area in this region,
    but the FLUXNET database lacks sites for parameter calibrations for this PFT.
    Using a mean of the parameter is likely to result in biases in Australia and parts
    of Asia and southern Africa. The sensitivity of transpiration to the two free
    parameters together with the input variables are evaluated here using the Sobol’
    (2001) sensitivity analysis method, which decomposes the model output variance
    into the sum of variances of the input variables and parameters, and the sensitivity
    index represents to what extent each parameter (or variable) or the interaction
    of the parameters (or variables) will have on the final output. We found transpiration
    is sensitive to the parameter α (Fig. 11) followed by the input variables of SIF
    and VPD, implying that any uncertainty associated with the parameter α will easily
    translate into the uncertainty in transpiration and evapotranspiration estimates.
    Thus, the accuracy of the parameter α largely determines the overall quality of
    ETSIF. Download : Download high-res image (140KB) Download : Download full-size

    index (a) and S1 represents the first-order sensitivity index (b). In particular,
    the first-order sensitivity index is evaluated by keeping all other variables
    (including parameters and input variables) constant, while the total sensitivity
    index is evaluated by considering variations of all variables (including parameters
    and input variables); see Sobol’ (2001) for the detailed descriptions. Black line
    represents the 95% confidence interval. Global ET estimation has advanced rapidly
    over the past decades, especially when combining remote sensing products with
    energy balance- and meteorologically based models (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998;
    Su, 2002; Fisher et al., 2008; Mu et al., 2007, Mu et al., 2011). Other data-driven
    efforts such as upscaling ET measurements at FLUXNET sites to the global scale
    (Jung et al., 2020) and using machine learning based on FLUXNET and SAPFLUXNET
    dataset (Koppa et al., 2022) also contributed to global ET assessments. Compared
    with other high data-demanding methods, provides an acceptable estimate using
    SIF dataset and basic meteorological variables with low data demand and has the
    potential to advance global ET modelling efforts. Another major advantage is that
    stomatal conductance is not explicitly required when constraining vegetation transpiration,
    thereby reducing the associated uncertainty of the model structure. Thus, may
    be viewed as a compromise between the highly parameterized models (e.g., MOD16)
    and parameter free models (e.g., PT-JPL). The model here based on SIF also provides
    a possible way for ET partitioning, but independent field measurements of transpiration
    are required to derive the model parameters to achieve such goal. The acceptable
    performance of at FLUXNET sites lends some confidence to its usage for large-scale
    ET computations. Needless to say, the accuracy of ETSIF depends on the quality
    of SIF retrieval, which is impacted by the signal quality, sky condition, among
    others (e.g., Köhler et al., 2018). Thus, any uncertainty associated with SIF
    retrieval brings about extra error into ETSIF as SIF is the most sensitive input
    variable for transpiration in this ET model (see Fig. 11). 5. Summary and conclusion
    An evapotranspiration model was developed that combines SIF satellite data and
    optimality principles for leaf gas exchange. The major novelty of this approach
    is that the model does not need to parameterize stomatal conductance. The model
    performance in reproducing eddy-covariance measured ET at FLUXNET sites was acceptable
    when model parameters related to GPP-SIF were optimized. The derived model parameters
    at these sites were later employed to determine a global distribution of parameters
    by relating them to site and climate properties using multiple linear regression.
    Using ERA5 meteorological input, MODIS LAI and SIF products, the MSWEP precipitation
    product, the computed evapotranspiration from 2003 through 2018 was in the range
    of 615–635 mm yr−1 with minor but statistically insignificant ET enhancement trend
    (0.257 mm yr−1) possibly resulting from global greening (Yang et al., 2023). Future
    developments seek to improve the role of soil moisture stress and hydraulic limitations
    on the marginal water use efficiency parameter and develop additional constraints
    on the relation between GPP to SIF. The first global terrestrial ET product mainly
    driven by SIF may be used to assess antecedent soil moisture conditions, drought
    monitoring, large-scale runoff and associated changes in the hydrological cycle,
    among others. The comparisons with other ET products show that large uncertainties
    generally exist in global ET estimates, thus all global ET products should be
    treated with caution when dealing with topics on global water cycle. Author contribution

    Rice feeds over 50% of the global population (Zhuang et al., 2020), and is essential
    for ensuring food security. Rice is a water-loving plant that uses 3–5 folds as
    much freshwater as other cereals (Ishfaq et al., 2020). Paddy fields are also
    major CH4 emissions sources (Lee et al., 2020), which contribute 11% of global
    anthropogenic emissions (IPCC, 2014). IAWD has emerged as one of the most widely
    water-saving irrigation technologies. It can greatly mitigate water scarcity and
    CH4 emissions (Arai, 2022, Hao et al., 2022, Sha et al., 2022, Jiang et al., 2023b).
    Sha et al. (2022) reported that IAWD decreased CH4 emissions by 54%–71% across
    three years. The lower CH4 emissions are largely attributable to IAWD limiting
    methanogens and promoting CH4 oxidation through improved soil aeration (Zhang
    et al., 2012). However, improved aeration under IAWD can promote soil CO2 emissions
    and thus ecosystem respiration (Re) (Yang et al., 2020). Haque et al. (2022) showed
    that IAWD decreases rice straw yield, which inevitably reduces plant carbon accumulation
    and thus affects gross primary product (GPP). Therefore, decreased GPP and enhanced
    Re lead to a serious sustainability challenge on soil carbon sequestration and
    carbon emission reduction. NEE represents the difference between GPP and Re, reflecting
    the ecosystem as carbon sink or source (Guo et al., 2021). Yang et al. (2017)
    showed IAWD enhanced soil CO2 emissions, resulting in lower NEE. In addition,
    the effect of IAWD on rice yield is controversial and mainly depends on the threshold
    of soil water potential (SWP) (Cheng et al., 2022). Recently, our studies indicated
    that IAWD maintained yield with different SWP thresholds set according to different
    growth periods (Zheng et al., 2018, Li et al., 2022). Nevertheless, little is
    known about the effect of IAWD with varying thresholds on CH4 and NEE in Northeast
    China, a typical rice monoculture region. Hence, to ensure sustainable rice production
    in northeastern China, effective management practices are required to alleviate
    the negative effect on NEE from IAWD, while further decreasing CH4 emissions and
    increasing yields as well. Biochar is extensively adopted for crop production,
    carbon sequestration, mitigation of GHG, and remediation of heavy metal pollution
    (Chen et al., 2019, Meng et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2022a). However, CH4 emissions
    response to biochar is still under debate, even in paddy fields. Numerous reports
    showed biochar reduced CH4 emissions (Qi et al., 2021, Nan et al., 2022, Jiang
    et al., 2023a). The lower emissions were widely advocated as biochar lowered the
    abundance rate of methanogenic and methanotrophic (Wang et al., 2019). Conversely,
    a few studies indicated biochar did not impact, even increased CH4 emissions (Liu
    et al., 2016, Qi et al., 2020). The different responses of CH4 emissions in paddy
    fields to biochar probably were related to biochar pyrolysis temperature, residence
    time and feedstock, soil properties, and fertilizers (Butnan et al., 2016, Wang
    et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2019, Cao et al., 2021). Most studies have been conducted
    and identify biochar impacts on CH4 emissions under ICF, while limited information
    is available on CH4 emissions for IAWD paddy ecosystems. In addition, few researches
    regarding the effect of biochar on NEE were somewhat controversial, and these
    different results may be mainly due to biochar application rate, residence time,
    crop type, and fertilizers (Zhang et al., 2013, Azeem et al., 2019). NEE in paddy
    fields was not affected after biochar application of 20 and 40 t ha−1, while it
    was improved by 40% at 10 t ha−1, mainly due to the increased net primary productivity
    (NPP) at 10 t ha−1, whereas the application of 20 and 40 t ha−1 did not increase
    the NPP, but rather increased soil CO2 emissions (Zhang et al., 2013). Biochar
    had a greater reduction in NEE for wheat under fertilizer than without fertilizer
    application, due to higher Rh under fertilizer (Azeem et al., 2019). Moreover,
    Azeem et al. (2019) also showed biochar did not affect NEE of mash bean in 1st
    year and significantly reduced it in 2nd year, which was attributed to increased
    Rh by the priming effect from fresh biochar. Nevertheless, limited information
    is available about the impact of biochar on NEE under IAWD with varying thresholds
    in Northeast China. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate whether
    biochar under IAWD can offset the negative effects of IAWD on NEE and achieve
    increased yield and mitigate CH4 emissions. We conducted a 2-yr field experiment
    to evaluate the effect of biochar on soil properties, NEE, CH4 emissions, GPP,
    soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh), ecosystem respiration (Re), and yield under
    two irrigation regimes. we hypothesized that: a) IAWD has no significant impact
    on grain yield, but decreased CH4 emissions while also decreasing NEE; b) biochar
    can increase grain yields while further decreasing CH4 emissions under IAWD; c)
    biochar mitigates the negative impact from IAWD on NEE through improving GPP more
    than Re. The outcomes will contribute to providing a scientific basis for the
    green and sustainable production of paddy fields by biochar application and IAWD,
    and achieve a \"win-win\" trade-off in food-water-GHG emissions. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Experimental site and materials The experiment was carried out
    at the Center Irrigation Experiment Station of Liaoning Province, Shenyan, China
    (N 42°08′, E 120°30′) in 2021 and 2022. The experimental site has a temperate
    continental monsoon climate with a mean temperature of 8.1 °C and precipitation
    of 672.9 mm. Daily temperature and precipitation during the experimental period
    are available in Fig. S1. The main properties of topsoil (0–20 cm) are listed
    in Table S1. Biochar derived from maize straw was pyrolyzed at 500 °C for 2 h.
    Biochar was mixed into the topsoil (0–20 cm) only once in 2020. The properties
    of biochar are shown in Table S1. 2.2. Experimental design A split-plot design
    with three replications was used in 2021 and 2022. The main plots were irrigation
    regimes (ICF and IAWD) and sub-plots were biochar application rates (B0: 0 and
    B1: 20 t ha–1). Each plot size is 18 m2 (3 m × 6 m) and surrounded by a 40 cm
    high PVC barrier, of which 30 cm was buried in the soil to avoid the lateral flow
    of nutrients and water. Water managements for ICF and IAWD at different growth
    stages were listed in Table S2 and was depicted by Li et al. (2022). Soil water
    potential (SWP) at the depth of 15 cm was daily measured for IAWD plots. Water
    level was daily observed at 8:00 am using a water level meter (MYWT, Minyi, China).
    Rice was transplanted on 26 May 2021 and 28 May 2022, and harvested on 12 October
    2021 and 13 October 2022. Based on local fertilization practices, 210 kg ha–1
    N (urea), 60 kg ha–1 P2O5 (superphosphate), and 75 kg ha–1 K2O (potassium sulfate)
    are generally applied. 40%, 40%, and 20% urea were used as basal, tillering, and
    panicle fertilizers respectively. 50% and 50% potassium were used as basal and
    panicle fertilizers respectively. All phosphate was used as a base fertilizer.
    2.3. Sampling and measurement 2.3.1. NEE and CH4 emissions measurement NEE and
    CH4 fluxes were measured using transparent static chambers. The static chamber
    was constructed of transparent PVC with a 0.5 m (w) × 0.5 m (l) × 0.1 m (h) base,
    a 0.5 m (w) × 0.5 m (l) × 0.5 m (h) standard chamber, and a 0.5 m (w) × 0.5 m
    (h) extension chamber. A digital thermometer and fan were mounted on top of each
    chamber to monitor the temperature and adequately mix the air. Gas samples were
    collected between 9:00–11:00 am. at the sampling frequency of 7–10 days, with
    additional samples after fertilizer. Samples were collected from the chamber into
    a 150 ml gas bag at 0, 15, and 30 min by a 100 ml syringe, respectively. NEE and
    CH4 concentrations were determined by the thermal conductivity and flame ionization
    detector (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatography
    system, respectively. 2.3.2. Soil sampling and analysis Three samples (0–20 cm)
    for each plot were collected randomly with the same frequency as gas sampling
    during the whole growth season, and mixed into one representative sample, with
    additional sampling before and after fertilization. Soil NH4+ and NO3- were extracted
    with 2 mol L−1 KCl and determined by the continuous flow analyzer. Soil dissolved
    organic carbon (DOC) was determined as described by Ghani et al. (2003). In-situ
    monitoring of soil redox potential (Eh), pH, and temperature were measured by
    an automated redox potential tester (CN61M/FJA3) with the same frequency as gas
    sampling (Chen et al., 2022). 2.3.3. Aboveground dry matter and carbon content
    After harvest, plant samples were selected randomly from 3 hills within a 1 m2
    region in the center of each plot. The samples were divided into stems, leaves,
    and panicles, dried, and weighed. The samples were powdered through a 0.15 mm
    sieve, and the carbon content was measured using an elemental analyzer (Vario
    Elemental Analyzer, Germany). 2.3.4. Data analysis The NEE and CH4 fluxes were
    calculated as follows: (1) where F is the flux of NEE or CH4 (mg C m−2 h−1); ρ
    is NEE (0.536 kg C m−3) or CH4 density (0.535 kg C m−3) at the standard state;
    h is the height of the chamber (m); dC/dt is the change in gas concentration over
    time (mg L−1 h−1); and T is the average temperature in the chamber (°C). The cumulative
    NEE and CH4 emissions were calculated as follows: (2) where f is the cumulative
    NEE (t C ha −1) or CH4 (kg C ha −1) emissions; i is the ith measurement; d is
    the day between two adjacent measurements. The GPP, Re, and Rh were calculated
    as follows: (3) (4) (5) (6) where Re and Rh was ecosystem and soil heterotrophic
    respiration (t C ha–1), respectively; GPP and NPP was the gross and net primary
    production (t C ha–1), respectively; NPP was calculated by Lee et al. (2020);
    NPPaboveground was calculated using aboveground dry matter and its carbon content;
    NPProot was calculated by aboveground/root ratio (10:1) (Huang et al., 2007);
    NPPlitter was calculated by 5% of the aboveground and root biomass (Kimura et
    al., 2004); NPPrhizodeposits was calculated by 15% of the total rice biomass (Mandal
    et al., 2008); The 0.52 was adopted for NPP and GPP conversions as reported by
    Zhang et al. (2009). The yield-scaled CH4 emission was calculated as follows (He
    et al., 2020): (7) where is the cumulative CH4 emission (kg C ha −1); Y is grain
    yield (t ha−1). 2.4. Statistical analyses Analysis of variance was performed to
    analyze the data separately for each year according to a split-plot design, using
    R software (version 4.2.1). The irrigation regime and biochar application were
    fixed effects, while replicates were random effects. Tukey’s HSD test at the 5%
    probability level was used to test the significance of differences among treatments.
    3. Results 3.1. Soil environment variables Soil NH4+-N usually peaked 1–4 days
    after each fertilizer and then declined rapidly (Fig. 1a, b). Soil NO3--N was
    much smaller than NH4+-N, which was relatively less affected by fertilizer application
    (Fig. 1c, d). Soil DOC is similar to soil NH4+-N, with a peak value appearing
    1–5 days after each fertilization application (Fig. 1e, f). Seasonal averaged
    NH4+-N, NO3--N, and DOC were significantly influenced by irrigation regime and
    biochar application (Table 1). IAWD reduced NH4+-N by 11.8% and 12.8% and DOC
    by 18.8% and 26.4% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, while increasing NO3--N by
    34.0% and 15.6%, compared to ICF. B1 increased NH4+-N by 16.4% and 13.2%, NO3--N
    by 21.2% and 9.4%, and DOC by 16.8% and 14.9% in 2021 and 2022, respectively,

    After the late tillering stage, soil Eh is divided into two distinct categories,
    mainly depending on irrigation regime (Fig. 2a, b). Seasonal averaged soil Eh
    was only significantly impacted by irrigation regime (Table 1). IAWD reached 66.4%
    and 60.6% higher soil Eh than ICF in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Fig. 3d). Soil
    pH tended to decrease first, then increase, and then decrease during the 2-year
    growth season (Fig. 2c, d). Seasonal averaged soil pH was only significantly influenced
    by irrigation regime (Table 1). IAWD increased soil pH by 2.9% and 2.0% compared
    to ICF in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Fig. 3e). Soil temperature in the two growing
    seasons increased first and then decreased (Fig. 2e, f). Soil temperature was
    not influenced by any factor (Table 1), but it can be observed that the soil temperature
    under IAWD tended to be higher than that under ICF, and seasonal averaged soil
    temperature under IAWD was numerically 5.4% and 6.8% higher than that under ICF
    in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Fig. 3f). Download : Download high-res image (499KB)

    the whole growing period, indicating the paddy ecosystem was a carbon sink. The
    NEE fluxes tended to a multi-peak curve during the whole rice growth throughout
    all the treatments, with relatively stable fluctuations at the seedling recovery
    and initial tillering stage. IAWD generally had lower NEE fluxes than ICF during
    the growing season. In contrast, biochar increased NEE fluxes in both years (Fig.

    Seasonal cumulative NEE was significantly impacted by irrigation regime and biochar

    and 2022, respectively, compared to ICF. B1 produced a 9.7% and 11.1% higher cumulative
    NEE than B0 in 2021 and 2022, respectively. IAWDB1 achieved a higher increase
    in cumulative NEE, 8.4% and 12.0% higher in 2021 and 2022, respectively, compared
    to IAWDB0 (Fig. 4e). Table 2. ANOVAs for seasonal cumulative NEE, CH4 emissions,

    1.2ns 3.3. CH4 Daily CH4 fluxes are mainly impacted by irrigation regime. IAWD
    considerably produced lower CH4 fluxes than ICF after the tillering stage. Under
    ICF, CH4 fluxes fluctuated greatly throughout the growing period, peaking at the
    jointing and tillering stages in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and then declining
    rapidly, while CH4 fluxes under IAWD reached a peak about 10 days after transplantation
    and then changed steadily over time. Moreover, B1 lower CH4 fluxes for both irrigation
    treatments (Fig. 4c, d). Seasonal cumulative CH4 emissions were significantly
    influenced by irrigation regime and biochar application in both years and their
    I × B interaction in 2022 (Table 2). IAWD reduced CH4 emissions by 81.1% and 87.6%
    in 2021 and 2022, respectively, compared to ICF. B1 reduced CH4 emissions by 25.8%
    and 38.9% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, compared to B0. The significant I ×
    B interaction in 2022 was caused by that B1 had a higher reduction under ICF than
    under IAWD. IAWDB1 achieved the highest decrease in CH4 emissions, 86.8%, and
    91.1% lower in 2021 and 2022, respectively, compared to ICFB0 (Fig. 4e). 3.4.

    and GPP by 7.2% and 10.4% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, compared to B0. IAWDB1
    achieved the highest increases in ADM and GPP, 9.2–16.4% and 9.1–16.1% higher
    in two years, respectively, compared to ICFB0 (Fig. 5a, b). Download : Download

    irrigation and alternate wetting and drying irrigation, respectively. B0 and B1
    represent biochar application rates at 0 and 20 t ha−1, respectively. Re was significantly
    influenced by biochar application in 2021 and 2022 and irrigation regime in 2022
    (Table 2). Although IAWD only significantly affected Re in 2022, it was 5.6% and
    6.2% higher than ICF in 2021 and 2022, respectively. B1 produced a 6.6% and 10.4%
    higher Re than B0 in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Fig. 5c). Rh was significantly
    influenced by irrigation regime and biochar application (Table 2). IAWD increased
    Rh by 11.0% and 7.3% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, compared to ICF. B1 increased
    Rh by 5.8% and 10.3% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, compared to B0. (Fig. 5d)
    IAWDB1 achieved the highest increases in Re and Rh among the four treatments,
    which were 12.5–17.1% and 17.5–18.3% higher than ICFB0 in two years, respectively
    (Fig. 5c, d). 3.5. Grain yield and yield-scaled CH4 emission Grain yield was only
    significantly impacted by biochar application in both years. B1 produced an 8.1%
    and 11.3% higher grain yield than B0 in 2021 and 2022, respectively. IAWDB1 achieved
    the highest increase in grain yield, with 10.0% and 15.7% increases relative to
    ICFB0 in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Table 3). Table 3. Means and ANOVAs for

    Yield-scaled CH4 emissions were significantly impacted by irrigation regime, biochar
    application, and the I × B interaction. IAWD reduced yield-scaled CH4 emissions
    by 81.3% and 88.2% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, compared to ICF. B1 reduced
    yield-scaled CH4 emissions by 30.4% and 44.6% in 2021 and 2022, respectively,
    compared to B0. The significant I × B interaction was caused by that B1 had a
    higher reduction under ICF than under IAWD. IAWDB1 had the lowest yield-scaled
    CH4 emissions, which are 89.9–92.3% lower than ICFB0 (Table 3). 3.6. Principal
    component analysis The principal component analysis results determined two principal
    components (PCs) with eigenvalues >1, which explained 92.2% of the total variation
    in soil environment properties, NEE, CH4 emissions, and grain yield (Fig. 6).
    The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 61.0% of the variability, and
    mainly contributed to CH4, yield-scaled CH4 emissions, soil Eh, pH, temperature,
    NO3--N, Rh, Re. PC2 explained 31.2% of the variability in NEE, GPP, yield, soil
    DOC, and NH4+-N. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download

    throughout the rice growth season. ICF and IAWD represent continuous flooding
    irrigation and alternate wetting and drying irrigation, respectively. B0 and B1
    represent biochar application rates at 0 and 20 t ha−1, respectively.T represent
    soil temperature. The correlation between PC1 and PC2 was shown in Fig. 6. Yield,
    GPP, Re, Rh and NO3--N were positively loaded on PC1 and PC2. CH4, yield-scaled
    CH4 emissions, DOC, NEE and NH4+-N were negatively loaded on PC1 but positively
    loaded on and PC2. Eh, pH and temperature were positively loaded on PC1 but negatively
    loaded on and PC2. ICF and IAWD regimes were separated by PC1 showing that CH4,
    yield-scaled CH4 emissions were negatively affected by the irrigation regimes
    from ICF to IAWD. In addition, biochar application moved the treatments towards
    the top of PC2, indicating that B1 had a positive effect on NEE, GPP, grain yield,
    soil DOC, and NH4+-N. 4. Discussion 4.1. NEE NEE is the main gauge of the strength
    of ecosystem carbon sinks (Kramer et al., 2002), and paddy ecosystem was a sink
    for CO2, due to that NEE was negative throughout most of the whole rice growing
    seasons (Fig. 4a and b). Some studies reported that IAWD reduced NEE in paddy
    fields through improved soil CO2 emissions (Yang et al., 2017, Jiang et al., 2021).
    Nevertheless, Oliver et al. (2019) reported that IAWD did not affect NEE in paddy
    fields because IAWD did not cause significant changes in soil carbon metabolism,
    and a relatively small amount of organic carbon available for oxidation had no
    effect on Re. Our results supported the former findings and showed that IAWD decreased
    NEE by 6.5–13.9% and therefore increased carbon release (Fig. 4e). The decreased
    NEE could be attributed to that IAWD had no effect on GPP while significantly
    increasing Rh and thus Re (Fig. 5b-d), since IAWD mainly affected Rh rather than
    rice autotrophic respiration (Ra) (Liu et al., 2021a). In our study, IAWD set
    different SWP thresholds according to different growth periods, which maintained
    rice yield and AMD (Zheng et al., 2018, Li et al., 2022), and therefore no effect
    on GPP. PCA showed that Rh was positively correlated with soil Eh, temperature,
    pH and NO3--N (Fig. 6). Alternating aeration under IAWD increased soil oxygen
    content, thus increasing soil Eh, temperature and pH (Fig. 3d-f), stimulating
    microbial activity and increasing Rh (Davidson et al., 1998, Moyano et al., 2013,
    Yang et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2019b). Alternating aeration also promoted nitrification
    and therefore increased NO3--N, while H+ released during nitrification resulted
    in increased soil CO2 emissions (Zamanian et al., 2018). Moreover, IAWD broke
    down soil aggregate structure during soil drying periods, which could reduce the
    physical protection of SOC and increase Rh(Cosentino et al., 2006). Numerous studies
    suggested biochar promotes or inhibits crop growth and CO2 emissions (Chen et
    al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019a, Zhang et al., 2021b, Liu et al., 2022b, Yang et
    al., 2022b), and these inevitably affected NEE. However, the effect of biochar
    on NEE is still inconsistent, even in paddy fields. NEE in paddy fields was not
    affected by biochar application at the rates of 20 and 40 t ha−1 (Zhang et al.,
    2013). In contrast, some studies suggested that NEE was increased at the rate
    of 20 t ha−1 and decreased at the higher rate of 40 t ha−1, due to increased soil
    CO2 emissions at higher biochar applications (Yang et al., 2020). Our results
    indicated that biochar improved NEE by 9.7–11.1% under both irrigation regimes
    (Fig. 4e). The increased NEE was attributed to that the increase in GPP (1.2–2.0 t C
    ha–1) was higher than Re (0.9–1.1 t C ha–1), and thus produce a higher NEE in
    turn, although biochar increased ecosystem carbon input and output (Fig. 5b and
    c). The PCA showed that GPP was positively correlated with soil NH4+-N and NO3--N
    (Fig. 6). The porous structure and high cation exchange capacity of biochar could
    adsorb NH4+-N and NO3--N to promoting rice nitrogen uptake and growth, thus increasing
    GPP (Fig. 3a and b) (Liu et al., 2022b, Li et al., 2023). Biochar could also promote
    photosynthetic rate and leaf area index (LAI), and produce more photosynthetic
    products (Rizwan et al., 2018, Li et al., 2023), therefore in turn producing higher
    GPP. However, biochar promoted rice growth and GPP while also increasing rice
    Ra, thus increasing Re. Unsurprisingly, the PCA analysis further showed that Re
    was positively correlated with GPP (Fig. 6). In addition, the increased Re was
    also attributed to increased Rh by biochar (Fig. 5d). Biochar promoted rice growth
    by increasing soil NH4+-N and NO3--N, which increased root exudates, thus increasing
    Rh (Fig. 3a and b) (Ru et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018). Moreover, biochar increased
    DOC and thus substrate availability, resulting in increased Rh (Fig. 3c) (Wang
    et al., 2018). We also found that IAWDB1 had no difference in NEE from ICFB0,
    but significantly more than IAWDB0 (Fig. 4e), suggesting that biochar has a higher
    potential of offsetting the negative effect of IAWD on NEE. The higher NEE under
    IAWDB1 was mainly attributed to biochar having the highest GPP under IAWD (Fig.
    5b). In our experiment, different SWP thresholds were set for IAWD according to
    the water stress of rice at different growth periods (Table 2), which did not
    inhibit rice growth but slightly promoted it (Zheng et al., 2018). Biochar significantly
    enhanced NH4+-N and NO3--N even under IAWD, thus further promoting rice growth
    to achieve the highest GPP. Overall, our results showed that biochar was able
    to offset the negative effect of IAWD on NEE by having a higher increase in GPP
    compared to Re. However, the effect of biochar on GPP and Re dynamics during rice
    growing periods under IAWD was unclear and worth further investigation. 4.2. CH4
    emissions IAWD had a major impact on mitigating CH4 emissions (Liu et al., 2021c,
    Islam et al., 2022). Our experiment confirmed these findings and demonstrated
    that IAWD reduced CH4 emissions by 81.1–87.6% (Fig. 4f). The PCA showed that CH4
    emissions were negatively correlated with soil Eh, temperature and pH (Fig. 6).
    Alternating aeration under IAWD increased soil oxygen content, thus increasing
    soil Eh and temperature, which inhibited methanogens and promoted CH4 oxidation
    by methanotrophs, resulting in lower methane emissions (Fig. 3d and f) (Islam
    et al., 2020a, Islam et al., 2020b). IAWD also promoted the activity of methanotrophs
    by increasing soil pH, which was due to improved pH benefiting methanogens as
    well as methanotrophs, but methanotrophs were more responsible for soil pH than
    methanogens with greater promotion (Fig. 3e) (Le Mer and Roger, 2001, Jeffery
    et al., 2016). Moreover, the PCA showed that CH4 emissions were positively correlated
    with soil DOC (Fig. 6). AWD decreased DOC, resulting in lower substrates for methanogens
    and thus decreased CH4 production (Fig. 3c) (Bertora et al., 2018, Nan et al.,
    2022). Numerous studies showed biochar mitigated CH4 emissions (Wang et al., 2019,
    Qi et al., 2021, Nan et al., 2022). Nevertheless, some reports showed biochar
    had no impact or even increased CH4 emissions (Liu et al., 2016, Qi et al., 2020,
    Cao et al., 2021). The inconsistent or even contradictory results probably were
    related to biochar characteristics, application rate, residence time, soil properties,
    and fertilizers (Butnan et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2019, Cao
    et al., 2021). Our findings suggested biochar reduced CH4 emissions by 25.8–38.9%
    (Fig. 4f), agreeing with most previous reports. Reduced CH4 emissions were reported
    to result from increasing soil Eh and pH due to biochar addition (Wang et al.,
    2019). The PCA showed that CH4 emissions were negatively correlated with soil
    Eh and pH (Fig. 6). However, biochar did not affect Eh and pH in our present experiments
    (Fig. 3d and e). This suggested that Eh and pH could not be the major factors
    in reducing CH4 emissions from biochar. The PCA also showed that CH4 emissions
    were positively correlated with soil DOC and NH4+-N (Fig. 6). In our experiments,
    it can be inferred that biochar probably promoted CH4 production by increasing
    soil DOC to provide substrate for methanogens (Fig. 3c). NH4+-N also stimulated
    methanogens growth by providing substrate from rhizodeposit and plant litter due
    to increased rice AMD (Fig. 3c and Fig. 5a)(Banger et al., 2012). Nevertheless,
    as much as 90% of CH4 is oxidized by methanotrophs before being released (Bosse
    and Frenzel, 1997). Biochar reduced CH4 emissions mainly through greatly increasing
    methanotrophic abundance rather than inhibiting methanogenic archaea growth (Feng
    et al., 2012). Previous studies reported biochar improved the abundance of methanogens
    and methanotrophs, with more methanotrophs than methanogens, largely because of
    increased soil DOC and NH4+-N, thus ultimately reducing CH4 emissions (Wang et
    al., 2019). The PCA showed that CH4 emissions were negatively correlated with
    soil NO3--N (Fig. 6). Biochar can decrease CH4 emission through increasing soil
    NO3--N, mainly due to soil NO3--N inhibiting methanogens and promoting methanotrophs
    activities (Fig. 3b) (Nan et al., 2022). Our results suggested that biochar further
    reduces CH4 emissions under IAWD because it had higher soil Eh, NO3--N, and lower
    DOC than under ICF (Fig. 3b-d and Fig. 6), However, the microbial mechanisms by
    which biochar reduced CH4 emissions under IAWD need to be further investigated.
    4.3. Grain yield and yield-scaled CH4 emission Most previous studies indicated
    IAWD exhibited no effect on grain yield (Chen et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2022a),
    but a significant increase (Sha et al., 2022) and decrease (Zhou et al., 2017)
    were reported. Whether IAWD caused yield loss depended mainly upon the extent
    and frequency of soil drying during the irrigation interval (Lampayan et al.,
    2015). When the SWP threshold for IAWD was fixed at −15kPa resulting in decreased
    yield (Zheng et al., 2018). Our results suggested that IAWD did not significantly
    affect yield, but was slightly higher than ICF (Table 3). In our experiment, IAWD
    set different SWP thresholds according to the different growth periods. At the
    late tillering stage, the SWP threshold under IAWD was −25 to 35 kPa (Table S2),
    which probably suppressed ineffective tiller numbers and allowed more nutrients
    and water to be allocated to productive tiller numbers, ultimately achieving slightly
    higher yields (Zheng et al., 2018). Numerous studies indicated biochar improved
    rice yield (Liu et al., 2011, Munda et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2020, Liu et al.,
    2022b). Nevertheless, some reports suggested biochar had no effect or even reduced
    yield (Haque et al., 2022, Yang et al., 2022b). Consistent with most previous
    studies, our studies indicated biochar increased grain yield by 8.1–11.3% (Table
    3). This was mainly due to that biochar increased NH4+-N and NO3--N (Fig. 3a,
    b), promoting nutrient uptake and nitrogen utilization by the rice roots (Liu
    et al., 2021b), thus promoting rice growth and achieving higher yields. In addition,
    biochar reduced the accumulation of harmful substances in rice fields and also
    improved the soil structure to produce a proper environment for rice growth (Lu
    et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2021a). Moreover, our results showed no significant
    difference in grain yield between ICFB1 and IAWDB1 treatments (Table 3). In our
    study, IAWD with the SWP threshold set according to the sensitivity of rice to
    water stress at specific growth stages maintained yield (Table S2). Although biochar
    had higher NH4+-N under ICF, however, biochar was probably lower in ineffective
    tiller numbers under IAWD, thus allocating more nutrients and water to productive
    tillers, and ultimately producing grain yield comparable to under ICF (Fig. 3a)
    (Zheng et al., 2018). Yield-scaled CH4 emission was an essential indicator to
    assess CH4 emissions and grain yields (Mosier et al., 2006). Our results suggested
    that IAWD reduced yield-scaled CH4 emission by 81.3%−88.2% (Table 3), similar
    to previous reports (Liang et al., 2016). It was attributed to water management
    that greatly reduced CH4 emissions and slightly increased yield (Guo et al., 2017).
    Our study also indicated biochar achieved 30.4–44.6% lower yield-scaled CH4 emission,
    agreeing with previous reports (Qi et al., 2021). It was attributed to biochar
    achieving lower CH4 emissions and higher grain yield (Qin et al., 2016). 5. Conclusions
    IAWD greatly decreased CH4 (81.1–87.6%) and yield-scaled CH4 emissions (81.3%−88.2%)
    while maintaining grain yield. IAWD also decreased NEE (6.5–13.9%) by increasing
    Rh and thus Re. Biochar reduced CH4 (25.8–38.9%), yield-scaled CH4 emissions (30.4–44.6%)
    while increasing grain yield (8.1–11.3%). Biochar increased both GPP and Re, but
    more to GPP than Re, thus increasing NEE (9.7–11.1%). Overall, Biochar combined
    with IAWD could mitigate the negative effects of IAWD on NEE while further reducing
    CH4 emissions and increasing grain yield, achieving a win-win situation of food-water-GHG
    emissions trade-off, which is beneficial to sustainable agricultural production.
    The long-term benefits of biochar on NEE and CH4 in IAWD paddy ecosystems are
    worth further exploration. CRediT authorship contribution statement Taotao Chen:

    learningDownscalingGWSAGroundwater depletion 1. Introduction Contributes a significant
    proportion of the global water supply and is pertinent to human survival. In terms
    of water quality, accessibility, and storage capacity, groundwater aquifers are
    generally considered the most valuable assets. Groundwater supplies fulfil agricultural,
    industrial, and drinking water requirements in dry and semi-arid regions all over
    the World. The pace of water exploitation from groundwater aquifers has dramatically
    increased in recent decades due to the rise in population, economic development,
    and due to climate change (Iqbal et al., 2016, 2017; Long et al., 2015, 2016;
    Tang et al., 2017; Khorrami and Gunduz, 2019, 2021a; Ali et al., 2021, 2022a,
    2022b; Arshad et al., 2020). Unrestrained pumping has led to a rapid decline in
    groundwater levels (Arshad et al., 2024), which in turn has led to a reduction
    in the quality of water and the emergence of environmental concerns such as the
    deformation of land (Iqbal et al., 2016; Khorrami et al., 2021). Water is crucial
    to economic growth and social progress in a predominantly agricultural country
    like Pakistan. Groundwater from the Indus Basin accounts for more than 60 % of
    the country''s water. The Upper Indus Plain, which consists of four riverine plains
    (locally referred to as “doabs\"), is the source of more than 80 % of the groundwater.
    Doab refers to the floodplain between two rivers, ideal for irrigated farming
    because of its fertile soil. More than 90 % of Pakistan''s agricultural output
    is dependent on groundwater supplies for irrigation (Qureshi et al., 2008), highlighting
    the necessity of regional and local groundwater monitoring and management (Rodell
    et al., 2009; Famiglietti et al., 2011; Long et al., 2016; Khorrami and Gunduz,
    2019; Ali et al., 2022a, 2022b). The over-abstraction of groundwater gives rise
    to many challenges in groundwater management. In Pakistan, groundwater managers
    face several issues including the depletion of the water table, excessive extraction
    of groundwater, degradation of groundwater quality, and the rise in salinity levels
    (Chandio and Larock, 1984; Sufi et al., 1998; Saeed and Ashraf, 2005; Khan et
    al., 2008; Qureshi et al., 2010; Arshad et al., 2024). Efficient management of
    groundwater necessitates the regular management of groundwater resources, being
    a crucial component. The assessment of groundwater extraction and variations in
    recharge rates are important factors in the implementation of sustainable groundwater
    management practices (Cheema et al., 2014; Shafeeque et al., 2023). The absence
    of a groundwater control policy in Punjab Province, Pakistan has increased the
    significance of groundwater resource management. Pakistan is classified among
    the leading four nations globally where the rate of groundwater abstraction has
    escalated to 80 km3/yr from 1961 to 2010, primarily due to excessive abstraction
    (Wada et al., 2010). The phenomenon of groundwater abstraction has been noted
    to be a result of the escalating population, urban expansion, and rapid irrigation
    development (Qureshi, 2011). Iqbal et al. (2016) have documented a significant
    decline in groundwater levels in the Punjab Province of Pakistan, with an annual
    loss of 13.5 mm measured between 2003 and 2010. Conventional groundwater monitoring
    methods rely heavily on readings from observation wells drilled underground. Although
    this method has the advantage of precise measurements, it is hindered by a lack
    of access to in-situ data from large basins because of limited observation networks
    and funding (Iqbal et al., 2016, 2017; Ali et al., 2021, 2022a), as well as issues
    arising from inadequate data sharing policies between countries (Seyoum et al.,
    2019). The above constraints must improve quantifying groundwater spatial variability
    and carrying out real-time monitoring practices (Chen et al., 2019a). As the first
    remote sensing project to track worldwide variations in gravity, the GRACE and
    GRACE-FO were introduced to the public in April 2002 and May 2018 (Khorrami et
    al., 2021, 2023; Ali et al., 2021). The monthly Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies
    (TWSA) are the result of the multi-step processing of gravity signals (Khorrami
    and Gunduz, 2021a, 2023; Ali et al., 2021; Khorrami et al., 2022). Despite their
    substantial spatial footprint, the scientific community has significantly benefited
    from the GRACE twin satellites. The Level 2 GRACE products were used to produce
    three spherical harmonic solutions (with a resolution of 1°) and two mascon solutions
    (with a resolution of 0.5°–0.25°), which have a spatial resolution of 3° × 3°
    (Watkins et al., 2015; Wiese et al., 2016). The Mass Concentration blocks (Mascons)
    are post-processed and ready to use. Save et al. (2016) state that these solutions
    can be applied to any scientific issue of interest because they are global and
    not specific to any one application. The current spatial resolution of Level-3
    solutions has been enhanced (Śliwińska et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2022a), but the
    GRACE mascon outputs still lack the necessary precision to evaluate groundwater
    depletion at a local scale. The downscaling of GRACE mascon solutions data to
    a higher spatial resolution enables the acquisition of enhanced physical information,
    which can be effectively utilized for local scale applications (Vishwakarma et
    al., 2021; Ali et al., 2021; Khorrami, 2023; Khorrami et al., 2023a). The GRACE/GRACE-FO
    observations, for instance, have been applied to the analysis of hydrologic extremes
    (Seyoum, 2018; Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021a), to manage drought events (Thomas et
    al., 2014; Chen et al., 2019d; Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021b; Khorrami et al., 2023b),
    and surface reservoirs and lakes (Hassan and Jin, 2014; Khorrami et al., 2023d),
    reservoir influencing mass transportation (Ran et al., 2019), evapotranspiration
    estimation (Long et al., 2014; Khorrami et al., 2023c) as well as identifying
    patterns in the growth or decline of water storage facilities across the globe
    (Seyoum and Milewski, 2016; Lezzaik and Milewski, 2018). Many studies have demonstrated
    GRACE''s capacity for tracking regional changes in groundwater storage (Swenson
    et al., 2003; Ran et al., 2013; Richey et al., 2015; Khorrami et al., 2023b).
    In the Indus Basin, groundwater changes have been quantified using a combination
    of GRACE data and land surface models (Iqbal et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2017;
    Ali et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2022a; Ali et al., 2022b; Arshad et al., 2022) and
    other watersheds around the world (Yang et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2019c). In
    a study conducted by Iqbal et al. (2016), an estimation was made about the fluctuations
    in groundwater storage within the Upper Indus Plain. The findings revealed a significant
    decrease in groundwater storage, with an annual loss of 13.5 mm observed between
    the years 2003 and 2010. In their study, Cheema et al. (2014) documented the abstraction
    of 68 km3 (262 mm) of groundwater and the depletion of 31 km3 (121 mm) in the
    Irrigated Indus Basin in 2007. Tang et al. (2017) conducted a reconstruction of
    groundwater storage on a yearly basis spanning the period from 1980 to 2015. Their
    findings revealed a notable decline in groundwater storage within the Punjab province
    of Pakistan, amounting to a loss of 13.6 ± 9.7 cm/yr. Zhu et al. (2021) estimated
    a loss of groundwater storage using GRACE data in the middle upper Indus plain
    aquifer of 1.57 mm/month from 2002 to 2020. Akhtar et al. (2022) observed mean
    annual depletion of groundwater storage ( 304.2 ± 749 mm) in lower Bari doab canal
    within the region of Indus basin from 2002 to 2017. The groundwater storage resources
    are observed to be declining with the rate of 3.39 ± 0.49 mm/yr in the Indus basin
    irrigation system (Ali et al., 2021, 2022b) and 4.16 ± 0.26 mm/yr in the lower
    Indus basin from 2003 to 2016 (Ali et al., 2022a). Arshad et al. (2022) investigated
    depletion of groundwater storage in different regions of UIPA, for instance, Thal
    doab ( 47.49 mm/yr), Upper Jehlum canal ( 55.11 mm/yr), Lower Jehlum canal ( 31.55
    mm/yr), and Lower Bari doab canal ( 63.88 mm/yr). However, GRACE-derived GWSA
    values are only useful on a regional to sub-regional scale if they are first downscaled
    from coarse to fine resolution (Miro and Famiglietti, 2018). The implementation
    of downscaling techniques for GRACE estimates has been recently carried out by
    utilizing simulated hydro-meteorological variables derived from hydrological models.
    Meanwhile, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) has been predominantly
    utilized by researchers globally to perform downscaling of the GRACE data (Rahaman
    et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019a; Yin et al., 2018; Verma and Katpatal, 2020;
    Ali et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021; Jyolsna et al., 2021; Karunakalage et al.,
    2021; Ali et al., 2022b; Ali et al., 2023; Ali et al., 2024). In recent years,
    there has been a development of machine learning techniques to address these challenges
    (Milewski et al., 2019; Seyoum et al., 2019). In their study, Chen et al. (2019a)
    employed the Random Forest (RF) method to downscale the resolution of TWSA and
    GWSA data. This was achieved by integrating six hydrological variables. The results
    indicated a maximum Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.68 and a correlation
    coefficient (R) of 0.83. Yin et al. (2018) employed Evapotranspiration (ET) data
    to perform the downscaling of GWSA in the North China Plain. However, it is worth
    noting that this particular approach was exclusively implemented in regions where
    a robust correlation between GRACE-derived GWSA and ET data was seen. Rahaman
    et al. (2019) employed the RF model to downscale the GRACE-derived GWSA data.
    The authors observed a notable increase in the NSE values, ranging from 0.58 to
    0.84, specifically inside the Northern High Plains aquifer. An artificial neural
    network (ANN) was employed to undertake downscaling of GWSA. The researchers successfully
    constructed maps depicting changes in GWSA from the years 2002–2010, achieving
    a greater level of resolution. The NSE values obtained varied from 0.0391 to 0.7511
    (Miro and Famiglietti, 2018). Ali et al. (2021) employed RF and ANN techniques
    to downscale GRACE TWSA and GWSA data in the Irrigated Indus Basin Irrigation
    System. The R values obtained ranged from 0.67 to 0.99. The Famine Early Warning
    Systems Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) is a model that utilizes
    the same modeling algorithm and data assimilation technique. However, it distinguishes
    itself by offering enhanced spatial resolution, with variables measured at a resolution
    of 10 km (Khorrami et al., 2023d). In contrast to the GLDAS model, the use of
    the FLDAS model is not extensively prevalent, particularly in the context of downscaling
    objectives. The FLDAS model was employed due to its superior spatial resolution
    estimates in comparison to the GLDAS model. The temporal sampling of soil moisture
    simulations in the FLDAS model is improved by a higher resolution, as demonstrated
    by Lu et al. (2019). In addition, it is worth noting that while both the GLDAS
    and FLDAS missions employ the Noah Land Surface Model (LSM), the FLDAS model demonstrates
    superior performance and increased accuracy in its simulations. This can be attributed
    to the utilization of CHIRPS as its forcing dataset, as supported by Agutu et
    al. (2017) and Shahzaman et al. (2021). This research improved the distributed
    estimation of groundwater storage and depletion variations using FLDAS high-resolution
    variables (Khorrami et al., 2023b, 2023d), leading to the development of a novel
    remote sensing-assisted spatial water balance approach for identifying GWSA variation
    hotspots. To estimate downscaled GWSA at 0.01° resolution, Arshad et al. (2022)
    resampled water storage component variables (soil moisture, snow water, and surface
    runoff) from 1° to 0.01° using the GLDAS-v2.1 model. However, the uncertainty
    in downscaling GWSA to high resolution might be attributed to the resampling technique
    not accounting for the geographical heterogeneity from 1° to 0.01° but instead
    smooths the spatial resolution of the data to 0.01°. For instance, Fig. 1 illustrates
    the difference between GLDAS smoothing data by resampling technique (Fig. 1b and
    e) and actual FLDAS data at 0.1° (Fig. 1c and f). Therefore, high-resolution data
    provided by the FLDAS simulation at spatial scale (Khorrami et al., 2023b, 2023d)
    to downscale the TWSA and GWSA to 0.1° was utilized to capture better spatial
    heterogeneity rather than resampling GLDAS data. To disseminate the quantification
    of GWSA over multiple doabs, GRACE data from a coarse resolution (0.5°) to a fine
    scale (0.1°) will be downscaled using the XGBoost model in the UIPA region. Download

    Basin groundwater aquifers are located in the Indus Plain, which is shared by
    Pakistan and India. The Upper and Lower Indus Plain Aquifers are the two divisions
    of Pakistan''s Indus Plain Aquifer. Four hydrological units in the Upper Indus
    Plain Aquifer (or “doabs\") make up the Upper Indus Plain Aquifer (UIPA). Fig.
    2 depicts the floodplains as four doabs labeled “Thal,\" “Chaj,\" “Rechna,\" and
    “Bari\". UIPA is home to vibrant soil and abundant agricultural potential with
    an area of 100,498 km2. The region under study is linked to the Indus Basin Irrigation
    System (IBIS), a system of canals used for collecting and transferring surface
    water for agricultural purposes. Precipitation-induced recharging is primarily
    accessible in the Doabs'' central regions (Khan et al., 2016). Forty years of
    data show that the average annual rainfall in the Upper Indus Plain Aquifer is
    around 580 mm (at Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, Sialkot, and Jhelum) (Iqbal et al.,
    2016). Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download : Download full-size

    Elevation Model (DEM) in ArcGIS, (b) elevation variations derived from DEM, (c)
    Siebert et al. (2015) generated a spatial dataset of irrigated land area, and
    (d) averaged (2003–2020) annual rainfall estimated using Climate Hazards Group
    InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) data. Since groundwater is not regulated,
    farmers can drill as many tube wells as they like, regardless of how deep they
    go. As a result, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of tube wells, with
    more than a million in the UIPA alone (Akhter et al., 2021). A 20°% rise (1991–2011)
    in the proportion of land submerged to a great depth below the water table indicates
    over-pumping, according to an examination of water level data (Ahmad et al., 2014).
    Lower flows in the eastern transboundary rivers (Ravi and Sutlej), under Indian
    control, have increased stress on the aquifer in the Bari and Rechna doabs (Fig.
    2). 3. Methodology 3.1. Dataset This investigation made use of a variety of datasets
    obtained from in situ and satellite. Table 1 summarizes the data properties, which
    will be further discussed in the following sections. Table 1. Summary of the data

    GRACE and GRACE-FO mascons The initial GRACE mission provided hydrological parameters
    from 2002 to 2017, and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) began as a continuation of the
    original project with a one-year delay in 2018. Basis functions like spherical
    harmonics (SH) (Bettadpur, 2012) and mass concentration blocks (Mascons) (Save
    et al., 2016) have been used to derive TWSA estimates from the GRACE satellite
    missions. By applying additional processing to the global gravity data, enhanced
    gravity solutions can produce more precise TWSA estimates (Khorrami and Gunduz,
    2021b). It has been observed that Mascon data can be used at the regional level
    with additional processing and increasing resolution (Scanlon et al., 2016). The
    Mascons have updated their spatial data to include an extra half degree at the
    equator, equivalent to 100,000 km2 of aerial coverage (Castellazzi et al., 2016;
    Scanlon et al., 2016). The TWSA data were obtained from GRACE JPL-Mascons release
    06 for this investigation. The original JPL product''s 3° × 3° spatial resolution
    was decreased to 1° × 1° using downscaling parameters determined from the Community
    Land Model (Lawrence et al., 2019) and then resampled to 0.5° × 0.5°. The linear
    interpolation technique was used to fill in the missing months in the GRACE datasets
    (Long et al., 2016). The missing gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO can be filled
    in using other different techniques such as the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
    (Nie et al., 2016), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms such
    as RF and XGBoost (Jing et al., 2020), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Li et
    al., 2020), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (Sun et al., 2019), Autoregressive
    Exogenous (ARX) (Forootan et al., 2014), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving
    Average with Exogenous Variables (SARIMAX) (Sun et al., 2020). Unfortunately,
    our study could not close the 11-month information gap between GRACE and GRACE-FO.
    3.1.2. FLDAS model NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), the USGS Earth Resources
    Observation and Science (EROS) Center, and the UCSB Climate Hazards Group (CHG)
    are working together on a data assimilation project called the Famine Early Warning
    Systems Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) (McNally et al., 2017).
    Hydro-meteorological variables can be simulated with FLDAS (Loeser et al., 2020)
    since it combines global-scale remote sensing, modeling, and in-situ data. Specifically,
    the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and the Noah model (McNally et
    al., 2017) are used as the underlying Land Surface Models (LSMs) for the simulations.
    The VIC and Noah models simulate the global-scale parameters with a spatial resolution
    of 0.25° and 0.1°, respectively. Noah is a well-known LSM that hydrologic modelers
    use because it can precisely predict water and energy fluxes in four soil layers
    (Zhuo et al., 2019). The Soil Moisture Storage (SMS), Evapotranspiration (ET),
    Temperature (T), Surface Runoff (Qs), and rainfall variables utilized in this
    study were all extracted from the most up-to-date version (version 4) of the FLDAS-Noah.
    3.1.3. In-situ observations The Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority (PIDA)
    website (https://irrigation.punjab.gov.pk/) was used to obtain 3368 measurements
    of groundwater level in June and October (before and after the monsoon), respectively.
    Outliers, unstable jumps, and gaps in the groundwater level data were removed
    during pre-processing. For validation purposes, Over the UIPA, we choose a sample
    of 398 groundwater level observations covering the years June 2003 through June
    2014. At first, we translated the in-situ observations of Depth-to-Groundwater
    (DTG) data from each observation well to the Groundwater Level (GWL) using their
    respective topographical heights above mean sea level (H) (Equation (1)). (1)
    The Groundwater Level Anomaly (GWLA) fluctuations were then retrieved by subtracting
    the similar baseline (mean of 2004–2009) used by the GRACE mission (Moghim, 2020;
    Ali et al., 2021; Arshad et al., 2022). Finally, the Specific Yield (Sy) of the
    unconfined aquifers was used in Equation (2) to determine the in-situ GWSA values.
    Multiplying the area-averaged Sy by groundwater anomalies to determine seasonal
    changes in groundwater storage (Strassberg et al., 2007). The Sy in the UIPA varies
    from 0.01 to 0.40 (Greenman et al., 1967). This investigation determined GWLA
    using an average Sy of 0.14 (Greenman et al., 1967). Each well''s GWSA can be
    determined by using the formula: (2) 3.2. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
    The XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that uses the gradient boost tree algorithm.
    When the gradient rises, new models are introduced to the final forecast to account
    for the residues or errors of earlier models (Chen and Guestrin, 2016). XGBoost
    builds many decision trees, but these trees are interdependent; the newest residuals
    or errors from the prior tree serve as the basis for the next tree. Each sample''s
    expected value is calculated by adding the values of the tree leaves. The multi-collinearity
    effect and complex nonlinear relationships are both easily handled by the random
    forest and XGBoost can also do the same for multi-collinearity without decreasing
    accuracy (Zhuo et al., 2019). The predictive value of each independent factor
    was calculated using a variable importance measure predictive (VIMP) test (Ali
    et al., 2021, 2023). Higher VIMP values represent more robust independent variables.
    More information about XGBoost model algorithm can be found here (Chen et al.,
    2016). Considering the distinctive advantages of XGBoost, including its ability
    to handle multiple inputs, achieve high precision, and identify the importance
    of variables (Ali et al., 2022b), it outperforms other machine learning models
    such as the random forest model (Rahaman et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019a, 2019b;
    Ali et al., 2021), support vector machine (SVM) (Chen et al., 2019a; Ali et al.,
    2022), and ANN (Chen et al., 2019a; Ali et al., 2022). The utilization of the
    XGBoost model has been increasingly prevalent in the fields of remote sensing
    and hydrology, as evidenced by the studies conducted by Ali et al. (2022b, 2023).
    3.2.1. Designing the downscaling algorithm GRACE-TWSA estimations were downscaled
    from 0.5° to 0.1° using the following steps in the XGBoost model. (i). The GRACE-JPL
    Mascon TWSA data, FLDAS data including rainfall, soil moisture storage, surface
    runoff, evapotranspiration, temperature, and SRTM data consists of elevation,
    aspect, and slope variables were used to develop the XGBoost model to predict
    TWSA at 0.5°. (ii). By subtracting the XGBoost model predicted TWSA from the original
    GRACE TWSA, the residual values were determined at 0.5°. (iii). To estimate TWSA
    at 0.1°, the trained model was employed on hydrological (rainfall, soil moisture
    storage, surface runoff, evapotranspiration, temperature) and geographical (elevation,
    aspect, and slope) variables at a spatial resolution of 0.1°. (iv). The downscaled
    TWSA was obtained by adding the interpolated residuals (from 0.5° to 0.1°) to
    the downscale TWSA observations at 0.1°. The residual correction eliminates any
    potential prediction bias due to missing variables and assures that the downscaled
    TWSA is consistent with the original data. (v). Finally, by deducting the SMS
    and Qs anomalies from the XGBoost-downscaled TWSA, we were able to derive the
    downscaled GWSA values. Fig. 4 depicts the overall analysis of the downscaling
    process. Download : Download high-res image (944KB) Download : Download full-size

    TWSA and GWSA downscaling process. 3.3. Extraction of downscaled groundwater storage
    Soil Moisture Anomaly (SMSA), Surface Runoff Anomaly (QsA), and GWSA are all included
    in TWSA, which is a vertically integrated hydrological variable (Iqbal et al.,
    2017; Tang et al., 2017; Ali et al., 2021, 2022a; Arshad et al., 2022). By isolating
    water storage component anomalies from XGBoost-based downscaled TWSA, it is possible
    to extract the fluctuations of downscaled GWSA. Equation (3) describes the structure
    of TWSA, and Equation (4) describes GWSA extraction. (3) (4) Subtracting SMSA
    and QsA from TWSA (Equation (4)) yields GWSA since SMSA is the primary driver
    of TWSA fluctuation in dry and semi-arid locations (Deng and Chen, 2017; Yang
    et al., 2018; Frappart and Ramillien, 2018). The SMSA and QsA components of this
    equation were calculated from the FLDAS Noah model. 3.4. Uncertainty estimation
    Uncertainty in downscaled TWSA (Equation (5)) is linked to the model''s input
    high-resolution variables (soil moisture, temperature, ET, rainfall, surface runoff,
    elevation, aspect, and slope). Each input variable''s uncertainty was quantified
    using the sample standard error, calculated using the standard deviation (Duan
    and Li, 2016). We used the error linearization propagation technique to estimate
    the standard deviation of the XGBoost-based downscaled TWSA (Faber, 2002; Duan
    and Li, 2016; Seyoum et al., 2019). (5) Error propagation theory, which states
    that errors in the GWSA and the land surface model outputs contribute to the overall
    uncertainty of the downscaled GWSA (Sahour et al., 2020), was used to assess the
    associated uncertainties of the downscaled GWSA values. Equation (6) was used
    to determine the downscaled GWSA errors. (6) where represents the parameter''s
    standard deviation. 3.5. Model performance evaluation Several statistical measures,
    such as Pearson''s correlation (R), percent bias (PBIAS), root mean square error
    (RMSE), and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), were employed to assess the performance
    of the XGBoost model and confirm the precision of the predicted TWSA. The formulas
    for R, PBIAS, RMSE, and NSE are given in Equations (7)–(10). Nearly perfect models
    have R and NSE values of 1, while RMSE and PBIAS values of 0 suggest perfection.

    of the model inputs The XGBoost model demonstrates the importance of each input
    variable in the final prediction. The relationships between the variables employed
    in the model affect its efficiency. The XGBoost model used in this research considers
    a range of variables, including rainfall, soil moisture storage, temperature,
    evapotranspiration, surface runoff, elevation, slope, aspect, and GRACE TWSA.
    The predictability of the model inputs for the study area was evaluated using
    the Variable Important Test (VIMP) test. Before and after applying permutation,
    the VIMP determines the prediction error variations for each input variable (Rahaman
    et al., 2019; Ali et al., 2021, 2023). When the VIMP values approach zero, it
    indicates that the variable has minimal impact or lacks predictive power. Fig.
    5 displays the predictive significance of the factors in the context of downscaling.
    Given that all the variables have values greater than zero. Hence, all the independent
    variables were deemed proficient in the process of downsizing the TWSA. The finding
    of the sensitivity analysis is shown in Fig. 5. The results show that ET and surface
    elevation (DEM), followed by rainfall, Qs, and SMS, are the most crucial factors
    in the XGBoost prediction of GRACE TWSA. However, the slope was the least helpful
    metric for predicting the GRACE TWSA using XGBoost. Since all of the independent
    variables are non-zero, they were considered to be expertly used in downscaling
    TWSA. Download : Download high-res image (109KB) Download : Download full-size

    and GRACE-derived TWSA exhibit a similar declining trend in the study area, with
    nearly the same variability in trend. Fig. 6a shows the variation between the
    TWSA time series before (0.5°) and after (0.1°) downscaling, with a correlation
    of 0.99. Monthly variations in the regional GRACE-derived and downscaled TWSA
    are 9.78 mm/month and 11.05 mm/month, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    downscaled and GRACE TWSA, and (b) scatter plot and one-to-one line of the XGBoost-predicted
    and GRACE-derived TWSA. The XGBoost model''s efficiency was evaluated by comparing
    the observed and predicted TWSA values. All four statistical measures (RMSE, PBIAS,
    R, and NSE) demonstrated the model''s performance. Fig. 6b shows that the XGBoost
    model performed very well and can be used to predict the finer resolution of TWSA
    over the research area, with a correlation coefficient over 0.95, an NSE over
    0.90, and an RMSE of about 23.98 mm. TWSA variations in August 2020 were mapped
    to check the spatial consistency of the TWSA before and after downscaling, as
    well as the GWSA estimation over the UIPA. Fig. 7 shows that the spatial distribution
    of the TWSA is consistent both in its original form (Fig. 7a) and after downscaling
    using the XGBoost model (Fig. 7f). The XGBoost model captures the spatial trend
    of the GRACE TWSA in the basin. Both the original and downscaled TWSA exhibit
    the same geographical variations over the UIPA, with higher values to the north
    and west and concentrated decreases to the interior and right north of the basin.
    To calculate the GWSA, subtract the SMSA and QsA from the downscaled TWSA. According
    to the thematic maps for the TWSA and GWSA, utilizing the downscaled products

    Temporal and spatial variations of groundwater storage Fig. 9 shows the temporal
    and spatial variations of the downscaled GWSA over the UIPA and its doab. Monthly
    variations in the GWSA across UIPA and its doabs indicated that water storage
    has decreased over time. Based on the GWSA''s monthly variations, it appears that
    the UIPA ( 6.19 mm/month) and its doabs such as Bari doab ( 6.42 mm/month), Chaj
    doab ( 4.12 mm/month), Rechna doab ( 4.60 mm/month), and Thal doab ( 6.69 mm/month))
    experienced a general downward trend from 2003 to 2010, an upward trend of 0.18
    mm/month was observed in UIPA, 1.45 mm/month in Bari doab, 0.16 mm/month in Chaj
    doab, 0.19 mm/month in Rechna doab, and 2.5 mm/month in Thal doab from 2011 to
    2015. Although, again decreasing trends of 5.36 mm/month, 4.62 mm/month, 4.38
    mm/month, 4.82 mm/month, and 4.82 mm/month in UIPA, Bari, Chaj, Rechna, and Thal
    doabs were observed from 2016 to 2020. The GWSA over the UIPA is estimated to
    observe a maximum storage loss of 290.20 mm in August 2020, the Bari doab of 292.13
    mm in July 2018, the Rechna of 390.44 mm in August 2020, the Chaj doab of 381.91
    mm in September 2020, and the Thal doab of 295.32 mm in August 2010. The GWSA,
    on the other hand, shows the most significant storage loss in August 2010 for
    UIPA, and it is all the doabs with values of 253.98 mm over UIPA, 191.22 mm over
    Bari doab, 254.09 mm over Rachna doab, 312.72 mm over Chaj doab, and 295.32 mm
    over Thal doab. The dry period analysis results for the Indus Basin (Iqbal et
    al., 2016; Ali et al., 2021, 2022a, 2022b) are consistent with the dry periods
    observed in the GWSA time series over the UIPA. Download : Download high-res image

    of GWSA over the UIPA and its doabs. The intensities of farming have significantly
    risen due to the insufficient fulfilment of agricultural water requirements through
    a combination of rainfall and surface water withdrawals during historical eras
    (Simons et al., 2020). Moreover, throughout the summer season, there is an augmentation
    in evapotranspiration rates, resulting in a further reduction in soil moisture
    levels and an escalation in the water requirements for agricultural crops. As
    a result, the overexploitation of groundwater in the IBIS region leads to drought.
    The average extraction of groundwater continuously surpasses the rate at which
    the aquifer is replenished, resulting in a notable reduction in the storage of
    groundwater over the year 2010 (see Fig. 9). According to Iqbal et al. (2016),
    a significant reduction in groundwater levels was seen during the year 2010. This
    finding indicates that the decline in groundwater storage has been consistently
    occurring between the years 2003 and 2010. Pakistan experienced a significant
    influx of precipitation during the monsoon season towards the conclusion of July
    in the year 2010. Fig. 9 depicts a notable upward trend in groundwater storage
    subsequent to August 2010, which had a substantial role in the process of replenishing
    following the occurrence of extensive flooding in the same month. The research
    area experienced a sequence of significant and localized flood events in the years
    2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, as documented by Rehman et al. (2015).
    Possible causes for the decline after 2016 include an insignificant rise in subsequent
    tube-well expansion and the redundancy of older tube wells, which leads to their
    eventual non-operational status. One possible cause is the abundance of tube wells
    in Punjab (Akhter et al., 2021). In Pakistan, the Punjab province accounts for
    almost 90 % of all groundwater abstraction, home to about 85 % of the country''s
    tube wells (Qureshi, 2020). The cropping intensity has increased from 80 % in
    1950 to 189 % in 2017 as a direct result of the expansion of tube wells (Qureshi,
    2020). To lessen the overexploitation and waste of precious groundwater, the government
    promotes using high-efficiency irrigation systems (Watto et al., 2018). However,
    it does not subsidize power use. The major cities (Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad,
    etc.) and the high-ends of doabs (the upper section of the Bari Doab) are where
    the water table has been reported to have significantly depleted (Akhter et al.,
    2021). Urbanization is the primary cause of groundwater depletion in urban areas
    because it limits groundwater recharge. However, an imbalance between recharge
    and pumping has developed due to excessive groundwater withdrawals for human use
    (Iqbal et al., 2016, 2017). Groundwater recharge, like groundwater depletion,
    varies in space and time. Seepage from the irrigation system is a crucial groundwater
    source in the Indus Basin (Iqbal et al., 2016). Several studies (Ashraf and Ahmad,
    2008; Khan et al., 2008; Awan and Ismaeel, 2014) on groundwater recharge have
    found that lower areas of doab regions have experienced groundwater depletion
    due to more excellent pumping than recharging. According to Khan et al. (2016)
    estimations, the lower sections of the Bari (Lodhran, Khanewal, and Multan), Chaj
    (Sargodha), and Rechna (Jhang, Faisalabad, and Toba Tek Singh) doabs have surpassed
    acceptable yields due to insufficient recharge in comparison with abstraction.
    Pakistan suffers from frequent floods because of the country''s climate. Despite
    the devastation, floods assist in strengthening the aquifer and make it more resistant
    to drought. Iqbal et al. (2016), Akhter et al. (2021), and Ali et al. (2021) all
    agree that the flooding events of 2010 and 2014 were crucial in promoting groundwater
    recharging in the region''s aquifer. 4.4. Validating the downscaled groundwater
    storage GRACE-derived and XGBoost-based downscaled GWSA were validated using the
    in-situ groundwater data. A pointwise approach (Fig. 3) was followed for validation
    purposes. The GRACE-derived, XGBoost downscaled, and in-situ values of GWSA were
    cross-validated. The validation results (Fig. 10) demonstrated that the downscaled
    GWSA has a more significant correlation (0.77) with the in-situ GWSA than the
    original GRACE-GWSA (0.75) at the seasonal scale. Previous studies (Iqbal et al.,
    2016, 2017; Ali et al., 2021, 2022a, 2022b; Arshad et al., 2022) also reported
    similar correlation. An enhanced correlation suggested that the XGBoost model
    accurately represented downscaled GWSA data at 0.1°. Download : Download high-res

    of the hydrological water cycle in the research region, together with its trend
    values and related uncertainties, is listed in Table 2. Uncertainties in soil
    moisture and surface runoff over the UIPA were estimated using the standard deviation
    of data generated from FLDAS Noah. As a result, the error in the downscaled GWSA
    was approximated using the principle of error propagation. Table 2. Monthly trend
    and uncertainty data for water cycle components. Watershed TWSA (mm/month) SMSA
    (mm/month) QsA (mm/month) GWSA (mm/month) UIPA Bari Rechna Chaj Thal As shown
    by the data, the downscaled GWSA in the UIPA, Bari, Rechna, Chaj, and Thal doabs
    has been decreasing at a rate of 11.36 mm/month, 11.55 mm/month, 10.08 mm/month,
    8.94 mm/month, and 11.57 mm/month between 2003 and 2020, respectively. Iqbal et
    al. (2017), Ali et al. (2021, 2022b), Ali et al. (2023), and Arshad et al. (2022)
    all researchers find that the vast water consumption due to industrial/agricultural
    expansion and population growth is most evident in the Chaj, where it accounts
    for the most significant variances in GWSA among the doabs of the research area.
    Results showed that the Rechna is the second largest river delta in UIPA to have
    considerably decreasing fluctuations in groundwater storage over time, despite
    its relatively positive status about groundwater. Soil moisture changes were shown
    to significantly influence TWSA shifts over the research region, as indicated
    by the trend data. The spatial representation of the yearly average trend of the
    downscaled GWSA (Fig. 11) showed that groundwater depletion has affected nearly
    the entire UIPA over the past 18 years, with maximum depletion rates of 2024 mm/yr
    concentrated in the east, particularly in the eastern parts of the Rechna and
    Bari doabs. According to the yearly trend map, a tiny percentage of the southern
    Bari and western Thal doabs indicated a minor declining tendency in the downscaled
    GWSA, with values as low as 19 mm/yr. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    GWSA over each basin were calculated using pixel size and basin area (Table 3).
    The findings showed that during the past 18 years, the UIPA''s groundwater aquifer
    has lost around 7.94 km3 of water storage capacity. Regarding overall groundwater
    depletion, the Bari ( 2.86 km3) and Thal ( 2.16 km3) basins proved to be the most
    crucial. However, the Rechna has had a minor depletion overall ( 0.84 km3) of
    any of the basins. Table 3. Zonal statistics of the volumetric GWSA. Watershed

    UIPA Bari Rechna Chaj Thal 5. Discussion 5.1. XGBoost downscaling Researchers
    and policymakers can get benefit significantly from improved water resource monitoring
    and evaluation by accessing more precise data on hydrometeorological variables''
    spatial and temporal fluctuation. The XGBoost algorithm was evaluated on downscaling
    GRACE estimates from a resolution of 0.5°–0.1° over the UIPA in Pakistan. The
    outcomes showed that XGBoost provides a high correlation in the prediction of
    TWSA and improved correlation with downscaled GWSA over the research region. Several
    researchers have identified a strong correlation between the XGBoost-based downscaled
    TWSA and the GRACE-TWSA. The correlation between the machine learning based downscaled
    and GRACE-based TWSA was reported to be 0.97, 0.97, 0.96, and 0.94 suggested by
    Ali et al. (2021, 2022b, 2023), Milewski et al. (2019), Chen et al. (2019a), and
    Rahaman et al. (2019), respectively. To make use of the statistical connection
    between the independent and dependent inputs, the XGBoost algorithm was developed.
    It follows that the accuracy of the input variables has a significant impact on
    the reliability and variability of the downscaled estimations. Regarding downscaling
    GRACE data, the GLDAS has been the leading model. Detailed and precise hydrometeorological
    variable simulations are used in the FLDAS model compared to GLDAS (Agutu et al.,
    2017; Shahzaman et al., 2021). In this research, the FLDAS simulations served
    as the basis for the downscaling processing. The findings showed that the FLDAS
    model has promising potential for GRACE downscaling if combined with the XGBoost
    model. The findings of the XGBoost sensitivity analysis showed that surface elevation,
    ET, and precipitation contribute more to XGBoost forecasting than previous studies
    in the region. These findings are in agreement with Ali et al. (2023), who reported
    that surface elevation and precipitation are essential factors in forecasting
    GRACE TWSA. The total water storage, in particular, is susceptible to changes
    in both surface elevation and precipitation (Khorrami and Gunduz, 2021a). The
    DEM is the most useful parameter of the XGBoost model because the area''s uniform
    terrain affects the range of hydro-meteorological variables experienced by UIPA.
    The XGBoost-based model predictions of the GRACE TWSA over the research region
    likely have some degree of control from the surface elevation orographic impacts
    (Ding et al., 2014) on weather variables like rainfall and temperature. The surface
    elevation was shown to substantially impact forecasting the GRACE data across
    the United States, as reported by Rahaman et al. (2019). 5.2. Limitations and
    future directions Our findings should be interpreted in light of the following
    constraints, which should be addressed in further studies to enhance the capacity
    to identify areas of rapid groundwater depletion. First, there are persistent
    gaps in the TWSA data obtained from the GRACE and GRACE-FO missions. As a result,
    accurate water resource monitoring is hampered by these missing values. Therefore,
    it is crucial to complete the missing information for a complete analysis of the
    hydrological cycle. Second, we limited ourselves to downscale GRACE Level 3 JPL
    Mascon estimates. The research can be deepened by downscaling other 1° (Spherical
    Harmonic) and 0.25° (Mascon) outputs to examine the reliability of the observed
    groundwater depletion hotspots. The third obstacle is the scarcity of groundwater
    level readings for the whole UIPA thorough validation process. The existing observational
    groundwater level data, however, support the estimates of groundwater loss. Similarly,
    the values we estimate are similar to those already present in the literature.
    6. Conclusion Large-scale evaluation and monitoring of fluctuations in terrestrial
    and groundwater storage entered a new era with the launch of the GRACE mission.
    However, small-scale watershed investigations have needed to be improved by the
    limited resolution of GRACE data. There is a growing need for higher-resolution
    data extraction from GRACE records due to the growing awareness of the importance
    of understanding local fluctuations in these parameters for more effective management
    and planning of water resources. Recently, the GRACE downscaling procedures have
    been put into practice globally using various statistical methods. The current
    study utilized simulated parameters at a resolution of 0.1° to produce GRACE data
    that was based on the XGBoost algorithm. The result of this research implies that
    the XGBoost model accurately and successfully simulated TWSA and GWSA at 0.1°
    across the study region. The XGBoost model is very useful not only in enhancing
    the spatial resolution of the coarse GRACE estimates but also good at ensuring
    the accuracy of the estimates with improved correlation value (from 0.75 to 0.77),
    as measured by comparison with in-situ groundwater level observations. Since the
    accuracy of the input variables has a direct impact on the quality of the final
    simulations, the relationship between the target and the input variables is crucial
    to the success of statistical downscaling procedures. There is uncertainty surrounding
    the model-based parameters due to the land surface model and techniques employed.
    Downscaling using high-precision satellite estimations of hydrometeorological
    parameters, then, has the potential to improve the model''s accuracy. The study
    also requires validation of the downscaling GWSA. But due to the large area of
    the basin, it is difficult to get desired data from groundwater observations,
    which could affect the accuracy level of downscaled GRACE estimates for basin-scale
    changes of the GWSA. According to the authors, better correlation values can be
    acquired by validation utilizing additional in-situ groundwater data at different
    temporal levels. CRediT authorship contribution statement Shoaib Ali: Writing

  description: Irrigated forage production systems are intensive and highly exhaustive
    on nutrients. Integration of cover crops in irrigated forage crop rotation could
    be a strategy to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and improve nutrient
    cycling. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on cover cropping
    strategies for improving soil health, SOC sequestration, and nutrient cycling
    in forage-based crop rotations in arid and semi-arid environments. A four-year
    study (2018–2022) evaluated the effects of cover crops on soil carbon and nitrogen
    (N) pools and nutrient concentrations in no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) – sorghum
    [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] rotation. We aimed to quantify the response of SOC
    and N pools and other nutrients with cover cropping and elucidate their SOC sequestration
    potential under a forage-based crop rotation in semi-arid environments. Cover
    crop treatments included a mixture of grasses, brassicas, and legumes (GBL), grasses
    and brassicas (GB), grasses and legumes (GL), and no cover crop (NCC). Soil samples
    were collected from 0–80 cm profiles and measured for potentially mineralizable
    carbon (PMC), SOC, total labile N (TLN), inorganic N, available Phosphorus (P),
    Potassium (K), and other macro and micronutrients as soil health indicators. Soil
    PMC content under GB treatment was greater than NCC at 10–20 (85.5%) and 20–40
    (70.5%) cm soil depth. The SOC was greater under GBL than under NCC at 0–60 cm
    (12 to 43%), while TLN was greater under GL than NCC at 0–20 cm depth (27 to 35%).
    The GBL mixture also enhanced soil N, P, and K within the upper 0–10 cm soil layer.
    The SOC stock at 0–80 cm depth under cover crops was 7–22% greater than under
    NCC, resulting in SOC sequestration of 1.5–2.3 Mg C ha-1 y-1 in cover crop plots.
    Cover cropping can increase SOC sequestration in irrigated cropping systems in
    semi-arid environments. Considerable increases in labile C and N components in
    the soil profile with cover cropping indicate long-term improvement in soil health
    and productivity through increased total SOC storage and improved nutrient cycling.

    forage production systems are intensive and highly exhaustive on nutrients. Integration
    of cover crops in irrigated forage crop rotation could be a strategy to increase
    soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and improve nutrient cycling. However, there
    is a lack of comprehensive information on cover cropping strategies for improving
    soil health, SOC sequestration, and nutrient cycling in forage-based crop rotations
    in arid and semi-arid environments. A four-year study (2018–2022) evaluated the
    effects of cover crops on soil carbon and nitrogen (N) pools and nutrient concentrations
    in no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) – sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] rotation.
    We aimed to quantify the response of SOC and N pools and other nutrients with
    cover cropping and elucidate their SOC sequestration potential under a forage-based
    crop rotation in semi-arid environments. Cover crop treatments included a mixture
    of grasses, brassicas, and legumes (GBL), grasses and brassicas (GB), grasses
    and legumes (GL), and no cover crop (NCC). Soil samples were collected from 0–80
    cm profiles and measured for potentially mineralizable carbon (PMC), SOC, total
    labile N (TLN), inorganic N, available Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), and other
    macro and micronutrients as soil health indicators. Soil PMC content under GB
    treatment was greater than NCC at 10–20 (85.5%) and 20–40 (70.5%) cm soil depth
    . The SOC was greater under GBL than under NCC at 0–60 cm (12 to 43%), while TLN
    was greater under GL than NCC at 0–20 cm depth (27 to 35%). The GBL mixture also
    enhanced soil N, P, and K within the upper 0–10 cm soil layer. The SOC stock at
    0–80 cm depth under cover crops was 7–22% greater than under NCC, resulting in
    SOC sequestration of 1.5–2.3 Mg C ha-1 y-1 in cover crop plots. Cover cropping
    can increase SOC sequestration in irrigated cropping systems in semi-arid environments.
    Considerable increases in labile C and N components in the soil profile with cover
    cropping indicate long-term improvement in soil health and productivity through
    increased total SOC storage and improved nutrient cycling. Previous article in

    security for ecosystems and societies (Manter et al., 2017, Miner et al., 2020).
    The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN-FAO) estimated that nearly
    95% of food production depends on soils (Food and Agriculture Organization FAO,
    2017). Therefore, soil health management holds fundamental significance in agricultural
    systems, yet robust evidence points to the prevalent degradation of agricultural
    soils (Kibblewhite et al., 2008, European Commission, 2002), significantly impacting
    agricultural productivity and ecosystem functions it provides (Tilman et al.,
    2011). According to estimates, soil degradation is so rapid that soil ecosystem
    services declined by 60% between 1950 and 2010 (León and Osorio, 2014, Lal, 2015a).
    Degraded soils are often low in soil organic carbon (SOC) contents (Lal, 2018),
    and their capacity for nutrient absorption, fixation, and transformation is compromised
    due to reduced soil biodiversity crucial for nutrient cycling (Wagg et al., 2014).
    Improved knowledge of management practices that increase SOC storage and nutrient
    cycling in low-fertility soils of semi-arid environments will enhance soil health
    and agricultural sustainability in the region. Cover crops are increasingly used
    across the United States to enhance soil quality and promote C sequestration (Smith
    et al., 2014, Poeplau and Don, 2015). Cover crops improve soil structure, increase
    SOC content, and reduce soil erosion, crucial for mitigating climate change impacts
    and fostering agricultural resilience (Blanco‐Canqui et al., 2015, Lal, 2015b).
    Wulanningtyas et al. (2021) suggested that a no-tillage rye (Secale cereale L.)
    cover crop system is promising for improving soil health and SOC. Similarly, a
    five-year study examining rye cover crops in no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) system
    found a noteworthy increase in potentially mineralizable N, particularly within
    0–5 cm soil depth (Obrycki et al., 2018). Comparing nonlegume cover crops and
    their termination timing, Singh et al. (2020) showed SOC increase at 0–10 cm soil
    under a no-tillage corn system in the semi-arid environments . A global meta-analysis
    examining the impact of cover crops on corn yield found that grass cover crop
    species such as rye, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and
    annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) did not affect corn yield. Ghimire et
    al. (2019a) discovered that oat cover crops in winter wheat-fallow systems for
    two years led to an 18 to 20% greater SOC and soil total N compared to pea (Pisum
    sativum L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.) mixture. Cover crops can change soil
    properties, mainly when evaluated over longer timeframes (Olson et al., 2014,
    Blanco-Canqui et al., 2011, Basche et al., 2016). Although cover crops offer numerous
    beneficial attributes, their adoption remains limited in semi-arid environments
    (Snapp et al., 2005, Nielsen et al., 2015) because limited information is available
    on the effects of cover cropping and increased crop diversity on soil health and
    agrosystems resilience (Ghimire et al., 2019b). Cover crops have been reported
    to reduce cash crop yields in areas where water used by cover crops is not compensated
    by additional irrigation or precipitation (Nielsen et al., 2015). This reduction
    is often associated with factors such as water depletion caused by cover crops
    or delayed emergence and growth of the cash crop (Westgate and Singer, 2005).
    The influence of cover crops on soil health varies depending on factors such as
    agro-climatic region, soil type, the timing of cover crop planting and termination,
    and the method of cover crop residue incorporation into the soil (Ghimire et al.,
    2018, Ghimire et al., 2019a). Interest in cover cropping has surged in the midwest
    region of the USA due to promotional and educational efforts by the USDA-NRCS
    and private companies (Acuña and Villamil, 2014). Despite similar efforts in arid
    and semi-arid regions, the slow adoption rate of cover cropping in this area is
    associated with low biomass production and water availability for the subsequent
    cash crop. Carefully selecting suitable cover crops that maximize biomass production
    with little water available in the region is pivotal in preserving soil water,
    increasing SOC, and enhancing cash crop yields (Nielsen et al., 2015, Ghimire
    et al., 2019a, Acharya et al., 2022a). Sustainable intensification of agricultural
    systems in water-limited environments requires increased biomass production without
    a corresponding increase in fertilizer inputs while minimizing the depletion of
    soil C and N stocks (Chen et al., 2023). It is more critical for irrigated forage
    cropping systems in the southwestern United States, which supplies feed to the
    region’s livestock industry (Paye et al., 2022a, Paye et al., 2022b), but exhaustive
    on the soils. Integration of cover crops in such cropping systems could be a strategy
    to increase SOC storage, improve nutrient cycling, and provide crop rotation benefits.
    However, there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluations regarding the long-term
    utilization of cover crops in crop rotations in water-limited environments. In
    addition, most studies are confined to evaluating SOC sequestration in the surface
    soils (usually < 30 cm), while the importance of deep profile soil C and nutrient
    assessments have been suggested by previous studies (Acharya et al., 2022a, Dougherty
    et al., 2022, Tautges et al., 2019). The main objective of this study (2018–2022)
    was to evaluate the impact of various cover crop mixtures on soil profile C and
    N pools and other nutrients in corn–sorghum rotation after four years of cover
    cropping. We hypothesized that long-term use of cover crops in the forage production
    system would maintain soil health and increase soil C and N. Adopting such practices
    could contribute to more resilient ecosystems and ensure the sustainable use of
    natural resources in cropping systems in water-limited regions. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Experimental site and treatments This research was conducted at the
    New Mexico State University Agricultural Science Center, Clovis, NM (34° 35′ 59′
    N, 103° 13′ 06′ W, and elevation 1368 masl). The study site is characterized by
    a ustic moisture regime approaching aridic conditions, indicating that the moisture
    control section stays dry for more than 180 but less than 205 days a year . The
    field remained fallow for six months, followed by oats (Avena sativa) grown as
    a smoother crop, before initiating the study plots. The field experiment was established
    in the fall of 2018 on the Olton clay loam soil. Details of the soil and weather
    conditions have been discussed by Acharya et al. (2022b). In brief, the study
    site has a hot, dry, and semi-arid climate. The baseline soil samples from 0–80
    cm depth had a bulk density of 1.10–1.30 Mg m-3, pH of 7.7–8.4, and electrical
    conductivity of 0.2–0.4 dS m-1(Table 1). The average annual precipitation in the
    area is 462 mm, and the minimum and maximum air temperatures are 22.6 °C and 6.1
    °C, respectively. Table 1. Soil properties measured before starting the experiment

    block design with four cover crop treatments and eight replications. Each treatment
    plot was 12.2 m long × 9.1 m wide. The research was conducted in no-tillage corn-sorghum
    rotation with the winter fallow period from late September to early May of the
    following year. Both corn and sorghum phases of rotations were present each year,
    and cover crops were introduced to replace the winter fallow period. Cover crop
    treatments included a mixture of grasses, brassicas, and legumes (GBL), grasses
    and brassicas (GB), grasses and legumes (GL), and no cover crop (NCC). Grasses
    comprised annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and winter triticale (× Triticosecale
    Wittmack). Brassicas included turnip (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa L.) and daikon
    radish (Raphanus sativus var. longipinnatus Bailey), while legumes contained pea
    (Pisum sativum subsp. arevense L.) and berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum
    L.). The cover crops were planted annually in late September using a double-disc
    drill opener (Model 3P600, Great Plains Manufacturing Inc., Salina, KS, USA) at
    a row spacing of 0.15 m and a seeding depth of 0.02 m. Seeding rates for cover
    crops differed among treatments and were established based on individual seed
    size and germination potential to ensure a similar plant population for each species
    combination (Acharya et al., 2022b). Irrigation was applied using a center pivot
    system for cover crop germination and establishment. No fertilizers were applied
    to cover crops. The cover crops were chemically terminated in April last week
    using herbicide mixtures as described in Paye et al. (2022a), and cover crop residues
    were not removed from the field. Forage corn (variety Pioneer P1828AM) and sorghum
    (variety Opal) were planted in mid-May at a rate of 61,776 and 123,533 plants
    ha-1, respectively, for the first two years. The same corn variety was continued
    in the third and fourth years of the study, but the sorghum variety was changed
    to Pearl (same plant population) in the third and fourth years because of the
    low germination of Opal in the first two years. Forage crops were planted using
    a John Deere planter (Deere and Company, Moline, IL, USA) and adjusted to maintain
    0.76-m row spacing. The recommended dose of fertilizer for the sorghum and corn
    silage production during the first year was applied based on the soil test report
    in 2018, and the same amount was used for the remaining study years. A single
    dose of N, P, sulfate-sulfur (S), and zinc (Zn) was applied within two days of
    cash crop planting at a rate of 171kg N ha-1 as urea and ammonium nitrate, 42.0
    kg P ha-1 as ammonium phosphate, 28.3 kg S ha-1 as ammonium sulfate and 7.02 L
    Zn ha-1 as chelated zinc, respectively. Irrigation for the corn and sorghum was
    applied based on the crop need and soil water content and was adjusted based on
    the precipitation. 2.2. Soil sampling and laboratory analysis Deep-core soil samples
    (0–80 cm) were collected in September 2018 before the field experiment establishment
    (baseline) and then again after four years of the corn-sorghum rotation in September
    2022. The samples were collected using a tractor-mounted giddings hydraulic probe
    (Giddings Machine Company Inc., Windsor, CO). Two soil cores were collected from
    each plot, and then samples were divided into 0–10, 10–20, 20–40, 40–60, and 60–80
    cm depth intervals, homogenized and combined by depth. The soil samples were taken
    to the laboratory for analysis, and about 20 g of subsamples were used to estimate
    soil moisture. The remaining soil samples were stored at 4 °C in a refrigerator
    to estimate potentially mineralizable carbon (PMC), total labile nitrogen (TLN),
    and SOC. Soil PMC was measured using 22 g of soil at field capacity (23% v/v)
    placed in a 1-liter mason jar. The soil was then subjected to aerobic incubation
    for 72 h, and then measurements of CO2 emissions in an infrared gas analyzer (LI-830,
    Licor Inc.) (Zibilske, 1994). The TLN concentration was measured by boiling 5
    g of the soil sample for 4 h with 25 mL of 1 M KCl in a Pyrex glass tube in a
    100 °C water bath. After boiling, the extract was filtered, and NO3– and NH4+
    ions were analyzed as inorganic N (Gianello and Bremner, 1986). After air-drying,
    the soil subsamples were ground to pass through < 0.5 mm sieve and analyzed for
    concentration of soil total C using dry combustion analysis (LECO corporation,
    St. Joseph, MI, USA). Soil inorganic C was estimated using the acidification method
    in a total inorganic C analyzer (UIC, Inc. Joliet, IL, USA). SOC and soil organic
    nitrogen (SON) were calculated by subtracting the inorganic C and N fractions
    from the total C and N, respectively. Soil bulk density was calculated by oven-drying
    undisturbed soil core samples at 105 °C for 24 h and then dividing the weight
    of oven-dried soil samples by core volume. The contents of PMC, TLN (kg ha-1),
    SOC (Mg ha-1), SON (Mg ha-1), and soil inorganic N contents (kg ha-1) were determined
    by multiplying their concentrations (mg kg-1) by the soil bulk density (g cm-3)
    and thickness of each soil layer. The SOC , SON , and soil inorganic N stocks
    were estimated by summing the SOC, SON, and soil inorganic N content in all soil
    layers within each depth. The SOC sequestration rate was calculated by using Eq.
    (1). (1) The soil samples were air-dried to analyze for nitrate N (NO3−-N), Olsen
    P, K, S, Zn, and boron (B). The NO3−-N concentration in the soil was measured
    using a flow injection analyzer after extracting the soil with calcium chloride
    (Houba et al., 2000). Available P was determined by extracting soils in 0.5 M
    sodium bicarbonate, and the concentration was measured using a spectrophotometer
    (Olsen, 1954). To measure the calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and K concentration
    in the soil, the soil was extracted using 1 N ammonium acetate solution, and the
    concentration was measured with an inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometer
    (Thomas, 1983). Sulfate-S concentration in soil was measured in the flow injection
    analyzer after the soil extraction with calcium phosphate solution (Schulte and
    Eik, 1988). Micronutrients such as iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), sodium
    (Na), Zn, and B were analyzed after soil extraction with a diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
    acid solution (Lindsay and Norvell, 1978). 2.3. Statistical analysis Data collected
    for each parameter was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a randomized
    complete block design in R version 4.2.1 using Agricolae package version 1.2–8.
    Data for each soil depth were analyzed separately to understand treatment effects
    on each response variable. The values of parameters shown in tables and figures
    for a cover crop treatment are the average values observed for a given soil depth.
    All the data were thoroughly examined and met the assumptions of homogeneity of
    variance and normality of residuals. Treatment means were separated using the
    Fisher''s protected least significant difference (LSD) test at the significance
    level of P ≤ 0.05. The Origin Pro 2018b (Northampton, MA) was used to make the
    figures. Pearson’s correlation analysis was conducted at P ≤ 0.05 to evaluate
    the linear relationship between soil C sequestration and nutrients at 0–80 cm
    soil depth. 3. Results 3.1. Baseline soil carbon and nutrient status Soil samples
    collected in September 2018, before the establishment of the experiment, show
    low SOC, PMC, and TLN contents. Among nutrients, K and Ca were within the medium
    to high range, while N, P, S, Fe, Mn, and Zn were in the low to medium range based
    on the soil test data (Table 1). 3.2. Soil profile distribution of carbon and
    nitrogen pools Soil PMC content significantly differed among cover crop treatments
    at 10–20 and 20–40 cm (Fig. 1a), with GB treatment containing 85.4% and 70.5%
    more PMC than in the NCC. However, there was no significant difference among the
    cover crop treatments for PMC at 0–10, 40–60, and 60–80 cm. The SOC significantly
    differed among treatments at 0–10, 10–20, and 40–60 cm soil depths. GBL had 23.8%
    and 11.5% greater SOC than NCC at the 0–10 and 10–20 cm, respectively (Fig. 1b).
    At 40–60 cm, GBL had 37.4% and 41.4% greater SOC than GB and NCC, respectively.
    The SOC content did not differ among the treatments at 20–40 and 60–80 cm depths,
    although it was consistently higher in GBL than other treatments across the soil
    profile. Soil TLN at 0–10 cm was similar among all treatments. At 10–20 cm, TLN
    contents significantly differed among treatments, where GL had 27% and 26% greater
    TLN contents than NCC and GB (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    and sequestration rates The average SOC stock at 0–80 cm depth under GBL (58.4
    Mg ha-1) was 22.4% higher than the NCC (47.7 Mg ha-1) (Table 2). The SOC stock
    in GB and GL was statistically similar to GBL as well as NCC, with numerically
    7.14% and 10.0% greater SOC content than NCC. The SON stock did not differ significantly
    among the treatments, but the 0–80 cm soil had 13.9%, 13.0%, and 10.4% more SON
    stock under GBL, GL, and GB treatments than the NCC. In contrast, soil inorganic
    N stock under NCC treatment was 45.8 kg ha-1, significantly greater than cover
    crop treatments. Soil profile SOC sequestration was significantly greater under
    GBL (2.30 Mg C ha-1 y-1) than GL (1.60 Mg C ha-1 y-1) and GB (1.59 Mg C ha-1 y-1).
    Total N storage was not affected by the cover crop treatments in the 0–80 cm layer,
    but it was decreased in all the treatments compared to the baseline data. The
    C:N ratio did not differ among treatments. However, the C:N ratios under GBL,
    GB, and GL were 15.9%, 4.41%, and 1.82% higher than those under NCC. Table 2.

    treatments at all soil depths except at 0–10 cm (Table 3). The NCC treatment had
    2.9–4.7, 6.7–11.1, 6.0–14.0, and 11.7–22.1 times higher at 10–20, 20–40, 40–60,
    and 60–80 cm depths, respectively. Available P did not differ among treatments
    at all the depths (Table 3). However, the soil at 0–10, 10–20, and 20–40 cm depths
    had more available P in the GBL than other treatments. In contrast to upper depths,
    available P at 40–60 and 60–80 cm was higher in the NCC than in cover crop treatments.
    Soil K significantly varied among treatments at 0–10 cm depth, where GL (409 mg kg−1)
    had 21.7% higher K than in NCC (Table 3). Soil sulfate-S significantly varied
    among treatments at 10–20 and 20–40 cm depths (Table 3). NCC had 25.9 mg kg−1
    of sulfate-S at 10–20 cm depth, which was 65.5% and 59.7% more than in GL and
    GBL, respectively. At 20–40 cm, NCC had 32.4 mg kg−1 sulfate-S, 41–67% higher
    than other treatments. Table 3. Soil nitrate-nitrogen (NO3− -N), available phosphorus

    increased labile carbon and nitrogen in the soil profile The changes in soil health
    with cover cropping were evaluated by monitoring labile components of SOC and
    N, including PMC, inorganic N, and TLN. The additional organic input from cover
    crops above- and belowground residues serve as energy sources for soil microbes,
    increasing their activity and decomposition (Roldán et al., 2003). In this study,
    residue addition from the diverse cover crop mixtures increased the C sources
    for microbes and enhanced microbial processing of these C compounds into more
    labile and stable organic matter. Grass cover crop species exhibit dense root
    systems and produce greater root biomass, contributing to root-derived C into
    the soil (Thapa et al., 2022, Amsili and Kaye, 2021). Similarly, legume and brassica
    cover crop residues decompose rapidly, which enhances microbial growth and activity,
    ultimately leading to increased labile and recalcitrant organic matter pools (Bloszies
    et al., 2022). Compared to fallow, diverse cover crop mixtures generally show
    higher enzyme activity related to C and nutrient cycling (Thapa et al., 2021).
    Other factors, including the adoption of no-tillage management since the beginning
    of this study, inherently low SOC content in cultivated soils, and soils characterized
    by higher clay content, are the potential factors to increase SOC response to
    cover crops (McClelland et al., 2021). Previous studies from the semi-arid SHP
    indicate that adopting cover crops may take more than five years to enhance SOC
    effectively in ecosystems where soils are significantly depleted in C and transitioning
    to limited-irrigation or dryland conditions (Ghimire et al., 2019a; Don et al.,
    2009). Irrigated cash crop production with rainfed production of cover crops after
    establishment in this study showed an increase in SOC within four years. Specifically,
    our results showed that SOC significantly increased at 0–20 cm depth under GBL
    where C input was greatest. The TLN content was significantly greater under cover
    crops than under NCC at 0–20 cm. Long-term cover cropping has improved N mineralization
    and biomass decomposition, significantly improving soil inorganic N and TLN at
    topsoil (Freidenreich et al., 2022). Higher TLN in cover-cropped systems could
    be related to SOC accumulation derived from the above- and belowground residues,
    root exudates, and microbial necromass. In addition, greater TLN under GBL and
    GL treatments at 10–20 cm depth suggest an addition of N through atmospheric N
    fixation and the rapid turnover of cover crop biomass during the high summer temperatures
    (Acharya et al., 2022a, Sainju et al., 2002). In addition, N fertilizer application
    during the cash crop period may have increased inorganic N in the soil and expedited
    the residue decomposition process. Our study involved the adoption of no-tillage
    in low fertility soils with baseline NO3− -N of 6.4 to 27.0 mg kg-1 in 0–80 cm
    soil profile. Soil NO3− -N was significantly less under cover crops than under
    NCC at all soil depths and 0–80 cm profile (Table 2, Table 3), potentially due
    to the utilization of inorganic N by cover crops for their growth, while in the
    absence of live vegetation, NCC stored inorganic N, mostly NO3--N. Plants prefer
    to uptake NO3− -N over NH4+ -N (Blair et al., 1970). In addition, various studies
    have shown that non-legume cover crops have a greater ability to scavenge nutrients,
    particularly NO3− -N, than legume cover crops (Adetunji et al., 2020; Dabney et
    al., 2010; Quemada et al., 2013). Studies have also demonstrated that grass cover
    crops with a high C:N ratio decompose slower, leading to soil N immobilization.
    As a result, greater amounts of N fertilizer are required to achieve economic
    yields in cash crops such as corn and sorghum (Adetunji et al., 2020; Dabney et
    al., 2010). In contrast, legumes cover crops such as hairy vetch (Vicia villosa
    Roth.) fix atmospheric N and supply up to 50–155 kg N ha-1 to the subsequent corn
    crop (Seo et al., 2000, Weerasekara et al., 2017). 4.2. Cover crops effects on
    depth-distribution of SOC and total N stock Our study is among the limited long-term
    initiatives comprehensively tracking soil C changes from soil surface to 80 cm
    depth within a semi-arid forage production system. After integrating cover crops
    in corn-sorghum rotation for four years, SOC under cover crops was 7–22% greater
    than under NCC at 0–80 cm, resulting in a SOC sequestration rate of 1.6–2.3 Mg
    C ha-1 y-1 with cover cropping systems. Cover crop mixtures primarily contributed
    to the accumulation of SOC through C additions from above- and belowground residues.
    Planting diverse and multispecies cover crop mixes leads to increased SOC accumulation
    due to the supply of diverse C substrates for microbial transformation into stable
    C compounds (Blanco‐Canqui, 2022, Finney et al., 2016, Smith et al., 2014). This
    idea aligns with the ecological principles that propose a mixture of diverse plant
    species could outperform single species due to functional compatibility among
    different plant species (Blanco‐Canqui, 2022, Smith et al., 2014). However, cover
    crop impact on SOC accrual depends on climatic regions, inherent soil conditions,
    management conditions, and cover crop biomass production, among others (McClelland
    et al., 2021, Seitz et al., 2023). For instance, cover cropping in Illinois, United
    States, showed a SOC sequestration rate of 0.5–0.9 Mg C ha-1 y-1 at 0–75 cm (Olson
    et al., 2014), whereas, in the temperate humid region of Ontario, Canada, nine
    years of cover cropping added 10–20 Mg C ha-1 SOC at 0–15 cm soil depth (Chahal
    et al., 2020). Similarly, in a 15-year study in central Italy''s Mediterranean
    climate, cover crops increased SOC at 0.1–0.3 Mg C ha-1 y-1 (Mazzoncini et al.,
    2011).. In our study, cover crops produced an average aboveground biomass of 2.1–6.0
    Mg ha-1 during 2018–2021 (Acharya et al., 2022b, Acharya et al., 2023), leading
    to the SOC sequestration rate of 1.6–2.3 Mg C ha-1 y-1 despite hot, dry semi-arid
    climatic conditions. In addition, no-tillage was adopted after the establishment
    of this study, shifting from conventional tillage management, which could have
    accompanied the synergistic benefits of adopting multiple conservation practices
    and thus increased SOC stock in the profile (Lal, 2015b). No-tillage does not
    increase SOC storage but conserves SOC accumulated from root and shoot residues
    and microbial proliferation due to cover cropping. Chen et al. (2022) suggested
    exploring SOC stock variation at different depths because introducing winter cover
    crops in a conventionally managed system had contrasting effects on SOC stock
    at different depths. A 19-year study in California revealed a 4% increase in SOC
    stock at depths of 0–30 cm but observed an 11% decrease at depths of 30–200 cm
    (Tautges et al., 2019). Consequently, there was a net loss in SOC stock at the
    0 to 200 cm depth range. Therefore, solely reporting results from one depth may
    lead to over or underestimating SOC stock benefits (Chen et al., 2022). The contrasting
    results emphasize the importance of considering the entire soil profile to accurately
    assess the impact of winter cover crops on SOC dynamics. Soil total N storage
    decreased under cover crops and NCC compared to the baseline data. This indicates
    that the inorganic N required for cover crop and cash crop biomass yield would
    be supplemented by mineralizing antecedent total N present in the deeper depths.
    Similar to our study, Mazzoncini et al. (2011)) reported that integrating non-legume
    cover crops for a long term in the Mediterranean climate increased SOC but significantly
    decreased total N at 0–30 cm soil depth. Also, the study revealed that total N
    content was reduced partly because of volatilization and leaching loss accounting
    for 5–40 kg N ha-1 y-1. In our study, legume species in legume-integrated cover
    crop mixtures, i.e., GBL and GL, did not contribute much through atmospheric N
    fixation, which could probably be because of their low biomass production, as
    Acharya et al. (2023) reported. Studies demonstrated that calculating soil C and
    N stocks to a specific soil depth can lead to uncertainties, mainly when there
    are variations in soil bulk density among the compared cropping systems (Gifford
    and Roderick, 2003, Lee et al., 2009). Researchers have adopted the equivalent
    soil mass method to overcome this challenge to assess changes in soil C and N
    stocks between cropping systems. Equivalent soil mass is calculated to effectively
    estimate SOC and nutrient stocks when bulk density differs among treatments. Soil
    bulk density was not different among treatments in this study. The equivalent
    soil mass approach does not calculate C and N stocks for identical soil layers,
    but it considers changes in soil bulk density to determine stocks for the same
    soil mass (Bhattacharyya et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2020). However, a five-year
    study in Denmark revealed that optimized crop rotations did not bring about any
    discernible changes in topsoil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks compared to
    continuous monoculture (Chen et al., 2020). The observation held true even when
    the equivalent soil mass method was used for examination. 4.3. Change in soil
    nutrients after four years of cover cropping and their relation with SOC sequestration
    Soil P was highest at 0–10 cm depth and dropped by at least 50% in lower depth
    across all treatments (Table 3). This could be due to the non-uniform distribution
    of P with a higher concentration near the soil surface than at lower soil depths
    (Villamil et al., 2006). Soil P stratification is common in long-term no-tillage
    management systems because fertilizer is often surface applied in such systems,
    and P, being immobile, concentrates in the surface soil layer (Franzluebbers and
    Hons, 1996, Crozier et al., 1999). As reported in previous studies (Dozier et
    al., 2017, Kumar and Goh, 1999), the K content was greater with cover crops than
    without, while we also observed a greater K content at the top 0–10 cm soil depth
    due to the stratification (Comia et al., 1994, Abdollahi and Munkholm, 2014).
    Soil K is highly mobile, and crop residues contain a relatively high amount of
    K compared to other essential nutrients. Over the years, enhanced decomposition
    of crop residues could have increased K content in surface soil. Cover cropping
    can have inconsistent effects on the S uptake and its cycling, mainly affected
    by the cover crop species used and subsequent cash crop uptake (Poffenbarger et
    al., 2015)). In this study, sulfate-S content was greater under NCC than under
    cover crops at 0–40 cm depth. Eriksen and Thorup-Kristensen (2002) also found
    lower sulfate content in the topsoil after using ryegrass cover crop compared
    to the values observed in the bare soil conditions. In contrast, other studies
    have reported that cover crops would increase sulfur content in the soil (Crespo
    et al., 2021). This suggests that the S contribution of cover crops to the subsequent
    cash crop varies, partially influenced by the specific species of cover crops
    utilized. The higher C-to-S ratio in the cover crops, mainly legumes, may slow
    S release from the residues or potentially lead to S immobilization (Eriksen,
    2009, Carciochi et al., 2021). Soil Zn content was greatest at 0–10 cm but did
    not improve after the 10 cm depth. Cover crop has the potential to effectively
    maintain optimal levels of Zn, B, Fe, and Mn in the topsoil (Sharma et al., 2018).
    Our study has uncovered positive developments in early indicators of soil health
    changes, emphasizing the importance of conducting long-term research. While cover
    crops offer numerous benefits under irrigated conditions, it is crucial to grow
    cover crops and cash crops with dryland agriculture to evaluate the ecosystem
    services provided by cover crops under water-limited semi-arid conditions. The
    positive correlation between SOC and P might be due to organic materials added
    by the cover crops that formed complexes with the P ions. Macdonald et al. (2018)
    reported that soil C and P are coupled via microbial and plant root activity,
    allowing the P mineralization from SOM. Their relationship can be influenced by
    microbial activity, land management, climate, fertilizer application, and soil
    water retention (Huang et al., 2016). Studies showed that arid and semi-arid regions
    have a weak correlation between SOC and P due to low SOM and biological activities
    (Jiao et al., 2016, Yuan and Chen, 2015). However, a previous study at the same
    site showed that cover crops improved the cropping system scale soil water balance
    (Paye et al., 2022a, Paye et al., 2022b), possibly affecting C and P dynamics.
    In addition, a positive relationship between SOC and other soil nutrients (Ca,
    Cu, Zn, Mn) shows that increased SOC in the soil can promote nutrient availability
    (Fig. 3). Soils with higher organic C levels enhance plant root growth and exploration,
    facilitating more efficient nutrient extraction from a larger soil volume (Six
    et al., 2004). Additionally, organic compounds like humic acids characterized
    by high cation exchange capacity can attract and hold positively charged ions,
    including essential nutrients like Ca, Mg, and K (Lehmann and Kleber, 2015). Increased
    organic C content stimulates microbial activity in the soil, with microbial biomass
    playing a vital role in nutrient cycling by converting organic forms of nutrients
    into mineral forms accessible to plants (Fierer and Schimel, 2002, Rousk et al.,
    2009). Using winter cover crops under semi-arid irrigated forage rotation systems
    can sequester SOC and improve soil nutrient availability. 5. Conclusions The results
    from our four-year field study showed the influence of winter cover crops on soil
    C and nutrient pools at various soil depths in a corn-sorghum cropping system
    in semi-arid environments. Compared to NCC, grass and its mixture of brassicas
    and legumes increased soil PMC at 10–20 and 20–40 cm depth. GL significantly increased
    soil TLN at 10–20 cm soil depth. GBL mixtures increased the SOC storage to 80 cm
    depth. Cover crop mixtures improved the soil NO3− -N, P, and K at the top 0–10 cm,
    although the P and K content was lower with cover crop than NCC at 20–80 cm soil
    depth. Integrating winter cover crops in the corn and sorghum forage production
    systems for the long term can potentially improve soil health and fertility in
    the semi-arid regions of SHP. Future research on using diverse cover crops in
    the lands transitioning from irrigated to dryland forage production systems will
    help to understand the soil health and ecosystem services in semi-arid regions
    or similar agroecosystems. CRediT authorship contribution statement Acharya Pramod:

  description: Water-saving irrigation is becoming more important in the upper Yellow
    River basin (YRB) due to reduced water allocation and growing water scarcity.
    However, drip irrigation as an efficient irrigation method, has not gained as
    much acceptance as one might expect. In this study, integrated approaches involving
    field experiments, agro-ecosystem modeling, and financial analysis were proposed
    to evaluate the multiple benefits of two irrigation methods. Field experiments
    on maize irrigated with border irrigation and drip irrigation under plastic mulching
    (i.e., BI-M and DI-M) were conducted in the Hetao Irrigation District (Hetao)
    of the upper YRB during 2021 and 2022. The AHC model was calibrated and validated
    using two-year experimental data, performing well in simulations of soil water-salt-nitrogen
    (N) dynamics and crop growth. An irrigation scheduling module was newly incorporated
    into AHC. Then the model was applied to analyze scenarios consisting of three
    classes of groundwater depth (GWD) and five N application levels. Optimal irrigation
    and N-fertilization strategies were suggested; and DI-M showed significant advantages
    over BI-M in terms of water-saving (56–66 mm), labor-saving, environmental benefits
    (50 kg ha−1 less N fertilizer and 19–25 kg ha−1 less N loss), and crop yields
    (<4%), both in experimental and scenario cases. However, the financial analysis
    revealed that the current smallholder BI-M could achieve higher net returns (about
    12%) compared to DI-M, since the family labor is often not counted as a cost in
    smallholder farming. Additionally, the widespread adoption of BI-M is also partly
    attributed to its easy operation. Lastly, results indicated a trend where the
    advantages of drip irrigation would become more significant in the future, with
    the increasing agricultural population aging and rising labor costs in the YRB.

    modelingFinancial analysis 1. Introduction Irrigation districts in the upper reaches
    of the Yellow River basin (YRB) in northern China are very important food-cash
    crop production areas. Irrigation plays a vital role in agricultural crop production
    due to the arid climate conditions in the region (Ren et al., 2016). Two major
    super-large irrigation districts, i.e., Qingtongxia Irrigation District (Qingtongxia)
    and Hetao Irrigation District (Hetao) divert nearly 25% of the annual river flow
    of the Yellow River (Chen et al., 2003, Ren et al., 2016). Canal conveyance/distribution
    and farm surface flooding irrigation (usually border irrigation: a kind of controlled
    flooding irrigation, i.e., water flows between dikes that divide a sloping field
    into rectangular strips with free drainage at the end) remain the main methods
    for conveying water and irrigating crops (Miao et al., 2015). However, long-term
    excessive irrigation has caused problems of low water-fertilizer use efficiency
    and secondary salinization (under shallow groundwater conditions) in irrigated
    areas of upper YRB (Xu et al., 2013, Ren et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2016). Meanwhile,
    increasing water demand for industrial, ecological, and domestic use calls for
    further cuts of river water allocation to the agricultural sector (Pereira et
    al., 2007, Ren et al., 2016). Consequently, various water-saving practices have
    been promoted and adopted in both the farm and canal system levels over the past
    two decades. Progress has been made in canal conveyance and distribution systems
    through government investment, mainly involving the lining of higher-order canals,
    upgrades of hydraulic structures, and improvements in canal measurement/control
    device (Pereira et al., 2003, Xu et al., 2010, Ren et al., 2016). Some technological
    advancements, such as precise laser leveling, plastic film mulching, and the planting
    of low-water-use crops, have been further made and successfully applied in farm-water
    saving (Pereira et al., 2007, Xu et al., 2010, Xiao et al., 2023). Nevertheless,
    it is puzzling that modernized on-farm water-saving irrigation technologies, particularly
    pressurized systems, have not gained sufficient acceptance by local farmers as
    expected by the government and researchers in the upper YRB. Drip irrigation,
    recognized as an advanced and efficient irrigation technique (Rouzaneh et al.,
    2021), seems particularly suitable for the upper YRB, given its arid and windy
    climate conditions, compared to sprinkler irrigation (Liu et al., 2017, Cheng
    et al., 2023). Drip irrigation offers also many significant advantages over surface
    irrigation, including potential water-saving, higher fertilizer efficiency, improved
    crop yield quality and homogeneity (Vázquez et al., 2006, Dhayal et al., 2023,
    Moursy et al., 2023), adaptability to various field shapes, sizes, and slopes
    (Surendran et al., 2022), and reduced labor costs (Çetin and Uygan, 2008; Sidhu
    et al., 2019). However, drip irrigation requires more initial investment (Çetin
    and Uygan, 2008; Couto et al., 2013), energy costs, maintenance work, and modernized
    management skills, which may hinder its adoption to some extent (Surendran et
    al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2021). Meanwhile, surface border irrigation remains widely
    used in upper YRB due to its ease use/operation and management, lower capital
    investment of deployment/energy/maintenance, and reduced sensitivity to weather
    conditions and water quality (Miao et al., 2015, Nie et al., 2021). The benefit
    concerns or needs between farmers and government are different. For farmers and
    stakeholders, the focus is primarily on obtaining higher net returns rather than
    the irrigation method itself (Luquet et al., 2005, Knox et al., 2012, Levidow
    et al., 2014). In contrast, drip irrigation is seen more as a solution to increasing
    water-fertilizer use efficiency and crop yields by the government and researchers,
    with an emphasis on eco-sustainability and food security (Surendran et al., 2016,
    2022). This means that a comprehensive analysis considering multiple benefits
    is necessary to understand the motivation and choices of farmers (Westerink et
    al., 2020) and guide decision-making on water-saving policies and incentives,
    such as subsidies. Numerous field experiments have been carried out to examine
    the effects of improving border irrigation and adopting drip irrigation on water-saving,
    salinity control, fertilizer use, and crop yields in the upper YRB (e.g., Li et
    al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2023). However, experiments are costly
    and time-consuming, and they can only consider a limited range of situations.
    Thus, many researchers have turned to agro-ecosystem models (e.g., SWAP, HYDRUS,
    SIMDualKc, and AHC) to enhance data analysis from field experiments and make quantitative
    predictions for various management practices (Xu et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2018,
    Liu et al., 2022, Rosa et al., 2012). Agro-ecosystem models have been successfully
    applied for optimizing irrigation schedules and fertilization, increasing water-nitrogen
    productivity and maintaining crop yields (Pereira et al., 2020, Groenveld et al.,
    2021, Ramos et al., 2023). Most existing simulation studies are related to the
    relationship water-crop, water-salinity-crop, or water-nitrogen-crop (Xu et al.,
    2013, Li et al., 2020, Siad et al., 2019). Due to the typical characteristics
    of arid irrigated areas, the agro-ecosystem processes in the upper YRB are highly
    complex, involving intricate interactions between water, salt, nitrogen, and crop
    plants. Recently, an improved AHC model is developed by Xu et al. (2023) to simulate
    these complicated interactions, and it is tested in the upper YRB (Li et al.,
    2023b); and this model will be adopted as well in this study. Additionally, few
    studies have done a systematic analysis of the finances of various irrigation
    strategies, a primary concern for farmers. This would involve detailed surveys
    and research on capital and manpower investment, operation and maintenance costs,
    and pricing, among other factors. Thus, to our knowledge, there is still a lack
    of comprehensive quantitative evaluations and comparisons of the multiple benefits
    of drip irrigation and border irrigation in the upper YRB. Therefore, this study
    proposes and applies an integrated approach that combines field experiments, agro-ecosystem
    modeling, and financial analysis to investigate the multiple benefits and differences
    between border and drip irrigation. The Hetao, as one of two super-large irrigation
    districts in the arid upper YRB, was selected as a typical case study area in
    this study. A two-year experiment (2021 and 2022) was conducted in maize fields
    to monitor the soil water-salt-nitrogen dynamics and crop growth for both border
    and drip irrigation. The AHC model (Xu et al., 2018, Xu et al., 2023), a numerical
    agroecosystem model with advanced functions for arid environmental use, was adopted
    and calibrated to enhance the experimental analysis and perform scenario analysis.
    The optimization of irrigation schedules was further improved for the AHC model.
    Detailed field surveys were carried out, particularly for aiding economic analysis,
    involving farmers, planners, and managers, covering various aspects like irrigation,
    fertilization, investment, price, operation, and more. Subsequently, scenarios
    of optimized irrigation strategies, combined with different groundwater depths
    and nitrogen fertilization, were simulated to analyze multiple benefits. The aim
    was to provide a comprehensive understanding of the adaptability and feasibility
    of border irrigation and drip irrigation in the arid upper YRB. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Field experiments 2.1.1. Field site conditions and the experiment
    Field experiments were conducted at the Hetao Experimental Station of China Agricultural
    University, Inner Mongolia, Northwest China (41° 09'' N, 107° 39'' E) in 2021
    and 2022. This region has an arid to semi-arid continental climate. The annual
    average precipitation ranges from 50 to 240 mm, with more than 70% of precipitation
    occurring between June and September. The annual sunshine ranges from 3100 to
    3300 hours, and the average annual temperature is approximately 7°C. In most regions
    of Hetao, the groundwater is relatively shallow, with an average depth (GWD) of
    less than 2.0 m and varying from 0.5 to 3.0 m throughout the year. However, some
    local areas experience relatively large GWDs due to groundwater abstraction. The
    groundwater has a small hydraulic gradient of 0.10–0.25‰ (Ren et al., 2016). Daily
    meteorological data of maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, precipitation,
    wind speed, and sunshine duration for 2021 and 2022 were taken from the nearby
    Linhe weather station and were used to compute the FAO-Penman–Monteith reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) according to Allen et al. (1998). The monthly averages

    irrigation and drip irrigation under plastic mulching (hereafter referred as BI-M
    and DI-M, respectively) were used for maize cultivation, using the Kehe 699 variety.
    The experimental design was a plot experiment with three replicates for each treatment.
    The soil was sandy loam, with a silty loam layer at deeper depths. The maize was
    planted with a wide-narrow row pattern, and the spaces of the wide row and narrow
    row were 70 cm and 40 cm, respectively. The soil surface was cover by the transparent
    plastic mulching, with a mulching fraction fr mulch = 0.6. The planting density
    was about 60,000 plants per hectare. Machine tillage and artificial assistance
    were used for sowing. The information about irrigation and fertilization is provided
    in detail in Table A1. The seasonal irrigation depth for BI-M was 479 mm and 427 mm
    in 2021 and 2022, respectively, including pre-sowing irrigation and four irrigation
    events during the crop growth season. The irrigation timing for BI-M was consistent
    with that of the local farmers. DI-M was triggered by a tensiometer located at
    a depth of 20 cm with soil matric potential (h20 cm) of −15 kPa, and the irrigation
    water was pumped from groundwater. The fertilization was determined following
    local farmers’ practices and previous research (see details in Table A1) (Li et
    al., 2020). A total of 250 kg ha−1 nitrogen (N) fertilization was applied for
    BI-M, while the N fertilization for DI-M was 200 kg ha−1. The base fertilizer
    was applied prior to sowing, which consisted of phosphorus fertilizer (diammonium
    phosphate, P=46%, N=18%; both 150 kg ha−1 for BI-M and DI-M), and potassium fertilizer
    (potassium oxide, K=50%; 60 kg ha−1 and 75 kg ha−1 for BI-M and DI-M, respectively).
    The base fertilizer was applied once, during mulching and sowing. In addition,
    lignite carbon-based organic fertilizer (4500 kg ha−1) was also applied as base
    fertilizer in 2022, which was mainly used to partly replace the inorganic N fertilizer.
    Wherein, the available N in organic fertilizer was counted in the total N application
    amount. The organic fertilizer was manually spread before sowing and mixed into
    deep soil (20 cm) using a rototiller. Urea (N=46%) was used as topdressing fertilizer,
    in which 40% and 60% were applied at the jointing stage and at the heading and
    filling stages, respectively (Table A1). Urea was uniformly spread in the interrow,
    between mulch, before irrigation in BI-M. For DI-M, it was dissolved in water
    and applied to the root zone using the drip irrigation system. Other cultivation
    practices, including pests, crop diseases and weed control followed local farmer
    practices in the region. 2.1.2. Field observations and data Table 1 lists the
    main soil physical properties, hydraulic parameters, and solute dispersion length
    at the experimental field. The particle size distribution was obtained using a
    laser particle size analyzer (Malvern MS2000, UK). The main soil texture in this
    study area was sandy loam to silt loam. The bulk density was obtained by drying
    undisturbed soil samples collected using a 100 cm3 ring sampler in the oven for
    48 hours. The dispersion length was referred to the value given by Xu et al. (2018).

    NH4-N, NO3-N, and salt, respectively. Soil water content, salinity concentration
    (i.e., salt content of the soil solution, g L−1), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) and
    nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) contents, groundwater depth (GWD), and crop growth indicators
    were monitored from planting to harvest during the crop growth seasons of 2021
    and 2022. Soil samples were collected every 10–15 days with 20 cm increments from
    the soil surface to 100 cm depth using a soil auger. Soil water content was measured
    by oven drying method and converted to volumetric values using soil bulk density
    data. Soil salinity concentration was determined from the electrical conductivity
    of the 1:5 soil water extract (EC1:5) using the calculation method suggested by
    Xu et al. (2013). The NH4-N and NO3-N contents in soil and groundwater were measured
    by ultraviolet spectrophotometer (UV-3100, China). GWD was monitored hourly with
    an automatic water level recorder (HOBO U20, USA) placed in an observation well
    (50 m away from the experimental field). To calibrate the water level recorder,
    the GWD was also measured every 10–15 days using a tape, and the groundwater sample
    was collected at the same time. The electrical conductivity of the groundwater
    (ECw) was measured and converted to the total dissolved solid (TDS) using the
    empirical relationship TDS (g L−1) = 0.69 ECw (ms cm−1) where 0.69 is a locally
    calibrated empirical coefficient (Xu et al., 2013). Crop growth indicators including
    leaf area index (LAI) and dry aboveground biomass (D-AGB) were measured every
    15–20 days. For LAI measurement, the length and width of each leaf were measured
    with a tape, and then LAI was calculated using the empirical equation suggested
    by Han et al. (2009). The D-AGB was measured by oven drying to constant mass at
    75°C. Crop yield was obtained at harvest after drying to 5% of water content.
    2.2. Modeling description 2.2.1. AHC model The AHC model (Agro-Hydrological &
    chemical and Crop systems simulator) is a one-dimensional (1-D) numerical physical
    model developed for the simulation of agroecosystem processes (Xu et al., 2018,
    Xu et al., 2023). It can simulate the soil water flow, solute transport (salt
    and N), heat transport, soil carbon-nitrogen turnover, and crop growth and yield
    formation under various ambient environments. The AHC version 2.01 (v2.01) is
    adopted in this study, and a new irrigation scheduling module is incorporated
    as well. A brief introduction to AHC is provided here, and more detailed calculation
    principles can be found in the previous literature (Xu et al., 2018, Xu et al.,
    2023). (1) Agroecosystem process simulation In AHC, the soil water flow is based
    on the 1-D Richards equation for vertical flow: (1) where θ is the soil volumetric
    water content (cm3 cm−3), h is the soil water pressure head (cm), t is the time
    (d), C is the differential soil water capacity (cm−1), z is the vertical coordinate
    (cm, positive upward), K is the hydraulic conductivity (cm d−1), and Sa is the
    sink term defined as the rate of root water uptake (cm3 cm−3 d−1). The soil hydraulic
    properties are described with equations proposed by van Genuchten (1980) and Mualem
    (1976), as follows: (2) (3) where Se is the effective saturation (-), θr and θs
    denote the residual and saturated water contents (cm3 cm−3), respectively, αl
    (cm−1) and n (-) are empirical shape parameters, Ks is the saturated hydraulic
    conductivity (cm d−1), and λ is a pore connectivity/tortuosity parameter (-).
    The common assumption of λ = 0.5 was used in this study. The piecewise linear
    equation proposed by Feddes et al. (1978) is used to describe the water uptake
    reduction due to water stress, meanwhile, a non-linear equation suggested by Dirksen
    and Augustijn (1988) is applied to account for the reduction caused by salinity
    stress (Xu et al., 2013). The mass conservation and transport equations involved
    in a sequential first-order decay chain during transient water flow in a variably
    saturated rigid porous medium are taken as: (4) (5) where the subscripts w and
    s refer to liquid and solid phases, respectively, and subscript k represents the
    kth chain number, c is the solute concentration in the soil liquid phase (g cm−3),
    ρb is the dry soil bulk density (g cm−3), Q is the adsorbed solid concentration
    (g g−1), q is the Darcian velocity (cm d−1), Ddif is the diffusion coefficient
    (cm2 d−1), Ddis is the dispersion coefficient (cm2 d−1), μ is the first-order
    rate coefficient of transformation (d−1), μ′ is the similar first-order rate coefficient
    of transformation providing connections between individual chain species, and
    Kr is the root uptake preference factor (-). A Kr value greater than 1.0 can be
    used to represent the occurrence of active root uptake. The AHC is allowed to
    use three solute types to describe the salt-N migration process in soil solutions.
    For N simulation, the transformation and transport processes including mineralization-immobilization,
    solid adsorption, nitrification, denitrification, volatilization, nitrous oxide
    (N2O) emission, water uptake (positive and active) and leaching are involved in
    the chain equations. Where k=1 corresponds to NH4-N, k=2 corresponds to NO3-N
    (regardless of adsorption), and k=3 corresponds to salt (without considering the
    reaction chain and solid adsorption). Thus, the AHC v2.01 provides an option to
    simultaneously simulate the fate of NH4-N, NO3-N, and soil salt in soil porous
    media. Neglecting the effect of water vapor diffusion on transport, the 1-D heat
    transfer can be described with a convection-dispersion equation (CDE) of the form
    in the heat transport module, as follows: (6) where Cs(θ) and Cw are the volumetric
    heat capacity of soil bulk and water, respectively (J cm−3 °C−1), T is the soil
    temperature (°C), and λ(θ) is the coefficient of the apparent thermal conductivity
    of the soil (J cm−1 °C−1 d−1). The modified EPIC crop growth model considers leaf
    area development, light interception, and the conversion of intercepted light
    into biomass and yield together with the effects of temperature, water, salt,
    and N stress (Xu et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2023). LAI is computed for the various
    phenological development stages considering heat unit accumulation (Williams et
    al., 1989), and is estimated as a function of heat units, crop stress, and development
    stages. Biomass is computed from the solar radiation intercepted by the crop leaf
    area, which is estimated with Beer’s law (Monsi and Saeki, 1953). The potential
    increase in biomass on a given day is estimated as a function of the plant radiation-use
    efficiency (RUE) with consideration of environmental stress (e.g., from soil moisture,
    salinity, N, and temperature). The RUE is estimated using the approach proposed
    by Stockle et al. (1992). The actual crop yield is calculated using the harvest
    index concept following the EPIC model procedures (Williams et al., 1989), i.e.,
    as a function of the above-ground biomass and environmental stress. (2) Irrigation
    scheduling module A new module for irrigation scheduling is modified from SWAP
    v2.0 (van Dam et al., 1997) and incorporated into AHC. Irrigation time can be
    determined by different trigger conditions, and then irrigation depth is calculated
    by defined scheduling criteria. Specified criteria are valid from a user-defined
    date in the cropping season until the end of crop growth. Both timing and depth
    criteria can be dynamic, i.e., defined as a function of crop development stage.
    For time trigger conditions, irrigation is applied: (1) whenever the depletion
    is larger than a fraction of f1 (-) of the total available water amount between
    field capacity and permanent wilting point, or (2) whenever moisture content or
    pressure head at a certain depth in the root zone drops below a prescribed threshold
    value. The first and second trigger conditions are appropriate for border irrigation
    and drip irrigation, respectively. Two irrigation depth criteria are provided:
    (1) a specified depth of irrigation water is applied, or (2) the soil water content
    in the wetting layer is brought back to field capacity. The former option is usually
    applied to most gravity systems, and the latter one is useful in the case of sprinkler
    irrigation and micro irrigation systems. In addition, the planned wetting layer
    could be determined by user-specified depth, root depth, or their combination.
    2.2.2. Model setup, calibration and validation A soil profile of 300 cm depth
    was specified during the model simulation of soil water flow and solute (salt
    and N) transport. The soil profile was generalized with four horizontal layers
    according to the soil description given in Table 1. The vertical one-dimensional
    soil domain was further discretized into 300 compartments (i.e., nodes), with
    a uniform thickness of 1 cm. For the depths below 100 cm, the soil properties
    were assumed to be the same as the last observed layer (i.e., 80–100 cm). The
    simulation period was from the beginning of May to the end of September, covering
    the whole maize growth season. For soil water flow, the upper boundary condition
    was determined by irrigation, rainfall, and actual daily soil evaporation. The
    lower boundary condition used a variable head boundary, determined by the monitored
    daily GWD. For solute transport, concentration fluxes were used to define the
    upper and lower boundary conditions, considering TDS, NH4-N and NO3-N concentrations
    observed in irrigation water and groundwater, respectively. Furthermore, the NH4-N
    and NO3-N contents in precipitation were also considered. The initial conditions
    of soil water content, salinity concentration, and NH4-N and NO3-N contents were
    determined by field observations before the beginning of the growth season. The
    initial soil hydraulic parameters were estimated from bulk density and percentages
    of sand, silt and clay values using the Rosetta pedotransfer functions (Table
    1) (Schaap et al., 2001). The solute transport parameters, C/N turnover parameters
    (Table A2), water and salt stress parameters, and crop growth parameters (Table
    2) were initially specified according to the previous studies (e.g., Xu et al.,
    2013, Xu et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2016). Then, a trial-error method was adopted
    to calibrate the above parameters, and the experimental data in 2022 and 2021
    were used for model calibration and validation, respectively. Table 2. Calibrated

    properties, solute transport and crop growth were selected to be calibrated as
    shown in Table 1 and Table 2, which was referred to the results of parameter sensitivity
    analysis by Xu et al., 2016, Xu et al., 2018. To evaluate the model performance
    of the calibration and validation process, several goodness-of-fit indicators
    were used, including the mean relative error (MRE), the root mean square error
    (RMSE), the Nash and Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), the coefficient of determination
    (R2), and the coefficient of regression (b). Detailed definitions and equations
    for the above indicators can be found in Xu et al. (2013). MRE and RMSE values
    close to zero indicated good model performance. R2 > 0.5 and NSE > 0 are generally
    considered acceptable (Moriasi et al., 2007). 2.3. Financial analysis The financial
    analysis involves all costs and benefits related to irrigation, fertilization,
    planting, agronomy, and field management during a whole agricultural year. A systematic
    agricultural survey was carried out for financial analysis, targeted at typical
    farmers, companies and government managers during 2022. The main cost items for
    BI-M and DI-M and their explanations are provided in Table 3. The irrigation water
    fee was calculated according to the water price standards of the Hetao Irrigation
    District Administration of Inner Mongolia, in which the tiered charge was adopted
    based on the amount of irrigation water consumption. The costs of fertilizer,
    electricity consumption, seed, plastic mulching, pesticide, agricultural machinery
    utilization (during spring plowing, mulching and sowing, harvest, and autumn plowing),
    and some other investments (e.g., fixed seedling, weeding, pesticide spraying,
    and manual irrigation and fertilization) were obtained from a survey conducted
    among farmers. The survey subjects were mainly farmers with extensive experience
    (>10 years) in maize cultivation and a planting area of 1–10 ha. For this comparative
    analysis, the average value of each cost item (Table 3) was adopted in the financial
    analysis for simplification. The cost structure for a typical drip irrigation
    system (with a controlled area of 25–35 ha) was obtained from Huawei Company''s
    subsidiary in Inner Mongolia, including material, installation, operation, and
    maintenance fees (see details in Table A4). The initial investment in the drip
    irrigation system was estimated by multiplying the market unit price of the materials
    by the required quantity. A 15-year system service life was assumed in order to
    estimate the annual input (Table A4). The irrigation water amount and crop yields
    in the scenario analysis were determined through AHC simulation. Total benefits
    were computed according to multiplying crop yields by the local maize market unit
    price (2.6 Yuan kg−1). Net economic benefits (i.e., profits) were calculated as
    total/gross economic benefits minus input costs. Table 3. The cost (Yuan ha−1)
    structure of maize cultivation for BI-M and DI-M methods in scenario simulations.

    Three GWD classes include the average GWD of 174 cm, 220 cm, and 280 cm. Drip
    irrigation system only has water fee for autumn watering. TC1 and TC2 are shown
    in Table 4. 2.4. Assessing water-salt-nitrogen dynamics and multiple benefits
    under various conditions: based on modeling and financial analysis After model
    calibration and validation, the AHC was used to evaluate the irrigation performance
    and N use for BI-M and DI-M in the two-year experiments. Subsequently, it was
    further applied to optimize the irrigation schedules for two irrigation methods
    and to predict the scenarios consisting of three classes of GWD and five levels
    of N application. The three GWD classes included the average GWD of 174 cm, 220 cm,
    and 280 cm during the crop growth period, which represented typical conditions
    of shallow GWD (the primary distribution at present), relative-deep GWD (the secondary
    distribution), and deep GWD (a minority distribution), respectively. Five levels
    of 200, 225, 250, 275, and 300 kg ha−1 N application were considered for DI-M,
    while only 250, 275, and 300 kg ha−1 levels were included for BI-M. These N levels
    were set up based on the N fertilizer applied by local farmers and previous studies
    (Fang et al., 2022, Li et al., 2023a). For each scenario, the irrigation schedule
    was optimized using the irrigation scheduling module for both BI-M and DI-M. Trigger
    conditions and irrigation depth criteria of irrigation scheduling are provided
    in Table 4. For optimized BI-M, irrigation was applied whenever the soil water
    content of the root zone was less than 40% of the total available water amount
    between field capacity and permanent wilting point. The irrigation depth was 60–75 mm
    under shallow and relative-deep GWDs, and 80 mm under deep GWD. For the optimized
    DI-M scenarios, irrigation was triggered when the matrix potential at the 20 cm
    soil depth dropped below a threshold value (i.e., h20 cm), with applying two levels
    of trigger conditions (i.e., TC1 and TC2) (see details in Table 4). The field
    capacity for each root zone node was determined by Eq. (2) with h = −110 cm, and
    the maximum wetting layer depth was set to 40 cm below the soil surface. The above
    scenario simulations were applied to comprehensively analyze the water-N dynamics
    and utilization and crop growth responses for two irrigation methods, under various
    conditions of GWDs and N applications. The multiple benefits and feasibility of
    BI-M and DI-M were evaluated and compared. Table 4. Trigger condition (TC) and

    a fraction of the total available water amount between field capacity and permanent
    wilting point. h20-cm is a tensiometer located at a depth of 20 cm with soil matric
    potential. h is the soil water pressure head corresponding to soil water content
    of field capacity. A minimum irrigation depth allowed for drip irrigation systems
    is set as 15 mm. The crop water productivity (WPET, kg m−3) was calculated as
    the ratio of crop yield to the cumulative ETa during the maize growth season.
    In addition, the N use efficiency (NUE, %) was calculated as follows: (7) where
    Nsupply is the total amount of N supply at the field (kg ha−1) (including N from

    simulated soil water contents in different soil layers were in good agreement
    with the observed ones during calibration (2022), and the AHC satisfatorily captured
    soil water dynamics also during validation (2021), both for BI-M and DI-M (Fig.
    2, Fig. 3). The RMSE and R2 were about 0.02 cm3 cm−3 and 0.9, respectively, and
    the NSE ranged from 0.28 to 0.78 (Table A3). Despite the complexity of the salt
    transport process, the AHC model produced satisfactory results for salt simulation,
    with RMSE: 1.0–1.22 g L−1, R2: 0.68–0.72, and NSE: 0.08–0.51 for BI-M, and with
    RMSE: 0.79–1.15 g L−1, R2: 0.60–0.66, and NSE: −2.06–0.37 for DI-M, during two
    years. Note that the lower NSE of DI-M were due to the soil salinity concentration
    relatively stable and difficult for the model to capture small variations (e.g.,
    40–80 cm soil layers) (Mu et al., 2023). Overall, the model well reproduced relatively
    strong variations of soil water contents and salinity concentrations due to large
    depth of each irrigation event in BI-M, meanwhile, it provided an accurate representation
    of more frequent and smaller variations of soil water-salt dynamics in DI-M (Fig.
    2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download : Download

    factors (REG) during the 2022 growth season in the BI-M and DI-M experiments.
    For soil N simulation, the AHC could accurately describe the fluctuations of the
    observed NH4-N and NO3-N contents. The goodness-of-fit indicators were also within
    acceptable ranges of RMSE <0.84 mg kg−1, −0.40 < NSE < 0.69, and 0.69 < R2 < 0.91
    for NH4-N, and RMSE <1.99 mg kg−1, −0.60 < NSE < 0.33, and 0.63 < R2 < 0.83 for
    NO3-N, respectively, during calibration and validation, despite the complexity
    of soil N transformation (Cameira et al., 2007, Xu et al., 2018). Similar to the
    salt simulation, the negative NSE value was also due to the relatively smooth
    changes of NH4-N and NO3-N in the 20–80 cm soil layers. Despite that the NSE values
    were sometimes negative, a visual inspection of the figures could confirm the
    good model performance. Especially, the model well described the responses of
    N contents before and after the fertilization event in the upper 0–40 cm soil
    layers. The large amounts of N fertilizer in the basal fertilizer led to a rapid
    increase in the soil NH4-N content during the sowing period. Then, NH4-N decreased
    by nitrification and the soil NO3-N content consequently increased. After that,
    the concentration of NO3-N in the soil gradually decreased due to crop N uptake
    and N leaching. Simulated LAI and D-AGB values also matched well with the observations
    (Fig. 4). The deviation in MRE and RMSE values was considered acceptable, and
    the NSE and R2 values were all close to 1. Furthermore, the model also estimated
    crop yields well, with relative errors of less than 1% for BI-M and DI-M in both
    two years. In addition, the calibrated and validated model was further verified
    by the observation dataset of another nitrogen treatment , i.e., with the total
    nitrogen amount of 250 kg ha−1 (with 75 kg N ha−1 from organic fertilizer) and
    300 kg ha−1 (with 37 kg N ha−1 from organic fertilizer) for BI-M and DI-M, respectively.
    The simulated values were also in good agreement with the observed ones (see Figs.
    A3 and A4). Overall, the AHC performance in simulating soil water-salt-N and crop
    growth processes was generally good for both calibration and validation periods,
    which indicated that the calibrated model can be used to accurately predict and
    analyze agroecosystem processes at maize fields of Hetao under different environmental
    conditions. 3.2. Irrigation performance and water-nitrogen use for present BI-M
    and DI-M experiments Results showed that there were distinctive characteristics
    of soil water-salt-N dynamics and components between the two different irrigation
    methods, as presented in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 and Table 5. For BI-M, the larger irrigation
    depths and low frequency caused strong water flux exchange (i.e., vertical bottom
    flux, Qbot) between the root zone and groundwater (Fig. 5a). Excessive irrigation
    resulted in a large deep percolation of 305–308 mm during both crop seasons, accounting
    for nearly 57–59% of total applied water depth (irrigation plus rainfall). Thus,
    large amounts of salt could be leached out of the root zone, with 178–212 mg cm−2
    salt moving into the deeper soil layers. However, this also led to a significant
    N leaching of the root zone (about 60 kg N ha−1) (i.e., 24% of the applied N amount).
    Between irrigation events, significant capillary rise took place, contributing
    to crop water consumption under shallow GWD, with the cumulative value of 277 mm
    and 292 mm in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Table 5 and Fig. 6a). Consequently,
    salts re-accumulated within the root zone, leading to cumulative salt contents
    ranging from 109 to 117 mg cm−2 in the two years (Table 5). Some previously lost
    N could be reintroduced into the root zone through capillary rise, but this process
    accounted for only 33–44% of the total N leaching. The net N leaching reached
    33–35 kg ha−1, and accounted for 28–29% of the total N loss. In addition, the
    denitrification and NH3 volatilization corresponded to about 11–17% and 54–61%
    of the total N loss, respectively, while the nitrification loss only accounted
    for a very small part of the total N loss and could almost be neglected. Excluding
    losses, crop N uptake (165–172 kg ha−1) accounted for about 60% of total N consumption
    (including total N loss and crop N uptake) during the maize growth period. Download

    versus present experimental conditions for BI-M and DI-M. Note: since the difference
    in capillary rise and deep percolation between the nitrogen application levels
    is only 0.1 mm in the scenario simulations, in this figure, BI-M and DI-M are
    discussed in the case of 250 kg N ha−1 and 200 kg N ha−1 application (i.e., nitrogen
    application amount in field experiments), respectively. Three GWD classes include
    the average GWD (AGWD) of 174 cm, 220 cm, and 280 cm during crop growth period.

    change 32.6 59.1 9.3 4.8 Note: Nnbot is the net cumulative N flux at the bottom
    (positive for upward). Compared to BI-M, the DI-M with small irrigation amount
    and high frequency resulted in lesser water exchange between the root zone and
    groundwater, and subsequently less deep percolation (92–191 mm) and capillary
    rise (199–220 mm) (Fig. 5). This irrigation method could save nearly 36% and 21%
    of irrigation water in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Table 5). N leaching was effectively
    reduced due to less deep percolation, even with almost little leaching loss (i.e.,
    2.3 kg N ha−1) in 2022; whereas, there was 21.6 kg ha−1 of net N recharge by capillary
    rise in 2021. As a result, although 20% less N fertilizer was applied in DI-M
    (i.e., 200 kg N ha−1), the crop N uptake was 7.0 kg ha−1 higher than that of BI-M
    in 2022 (Table 5). This meant that the DI-M had higher NUE for maize cultivation
    in our experiments. Moreover, the DI-M which might cause some more salt accumulation
    in the root zone, especially during the dry year. Such as, in 2021, less rainfall
    (44 mm) and percolation (92 mm) resulted in 53 mg cm−2 of salt accumulating into
    the root zone. The seasonal actual evapotranspiration (ETa) presented small differences
    for BI-M and DI-M during the crop growth seasons, with 480 mm and 503 mm for BI-M
    and 530 mm and 523 mm for DI-M in 2021 and 2022, respectively (Table 5). However,
    the actual crop transpiration (Ta) was about 8–15% less for BI-M than that for
    DI-M owing to higher soil salinity level in the former (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Actual
    evaporation (Ea) was the main mechanism of water consumption during the early
    crop growth stage (Fig. 5). The plastic film mulching, mainly used to maintain
    soil temperature to ensure crop emergence and seedling growth, could also effectively
    reduce the soil evaporation (especially for border irrigation with complete surface
    wetting). Thus, the ratio of seasonal Ea to ETa was only 0.23 and 0.20 for BI-M
    during the two seasons; while, DI-M had smaller ratio (0.18 and 0.17) and less
    non-beneficial soil evaporation due to the lower wetting ratio, under the same
    plastic mulching fraction (fr mulch = 0.6). Crop growth was susceptible to being
    affected by temperature stress only during the early or late stages (with relatively
    low air temperatures) (Fig. 5). During other stages, water-salt-N stress became
    the major factor limiting maize growth. For BI-M, the maize growth suffered severe
    water-salt stress between irrigation events, e.g., between the first and second
    irrigation (Fig. 5a), due to the increase of soil osmotic stress. In addition,
    maize also suffered a temporary (about two days) waterlogging stress after each
    irrigation event. There was also a slight N stress due to N leaching loss (e.g.,
    after the third irrigation events, July 2nd) (Fig. 5a). However, for DI-M, there
    was almost no water-salt stress during crop growth period, and only a slight N
    stress was noticed. Note that the reason for the N stress was the use of organic
    fertilizer replacement in DI-M rather than N leaching loss (Fig. 5b). Results
    further showed that although there was 20% less N applied in DI-M, the crop yield
    was close to that of BI-M. In 2021, the crop yield of DI-M (11,825 kg ha−1) was
    only 6% lower than BI-M despite insect pests on DI-M; while in 2022, the yield
    of DI-M (14,262 kg ha−1) was even 5% higher than that of BI-M. In general, irrigation
    schedules with low frequency and large depths for BI-M had adverse effects on
    both the soil and crops (i.e., excessive deep percolation, N leaching, and water-salt
    stresses), whereas there were no such issues for DI-M. However, there were also
    some limitations in the DI-M experiments, especially the operation of the drip
    irrigation system (e.g., extra water use and relatively large deep percolation
    caused by untimely drip tape laying). In the experiment, BI-M and DI-M both did
    not attain the optimal levels for water and fertilizer use during the two-year
    experiments. 3.3. Water-nitrogen use and crop yields: scenario analysis 3.3.1.
    Border irrigation Figs. 6-8 present the responses of water-N use and crop yields
    to various water-N management strategies in the scenarios for BI-M. In the scenario,
    with the same N application level and GWD class as in the experiment of 2022,
    the optimized irrigation schedule resulted in a reduction of 82 mm (19%) irrigation
    water and a decrease of 128 mm (41%) deep percolation compared to the experiment.
    Note that the water recharge by capillary rise was still sufficient and close
    to that of the experiment. The crop yield reached 14,271 kg ha−1, and was about
    4% higher than that in the experiments (Fig. 7a). WPET almost remained unchanged.
    Furthermore, the optimized BI-M increased NUE to 65% (i.e., 10% higher than that
    in the experiment), and reduced N loss from 121 kg ha−1 in the experiment to 102 kg ha−1
    (Fig. 7a). The results showed that the optimized irrigation schedule of BI-M was
    more rational and effective in enhancing water-N utilization and crop yields and
    reducing N loss. In addition, it contributed to mitigating adverse impacts on
    the eco-environment. Download : Download high-res image (454KB) Download : Download

    Note: bar and blue dashed line correspond to the left Y-axis, while the scatterplot
    and green dashed line correspond to the right Y-axis. Three GWD classes include
    the average GWD (AGWD) of 174 cm, 220 cm, and 280 cm during crop growth period.
    TC1 and TC2 are shown in Table 4. Scenario analysis showed that the required irrigation
    water depth increased from 345 mm to 400 mm for optimized BI-M as GWD increased,
    and deep percolation decreased by about 73–92 mm (Fig. 6b). The crop yields slightly
    decreased due to small water-salt stresses during the middle and late crop growth
    season (Fig. 8a-c), while WPET slightly increased (Fig. 7a). Furthermore, results
    also showed that crop growth was almost not affected by N stress under three GWD
    classes (Fig. A2). The increasing N application (250–300 kg ha−1) did not lead
    to a significant improvement in crop yields or NUE; instead, it resulted in an
    increase of N losses ranging from 14 to 17 kg ha−1 (Fig. 7a). These meant that
    250 kg ha−1 N application may be an appropriate level for BI-M, which agrees with
    the recommendation of Li et al. (2020). However, N losses were reduced by nearly
    21 kg ha−1 as the GWD increased. This was because the large irrigation depth and
    shallow GWD conditions resulted in excessively wet soil after irrigation and fertilization.
    The denitrification of N in the soil was promoted, leading to an increasing N
    loss. In addition, the results suggested that the obtained irrigation schedule
    (Fig. 8a-c) and N application (250 kg ha−1) should be considered as the optimal
    water-N management strategy of BI-M maize in Hetao. Download : Download high-res

    during crop growth season in the scenario simulations for BI-M and DI-M. Note:
    TC1 and TC2 are shown in Table 4. 3.3.2. Drip irrigation The responses of water-N
    use and crop yields to various water-N management strategies for DI-M are shown
    in Figs. 6-8. The scenario that followed the same trigger condition, N application
    level, and GWD class as in the experiment, showed it was possible to reduce irrigation
    water depth by 54 mm and deep percolation by 63 mm (Fig. 6b). Meanwhile, the water
    recharge by capillary rise was still close to that of the experiment. The crop
    yield improved by 2% (Fig. 7b) due to less N stress, and WPET increased from 2.73 kg m−3
    to 2.77 kg m−3. Besides, the N loss increased by 8 kg ha−1 (Fig. 7b), due to the
    wetter soil environment and relatively large denitrification under automatic irrigation.
    When the trigger condition changed from TC1 to TC2, the crop yields, WPET, and
    NUE remained at a stable level for all scenarios of DI-M (Figs. 6b and 7b). This
    was attributed to timely irrigation that maintained favorable water-salt conditions
    (Fig. 8d-i). For irrigation water, TC1 was suitable for shallow GWD, while TC2
    was more adequate for relative-deep and deep GWDs (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Furthermore,
    the scenario results revealed that there was almost no N stress even at N application
    of 200 kg ha−1 (Fig. A2). Results further showed that increasing N application
    would lead to more N losses (e.g., 30–37 kg ha−1 for 200–300 kg ha−1 N application)
    (Fig. 7b). Thus, the application of 200 kg N ha−1 with TC1 should be the optimal
    water-N management strategy for DI-M under shallow GWD, which was consistent with
    the experimental results by Li et al. (2020) under shallow GWD. Meanwhile, the
    application of 200 kg N ha−1 with TC2 should be appropriate under relative-deep
    and deep GWDs. 3.4. Financial and economic-benefit analysis The response of net
    economic benefits to optimized water-N management strategies is shown in Fig.
    9 for two irrigation methods. For intensive farming, the optimized irrigation
    schedule could result in an increase of 7% (1710 Yuan ha−1) in the net economic
    benefits for BI-M, and little change for DI-M, as compared to the experimental
    conditions. In addition, scenario analysis showed that increasing irrigation and
    N application had very small impacts on net economic benefits for both DI-M and
    BI-M, only reducing profits by 2–3% (Fig. 9a-b). For the optimal water-N management
    strategy of the two irrigation methods, the net economic benefit of DI-M was very
    close to that of BI-M for intensive farming, remaining at approximately 25000
    Yuan ha−1 under shallow GWD; while DI-M was 2–3% higher than that of BI-M with
    increased GWDs. Despite this, the initial investment for drip irrigation system
    was relatively high (about 17206 Yuan ha−1); yet, considering 15-year service
    life, the annual investment in drip irrigation system amounted to approximately
    2994 Yuan ha−1 (Table A4). This showed that the economic cost of a drip irrigation
    system was affordable. Furthermore, DI-M significantly reduced labor input costs.
    Cost analysis revealed that the labor cost for DI-M was only 2% of the total inputs,
    while that of BI-M in intensive farming was 19% of the total inputs (Table 3).
    It is noteworthy that Hetao is currently facing challenges related to a declining
    agricultural workforce and an aging population. The adoption of drip irrigation
    would be a feasible solution in the context of future labor shortage, rising labor
    costs, and expansion of agricultural scale. Download : Download high-res image

    depths/trigger conditions (TC1 and TC2) and nitrogen application (NA) levels under
    three GWD classes versus present experimental conditions (dashed line) for BI-M
    and DI-M. Note: three GWD classes include the average GWD (AGWD) of 174 cm, 220 cm,
    and 280 cm during crop growth period. TC1 and TC2 are shown in Table 4. The changing
    trend of net economic benefits for optimized BI-M in smallholder farming was close
    to that of intensive farming in the scenario simulations of three N application
    levels and three GWD classes (Fig. 9b-c). However, the net economic benefit of
    optimized BI-M in smallholder farming was 3000 Yuan ha−1 (12%) higher than that
    of intensive farming. This difference could be attributed to a significant 53%
    reduction in labor costs in smallholder farming, since the family labor was not
    counted as a cost in smallholder farming. This was particularly for tasks such
    as spring plowing, mulching and sowing, as well as manual irrigation and fertilization
    (Table 3). 4. Discussion 4.1. Comparisons of multiple benefits for two irrigation
    methods Experimental results indicated that the DI-M could effectively improve
    the water use and NUE for maize cultivation compared to BI-M; while, it had weaker
    effects of salt leaching than BI-M. In addition, BI-M had larger non-beneficial
    soil evaporation, whereas DI-M was more efficient in water use and could reduce
    ineffective water loss. Upon integrating all scenario simulations, it was found
    that the optimal water-N management strategy could lead to water savings of 56–66 mm
    in irrigation, along with a reduction of 50 kg ha−1 in N fertilizer, for DI-M
    compared to BI-M. In both optimal scenarios, there was only a marginal disparity
    in WPET between the two irrigation methods. Despite applying 20% less N fertilizer
    to DI-M compared to BI-M, DI-M exhibited a slightly higher NUE and a reduction
    in N loss by 19–25 kg ha−1 across three GWD classes. Furthermore, DI-M managed
    to maintain crop yields slightly higher (<4%) compared to those in BI-M, even
    with 20% reduction in N application. Moreover, in the intensive farming, the economic
    benefit of DI-M was higher than that of BI-M both in experimental and scenario
    cases, and DI-M could significantly reduce labor input during irrigation and fertilization.
    In summary, the scenario analysis above suggests that adopting DI-M can lead to
    significant savings in water, fertilizer and labor, while also maintaining robust
    crop yields when compared to an optimized BI-M approach. In another aspect, the
    smallholder farming focuses on traditional agricultural business patterns and
    the characteristics of farmers'' self-employment. It relies on farmers'' own labor
    inputs to reduce costs and consequently obtain higher net returns. This revealed
    that smallholder farming can more easily achieve higher net economic benefits
    under the same water-management strategy, due to the exclusion of family (household)
    labor costs. This might be one of the most important reasons why the drip irrigation
    system is not currently accepted and widely used by farmers in the upper YRB.
    4.2. Accessing the feasibility of border and drip irrigation The implementation
    of drip irrigation systems in the upper YRB can effectively reduce the demand
    for irrigation water and improve NUE. This reduction indirectly lessens the quantity
    of water diverted from the Yellow River. However, the net economic benefits resulting
    from water saving are minimal due to the very low price of irrigation water in
    the region. The decrease in N use in DI-M significantly reduced fertilizer input
    costs in comparison to BI-M. Drip irrigation ensured optimal water-salt conditions,
    leading to improved yields and profitability. Nevertheless, smallholder BI-M remains
    the dominant practice in current agricultural production in the upper YBR, owing
    to its inherent advantages of lower input costs, ease of operation, and familiarity
    among local farmers. More importantly, family labor costs are not accounted for
    in the total costs for smallholder BI-M, making it more profitable than intensive
    drip/border irrigation. This explains its widespread acceptance and adoption among
    farmers in the upper YRB. Although the analysis demonstrates that the economic
    cost of drip irrigation systems can be managed, it relies on farmers possessing
    comprehensive knowledge of operation and long-term maintenance skills. Additionally,
    the application of drip irrigation systems faces the challenge of a substantial
    initial investment. Recently, the government has taken several measures to promote
    and incentivize the use of drip irrigation systems. These include advocating for
    land consolidation, and participating in the investment and construction of pressure
    headers and main pipelines, especially in designated demonstration areas. In these
    cases, farmers are only responsible for acquiring the lowest order pipes at the
    field level. However, owing to limited knowledge among farmers, often characterized
    by older age and lower education levels, several management and technical issues
    persist. These include excessive and uneven irrigation, improper operation of
    filter systems, and clogging of drippers. Survey research further indicates that
    these issues raise the maintenance costs of drip irrigation system and reduce
    their operational lifespan, resulting in actual cost exceeding the anticipated
    normal operating costs. It is important to note that government investments in
    drip irrigation mainly focus on water conservation and ecological environment
    protection in the upper YRB. From the perspective of farmers’ recent economic
    interests, there is still insufficient motivation to adopt drip irrigation for
    existing smallholder farming systems. However, as the agricultural population
    decreases and the aging problem intensifies, the advantage of low agricultural
    labor costs associated with with smallholder BI-M will gradually diminish of even
    disappear. Consequently, drip irrigation will inevitably gain greater development
    in the upper YRB due to its labor-saving advantages. Moreover, the government
    should explore more effective approaches (e.g., water rights trading and water
    fee reform) to enhance the economic value of saved irrigation water, thereby improving
    the economic sustainability of drip irrigation applications. Furthermore, increased
    attention should be directed to the availability of groundwater sources when implementing
    DI-M, especially with regard to the distribution of brackish and salty water in
    the aquifer. In summary, our study provides valuable reference information regarding
    the use of border and drip irrigation, offering insights that can be beneficial
    to farmers, planners, managers, and policymakers aiming to promote water saving
    and sustainable development of the agricultural economy in the upper YRB. 5. Conclusion
    In this study, an integrated approach involving field experiments, agro-ecosystem
    modeling, and financial analysis was proposed to evaluate the multiple benefits
    and suitability of two typical irrigation methods, namely border irrigation and
    drip irrigation, in the Hetao region of the upper Yellow River basin (YRB). Field
    experiments involving maize cultivation with border irrigation and drip irrigation
    under plastic mulching (BI-M and DI-M) were conducted in Hetao during 2021 and
    2022. The AHC model was calibrated and validated using two-year experimental data.
    Furthermore, irrigation schedules were optimized for both BI-M and DI-M by incorporating
    an irrigation scheduling module. The irrigation and N-fertilization strategies
    for BI-M and DI-M were obtained and recommended through scenario simulations involving
    three GWD classes and five levels of N application. Subsequently, water-N use,
    N losses, crop yields, and economic benefits in both experimental and scenario
    cases were quantitatively evaluated, and the analysis provided valuable insights
    into the practical feasibility of using BI-M and DI-M in the upper YRB. The experimental
    results revealed that under shallow GWD conditions, BI-M in the current experiment
    had adverse effects on the soil and crops, including excessive deep percolation,
    N leaching, and water-salt stress. The optimized irrigation schedule of BI-M involved
    one pre-sowing irrigation and four irrigations during the crop growth period,
    each with a depth of 60–80 mm for different GWD levels; meanwhile, 250 kg ha−1
    N fertilizer was recommended for BI-M maize, resulting in significantly improved
    water-N utilization. For the application of DI-M, appropriate trigger conditions
    (TC1 and TC2, Table 4) were identified for shallow GWD, and relative-deep and
    deep GWDs, respectively, and recommended N fertilizer application rate of 200 kg ha−1.
    In comparison to the optimized BI-M, the optimized DI-M showed clear advantages
    in terms of water-saving, labor-saving, and eco-environmental benefits. Across
    three GWD classes, optimized DI-M saved 56–66 mm of irrigation water and 50 kg ha−1
    of N fertilizer. Moreover, crop yields with optimized DI-M were slightly higher
    than those with optimized BI-M, even with a 20% reduction in N application. The
    financial analysis showed that the optimized DI-M consistently provided stable
    net economic benefits ranging from 24,566 to 25,184 Yuan ha−1 under three GWD
    classes and five N application levels. Although optimized BI-M in intensive farming
    had different cost input structures, the net economic benefit remained comparable
    to that of DI-M under shallow GWD. A minor decrease in benefit (< 500 Yuan ha−1)
    occurred as GWDs increased. Notably, the net economic benefit of smallholder BI-M
    was higher than that of the intensive drip/border irrigation, with an additional
    benefit of 3000 Yuan ha−1, primarily because family labor costs were not considered.
    Given the advantages of lower cost inputs and ease of operation, smallholder BI-M
    continues to dominate in the upper YRB. However, Hetao is witnessing a decline
    in agricultural workforce and an aging population. In the future, with labor shortages,
    increasing labor costs, and expanding agricultural scale, drip irrigation may
    gradually replace the smallholder BI-M or even surpass intensive BI-M. Additionally,
    the challenges faced by current applications underscore the pressing need to address
    technical issues in maintaining and managing drip irrigation system while improve
    farmers’ ability to operate this technology effectively. CRediT authorship contribution

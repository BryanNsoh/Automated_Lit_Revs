    The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion
    of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport
    and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA),
    which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water,
    pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential
    to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental
    sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements,
    timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data
    analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara
    et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they
    can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images
    can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022,
    Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count
    and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which
    is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover,
    images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation.
    At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification
    and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising
    solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional
    approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha
    et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models
    with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered
    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging
    platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing
    refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches
    at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms
    that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can
    automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands
    worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and
    internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed
    in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency
    decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used
    for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto
    et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit
    counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further
    post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest
    density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019),
    as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021).
    Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential
    to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both
    new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing.
    Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021;
    Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et
    al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction
    (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification
    (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional
    image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are
    limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational
    power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large
    number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement
    these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation
    power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with
    high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the
    image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image
    computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement
    over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a)
    demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above
    89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm.
    These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve
    real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang
    et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier
    for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection
    with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a)
    reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications.
    They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective
    edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing
    unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan
    et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification
    of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via
    LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications
    in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled
    crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time
    crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet
    connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address
    this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts
    plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud
    via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM
    on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology
    that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only
    useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore,
    the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image
    processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through
    IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing
    algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an
    embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and
    image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing,
    and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN
    for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation,
    crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting,
    and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM
    to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud
    platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains
    the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported
    the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development.
    2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image
    collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for
    data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design,
    and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn
    and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai
    et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet
    for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for
    segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and
    counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting
    them. Download : Download high-res image (412KB) Download : Download full-size

    system (edge devices). 2.1. Image collection, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation
    Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using
    three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail
    cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with
    ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry
    Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the
    bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in
    the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the
    cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images
    used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could
    not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned
    above. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Left: An Illustration of how AICropCAM was set up in the field for
    image collection. In addition to the camera, other components such as the solar
    panel and data logger were also shown. Right: A close-up view of AICropCAM and
    its hardware components. All three standard image annotation techniques in deep
    learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification
    models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3)
    bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class
    were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were
    created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy
    from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation.
    Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants,
    soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation
    used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels
    from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models
    in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet)
    Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images
    caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted
    crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few
    leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the
    camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants
    at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants
    at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants
    at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions.
    Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light.
    Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the
    crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB
    image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used
    assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler.
    Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding
    boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy
    was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding
    boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing
    insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled
    using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training
    and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different
    DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for
    training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require
    more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only
    limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase
    the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation,
    color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and
    Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed
    in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training,
    validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation
    and image augmentation. Model Number of images Data Augmentation Techniques Total

    (same as CanopySegNet) Our main objective was not to make the most accurate prediction
    for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image
    processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore,
    we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet,
    which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2.
    DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the
    edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and
    image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet,
    and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize
    higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy
    and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image

    during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model
    backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet
    (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights
    initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50,
    Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were
    512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find
    the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi
    4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model
    for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes
    the hyperparameter values and training options for the final DCNN models deployed
    to the edge device. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) Table 3. Hyperparameter values

    used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and
    mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard
    index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of
    labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor,
    a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500
    Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM,
    and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission
    and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a
    Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an
    Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa
    Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled
    through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer
    battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having
    a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements.
    Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud
    with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM
    required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++
    in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image
    processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi
    4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to
    read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino
    MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed
    data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication
    from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel
    through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep
    learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models
    logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation,
    as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the
    program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the
    standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download

    image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters
    generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields
    holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and
    maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation
    from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before
    being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the
    crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest
    count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents
    a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the
    size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a
    single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table

    for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The
    data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card,
    allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field
    visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT
    platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry
    Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly,
    the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310.
    The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards
    it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication
    beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server
    includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough
    to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates
    (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device''s location. The third
    field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count,
    insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight.
    ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated
    in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only
    data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa
    library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry,
    2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification
    number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message,
    it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device),
    host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password,
    channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices
    can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to
    interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols.
    The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak
    data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission
    over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our
    demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet
    had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91;
    the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass”
    class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is
    for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary
    goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them
    for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based
    crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous
    images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera
    is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests
    through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download

    Confusion matrix for test images by CropClassiNet. CanopySegNet on the test images
    achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score
    of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding
    segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long,
    time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal
    curves of crop CC, as shown in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res image (621KB)

    and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According
    to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and
    reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before
    segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of
    false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting
    the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series
    on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to
    95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached
    a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models
    can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting
    conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and
    InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation

    of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet is given in Table 5. Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show
    the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative
    stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive
    stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels
    of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy. Download

    result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs.
    model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated
    vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects
    is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason
    for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond
    480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models
    into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution
    of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution
    the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a,
    Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances,
    we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the
    same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy
    for small object detection. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    labels. 3.2. Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands
    have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption
    is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be
    energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar
    power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM,
    and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for
    the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware,
    maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management.
    Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable
    for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore,
    we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic
    power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based
    central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the
    Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity

    detection 5.25 V × (0.62 – 0.70) A Arduino MKR1310 Sleep mode <0.01A Serial communication
    <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B
    with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse,
    and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The
    Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN
    access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption
    for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the
    highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had
    the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption
    because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the
    manufacturer''s specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The
    average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed
    for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines
    for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also
    noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time,
    but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration

    320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity,
    while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing
    models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular
    operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module.
    The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based
    image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring
    camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse
    IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching
    them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting
    crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short
    time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications,
    including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example,
    a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation
    or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth
    stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to
    the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers
    can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision
    spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential
    components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time
    crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured
    images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types
    for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy
    coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image;
    and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four
    DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important
    crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency
    decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the
    edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited
    to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential
    future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation,
    weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation,
    decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and
    disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by
    AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through
    crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements
    on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design
    are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential
    of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like
    a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification
    must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from
    other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the
    capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect
    types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally,
    improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object
    detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training
    image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture
    evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts
    images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication
    (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers
    of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed
    in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond
    corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective
    tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

  description: This paper aims to implement a wireless sensor network to automate
    greenhouse operations, with the primary objective of achieving optimal plant growth
    conditions. To effectively monitor crucial micro-climatic parameters such as temperature,
    soil moisture, light, pH, and salinity, the system employs slave unit sensor nodes
    equipped with a diverse array of sensors. Additionally, a mobile application is
    utilized to enable farmers to set customized threshold values for each parameter,
    granting them complete control over the greenhouse environment via their mobile
    devices. These threshold values serve as benchmarks to ensure that the growing

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bengaluru, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Climate change introduces us to many problems and the challenge is intensified
    by agriculture''s extreme vulnerability to climate change. Climate change is already
    having a negative impact, with rising temperatures, increased weather variability,
    shifting ecosystem boundaries, invasive crops and pests, and more frequent extreme
    weather events. The solution for such a problem is a controlled environment such
    as a greenhouse, also called a glasshouse, which is a building designed for the
    protection of tender or out-of-season plants against excessive cold or heat. Maintenance
    and working in the greenhouse are tough as the knowledge of multiple parameters
    such as Electric Conductivity (EC), pH, light intensity, humidity, moisture, and
    temperature is required. This procedure simplified the problem of obtaining the
    reading and the steps required to preserve the plants in a controlled environment.
    Here, drip irrigation is automated to water the plants in a regulated manner on
    a regular basis. Also, it aims to maintain pH and EC using water, by adding fertilizer
    and salt to control pH and EC [1]. Install automated light bulbs and curtains
    to control the light received by the plants in a regulated manner based on the
    plant''s requirements. For example, Gerbera is commercially propagated through
    the division of clumps (suckers). Tissue-cultured plants, on the other hand, can
    be used for commercial flower production. Day temperature of 22- 300C and night
    temperature of 120C to 160C is ideal for growth and flower production. An adequate
    amount of shade net (50%) must be provided to regulate excess light and temperature.
    Humidity should be maintained at 60% Farmers need frequent visits to their farms
    for tasks like watering and fertilizing, which can be costly and time-consuming.
    As agricultural lands grow, remote monitoring and management systems are becoming
    more prevalent. However, weak or inadequate internet connectivity can hinder remote
    farm monitoring and control. The Internet of Things is typically used in agriculture
    through a monitoring network with numerous sensor nodes. Using edge computing,
    which distributes the cloud server burden and reduces wait times, could help address
    this issue. Edge computing applications include pest identification, product safety
    tracking, autonomous equipmentuse, promoting agricultural technology, and intelligent
    management [2]. The paper is divided into 6 sections. Section 1, consists of an
    introduction and motivation. In section 2, a detailed literature review is presented.
    Section 3 consists of the system overview which includes information about the
    slave unit, master unit, methodology, and block diagrams. Section 4 is all about
    hardware and software implementation with all flowcharts. Section 5 explains about
    Results. In Section 6, the conclusion is mentioned. SECTION II. Related Work Greenhouses
    are structures, either with frames or inflated, that are covered with transparent
    materials. They are designed to provide a suitable environment for plant growth,
    allowing for optimal growth and productivity by controlling environmental-mental
    conditions to a partial or full extent. This section includes research done in
    Smart Greenhouse monitoring Systems and EDGE Computing. An automatic irrigation
    system using edge nodes has beenproposed that is unaffected by communication delay
    and disconnection [3]. The Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B were evaluated
    as edge node candidates andthe Jetson Nano was found to perform better at hightemperatures.
    The system can be used to evaluate AImodels and determine water stress for crop
    cultivation. It is currently used for high sugar tomato cultivation in Japan with
    manual parameter management. An Intelligent IoT-based Automated Irrigation system
    has been developed that captures sensor data on soil moisture and temperature.
    The data is communicated to a Raspberry Pi3 control unit where a KNN machine learning
    algorithmis used for analysis and irrigation prediction. The system is developed
    using cheap embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi 3 and Arduino Uno [4]. A wireless
    sensor network is used to gather data for the prediction of energy and water requirements
    for maintaining a greenhouse''s climate [5]. The input data from sensors is processed
    using fuzzy logic methods to produce output data. The greenhouse is managed and
    monitored through an Android-based user interface. The paper [6] presents a system
    architecture that integrates artificial intelligence at the local network layer
    for smart agriculture and farming applications. Edge and Fog computing, as well
    as LPWAN technology, are used to extend functionality and solve the low-bandwidth
    transmission challenge of LPWAN technologies. The system includes a sensor node,
    an Edge gateway, LoRa repeaters, a Fog gateway, cloud servers, and an end-user
    terminal application. The article in [7], discusses the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture and the challenges of integrating this technology
    with traditional farming practices. It lists the available sensors for soil preparation,
    crop status, irrigation, and insect/pest detection, and how this technology helps
    the growers throughout the crop stages. Applying the fuzzy logic method to the
    input data from sensors (temperature and humidity sensors, such as the DHT11)
    has produced the output data. Through an Android-based user interface, the writers
    manage andkeep an eye on the greenhouse [8]. A greenhouse smartphone monitoring
    system has been suggested that combines Eclipse''s Android programming tools and
    Visual Studio''s C++/MFC. The system offers strong cross-platform and secondary
    development portability, enabling real-time data interchange between client software
    and the core module [9]. The article [10] provides a comprehensive overview of
    important technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence used in agriculture
    to inform consumers about the products they consume. The research also sheds light
    on difficulties encountered with tasks like task assignment, data analysis, service
    stability, and privacy protection. Edge AI, also known as local network layer
    artificial intelligence, enables smart farming and agricultural applications using
    edge and fog computing as well as LPWANtechnology for extensive coverage. Moving
    data analyticsand compression close to end devices solves the low-bandwidth transmission
    issue of LPWAN technologies. The system [11], [12] includes a sensor node, an
    Edgegateway, LoRa repeaters, a Fog gateway, cloud servers, and an end-user terminal
    application. The article discusses the impact of IoT-based technologies on smart
    agriculture and the potential of wireless sensors. It lists sensors for various
    agricultural applications and explains how they aid farmers throughout the production
    process. The article also highlights modern IoT-based agricultural systems and
    platforms. The article [13] highlights the state-of-the-art IoT-based architectures
    and platforms used in agriculture. The system that forecasts how much water and
    energy willbe needed to keep greenhouse climate factors like soil moisture, relative
    humidity, and temperature stable. Using a wireless sensor network, node packs
    arranged in a star topology are used to gather the data needed for predictions.
    The papers [14], [15] discusses the advantages of advanced wireless sensor networks
    for soil sampling processes, the challenge of maintaining power supply, and the
    potential of ambient energy harvesting as a solution, while also noting the current
    limitations of battery less sensor nodes for extensive environmental monitoring.
    The paper presents a Wireless SensorNetwork prototype with MicaZ nodes for monitoring
    temperature, light, pressure, and humidity in greenhouses, sharing measurement
    data through the Internet of Things for remote control by farmers via mobile phones
    or computers. The paper explores the automation of greenhouse monitoring systems
    using edge nodes, automated plant watering, and sensors to track temperature,
    light, humidity, and soil moisture. It highlights the significance of also monitoring
    soil pH and EC, which can be challenging when dealing with multiple plantation
    areas. To address this, a mobile application and a master-slave unit are proposed,
    enabling the owner to manage all parameters remotely and efficiently across different
    greenhouse sections. SECTION III. The System Overview The system consists of both
    hardware and software technologies. The following sections describe the methodology
    and the block diagram of the system. The goal of this Paper is to fully automate
    a greenhouse shown in Fig. 1. There are three parts in the system, 1. Mobile Application.
    2. Slave unit. and 3. Master Unit. The Mobile application is used to set the parameters
    with respect to the plantation area. The Slave units are implemented in the plantation
    area of the greenhouse and used to sense the temperature, light, moisture, pH,
    and salinity using multiple sensors. The sensed data are sent to the master unit
    wirelessly. The data received from the Slave unit is to the master unit. The master
    unit will take appropriate action to control parameters in the greenhouse with
    respect to the data set by the owner through the mobile application. To regulate
    the pH, EC, temperature, and moisture, a separate solution is prepared and kept
    in a tank. The app helps the user (Farmer)to view the greenhouse condition and
    change, control, and setparameters for the plants as required remotely. The app
    also contains default parameters to set for specific plants. Fig. 1. Block Diagram
    of Greenhouse. Show All A. Mobile Application The owner-specified plant''s threshold
    values for temperature, moisture, light, and soil pH are set using a mobileapplication.
    Users must first sign up and log in using the same email. Users can set data in
    2 modes in the application. The first one is done manually using a slider as shown
    in Fig. 2(a), and if the plant owner is unaware of its specifications, they can
    simply choose the plant type as shown in Fig. 2(b). In accordance with the owner''s
    threshold valve, the master unit will take the appropriate action. Fig. 2. (a)
    Login page of app. (b) Manual setting using slider and Plant type selection. Show
    All B. Slave Unit The Slave unit consists of temperature, luminosity, pH, and
    soil EC sensors along with a microcontroller i.e., ESP32 as shown in Fig. 3. The
    sensor node senses the environmental parameters such as temperature, luminosity,
    soil pH, EC, and Moisture inside the greenhouse with the help of DHT11, light,
    pH, and EC (JXBS-3001-EC-RS-I) sensors respectively. The sensed data is sent to
    the Master unit wirelessly. Multiple slave units are deployed at strategic points
    of the greenhouse. The control signals from these different nodes communicate
    with the master unit. Fig. 3. Slave Unit Show All C. Master Unit As shown in Fig.
    4, the proposed system''s master unit consists of a microcontroller (ESP32), solenoid
    valves, and a diaphragm motor. The control signals from the sensor nodes are received
    by the Master unit from the slave unit. The received data from the slave unit
    is stored locally and also transferred to the cloud using ESP32 module and analyzed
    as an edge node. The control signals indicate the conditions prevalent in the
    greenhouse. The control signals are relayed to the microcontroller which processes
    the data and necessary actions such as bringing the temperature down using the
    humidifiers, improving the lighting conditions maintaining using artificial lighting.
    Soil with a pH level below 6.5 is considered acidic and requires the amendment
    of lime, while soil with a pH level above 8.5 is categorized as acidic soil and
    requires the amendment of gypsum which is added to the soil by mixing it with
    water controlled by the solenoid valves. If the EC level of the soil exceeds the
    established threshold, which indicates the presence of saline soil, and the recommended
    solution is leaching to flush out the excess salts. Fig. 4. Master Unit Show All
    SECTION IV. Implementation A. Hardware The system hardware in the slave unit consists
    of Soil EC sensor, pH sensor, Light sensor, DHT11, Moisture sensor and ESP32 module.
    The primary responsibility of the slave unit is to gather and transmit data to
    the master unit about all sensed data. Fig. 5 explains the complete system design
    of slave circuit. The complete design of the master unit circuit is provided in
    Fig. 6. The primary role of the master unit is to regulate the soil''s acidic
    pH, base pH, temperature, moisture, and electrical conductivity (EC) using solenoid
    valves. These valves are controlled by the ESP32 microcontroller integrated into
    the master unit. The working of solenoid valves depends on the data sent by slave
    unit to master unit. Master unit controls solenoid valves so that the environment
    is suitable for greenhouse plants. Pumping solution out of tanks for drip irrigation
    is done with a diaphragm motor. Fig. 5. Circuit of Slave Unit Show All Fig. 6.
    Circuit of Master Unit. Show All B. Flowchart This Paper employs software technologies
    to build user-facing applications, and it stores all of the data it has gathered
    on the cloud. A mobile application was created to update the preloaded data and
    configure the threshold parameters for the particular plantation. The user (owner)
    must first register and log in for the same account in order to manually set the
    parameters using the slider and establish a set of settings, particularly for
    the plantation area. The mobile application''s flowchart, as shown in Fig. 7.
    Fig. 8 explains how the slave unit operates. Fig. 7. Mobile Application flow graph
    Show All Fig. 8. Slave unit flow graph Show All The slave unit collects data from
    all sensors and transmits it to the master unit as soon as it receives power.
    Themaster unit flow will be managed in accordance with the data sent, as shown
    in Fig. 9. The water solution value will open and the motors will pump to maintain
    the soil''s moisture levelif the moisture value falls below the threshold value.
    Then, if the temperature data exceeds the threshold, sprinklers are utilized to
    maintain the temperature. Fig. 9. Master unit flow graph Show All Acid solution
    is used when the pH value exceeds the threshold. Base solution is used when the
    pH value is below the threshold. A motor will pump solutions to keep the pH of
    the soil stable. Then, with the aid of lights, intensity is adjusted by comparing
    light intensity with the threshold value. SECTION V. Results As a case study,
    the Gerbera plants are chosen for implementing and testing the proposed work in
    real-time. Table I represents the ideal environmental conditions for the growth
    of the Gerbera plant. The outcomes of the work are presented in the subsequent
    sections. Table II shows the greenhouse monitoring system can deviate from ideal
    values for optimal plant growth conditions. However, after deployment and operation,
    these parameters are effectively controlled and regulated, resulting in improved
    plant cultivation conditions. The mobile application login success depicted in
    Fig. 2 signifies thatusers have gained access to the system. The cloud-based infrastructure
    empowers real-time monitoring of greenhouse conditions while offering manual parameter
    customization and plant type selection, enhancing usability and adaptability.
    Table I. Ideal Values of the Parameters for Gerbera Plant Table II. Comparison
    of Parameters Inside Greenhouse Before and After Controlling to That of Ideal
    Values The model implementation displayed in Fig. 12 showcases the master unit
    and slave units, forming an efficient architecture for data processing and control.
    Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 provide avisual representation of all parameters before and
    after monitoring and control, taking into account the user mobile application''s
    threshold value. These figures illustrate the changes in various measured quantities
    and how they compare to the set threshold. The visual representation presents
    a clear overview of the parameter values, allowing users to assess the effectiveness
    of the monitoring process and identify any deviations from the desired threshold.
    The successful uploading of all slave unit data shown in Fig. 13 through the app
    enables real-time monitoring. Finally, Fig. 14 demonstrates the successful testing
    conducted in the greenhouse, validating the system''s effectiveness in maintaining
    optimal growing conditions. From survey, so far pH and EC in real time is not
    implemented but in this paper both pH and EC are controlled. Fig. 10. (a), (b),
    (c) and (d) are Light Intensity before, after monitoring and Temperature of the
    greenhouse before and after monitoring respectively Show All Fig. 11. (a), (b),

    All Fig. 13. Control Page with various parameters. Show All Fig. 14. Real-time
    implementation of the system. Show All SECTION V. Conlusion The proposed system''s
    primary contribution is focused on maintaining the soil pH within the desired
    range. Users have the ability to set all relevant parameters using a mobile application.
    Additionally, all processing tasks carried out by the master unit are efficiently
    performed through edge computing. This ensures effective soil pH regulation and
    simplifies the greenhouse management process for users. Smart greenhouse monitoring
    using edge computing was tested in real time at Akshaya nursery near Gulur. As
    part of the proposed work, the master unit and slave unit both underwent successful
    design and testing. The master unit has the ability to control all greenhouse
    parameters, enabling thorough management. The data from the slave unit can be
    successfully updated to the cloud system, guaranteeing precise and real-time monitoring
    of the greenhouse environment. Two slave units are used to get the soil and environment
    conditions such as Soil pH, temperature, moisture, and light intensity. A master
    unit is used to control the different solenoid valves to let the different solutions
    flow into the plantation area to maintain the soil pH, moisture and control the
    artificial lighting according to requirements based on edge computing. A mobile
    application that allows users to manually change parameters based on plant type
    has also been developed. For quick and personalized control of greenhouse conditions,
    this app offers a user-friendly interface, with these developments able to automate
    the greenhouse, which improved plant growth and reduced manual labor. Edge computing
    eliminates processing delays in greenhouse automation systems by completing processes
    faster, typically within 3–4 minutes. This local data processing and decision-making
    reduces latency, enhancing efficiency andresponsiveness, allowing timely actions,
    and minimizing delaysin critical processes. Authors Figures References Keywords

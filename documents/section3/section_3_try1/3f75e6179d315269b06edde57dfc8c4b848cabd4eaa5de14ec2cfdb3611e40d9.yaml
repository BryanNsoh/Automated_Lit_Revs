  description: 'The automatic irrigation control system based on web is a main trend
    of current water-saving technology development. In order to provide personalized
    irrigation control scheme and precise water metering, the system needs higher
    real-time data transmission performance. The real-time performance of web application
    is currently poor, and difficult to meet the needs of accurate irrigation control.
    Aiming at this problem, in this paper, the structure and bottleneck of real-time
    data transmission of web-based automatic irrigation control system was analyzed,
    and the data push scheme of improving the real-time performance was proposed.
    Based on observer pattern, the data push mode between data layer and logic layer,
    and that between logic layer and presentation layer were specifically designed.
    In the former data transmission process, the observed object is database table,
    and the observer is Web server monitoring program. After the data is inserted
    into the data table, the database immediately triggers the stored procedure to
    notify the relevant Web service program and executes updating data subject. In
    the latter data transmit process, the observed object is program object running
    on the Web server, and the observer is client program object running on the browser.
    Because the Web service program cannot directly initiate data connection to the
    client program. Therefore, in order to implement the observer pattern, it is essential
    to establish a real-time tow-way data connection in the client program loading
    process. Then through subscribing a group of data subjects, the client program
    can receive real-time data push as soon as the data subjects are updated. The
    connection between client and Web server is established and maintained by client
    connect request, then a streaming connection is evoked by client through which
    Web server streams data down to the client with no poll overhead. But these client-to-server
    messages are not sent over the streaming connection, instead an internal HTTP
    connection was used to send data for the duration of the operation. Through database,
    server and client programming, the construction of web-based irrigation control
    system and the realization of the real time data push mechanism were implemented.
    Then tests were carried out to quantitatively assess real-time performance of
    data acquisition and instruction sending process. The result showed that: the
    average delay of the data acquisition process was 1.7 seconds, the average delay
    of the control process was 3.4 seconds, and the real-time performance could basically
    meet the needs of equipment control and irrigation decision-making. The average
    delay of one-way data transmission in the software system was no more than 130
    milliseconds. The delay factors of the data pull mode were totally eliminated,
    and this improvement plays an important role in enhancing overall real-time performance
    of system. The results of this paper showed that, through the reasonable design
    and development, the real-time performance of the Web based irrigation control
    system can reach the level of desktop control system. When the system is accessed
    through internet or 4G mobile communication network, the delay is on the hundreds
    milliseconds level, which has little effect on the real-time performance of the
    system. The data push scheme can also be applied to other related monitoring and
    control software system in internet of things, which can improve the real-time
    performance with low cost.'

    676 ms，控制数据从发送到结果返回的平均延时为3 378 ms，基本能够满足其设备控制和灌溉决策的需要；软件系统内采集和控制过程的数据库至客户端数据传输的平均延时分别为124和118
    ms，消除了数据拉取模式中的延时因素，对提高系统实时性起到了重要作用。该研究为基于Web的实时监测与控制系统的开发提供了方法参考。   关键词: 灌溉  /  数据采集  /  设计  /  灌溉控制  /  实时  /  数据推送  /  观察者模式   Abstract:

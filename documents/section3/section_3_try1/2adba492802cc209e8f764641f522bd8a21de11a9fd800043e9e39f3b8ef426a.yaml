    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Smart farming in the contemporary
    world has gained paramount importance while playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing
    agricultural practices [1]. Conversely, the increasing global population along
    with environmental challenges have made the adoption of smart farming techniques
    indispensable. By leveraging data-driven insights, automation, and precision agriculture,
    smart farming not only enhances productivity but also addresses the pressing need
    for sustainable resource management [2]. On the other hand, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has been a promising technology to provide connection among a large volume
    of devices that are deployed to provide a specific service for smart agriculture.
    A wide range of different use cases such as smart greenhouse monitoring, pest
    control, and irrigation/soil management can be considered [1], [3]. These use
    cases are mostly computation intensive and delay-sensitive [1], [4], [5]. A large
    volume of connected devices implies a large volume of data that must be processed
    accurately in a timely manner [6]. Such data computation and analysis demands
    a significant amount of processing and storage resources which put a constraint
    on energy-limited IoT devices. Depending on the specific application, the aggregated
    data from monitoring sensors, and captured images/videos from installed cameras
    in the field need to be processed in real-time to turn raw data into usable information.
    Introducing IoT and its applications in modern agriculture provides this industry
    with suitable tools to support farmers for better productivity, quality, and profitability
    [1]. Therefore, the scope of IoT extends beyond just agricultural land, encompassing
    a broader spectrum that includes the supply chain as well [7], [8]. Battery-operated
    IoT devices lack the capability to perform energy-intensive computations independently.
    Additionally, they face challenges related to limited processing power and storage
    capacity [9]. Therefore, MEC is proposed as a promising technology to address
    these limitations by offering additional computation and storage resources for
    IoT systems. This is achieved by providing servers where IoT devices can offload
    their computation tasks [10], [11]. On the other hand, large-scale agricultural
    operations often involve the distribution of IoT devices across expansive areas.
    In such scenarios, challenges may emerge concerning communication, particularly
    with issues related to the limited reachability between IoT devices and MEC infrastructure.
    To address these challenges, a proposed solution involves the integration of a
    network comprising unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the capabilities
    of MEC [12], [13]. This approach aims to mitigate communication limitations stemming
    from the constrained transmission power of IoT devices and simultaneously improve
    network coverage. Due to the easy-to-deploy, cost-effective, and strong capabilities
    of the UAVs, UAV-aided MEC has attracted much attention and is widely utilized
    in smart agriculture to provide a high-quality line-of-sight (LoS) link to IoT
    devices [1], [3], [5], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The versatility and mobility exhibited
    by UAVs in response to changing weather conditions, alongside their straightforward
    deployment and economically viable maintenance costs, collectively establish UAVs
    as a proficient solution for supplying IoT devices with the necessary resources.
    Nevertheless, the UAVs themselves are quite often battery-powered which means
    their available energy is limited [6]. 1) Age of Information Besides energy, the
    freshness of information is another important aspect that needs to be considered
    in environmental monitoring and smart agriculture applications in which rapid
    protective and/or recovery actions are needed. Being more specific, within the
    realm of environmental monitoring applications and precision farming [18] in a
    UAV-aided MEC network, the IoT devices are strategically dispersed throughout
    specified regions to seamlessly gather real-time environmental data. Then the
    collected and pre-processed data by the UAVs finds its transmission route toward
    a localized MEC server; where a comprehensive analysis is conducted to facilitate
    the extraction of pertinent insights. These insights, in turn, play a pivotal
    role in fostering prompt agricultural decision-making and actions. The objectives
    can be the refinement of operations, the performance optimization, or the reduction
    of expenditure [1], [14], [19]. This expansion of smart agriculture’s scope ensures
    a secure and sustainable food supply chain, underpinned by contextual and situational
    awareness derived from real-time event processing [20]. Accordingly, such applications
    are characterized by their intensive computational demands and time-sensitive
    nature [1], [3], [5], [14], [18]. Concisely, the freshness of information becomes
    a critical factor that demands careful consideration. Packet delay and inter-delivery
    times, as two exemplary metrics that are commonly used to quantify the performance
    of real-time applications, are not adequate to represent the freshness of information
    received at the destination. Recently, age of information (AoI) has been proposed
    as a novel criterion to quantitatively evaluate the freshness of information [6],
    [17], [21]. For a flow of data packets, and with emphasis on the freshness of
    data at the destination, AoI is defined as the time elapsed from receiving the
    most recent packet belonging to that data-packet flow [22], [23]. 2) Network Function
    Virtualization (NFV) From the above discussion, in the context of UAV-enabled
    smart agriculture paradigm – which constitutes the focal point of this paper –
    UAVs are confronted with a substantial amount of data necessitating prompt processing.
    This scenario embodies a dynamic computational framework wherein a bunch of processing
    functions demands seamless implementation across both the UAVs and the local server
    [20], [24], [25]. NFV is a key technology for implementing and managing computing
    machines in a reliable, efficient, and robust manner [26]. The NFV virtualizes
    the network functions (NFs) and abstracts them from the physical hardware, which
    enables rapid service function chaining (SFC) and service provisioning in UAV-aided
    MEC applications [27]. Considering the data-intensive and computation-based application
    of smart agriculture, multiple computing functions in the form of virtual network
    functions (VNF) should be deployed sequentially and orderly to provide the processed
    data for the final decision-making at the local MEC-server. Utilizing NFV significantly
    enhances the agility in deploying and managing network components and improves
    the robustness and scalability of networks [27], [28]. Therefore, a critical challenge
    to address is the optimal and efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions
    (VNFs) and determining how to route information packets among VNF components over
    the available NFV infrastructure, i.e., UAVs and the MEC server. The decision
    to distribute and allocate VNFs between both UAVs and the server, rather than
    solely on one of them, aligns with the primary goal of the proposed scheme—to
    minimize the Age of Information (AoI) while maintaining energy efficiency. Network
    traffic and the workload on both UAVs and MEC servers fluctuate over time, while
    changing channel conditions between the parties necessitate adjustments in the
    required communication resources for packet forwarding. Furthermore, certain processing
    functions, such as compression, may alter the packet size, so the trade-off of
    performing these functions locally and sending the smaller packets with spending
    fewer communication resources versus doing the entire processing locally becomes
    pivotal. Consequently, the placement must dynamically adjust to new conditions
    to ensure the minimization of AoI and energy efficiency [28]. In light of this,
    a general condition has been considered where the VNFO can, depending on network
    conditions (processing node resources, service type, and channel conditions),
    decide on the optimal placement to minimize AoI and energy consumption. The work
    presented in [24] is a use-case of the practical implementation of smart agriculture
    in real-world contexts; where, the authors leverage a confluence of cloud computing,
    edge computing, and NFV technology to conceive a comprehensive framework tailored
    to the essential demands of soilless precision farming practiced within a fully-recirculating
    greenhouse [24]. 3) Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) The VNF placement and
    scheduling in our network settings can be expressed as integer programming with
    some constraints that reflect the service requirements and the network infrastructure’s
    restrictions. Nevertheless, this problem is NP-complete and there is no standard
    solver that can solve such problems in polynomial time [29], especially for large-scale
    networks where the required computation to find the optimal solution increases
    exponentially. Recently, machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligent
    (AI) based solutions appear as a viable way to solve such complex problems in
    polynomial time [17], [29], [30]. Since its inception in 2017 [31], Federated
    Learning (FL) has reshaped many emerging intelligent IoT systems toward advanced
    FL architecture. The distributed nature of FL, where some agents cooperatively
    train a global ML model without directly sharing the local data, makes FL an attractive
    alternative to traditional centralized ML schemes. To be more specific, FL by
    pushing intelligent ML functions to the network edge enhances the privacy and
    scalability of IoT applications and networks [30]. In this paper, our focus is
    on use cases in smart agriculture that require live streaming and analysis, such
    as surveillance and environmental monitoring. Specifically, we address the flexible
    dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs within the context of delay-sensitive
    services. The approach involves distributing VNFs across processing nodes, utilizing
    UAVs and local MEC server in a UAV-aided MEC network. The objective is to perform
    SFC while ensuring the freshness of information by jointly minimizing AoI and
    total energy consumption throughout the network. Condensing the system model and
    the definition of the problem, we present the following key insights: In the realm
    of smart agriculture applications, real-time information is collected by IoT devices
    on a smart farm and transmitted through hovering UAVs to the local server. VNFs
    must be executed sequentially on the raw packets, as they represent split functionalities
    of a single processing job. Meanwhile, certain VNFs, such as compression, may
    potentially alter packet sizes. Various service types are assumed, each with its
    specific VNF chain. The challenge involves determining the optimal placement and
    scheduling of VNF chains on processing nodes (UAVs and the local server), accounting
    for processing time, transmission delay, and power consumption (both transmit
    and processing power) in a distributed manner. We will demonstrate analytically
    that the problem: Exhibits circular symmetry, wherein the optimal policies of
    the agents (UAVs) are identical. The local observations of the agents serve as
    sufficient statistics for determining the optimal policy, We will show how these
    two features will simplify the problem significantly. Subsequently, we present
    a novel solution for solving the modeled problem. The main contributions of our
    paper are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge this is the first
    time that the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop
    UAV-aided MEC network for smart agriculture is considered, while the problem is
    formulated as a joint AoI and Energy minimization. We formulate this joint optimization
    problem as a decentralized partially observable MDP (DEC-POMDP), where the parties
    are not aware of the true state and just make decisions based on their local observations.
    We adopted the structural feature of the problem and have analytically shown that
    under the satisfaction of certain symmetry conditions, the local observation of
    the parties (agents) would be a sufficient statistic for determining the optimal
    solution. As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we proposed a novel FL-based
    algorithm called Asynchronous FL Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) in which a set of distributed
    parties learn in parallel and aggregate their own experience through a coordinator.
    A Multi-hop network is considered, where the UAVs can offload their computing
    tasks to the other UAVs as well as the local MEC server. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows: In Section II some state-of-the-art studies will be reviewed.
    Section III describes the system model and the main components of the system in
    detail. Section IV presents the problem definition and formulation. In Section
    V, the problem is expressed as a DEC-POMDP, and some analytical results are given
    that support our proposed FL-based solution presented in Section VI. The complexity
    analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented in Section VII. The effectiveness
    and performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in Section VIII. Finally,
    Section IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Works In this section, we
    review some state-of-the-art studies on AoI and energy-aware UAV-aided MEC for
    smart agriculture. The prospects of using UAVs for smart agriculture are immense.
    Moreover, UAVs are easy to deploy and cost-effective which motivates their use
    in smart agriculture [1], [6], [32]. For a comprehensive survey on IoT-based smart
    agriculture and the emerging technologies mentioned in the previous section refer
    to [1]. In [13], Mozaffari et al. have considered the reliable design of IoT’s
    uplink communication in a scenario in which multiple UAVs are deployed to collect
    data from ground IoT devices. In particular, a framework for jointly optimizing
    the trajectory of the UAVs, IoT-to-UAV association, and IoT’s uplink power is
    proposed with the aim of minimizing the total energy consumption and mobility
    of the UAVs. However, in the formulated problem, the delay of the forwarded data
    across the UAV network is not considered. Nguyen et al. [5] have considered this
    issue as the problem of processing deadline-critical tasks which are fed to a
    network of hovering UAVs that support the IoT devices deployed in a smart farm.
    It is assumed that the smart farm is equipped with a multi-access MEC infrastructure.
    In such a circumstance, the energy-efficient monitoring problem is modeled as
    a multi-objective maximization problem which aims to maximize the number of tasks
    that are successfully processed before their deadline. Then, a Q-Learning-based
    solution is proposed to solve the problem. The same authors in [5] have extended
    their proposed scheme to a DQN-based solution [33] and to a multi-actor-based
    risk-sensitive RL approach [32]. Although, the goal of the aforementioned studies
    is to minimize the energy consumption in the network, however, the proposed solutions
    are basically centralized and the communication overhead of the centralized approaches
    is itself a source of energy waste. The AoI as a metric for determining the freshness
    of information has been used in some recent works On UAV-aided IoT networks [6],
    [17], [23], [34], [35]. Buyukates and Ulukus [34] examined a status update system
    where update packets require processing to extract embedded useful information.
    The source node sends information to a computation unit (CU) with a master node
    and worker nodes. The master node assigns tasks, aggregates results, and sends
    them back to the source node for updating. The analysis focuses on the age performance
    of various schemes in the presence of stragglers, considering i.i.d. exponential
    transmission delays and i.i.d. shifted exponential computation times. Then, the
    best scheme that minimizes the average age is presented. In [35], the authors
    analyzed the average age of information (AoI) and average peak AoI (PAoI) in a
    multiuser Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. The system considers three computing
    schemes: local computing, edge computing, and partial computing (where the computational
    tasks are partially performed at the edge and the remaining is performed by the
    local server). To address the complexity, upper and lower bounds on average AoI
    are provided, enabling an examination of optimal offloading decisions based on
    MEC system parameters. In [6], Han et al. modeled a UAV-aided IoT network using
    a Markov chain. The freshness of data packets is defined using AoI and they analyzed
    the IoT devices as first-come-first-served (FCFS) model and M/M/1 queue. Sun et
    al. [17], employed AoI to propose an AoI-energy-aware data collection scheme for
    IoT networks in which the UAVs are used to collect data. Here, AoI is used to
    quantify the temporal correlation among data packets. Then, an algorithm for determining
    the UAV’s flight speed, hovering locations, and allocated bandwidth to IoT devices
    is proposed that jointly minimizes energy consumption and the weighted sum of
    expected average AoI in the network. In [23], a UAV-aided wireless powered IoT
    scheme is proposed, where a UAV flies from a data center toward IoT sensory nodes
    to transfer energy and collect their information and then it returns back to the
    data center. The goal is to minimize the average AoI of the collected data from
    sensor modes. For such circumstances, an optimization problem is formulated, and
    then a suboptimal method is proposed that first decomposes the problem into two
    subproblems. The solution to the first subproblem is the input for the second
    subproblem. It is worth mentioning that the AoI is basically an end-to-end metric;
    Hence, even though the aforementioned works try to minimize the AoI, for the use
    cases in smart agriculture that the captured data needs some live processing before
    being turned into useful information, these approaches are not effective as they
    just consider the problem of finding the best data flow path. In the context of
    UAV-aided MEC for IoT networks, each service can be represented as a service function
    chain (SFC) consisting of ordered processing functions in the form of VNFs that
    can be geographically placed on to local MEC-server or the UAVs. However, in a
    network with numerous IoT devices and dynamic network load, the placement of VNF
    instances and routing among them in an optimal and efficient manner is a challenging
    problem [27], [28]. In the literature, this problem is referred to as the SFC
    dynamic orchestration problem (SFC-DOP) [27]. In [27], Liu et al. presented a
    DRL-based framework for dynamic SFC orchestration in IoT networks. Huang et al.
    in [36] dealt with the problem of scalability and flexibility of static orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs. Then, a FL-based SFC orchestration is proposed which is scalable
    and benefits from low communication cost. Table 1 presents an overview of the
    previously mentioned studies, emphasizing the main topics they concentrated on.
    Although, in the literature, the UAV-aided MEC architecture is mainly proposed
    as a technique to compensate for the energy and computational limitations of IoT
    networks, however, existing solutions for NFV-enabled SFC require IoT nodes to
    exchange large volumes of local data with a centralized server or among the distributed
    agents. Considering the energy limitation of IoT devices and battery-powered UAVs,
    this significantly causes waste of the network energy. In this paper, we deal
    with this inconsistency and propose a novel FL-based solution for the dynamic
    orchestration of SFCs in a multi-hop and UAV-aided MEC network. To the best of
    our knowledge, this is the first time that the problem of dynamic orchestration
    of NFV-enabled SFCs in a multi-hop UAV-aided MEC network is considered. What makes
    our approach unique is the adoption of the inherent structural aspects of the
    problem, typical in most scenarios, to introduce a decentralized solution that
    is analytically demonstrated to be valid. The proposed method is asynchronous
    FL-based, enabling distributed parties to independently learn locally and subsequently
    contribute to the training of the global model asynchronously [38], [39]. In other
    words, the parties are allowed to directly share gradients with the coordinator
    (here, the MEC server) after every local update and asynchronous of the other
    parties. This further enhances the training speed and efficiency of our proposed
    approach [39]. The coordinator in turn can perform the aggregation and update
    the global model whenever an update from one of the distributed parties is received.
    This approach improves the whole system’s scalability and alleviates the straggler
    impact, i.e., users who may have slower performance [38]. TABLE 1 Summary of Related

    We consider a real-time IoT network for smart agriculture applications, where,
    the IoT network provides real-time monitoring and visibility to network operators
    by video/image streaming. For such circumstances, several use cases from remote
    monitoring to security can be considered. As it is depicted in Fig. 1, a set N
    of N IoT devices collect real-time information from a smart farm and send the
    packets to a local server. A UAV-aided MEC architecture is considered, where packets
    are forwarded through an Aerial Network consisting of U hovering UAVs toward the
    local server. We consider applications in which some processing functions, from
    primary processes (e.g., compression) to advanced ones (e.g., object recognition)
    must be sequentially performed on the raw packets. Each IoT device is associated
    with one of the UAVs in its range. U denote the set of all U UAVs in the network.
    The local server is indeed a MEC-server1 denoted by M . A set S={ S k } K k=1
    with |S|=K different service types is assumed. Each service type S k itself consists
    of a set F k ={ F k f } F k f=1 including F k different processing functions that
    should be performed on the packets of that service and F denotes a set of all
    processing functions of all services, F= ⋃ k∈S ( F k ) . The input and output
    packet sizes of the function f of service type k are ρ k f and ϱ k f , respectively.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Let s k n ∈{0,1} denote the service type k∈S
    in IoT node n∈N is active, s k n =1 , or not, s k n =0 . In each IoT node one
    of the K different services is running, ∑ k∈S s k n =1,∀n∈N . To perform the processing
    functions, the MEC-server M and each UAV u is able to run F= ∑ k∈S F k different
    VNF types on their physical computing machine.2 The proposed architecture is based
    on ETSI-NFV standard [40] which is a globally accepted architecture for implementing
    the NFV. According to ETSI-NFV, in each physical machine (processing node) p∈U∪M
    (All U UAVs and the local server M), the VNF manager (VNFM) is responsible to
    manage its computing and storage resources among the VNFs it hosts. The total
    available resources at processing node p is indicated by C p , the computing capacity
    in Hz, and B p , the memory capacity in Byte. The VNF orchestrator (VNFO), hosted
    by the local server, places and schedules the chain of VNFs through Aerial Domain
    and Local (MEC) Server. For a summary of the key symbols and variables used in
    the system model and problem formulation, refer to Table 2. TABLE 2 Key Symbols
    and Variables B. VNF Placement and Scheduling We consider a discrete-time system
    with two hierarchical timing levels. First, the time is divided into equal time
    slots TS with duration T indexed by t=1,2,… . On top of that, we have the VNF-scheduling
    time slots t ~ with duration T ˜ that is multiples of T , and it is a single round
    of VNF placement and scheduling update. At the beginning of each time slot t ~
    , the VNFO updates the VNF placements. Each UAV u segregates data packets from
    IoT nodes sharing the same service type, say k , into a packet-flow Υ k u (t)
    , which it then transmits across the aerial network to the local server. The set
    F k ={ V fk } F k f=1 of F k different VNFs (processing functions) must be performed
    on data packets of the IoT nodes with service type k . At the beginning of each
    VNFO-level time slot t ~ , the VNFO determines the set of processing nodes Δ k
    u ( t ~ ) that participate in serving the k th service packet-flow Υ k u (t) of
    UAV u at t th TS. Each selected processing node p∈U∪M that belongs to Δ k u (
    t ~ ) performs a subset B k up ( t ~ ) of all functions F k that is supposed to
    be performed on the packet flow of service type k belongs to UAV u : B k up (
    t ~ )={ F k f  :  f ˙ k up ≤f≤ f ¨ k up }, B k up ( t ~ )⊆ F k , (1) View Source
    where f ˙ k up (S) and f ¨ k up (E) are the first and the last function (VNF)
    that p performs on the packet flow of service type k of UAV u . In summary, for
    each packet-flow Υ k u (t) , the VNFO selects and schedules the processing nodes
    that handle F k . These nodes can be each one of any other UAVs (intra-domain
    offloading) or local server (inter-domain offloading). Remark 1:Let P to−do p
    ( t ~ )={(u,k,f) : f∈ F k u is running on p} indicate a set of all assigned VNFs
    to the processing node p∈U∪M . We assume all assigned VNFs P to−do p ( t ~ ) to
    processing node p should be finished in a single round of VNF scheduling t ~ .
    Fig. 2 provides a comprehensive representation of crucial elements related to
    the proposed orchestration solution and the communication dynamics within the
    network. Operating at two distinct timing levels, the figure elucidates: 1) The
    VNFO timing (Tier 1), emphasizing interactions pivotal for establishing the proposed
    orchestration solution, and 2) the network-wide communication (Tier 2), encompassing
    all entities within the network. FIGURE 2. Network-wide timing model. Show All
    The upper segment of the figure illustrates how UAV 1 manages received packet
    flows from IoT nodes, accommodating two distinct service types. Following the
    assumed VNFO policy in a single round of VNF placement and scheduling, it is evident
    that for packets of service type 1, UAV1 processes them and subsequently forwards
    them to UAV3. UAV3, after performing the assigned VNFs, then forwards the packets
    to the local server, i.e., the final destination. Conversely, for packets of service
    type 2, UAV1 initiates some initial processing and then directly forwards them
    to the local server, where all remaining VNFs are executed. The lower section
    of the figure is dedicated to illustrating VNFO level operation, depicting control
    packets exchanged between the local server and agents for the training of the
    VNFO model. Further clarification on this VNFO communication is postponed to subsequent
    sections within the article. C. Communication (Access) Network There are three
    communication links among the network nodes: the wireless links between IoT nodes
    and an aerial network consisting of UAVs, the UAV-to-UAV wireless links, and the
    wireless link between the UAVs and the local terrestrial server. Let random process
    g nu (t)∈C denote the channel loss between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U , then the
    achievable bit rate of node n in up-link direction at time instant t will be R
    nu (t)= w n log 2 (1+ p nu | g nu (t)| σ 2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U , where w n and σ 2 denote
    the channel bandwidth of IoT device n and the noise variance, respectively, and
    p nu is the transmission power level. The channel between IoT nodes and UAVs and
    between UAVs and the local server can be modeled as an air-to-ground channel model
    [41]. According to this model, the path loss, g nu can be calculated as [37],
    g nu (t)= ( 4πf c ) 2 d 2 (t) η e , (2) View Source where f , c , and d are frequency
    of operation, speed of light, and distance between the transmitter and receiver,
    respectively; and η e is the average of excessive path loss in two cases of existing
    a LoS path, η LoS e , and non-LoS case, η nLoS e , η e = p LoS × η LoS e +(1−
    p LoS )× η nLoS e , (3) View Source where p LoS is the probability that a LoS
    path exists and can be closely approximated as [37], p LoS = 1 1+aexp−b(ψ−a) ,
    (4) View Source where, a and b are environment-related parameters. Similarly,
    in the downlink direction, the achievable bit rate of the link between UAV u∈U
    and MEC server M at time instant t will be R uM (t)= w uM log 2 (1+ p uM | g uM
    (t)| σ 2 ),∀u∈U , where w uM denotes the channel bandwidth, σ 2 is the noise variance,
    p uM is the transmission power level, and random process g uM (t)∈C denotes the
    channel Loss at time t . Finally, the UAV-to-UAV wireless channel also follows
    the same mathematical model, however, the only difference is that the probability
    of existing LoS is equal to 1, p LoS =1 . For each UAV u and service type k ,
    τ k u (t) is defined as the expectation value of IoT access network delay with
    respect to transmission rate R nu (t) , τ k u (t)= E R nu [ τ k nu (t)], τ k nu
    (t)= D nu /C+ Λ k nu / R nu (t), (5) View Source where, E R nu denotes the expectation
    with respect to R nu , D nu is distance between IoT node n∈N and UAV u∈U and Λ
    k nu is the packet length of service type S k ∈S . For the aerial radio links,
    Let random process g u u ´ (t)∈C denote the channel power gain between UAV u∈U
    and UAV (or local server M) u ´ ∈U∪M , then the achievable bit rate of the link
    at time instant t will be R u u ´ = w u u ´ log 2 (1+ p u u ´ | g u u ´ (t)| σ
    2 ),∀n∈N,u∈U∪M , where w u u ´ denote the channel bandwidth between UAV u , and
    UAV (or local server) u ´ , σ 2 is the noise variance, and p u u ´ is the transmission
    power level. In the following sections, we will focus on the VNFO’s functionality,
    and resource allocation of the radio access part is beyond the scope of this paper;
    hence, without loss of generality, we assume a fixed power and bandwidth allocated
    to all the participating nodes. SECTION IV. Problem Formulation Let χ fk pu (
    t ~ )∈{0,1} denote whether the processing node p at time slot t is selected to
    run VNF function f on the packet of the k th service type of UAV u : χ fk pu (
    t ~ )= { 1, 0, if p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ )andf∈ B k pu ( t ~ ) otherwise ∀k∈S,u∈U. (6)
    View Source For each service type k∈S of UAV u , only one of the processing nodes
    (UAVs or MEC-server) must be selected for serving each function f∈ F k : ∑ p∈U∪M
    χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k . (7) View Source
    The relation (7), both left and right expressions together, implies that the packets
    belonging to the service packet-flows travel a loop-free route. Each packet belongs
    to packet-flow Υ k u (t) needs a specific computational capacity c fk in CPU cycle.
    Assuming that all the processing capacity of processing node p in a single time
    slot with duration T ˜ is C p T ˜ , to be assured that the computing capacity
    of the selected processing node is enough to serve the assigned VNFs and the scheduler
    does not exceed the processing node’s budget, the following condition at each
    VNF-scheduling time slot t ~ should be satisfied: ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do
    p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T ˜ ,∀p∈U∪M. (8) View Source The same condition also
    needs to be fulfilled regarding the storage capacity requirement b fk (in Bytes):
    ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p ,∀p∈U∪M (9) View Source
    where B p is the total amount of available storage capacity of the processing
    node p . A. Age of Information In order to quantify the freshness of the received
    packet at the destination, the AoI metric is adopted. As soon as an IoT node has
    a packet to send, it connects to its serving UAV and sends packets.3 For each
    packet flow of service type k that UAV u∈U receives directly from the IoT nodes
    that are connected to it and running this service type, the arrival time t k u
    is defined as the time elapsed from the beginning of the time slot t in which
    any packet has arrived in. Let Θ k u (t) denote the AoI of the packet-flow of
    service type k in UAV u , it can be calculated as, Θ k u (t)={ τ k u +T− t k u
    , Θ k u (t−1)+T, if  α k u (t)=1 if  α k u (t)=0 ∀k∈S,u∈U (10) View Source where
    binary variable α k u (t)∈{0,1} indicates whether any new packet of service flow
    k at TS t is received, α k u (t)=1 , or not, α k u (t)=0 . By definition, for
    every time slot t in which the UAV does not receive a new packet from a service
    packet flow, the AoI of that service packet flow increases by T . On each received
    packet from IoT node n with service type k , the set F n k of VNFs (processing
    functions) should be performed. As stated above, the VNFO determines the set of
    processing nodes p∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) that participate in performing the VNFs on packet-flow
    Υ k u (t) by performing the set B k up ( t ~ ) of VNFs. B k up ( t ~ )=∅ means
    p hosts none of the required VNFs of Υ k u (t) . Let Δ k u ( t ~ )={ p 1 , p 2
    ,…, p L } denote the sequence of all UAVs that are already selected to sequentially
    do the chain of VNFs on the received packets of service type k . The processing
    time of every packet of this flow will be, Φ k u (t)= ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ( t ~ ) ⎛
    ⎝ ⎜ ⌈ τ fk p v−i p v (t) T ⌉T+ ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v ( t ~ ) (⌈ θ k ϑ T ⌉T ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ), ∀k∈S,u∈U
    τ fk p v−i p v (t)= D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i p v (t) F k
    f = f ¨ k u p v−i , (11) View Source where θ k ϑ is the run time of ϑ th VNF for
    service type k , Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) is the packet length of service type S
    k ∈S after doing the last VNF f ¨ k u p v−1 of the chain in p v−1 , and, Assuming
    that the queueing delay is negligible, τ fk p v−1 p v is total transmission delay
    between p v−1 and p v consists of propagation delay and transmission delay. If
    the binary variable β k u ( t ~ )∈{0,1} indicates whether the VNF scheduling (at
    VNF-scheduling time slots t ~ ) for the flow of packets belong to service type
    k of UAV u was successful, then, the AoI at the Local server will be, Π k u (t)={
    Θ k u (t)+ Φ k u (t), Π k u (t−1)+ T ˜ , if  β k u ( t ~ )=1 if β k u ( t ~ )=0
    ∀k∈S,u∈U. (12) View Source Note that T ˜ is the duration of a single round of
    VNF placement and scheduling. B. Energy Consumption The energy consumption of
    the network in the uplink direction can be calculated as, P UL (t)= ∑ n∈N ∑ k∈S
    ∑ u∈U s k n p nu Λ k nu / R nu (t), (13) View Source where Λ k nu / R nu (t) is
    the transmission time between IoT node n , with service type k , and UAV u at
    TS t . The other energy-consuming part of the access network is transmission among
    the processing nodes. If we represent the energy consumption in the aerial domain
    (including UAV-to-UAV and UAV-to-MEC links) at TS t with P Aerial (t) , then it
    will be as, P Aerial (t)= τ fk p v−i p v (t)= F k f = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k
    u p p v−i p v τ fk p v−i p v (t), D p v−i p v /C+ Λ p v−i p v ( F k f )/ R p v−i
    p v (t), f ¨ k u p v−i , (14) View Source where Λ p v−i p v ( F k f ) , f ¨ k
    u p v−1 and τ fk p v−1 p v are defined like (11). Finally, if Ψ k ϑ denotes the
    power each machine, that hosts the ϑ th VNF of service type k , consumes to run
    this VNF on each packet of this service type, then, the total network-wide required
    energy for performing the VNFs across a single packet of all service type can
    be calculated as follows: P NFV = ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ p v ∈ Δ k u ∑ ϑ∈ B k u p v Ψ k
    ϑ θ k ϑ . (15) View Source In a single term, P NFV represents the energy consumption
    resulting from VNFs processing. Using (13)–(15), the total energy consumption
    of the network to process a single packet across all the service types belonging
    to all UAVs would be, P Total (t)= P UL (t)+ P Aerial (t)+ P NFV . (16) View Source
    The UAVs use a battery, hence their available energy to do the processes and perform
    the required communications is limited. Therefore, we need an energy-efficient
    VNFO solution with minimum communication overhead. A centralized ML method will
    be optimal, but it requires a large communication transaction to share the local
    observation with the central controller. Another drawback of adopting centralized
    architecture is that the centralized coordinator is not scalable and from the
    processing and communication viewpoint is a single point of failure. Therefore,
    in this paper, we deal with proposing a solution for the following problem of
    distributed NFV orchestration through the UAVs as distributed VNFO agents. Problem
    1 (Distributed VNFO for Joint AoI and Energy Minimization):Considering the service
    requirements of IoT nodes, UAVs/MEC-server available resources, and the condition
    of access networks, what is the optimal strategy of VNF placement and scheduling
    in each UAV to jointly minimize the average AoI and total energy consumption at
    the Local Server: Minimize χ fk pu ( t ~ ) s.t. γ AoI [ 1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u
    (t)]+ γ E P total (t), ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t ~ )=1,∀f∈ F k , ∑ p∈U∪M χ fk pu ( t
    ~ )=0,∀f∄ F k , ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) c fk ≤ C p T,
    ∀p∈U∪M, ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S ∑ f∈ F k 1 P to−do p ( t ~ ) (u,k,f) b fk ≤ B p , ∀p∈U∪M.
    (17) View Source In each VNFO-level time slot T ˜ the orchestrator sequentially
    decides on the chain of VNFs of the service flows belonging to UAVs. For a class
    of stochastic sequential decision-making problems, the Markov Decision Process
    (MDP) has been a powerful framework for the mathematical formulation and study
    of this type of problems. Another point that is worth mentioning is that our proposed
    method in Section VI is FL-based where the UAVs follow the same model trained
    cooperatively. Therefore, minimizing the average AoI over UAVs or minimizing the
    maximum value of AoI over UAVs are basically the same. Depending on the environment
    state, the MDP output will be the best action (or at least the best upon the history
    of the observations and actions) which maximizes a specific utility function [42].
    For the case that the state is not fully observable to the deciding agent or the
    agent’s observations are exposed to noise or some source (sort) of uncertainties,
    another extended class of decision-making processes called Partially Observable
    MDP (POMDP) is adopted [43]. Both MDP and POMDP in their original scope are defined
    centralized [42], [43]. Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) is the extended
    version of POMDP in which a set of distributed agents are involved in the decision-making
    process [44], [45]. By definition, if every agent has the same individual reward
    function, the POSG model becomes the Decentralized POMDP (DEC-POMDP) [45]. In
    the following two sections, first, we show how the problem can be modeled as a
    DEC-POMDP and then we will present our proposed method to solve the developed
    DEC-POMDP. SECTION V. DEC-POMDP Formulation In a multi-agent MDP with state uncertainty,
    a DEC-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple with the following definition. Definition
    1 (DEC-POMDP Model):DEC-POMDP G with a set U of U agents is defined as a tuple
    G=⟨U,S, b 0 ,A,O,T,O,R⟩ , where S is the finite set of global environment states,
    b 0 is the probability of the environment initially being in state s∈S , A= ∏
    u∈U A u is the joint action of all agents, where A u is the set of actions available
    to agent u , O= ∏ u∈U O u is joint observation, where O u is the observations
    available to agent u , T is the transition function T :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×S→[0,1]
    , where T( s ´ |s,A(s)) is defined as the transition probability from state s
    to s ´ by doing joint action A(s) , O is the observation function O :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))×O→[0,1]
    , where O(O|s,A(s)) is defined as the joint observation at state s by doing joint
    action A(s) , R={ r u } U−1 u=0 is a set of reward functions r u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s×A(s))→R
    , where r u (s,A(s)) is defined as the reward received by u when A(s) is executed
    at the global state s . In a DEC-POMDP, each agent u∈U based on its local observation
    o u ∈ O u and a local policy π u performs an independent action a u ∈ A u . In
    each partially observable state s , the joint action A(s)= ∏ u∈U a u (s) from
    the joint policy P= ∏ u∈U π u determines the next global state s ´ and joint observations
    O according to transition and observation probability of T( s ´ |s,A(s)) and O(O|s,A(s))
    , respectively. According to Problem 1, our purpose is to find the best choice
    for the sets Δ k u (t) of processing nodes p and B k up (t) of the VNF chains
    for serving packet-flow Υ k u (t) of any service type k∈S of UAVs u∈U in a distributed
    manner. Remark 2 (Source of Uncertainties):We have considered a multi-hop network
    architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, in which, 1) each agent u is not aware of
    the other agents’ observation o −u  (−u refers to all the agents except u , o
    −u = ∏ u ´ ≠u o u ´ ) , nor the action a −u ,4 2) each agent observes the result
    of doing its own action and the actions of the other agents, while it is not aware
    of the global state nor the action of the other agents. Therefore, according to
    Definition 1, it can be inferred that Problem 1 in its decentralized form is a
    DEC-POMDP. FIGURE 3. System model as a DEC-POMDP. Show All In DEC-POMDP, each
    agent based on its actions and observations creates a local database that in time
    t can be represented as h u ( t ~ )={ a u ( t ~ −1), o u ( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1
    ,∀u∈U , where a u ( t ~ −1) and o u ( t ~ ) are the action of u at time slot t
    ~ −1 and its corresponding observation at t ~ . All the information is available
    to all the U agents at time t ~ defines as the joint history H( t ~ )= ∏ u∈U h
    u ( t ~ )={A( t ~ −1),O( t ~ ) } t ~ t ~ =1 . The POMDP state is hidden from the
    agents. Hence, the agents would not be able to choose their actions based on knowing
    the true state. The standard approach for dealing with POMDPs is to find a solution
    to the fully observable equivalent belief-MDP [43]. Where, belief B(s, t ~ )=P(s(
    t ~ )=s|H( t ~ ),B(0)),∀s∈S defines as a probability distribution over the state
    space of the original POMDP knowing the joint history H( t ~ ) , i.e., all the
    available information from the sequence of interactions that the agents have had
    until now,where B(0) is the initial value the belief state function. Belief state
    function B(s, t ~ ) is known as sufficient statistic for the history H( t ~ )
    [45]. Upon performing a new interaction at t ~ +1 , the belief value is updated
    from the belief point at time t considering the new interaction {A( t ~ −1),O(
    t ~ )} . Despite the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer
    the action (the policy) of the other agents. This leads to the definition of multi-agent
    belief function [46] with the following definition, b u  :  ⋃ s∈S (s× π −u (s))→[0,1],∀u∈U
    b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=P(s( t ~ )=s, π −u | h u ( t ~ ), b u (0)), π −u = ∏ u ´ ∈U,
    u ´ ≠u π u ´ . (18) View Source As it is evident, the multi-agent belief function
    is defined in a space that is a combination of the hidden global state s and joint
    policy π −u of the other agents. From Bellman expectation equation [47], the action-value
    function Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u ] is the expected return starting from
    state hidden state s , taking action a π u according to policy π u , while the
    other agents follow the joint policy π −u , Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~
    ]= E{ R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u Q π u, t ~ +1 [( s ´ , π −u ), a π u,
    t ~ +1 ]}. (19) View Source where the action-value function decomposed into immediate
    reward plus discounted action-value of the successor state, and γ u is the discount
    factor of agent u . With some mathematical manipulation, (19) can be written as,
    Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]= R u [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ] + γ u ∑ (
    o u , o −u )∈O O[ o u , o −u |s,( a π u , a −π −u )] ∑ s ´ ∈S T[ s ´ |s,( a −π
    −u )] × ∑ ( a π u , a −π −u )∈A π u ( a π u | s ´ ) Q π u,t [( s ´ , π −u ( o
    −u )), a ´ π u, t ~ +1 ( o u )]. (20) View Source Using (18), for a given belief
    state function b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) , the action-value function Q π u, t ~ ( b
    u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ ) will be, Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a π u, t ~ )= ∑ s∈S ∑ π
    −u b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) Q π u, t ~ [(s, π −u ), a π u, t ~ ]. (21) View Source
    For an enough large value of t ~  ( t ~ →∞) , the goal is to find the optimal
    policy π ∗ u among available policies π u which leads to the optimal Q-value (action-value)
    function, Q ∗ u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ , a u, t ~ )=arg max π Q π u, t ~ ( b u, t ~ ,
    a π u, t ~ ). (22) View Source There is no straightforward solution for the aforementioned
    DEC-POMDP problem. Among decentralized methods, multi-agent solutions also need
    a large volume of communication overhead between the agents to share their local
    observations to converge. FL does not have the communication overhead of the centralized
    techniques and also does not necessitate the agents to share all of the data and
    local observations to converge. Although this specification is for providing privacy,
    in our problem it provides us with the gain of energy efficiency that arises because
    the agents (UAVs) do not need to share all of their observations. A few efforts,
    [45], [48], [49], have been made in the literature to capture and exploit some
    structural specifications of the understudied system (application) to find or
    at least simplify the problem of finding optimal policy (22). One of these works
    is one presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], in which the authors have developed
    a class of POSGs that is characterized by symmetry across players in terms of
    cost and state dynamics. In view of this research, within the APPENDIX, we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP and prove that Problem 1belongs to this class and
    is Circularly Symmetric. This implies that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the
    same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . In essence, this necessitates a distributed solution
    to determine the best policy while ensuring uniformity across all agents. Furthermore,
    in accordance with the circular symmetry characteristic of the problem, in Corollary
    22 we prove that local observations serve as sufficient statistics for each agent
    to ascertain the best policy. Corollary 22 guarantees that the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) serves as a sufficient statistic to determine the optimal policy π
    ∗ for the agents (UAVs). This implies that the information encapsulated in the
    local observations of the individual agents is comprehensive enough to determine
    the optimal policy π ∗ . While this corollary does not suggest a particular method
    for identifying the optimal policy, it is promising and justifies our proposed
    FL-based algorithm in which the agents collaboratively engage in training a globally
    shared model. This approach aligns with the notion that leveraging decentralized
    insights from each agent’s local observations can contribute to the derivation
    of an effective and globally optimal policy because their observations are sufficient
    statistics. Capitalizing on the promising findings in this section, the subsequent
    section introduces our proposed approach to address Problem 1. SECTION VI. Symmetry-aided
    Asynchronous Federated DQN Framework In this section, we introduce our proposed
    Asynchronous Federated Deep Q-Network (AFDQN) algorithm and the components we
    have used in the proposed model as depicted in Fig. 4. In traditional RL, the
    problem is modeled as an MDP consisting of a tuple {s( t ~ ),a( t ~ ),r( t ~ ),s(
    t ~ +1)} . At each decision-making time t ~ , the agent is at state s( t ~ ) and
    takes an action a( t ~ ) based on a policy π that causes a state transition from
    s( t ~ ) to s( t ~ +1) while an immediate reward r( t ~ ) incurred. For our POMDP
    case in which the true state of the network is hidden, the true state s( t ~ )
    is replaced with belief-state b( t ~ ) . Mainly, the RL aims to guide the agent
    to find the best policy π ∗ defined as the best mapping from observation o( t
    ~ ) to action a( t ~ ) that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted future
    rewards R( t ~ )= E π { ∑ ∞ l=t γ (l− t ~ ) r(l)} , where γ∈[0,1] is a discount
    factor indicating how much future rewards is important. For our DEC-POMDP problem,
    this relation maps to (19). FIGURE 4. Block diagram of the proposed Asynchronous
    Federated-DQN (AFDQN). Show All A. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Part To estimate Q-value
    functions (21), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is deployed, where Q-values
    are predicted using deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators. The
    estimated Q -functions are represented by { Q u ( o u ( t ~ ), a u ( t ~ ); θ
    u ( t ~ )) } U−1 u=0 , where the parameter θ u ( t ~ ) represents the weights
    of the agent u ’s neural network (NN). The updated value of θ u ( t ~ ) is used
    to approximate the true values of Q u ( t ~ ) [21], [50]. Let’s define the loss
    function L( θ u ( t ~ )) as the expectation value of the mean squared error of

    and Experience Replay Buffer [52] are deployed, respectively. Utilizing these
    two techniques, the loss function L( θ u ( t ~ )) can be written as L( θ u ( t

    E D is taken over the randomly selected mini-batches of samples from the replay
    buffer D . B. Federated Learning Part As it is illustrated in Fig. 4, we have
    two main entities, the set U={0,1,…,U−1} of UAVs that are our distributed agents
    or in FL terminology, the agents, and the coordinator that in our model is local
    server (MEC-server). FL allows the UAVs (agents) to train a shared global model
    parameterized by θ g that is an exact copy of the agents’ local model { θ u }
    u=U−1 u=0 using their own dataset { D u } u=U−1 u=0 , while the original data
    remains in UAVs. After local training, agents share their local model updates
    with the coordinator. The coordinator then aggregates the received updates to
    build the global model θ g . As a result, relying on the distributed data training
    at the agents, the local server is able to enhance the training performance without
    significant communication overhead as it just needs an update of the local model
    parameters, not the agents’ local data. The federated learning procedure of our
    proposed method includes the following key steps. 1) Distributed Local Training
    Primarily, the local server initializes the global model, θ g,0 , and transmit
    it to the agents. Upon receiving θ g,0 , during VNFO time slots t ~ the agents
    interact with environment and train their local model { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0
    using their own data set { D u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 by minimizing a loss function
    { L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) } u=U−1 u=0 , θ ∗ u =arg min π u L u ( θ u (( t ~ ))),∀u∈U.
    (25) View Source Then, the agents upload their local update on { θ u ( t ~ ) }
    u=U−1 u=0 to the coordinator for aggregation. 2) Model Aggregation After collecting
    the agents’ local model updates, the next step is aggregating them into a new
    version of the global model which is performed by the coordinator by solving the
    following optimization problem. Problem 2 (Model Aggregation):Given the local
    model updates { θ u ( t ~ ) } u=U−1 u=0 of all agents, and knowing the local loss
    functions { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 , what is the optimal strategy for aggregating
    the local model that minimizes the global loss, θ ∗ g , L ∗ g =arg min L g , θ
    g L g ( ∏ u∈U L u ( θ g (( t ~ )))). (26) View Source According to Problem 2,
    θ ∗ g is the optimal value for θ g with having the local updates in hand; and
    L ∗ g is the best function (the best method) for aggregating the local loss function.
    The loss-aggregation function L ∗ g indicates the relative contribution of each
    agent on the global model, however, there is not a fixed method for determining
    this function and it depends mostly on the structure and specific features of
    the problem. Corollary 1:According to Lemma 2, The best setting for loss functions
    is (24) and { L u (⋅) } u=U−1 u=0 =L(⋅) , The optimal way for aggregating the
    local updates is averaging among the agent’s contributions, thus (25) can be rewritten
    as, θ ∗ g = ∑ u∈U ω u θ u , where ω u represents the relative contribution of
    each agent on the global model. After the derivation of a new update of θ g the
    coordinator broadcasts it to all agents. Upon receiving the update from the coordinator,
    the agents upgrade their local model accordingly. Until achieving a predefined
    level of accuracy or convergence of the global loss function, this process is
    continued. C. Asynchronous Networking The communication among the network entities
    follows the time slots t , but slot scheduling in which the agents share their
    own local model with the coordinator is distributed and asynchronous. Upon receiving
    an update, the coordinator aggregates it with the global model and updates the
    agents with the newly updated global model. In this way, we do not impose a strict
    constraint on synchronous communication with the local server (the coordinator).
    This significantly decreases the networking overhead in comparison with synchronous
    federation among distributed agents. During the training phase, we consider episodes
    in which the agent presets to a random initialization setting and starts interaction
    with the environment, and learns from its experience. Each episode contains T
    ˆ VNF scheduling round t ~ . In the deployment phase, the stream of packets that
    belong to different services is assigned based on an optimally determined VNF
    placement/scheduling policy. To avoid service interruption any fine-tuning and
    policy adaption to environmental changes, including the time the algorithm spends
    on fine-tuning and finding the optimal solution by coordinating multiple agents
    to train the global model, can be done in parallel. Definition 2 (Global Update
    Period):global update period 1≤η≤ T ˆ is defined as the period of updating the
    coordinator by the agents. We have two special settings, AFDQN-SGD ( η=1 ): In
    this case, every VNF scheduling slot t ~ , the agent sends the locally calculated
    SGD, ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator uses the
    received local data to perform one step of gradient descent: θ g ( t ~ +1)= θ
    g ( t ~ )− γ ˙ ∇ θ L u ( θ u ( t ~ )). (27) View Source AFDQN-Avg ( η= T ˆ ):
    In this case, only one time during each episode, the agent sends the whole parameter
    θ u ( t ~ ) to the coordinator. Then, the coordinator updates θ g ( t ~ ) accordingly,
    θ g ( t ~ +1)=(1− γ ¨ ) θ g ( t ~ )+ γ ¨ θ u ( t ~ ), (28) View Source where,
    γ ˙ and γ ¨ are AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg forgetting factors, respectively. Introducing
    the forgetting factors γ ˙ and γ ¨ allows for the adjustment of learning rates
    during model updates. Rather than updating the global model instantly upon receiving
    a local update, it is beneficial to employ a weighted average approach, considering
    both the most recent update and the previous value of the Agent’s NN weight θ
    g . This approach, known as Asynchronous Weight Averaging [53] in the literature,
    proves advantageous in alleviating the impact of outdated updates, commonly referred
    to as stale weights, and consequently, it enhances overall stability. The only
    point is that the forgetting factors should be chosen small enough. Another worth
    mentioning point is that the AFDQN-SGD and a centralized approach doing mini-batch
    SGD in the local server are essentially different as the former is asynchronous,
    distributed, and fully based on local data. The details of the proposed AFDQN
    algorithm are described in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: AFDQN- η Algorithm Show All
    Considering our optimization problem, for each agent u∈U at VNF scheduling round
    t ~ , we define the observation space O u , the action space A u , and the reward
    function R u as follows: Observation: We define the observation space as a vector
    of: 1) CPU and storage requested by the local service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } k as { c fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k and { b fk (t)|t= t ~ } f,k , respectively, 2)
    available CPU { C p } p and storage { B p } p of the processing nodes, 3) service
    arrival time { t k u } k , and 4) the transmission rate { R u p ´ } U∖ u ´ ∪M
    of the links between agent u and the other processing nodes. Therefore, the observation
    o u ( t ~ ) can be written as O u ( t ~ )= {{ c fk (t) } f,k ,{ b fk (t) } f,k
    , { C p } p ,{ B p } p ,{ t k u } k ,{ R u p ´ } U∖u⋃M } t= t ~ . (29) View Source
    Action: The action space is defined as all possible placement of the required
    VNFs for service flows { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ } k as A u ( t ~ )={ χ fk pu ( t ~ )},∀p∈U∪M,k∈S,f∈
    F k . (30) View Source Reward: Our objective is to orchestrate the VNFs in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and total energy consumption over the network.
    So we define the reward as a linear combination of three terms as follows: R u
    ( t ~ )= ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u ( t ~ )= Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )= ζ k u ( t ~ )= δ NFV ζ ¯ ¯ ¯ u
    ( t ~ )+ δ AoI Π ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ( t ~ )+ δ E P total ( t ~ ), 1 K ∑ k∈S ζ k u ( t ~ )
    1 UK ∑ u∈U ∑ k∈S Π k u ( t ~ ) { +1, −10, if (7)-(9)are satisfied otherwise. (31)
    View Source where δ NFV , δ AoI and δ E are the normalization factors for NFV
    scheduling result, AoI, and the energy consumption, respectively; ζ k u ( t ~
    ) is defined as the reward assigned to the result of NFV placement for service
    flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ . SECTION VII. Complexity Analysis In this section, we determine
    the computational complexity of the proposed Algorithm 1. We analyze the algorithm’s
    complexity through two distinct phases: Model Training and Action Selection, which
    occur during the deployment of the trained model. During each iteration of the
    global update period η , the process involves the training of local models by
    the agents (UAVs) and subsequently, the asynchronous aggregation of these local
    models by the MEC server to form the global model. The complexity of the local
    model training conducted by the agents can be expressed as the sum of two components:
    the complexity of action selection and the complexity of the back-propagation
    algorithm for each sample within the replay buffer. This sum is then further multiplied
    by the mini-batch size and η . It is worth noting that the multiplication by the
    mini-batch size accounts for the fact that, in each training iteration, the local
    agent randomly selects a mini-batch of samples from its own local replay buffer.
    The computational complexity of action selection in a fully connected neural network
    with a fixed number of hidden layers and neurons in each hidden layer is directly
    proportional to the sum of the input size and the output size of the neural network
    being used [54], [55]. The input size of the neural network is equivalent to the
    size of the state space, which from (29) is given by 2KF+2(U+1)+K+(U−1)+1 ; and,
    the output size of the neural network is equal to the size of the action space.
    which from (30) is given by KF(U+1) . It’s worth recalling that F= ∑ k∈S F k represents
    the overall count of distinct VNFs required to be executed across all service
    types. Hence, the computational complexity associated with action selection is
    represented by O(KFU) . Conversely, as indicated in equation [54], [55], for a
    specific sample extracted from the replay buffer, the computational complexity
    of the back-propagation process is directly proportional to the product of the
    neural network’s input and output sizes. Consequently, in our specific scenario,
    derived from the preceding computations, the overall algorithmic complexity for
    each agent can be expressed as O(ηO K 2 F 2 U) , where, O denotes the batch size.
    From Algorithm 1, each agent repeats the whole process of local model training
    η times preceding sharing the results with the local server. The last step is
    the aggregation process. While our algorithm conducts asynchronous aggregation,
    it’s important to note that the processing load escalates proportionally with
    the number of UAVs, U . As a result, the overall computational complexity for
    the training phase across the entire network is given by O(ηO F 2 K 2 U 2 ) .
    Based on the prior discussion, the complexity associated with the action selection
    for all U agents during the deployment phase is denoted as O(KF U 2 ) . SECTION
    VIII. Performance Evaluation In this section, the performance of the proposed
    algorithm is evaluated. The performance results are compared for four different
    methods of AFDQN-SGD, AFDQN-Avg, AFDQN with parameter η≠{1, T ˆ } , and a centralized
    case. In the centralized DQN method, all the observations are forwarded to the
    local server and the local server performs the VNF scheduling. Hence, its performance
    can be considered as an upper bound for the proposed AFDQN method. A. Simulation
    Setup The simulation is implemented by Python using OpenAI gym [56], a widely
    used tool for developing RL algorithms, and conducted in a computer with Intel
    Core i7–10700 CPU 2.90 GHz and 64 GB RAM. Using simulation, the impact of parameter
    η , the number of IoT nodes, and the effect of the received load by the agents
    are evaluated. To this purpose, while T ˆ =60 , five different values for the
    parameter of η consisting of 1 (corresponds to AFDQN-SGD), 10, 20, 30, and 60
    (corresponds to AFDQN-Avg) are considered. The other model parameters and simulation
    settings are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4. The proposed system model entirely
    matches none of the existing related works. However, the simulation parameters
    have been chosen to be in line with the typical values commonly used in similar
    studies within this context [6], [32], [33], [36], [37]. TABLE 3 Model Parameters
    and Simulation Settings Part I TABLE 4 Model Parameters and Simulation Settings
    Part II B. Simulation Results In Fig. 5, the convergence behavior of the AFDQN
    method is compared with the centralized method as a baseline. The two extreme
    cases of AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg are considered. As is evident from this figure,
    for the AFDQN method we have some variations around the value where it converged.
    The absolute value of these variations in AFDQN-Avg is more than AFDQ-SGD, and
    in AFDQN-SGD’s case, they are around the value achieved by the centralized method.
    Also, the AFDQN-Avg converged to a smaller value for total return, we expect this
    result will also be reflected in the performance of AFDQN-Avg against AFDQN-SGD.
    This will be investigated in the following experiments. In Fig. 6(a) and Fig.
    6(b), the minimum achievable average AoI and total energy consumption are investigated.
    The AoI value is averaged over all the agents and the total energy consumption
    is defined as the total energy consumption for sending a single packet of each
    service flow through the network from IoT nodes toward the local server. As can
    be seen, the maximum energy consumption of the three methods is limited to a maximum
    value corresponding to the maximum value of resources that the processing nodes
    can allocate to the requests. As a result, the negative side effect of the methods’
    drop in performance is mostly reflected in the value of the averaged AoI. For
    the AFDQN-Avg, this point is evidenced in Fig. 6(a), where we can see that at
    several points the values of the averaged AoI are more than 1 second. However,
    this is the worst-case choice for selecting the global update period η . Form
    Fig. 6(a), for the proposed AFDQN, we could achieve an average AoI of less than
    200 msec, which is acceptable for most real-time applications. Therefore, performance
    close to the centralized case can be achieved by the proposed method in a distributed
    manner, relying solely on the local observations of the UAVs and the sharing of
    trained local models, thus eliminating the need for exchanging the local observations,
    which can be time and energy-consuming. FIGURE 5. Episodic reward of agent 1 for
    the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All FIGURE 6. (a) Average episodic AoI. (b) Average episodic total energy consumption
    of the proposed method compared with centralized architecture. All agents follow
    the same policy, which is a copy of the cooperatively-trained global model. Show
    All In Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), the network energy efficiency versus service availability
    is drawn. The network-wide energy efficiency is defined as the total number of
    successfully-supported service flows divided by the total energy consumption throughout
    the network to send a single packet from each one of the services flows. Also,
    service availability is defined as the percentage of the service flows that are
    supported successfully. In Fig. 7(a), the average network energy efficiency and
    the sample values in our simulation, as well as the standard deviation of the
    value, for AFDQN- 20 (η=20) are shown. The averaged network efficiency with increasing
    the value of the service availability increases in a way that for the service
    availability of more than 80 percent, it converges to around 82 percent. This
    convergence for large value of service availability shows that we were eventually
    able to provide energy efficiency as one of our objective functions. In Fig. 7(b),
    where the proposed AFDQN method with different values of η∈{20,30,60} is compared
    with the centralized approach, it can be seen that the energy efficiency of the
    centralized approach degrades as the availability reaches 100%. This behavior
    is because the centralized method has a single NN for all UAVs. For the availability
    values near 100%, the centralized agent is not able to do the job as efficiently
    as the AFDQN method where each agent has its own NN. FIGURE 7. Network-wide energy
    efficiency vs. percentage of service availability. The shaded area represents
    the standard deviation (SD) from the average value: (a) For AFDQN with η=20 .
    Sample values are shown for more illustration. (b) For AFDQN with η=20 , η=30
    , AFDQN-Avg and centralized architecture. Show All As illustrated in Table 3,
    the load of services (in terms of requested CPU and storage resources) is modeled
    as a normalized uniform random variable. The standard deviation (SD) of the values
    for both CPU request values and storage is 1.3 percent. In Fig. 8, the impact
    of increasing this value, up to 6 times the primary value of 1.3, on the network’s
    performance is examined. The network is first trained with the primary input-load
    SD value of 1.3, and then, we incrementally raised the SD of the input load. This
    can be implicitly considered as a test under non-stationary load. It is evident
    that in this situation the AoI will increase, as illustrated in Fig. 8. To be
    more specific, we considered a threshold of one second for the acceptable AoI.
    Hence, we have also drawn a graph of AoI violation (in percentage) in conjunction
    with the bar chart of averaged AoI to better reflect the effect of the load SD.
    The results demonstrate that the AFDQN-Avg method has better performance in this
    situation, which appears to contradict our previous observations where we concluded
    that decreasing the global update period improves the performance. This observation
    can be explained using the non-stationary behavior of the input load. In this
    case, the AFDQN-Avg lets the agents learn the variations and input model better,
    in comparison with AFDQN-10, which was chosen as an example for a case between
    two extreme cases, AFDQN-SGD and AFDQN-Avg. FIGURE 8. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation
    percentage for AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg versus standard deviation (SD) of the load
    normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All The effect of increasing
    the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and Energy consumption is investigated
    in Fig. 9. For this experiment, two AFDQN-10 and AFDQN-Avg cases are considered.
    The results show that AFDQN-10 had better performance than AFDQ-Avg. Another important
    point that should be mentioned relates to the behavior of the network for a large
    number of IoT nodes, e.g., 120 or more. As the number of IoT nodes increases,
    the load of the agents increases directly, this means that there are more CPU
    and storage requests. Because the resources in the processing nodes are limited,
    there comes a point where an increase in the number of IoT nodes will lead to
    more request rejection responses. In this situation, the fresh packets will drop,
    and that causes an increase in the AoI value. However, the network energy consumption
    does not change because the volume of the active processes does not change and
    remains equal to the maximum capacity of the processing nodes. FIGURE 9. The effect
    of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and energy consumption.
    Show All For further exploration, Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 compare the performance
    of the proposed algorithm against two baseline algorithms: Multi-agent DQN (MDQN)
    [57] and the adapted version of heuristic Minimum-Delay algorithm [58]. In MDQN
    the agents operate independently based on locally trained models without coordination.
    The agents are equipped with an identical neural network featuring the same specifications
    as AFDQN. Conversely, the Minimum Delay algorithm selects actions at each VNF
    scheduling round t ´ to minimize end-to-end delay (not AoI) between IoT nodes
    and the local server. FIGURE 10. Averaged-AoI and AoI-violation percentage for
    AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay versus standard deviation (SD)
    of the load normalized by SD of the load in the training phase. Show All FIGURE
    11. The effect of increasing the number of IoT nodes per agent (UAV) on AoI and
    energy consumption for AFDQN-avg compared with MDQN and Minimum-Delay. Show All
    In Fig. 10, a comparison similar to Fig. 8 assesses the impact of increasing load
    standard deviation (SD) on network performance in terms of AoI and AoI violation.
    Generally, an increase in SD raises the average AoI and AoI violation percentage
    for all methods, as larger SD values force agents to find the best action across
    a larger state space. As it is evident, the proposed AFDQN method exhibits the
    smallest average AoI and AoI violation percentage compared to baseline methods.
    However, the Minimum Delay method performs the worst due to its localized short-term
    target. Finally in Fig. 11, the impact of increasing the number of IoT nodes per
    agent (UAV) on the proposed method’s performance in terms of AoI and energy consumption
    is explored and compared with MDQN and Minimum Delay algorithms. Results demonstrate
    the superior performance of the proposed AFDQN method compared to baselines. Additionally,
    as the number of IoT nodes reaches 120 and beyond, there is an increased demand
    for CPU and storage; limited resources in processing nodes eventually lead to
    increased rejection of requests, causing a rise in AoI. However, network energy
    consumption remains unchanged, as the volume of active processes remains equal
    to the maximum capacity of processing nodes. SECTION IX. Conclusion We considered
    the problem of dynamic orchestration of NFV-enabled SFCs in smart agriculture
    applications to jointly minimize the AoI and energy consumption throughout the
    network. Especially, the problem is formulated as a decentralized POMDP. Then,
    adopting the symmetric structure of the network, we analytically proved that the
    optimal policy among the agents is behaving similarly. Accordingly, a novel federated-based
    DQN method was proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The proposed method
    is distributed and energy efficient, as the local agents just need to share the
    parameters of their locally trained model with each other. Although the primary
    goal of this method is to provide privacy among the agents, in our problem, this
    significantly decreased the communication overhead, and additionally, the total
    energy consumption of the network. In terms of freshness of information, the AoI
    is minimized jointly, and the achieved value for the AoI, while the parameter
    setting is set to be close to real values, is appropriate for most real-time applications.
    Appendix In this section, we aim to simplify the problem of determining the optimal
    policy (22) by utilizing some structural specifications of the developed system
    and problem. Inspiring by the work presented by Yongacoglu et al. [48], we introduce
    a class of Symmetric DEC-POMDP based on the Definition and Lemma presented below.
    Definition 3 (Symmetric DEC-POMDP):A DEC-POMDP is called symmetric if the following
    conditions hold: A u = A u ´ and γ u = γ u ´ , ∀u, u ´ ∈U∀u∈U , ∀a∈A , and an
    arbitrary permutation function σ(.) : r u (s,σ(a))= r σ(u) (s,a) , and T(⋅|s,σ(a))=T(⋅|s,a)
    . Lemma 1:Let G be a symmetric DEC-POMDP, for any u, u ´ ∈U , if π u = π u ´ ,
    then, π u is ϵ -best-response to π −u if and only if π u ´ is ϵ -best-response
    to π − u ´ , where ϵ -best-response (for an arbitrary ϵ≥0) defines as a policy
    that achieves (reach) a reward (cost) within ϵ of the maximum (minimum) value.
    In our VNF scheduling problem, as it is depicted in Fig. 3, at each VNF scheduling
    round t ~ , each distributed agent u∈U , has K packet-flow { Υ k u (t)|t= t ~
    } K k=1 belong to different services each of which requires running F k different
    VNFs on their packets. The agents decide on how to place these VNFs into available
    processing nodes, i.e., other U−1 UAVs, the local server, or itself, in a way
    that jointly minimizes the average AoI and energy consumption according to (17).
    All the agents follow the same goal and the priorities among the agents are the
    same. Without loss of generality, we assume that the agents have chosen the same
    discount factor, { γ u } u∈U =γ . Thus, it can be found that the agents conceptually
    have the same model; an intuitive inference that can be figured out better using
    the following Index Mapping rule. Definition 4 (Index Mapping):For each function
    f∈ F k of packet-flow Υ k u (t)|t= t ~ , by definition we assume that the policy
    π u ( t ~ ) outputs I fk u ∈{0,1,…,U−1,M} is the i th candidate processing node,
    I i , as depicted in Fig. 12. The actual selected processing node among p∈{u∪{
    u ´ } u ´ ≠u ∪M} , will be, p u ( t ~ )={ [(u+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M
    if  I i = I M , ∀ I fk u = I i . (32) View Source Then, χ fk pu (|t= t ~ )=1 ,
    and X k u , B k pu will be updated accordingly. FIGURE 12. Index mapping mechanism.
    Show All Now, according to Definition 3and Definition 4, the following lemma can
    be driven. Lemma 2:Problem 1is a symmetric DEC-POMDP. Proof:According to Definition
    4, the agents have the same set of actions { A u } u∈U ={ I i } i∈U∪M , so the
    condition (i) of Definition 3 is met. Let define C ℓ as circular shift operand
    with arbitrary value of ℓ , C ℓ (⋅)=[⋅+ℓ]modU . Considering a circular shift of
    ℓ over joint action A , C ℓ (A) , we will have, a C ℓ (u) = a u , thus from (32),
    for each I fk C ℓ (u) = I fk u = I i the selected processing node p C ℓ (u) (t)
    will be, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )={ [( C ℓ (u)+i)modU] th UAV, M, if  I i ≠ I M if  I
    i = I M , ∀ I fk C ℓ (u) = I i . View Source Or, p C ℓ (u) ( t ~ )= C ℓ ( p u
    ( t ~ )). (33) View Source Equation (33) means Problem 1 is circularly symmetric.
    To be more specific, we do not have any special dependency on the identity of
    the agents and the state transitions depend only on the profile of joint actions
    performed by all agents. Accordingly, permuting the agents’ actions does not change
    the conditional transition probabilities, T(⋅|s, C ℓ (A))=T(⋅|s,A) , and this
    permutation will lead to a corresponding permutation of rewards, r C ℓ (u) (s,A)=
    r u (s, C ℓ (A)) . Hence, the second condition of Definition 3 is also satisfied
    and the proof is complete. According to Lemma 2, being circularly symmetric means
    that the best agents’ policy, π ∗ are the same, { π u } U−1 u=0 = π ∗ . For such
    a condition, Lemma 1implies that the problem of finding the best policy can be
    reduced to finding π ∗ u , the best response to ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ´ , while π u ´ =
    π u ,∀ u ´ ≠u . Although this result is promising, from an implementation viewpoint,
    proposing a distributed solution for finding the best policy while requiring the
    same policy for all the agents is challenging. Recalling (18), in addition to
    the current hidden state, in DEC-POMDP the agents need to infer the action (the
    policy) of the other agents. The subsequent Corollary establishes a connection
    between this inference and solely relying on the local observations of the agents,
    thereby rendering it feasible. Corollary 2:With the same initialization of the
    belief function, { b u (0) } U−1 u=0 =b(0) , for a circularly symmetric DEC-POMDP,
    the local observation h u ( t ~ ) is a sufficient statistic for determining the
    optimal policy π ∗ . Proof:Assume that using a mechanism, the agents peruse the
    same policy π u ( t ~ ) , while they are learning the optimal policy π ∗ . Then,
    the multi-agent belief state b u, t ~ (s, π −u ) would be, b u, t ~ (s, π −u )=
    = = b u, t ~ ⎛ ⎝ s, ∏ u ´ ≠u π u ⎞ ⎠ P(s( t ~ )=s| h u ( t ~ ), b u (0), π u )
    b π u u (s, t ~ ).∀u∈U (34) View Source So, for each agent u , the local observation
    h u ( t ~ ) and knowing its local policy π u is enough for determining the belief-state
    b π u u (s, t ~ ) . In a DEC-POMDP, the set { b π u u (s, t ~ ) } U−1 u=0 is sufficient
    statistic for the joint history H , and the proof is complete. Authors Figures

    IEEE Conference Location: CHENNAI, India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION In recent years,
    the convergence of technology and agriculture has given rise to innovative solutions
    aimed at optimizing farming practices. One such transformative technology is the
    Internet of Things (IoT), which holds immense potential in revolutionizing the
    agricultural landscape. A significant leap forward in addressing the challenges
    faced by traditional farming methods, offering real-time monitoring, automation,
    and data-driven decision-making for enhanced agricultural productivity [1]. Agriculture,
    being the backbone of many economies, faces numerous challenges, including climate
    change, resource management, and the need for increased efficiency. Traditional
    farming methods often involve manual monitoring, leading to inefficiencies, resource
    wastage, and suboptimal yields. The integration of IoT into agriculture presents
    an opportunity to overcome these challenges by providing a connected and intelligent
    framework for monitoring and managing agricultural activities [2]. While these
    systems have been effective to some extent, they are primarily manual-dependent
    and incur high implementation costs [3]. Moreover, these conventional systems
    contribute to water and electric resource wastages, often relying on solar panels
    to address power supply issues. The integration of the IoT in agriculture has
    ushered in a new era of efficiency and precision, particularly through the development
    of Smart Agriculture Monitoring and Summarization Systems. This transformative
    technology combines IoT devices, sensor units, and cloud-based analytics to provide
    real-time insights and automate crucial aspects of farming, promising enhanced
    productivity and sustainable practices. At its core, the IoT-assisted Smart Agriculture
    Monitoring and Summarization System is designed to address the inherent challenges
    faced by traditional farming methods. In many agricultural settings, manual monitoring
    and resource management have proven to be labor-intensive and prone to inefficiencies
    [4] [5]. The system leverages IoT technology to create a network of interconnected
    devices that collect, transmit, and analyze data from various sensors strategically
    placed in the agricultural environment. The operational flow of the system involves
    the IoT devices interfacing with the sensor unit to gather real-time data. This
    data is then transmitted to a cloud-based analytics platform for storage, analysis,
    and visualization. Cloud platforms such as AWS IoT or Microsoft Azure process
    the data, employing machine learning algorithms to derive actionable insights.
    The functionalities of this system are diverse and impactful. Real-time monitoring
    provides farmers with immediate access to critical information about soil conditions,
    temperature, humidity, and light exposure. Automation, a key feature, allows for
    the optimization of irrigation schedules based on soil moisture levels [6]. The
    illustration in Figure 1 depicts the implementation of intelligent IoT technology
    in agriculture.Farmers can easily interpret trends, patterns, and anomalies through
    user-friendly interfaces, empowering them to make informed decisions. Fig. 1 Smart
    IoT Agriculture Show All Traditional internet-enabled mediums have limitations
    in terms of connectivity range and cost-effectiveness [7]. In contrast, IoT provides
    a robust solution by enabling internet services for smart devices without significant
    interventions. In the context of agricultural monitoring, IoT offers several advantages,
    including manual intervention-free monitoring, automatic watering systems, and
    efficient water flow management. The system provides farmers with actionable insights
    derived from data analysis, facilitating data-driven decision-making for crop
    management [8]. The use of NodeMCU as a low-cost IoT platform and efficient sensors
    contributes to the cost-effectiveness of the system. The potential for increased
    crop yields and resource savings outweighs the initial investment. By optimizing
    resource usage and minimizing wastage, the system contributes to environmental
    sustainability in agriculture. Reduced water usage aligns with the goal of sustainable
    and responsible farming practices. Integrating the system with precision agriculture
    techniques, such as drones and satellite imagery, can provide a more comprehensive
    understanding of crop conditions [9]. This integration can further enhance the
    precision and efficiency of farming practices. As the system involves the collection
    and transmission of sensitive agricultural data, ensuring robust data security
    and privacy measures is imperative. Implementing encryption and secure communication
    protocols should be prioritized. Collaborating with agricultural researchers,
    policymakers, and technology developers can foster a holistic approach to smart
    agriculture. Engaging stakeholders ensures that the system aligns with the broader
    goals of sustainable agriculture and food security. IoT-enabled agricultural monitoring
    systems reduce the need for manual oversight. This not only saves time for farmers
    but also ensures a more accurate and real-time assessment of crop conditions.
    The integration of IoT allows for the development of automatic watering systems
    [10]. These systems can analyze soil moisture levels and weather conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules, preventing both water wastage and water deficiency.
    IoT devices can efficiently manage water flow in agricultural fields. By monitoring
    water usage and flow rates, farmers can make informed decisions to conserve water
    resources and enhance overall efficiency. SECTION II. RELATED STUDY One of the
    most significant applications of the IoT is smart agriculture. Smart farming minimizes
    lost water, fertilizer, and harvest by optimizing these three factors. Existing
    agricultural systems are inefficient because they need human labor-intensive manual
    sensing of parameters including temperature, moisture, and humidity. The irrigation
    process is automated with the use of several sensors, reducing the need for human
    intervention [11]. It is advised to utilise a sensor-based monitoring system for
    crop fields. Measurements of soil moisture, humidity, and temperature would have
    to be taken. Monitoring these factors allows for automated watering systems to
    be built. Providing more food for a growing global population while using fewer
    resources is a formidable challenge, but one that smart farming might help alleviate.
    Smart farming is not only necessary for feeding the world''s growing population
    in a sustainable manner, but it also provides several benefits to farmers and
    local communities everywhere. Using these methods, farmers may boost yields while
    also enhancing their management of the surrounding ecosystem. IoT-based smart
    agriculture improves farming in general by keeping an eye on the fields. Thanks
    to sensors and networks, IoT in farming helps farmers save time and cut down on
    wasteful water use, among other benefits. Power grid, temperature sensors connected
    to the web. The study of agriculture began with the principle that individual
    systems are all interrelated. Therefore, it was essential to think about agriculture,
    crops, and cattle. As people began to gradually digitalize farming with new information
    technologies, the concept of \"smart farming\" emerged as a result of the IoT.
    Institutes of higher learning and scientific research develop and market novel
    IoTbased agricultural goods and services. There are several groups, both public
    and commercial, that look into new farming technologies. Therefore, we need to
    encourage dialogue and collaboration among the many players in the farming business
    in order to develop smart agricultural standards and enhance the interoperability
    of systems and technologies. The obtained corpus undergoes preliminary processing
    in order to generate a lexical pool. The obtained corpus is subjected to text
    mining, latent semantic analysis, and network analysis in order to generate active
    research domains from the phrases. The word frequency-inverse document frequency
    score is used to extract the most important phrases. KNIME and VOSviewer were
    used for experimentation in [12]. Last but not least, K-means clustering is used
    to present ten active study fields that a prospective researcher might go into
    for greater depth. These tendencies might be the starting point for research into
    the many problems that plague intelligent farming. It highlights potential new
    avenues for investigation. Agriculture offers human beings with crucial resources
    such as fiber, food and energy; consequently, it has been one of the most significant
    industries in human history. Farmers'' losses are being cut and their output is
    being boosted thanks to new technological initiatives. The agricultural industry
    has the potential to develop by embracing new technology. In instance, IoT is
    a cutting-edge technology now employed by several market leaders. In [13] offers
    a tiny farm built on IoT systems with the goal of giving farmers access to cutting-edge
    technologies like NodeMCU, the IoT, and wireless sensor networks (WNS). Here,
    real-time data is detected by means of NodeMCU and linked sensors (DHT-11 as temperature
    sensor, soil moisture detector, and PIR sensor to detect water level in soil and
    intruder activity, respectively) and then saved on cloud for later use. The Blynk
    app is used for both data visualization and switching on and off of critical field
    equipment including motors, fans, lights and heaters. It aids in the prevention
    of blunders by encouraging foresight and forewarning. This setup is a low-cost
    and user-friendly example of precision agriculture. The climate has a significant
    impact on the number of workers, the quality of the crops, and the yields in Kuwait''s
    vast agricultural areas, especially in the desert. Since most of these fields
    aren''t exactly in the middle of town, keeping an eye on them might be a challenge.
    A smart irrigation system that utilises Zigbee wireless technology to keep track
    of and manage water distribution in a farm''s fields. Temperature, humidity, wetness,
    and gas concentration are only few of the factors taken into account. The IoT
    has had a profound impact on precision agriculture by allowing for continuous
    study of crop development and health. A deep dive into the potential of IoT-enabled
    smart crop monitoring devices for environmentally friendly, pinpoint farming.
    SECTION III. METHODOLOGY The proposed IoT Assisted Smart Agriculture Monitoring
    and Summarization System is a comprehensive solution integrating various sensors
    for precision farming. Soil moisture sensors monitor hydration levels, while temperature
    and humidity sensors track environmental conditions. Crop health is assessed through
    specialized sensors detecting nutrient levels and disease indicators. Figure 2
    illustrates the block diagram of the proposed methodology.Additionally, automated
    weather stations provide real-time meteorological data. These sensors collectively
    gather a vast array of information, transmitting it wirelessly to a central hub.
    Advanced algorithms then analyze and summarize this data, offering farmers actionable
    insights. This interconnected network of sensors empowers precision agriculture
    by enabling timely and informed decision-making, ultimately optimizing crop yields
    and resource management. Fig. 2 Block Diagram of Proposed Method Show All A. NodeMCU
    ESP8266 The NodeMCU ESP8266 in Figure 3, emerges as a powerful and cost-effective
    solution for implementing smart agriculture monitoring systems. This compact and
    versatile microcontroller, based on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, enables seamless
    connectivity and data transfer in agricultural environments. Equipped with analog
    and digital pins, the NodeMCU facilitates the integration of various sensors,
    including those measuring soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, transforming
    traditional farms into intelligent, data-driven operations. Its compatibility
    with IoT platforms allows farmers to remotely monitor and manage crucial parameters
    via a web interface. The NodeMCU''s real-time data collection capabilities empower
    farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation schedules, crop health, and
    resource optimization. By leveraging this technology, smart agriculture systems
    utilizing NodeMCU ESP8266 contribute to increased efficiency, sustainability,
    and productivity in farming practices, marking a significant stride towards precision
    agriculture and the IoT in the agricultural sector. Fig. 3 NodeMCU ESP8266 Show
    All B. Agricultural Drones Agricultural drones, in Figure 4 represent a transformative
    technology in smart agriculture monitoring, offering a bird''s-eye view of fields
    for comprehensive data collection and analysis. These unmanned aerial vehicles
    are equipped with advanced imaging technologies, such as multispectral and thermal
    cameras, enabling them to capture high-resolution images and gather valuable data
    on crop health, soil conditions, and irrigation efficiency. Agricultural drones
    can cover large areas efficiently, providing farmers with real-time insights into
    the spatial variability of their fields. This data can be used to create detailed
    maps for precision farming, identifying areas that may require specific attention,
    such as nutrient supplementation or pest control. By facilitating rapid and targeted
    interventions, agricultural drones enhance overall crop management, optimize resource
    utilization, and contribute to sustainable agriculture practices, making them
    a vital component in the arsenal of tools for modern and efficient farming. Fig.
    4 Agricultural Drones Show All C. Optical Sensor Optical sensors shown in Figure
    5 play a pivotal role in advancing smart agriculture monitoring by offering a
    sophisticated means of assessing crop health and growth. These sensors utilize
    light wavelengths to analyze various parameters, including chlorophyll content,
    leaf structure, and overall plant vitality. Deployed across fields, optical sensors
    capture detailed information about the physiological status of crops. By measuring
    the absorption and reflection of light, these sensors can identify stress factors,
    nutrient deficiencies, or the presence of pests and diseases. The collected data
    is then processed and transmitted to a central system, enabling farmers to make
    informed decisions about nutrient application, pest control measures, and overall
    crop management. Optical sensors contribute to precision agriculture by providing
    non-invasive, real-time insights into plant conditions, allowing for timely interventions
    that optimize yield, reduce resource inputs, and foster sustainable farming practices
    in alignment with the specific needs of each crop. Fig. 5 Optical Sensor Show
    All D. Soil Moisture Sensor The Soil Moisture Sensor depicts in Figure 6 is a
    crucial component in the realm of smart agriculture monitoring, designed to optimize
    crop cultivation by providing precise insights into soil hydration levels. Strategically
    embedded in the agricultural landscape, these sensors measure the moisture content
    of the soil at various depths. By continuously monitoring soil moisture, farmers
    gain valuable information about the water status in their fields. This data is
    then transmitted in real-time to a centralized system, allowing for prompt decision-making.
    Armed with these insights, farmers can implement targeted irrigation strategies,
    ensuring that crops receive the appropriate amount of water at the right time.
    This not only enhances water efficiency but also mitigates the risk of overwatering
    or underwatering, promoting sustainable agricultural practices. The Soil Moisture
    Sensor thus emerges as a key tool in precision farming, contributing to increased
    crop yields, resource optimization, and overall environmental sustainability in
    agriculture. Fig. 6 Soil Moisture Sensor Show All E. Temperature and Humidity
    Sensor Temperature and humidity sensors shown in Figure 7 provides real-time insights
    into environmental conditions crucial for optimal crop growth. Fig. 7 Temperature
    and Humidity Sensor Show All F. Motion Sensor Motion sensors (Figure 8) bring
    a valuable dimension to smart agriculture monitoring by providing insights into
    the movement patterns of wildlife or potential intruders in agricultural areas.
    These sensors, often based on technologies like passive infrared (PIR), ultrasonic,
    or microwave detection, can be strategically placed to detect motion within a
    specified range. In agricultural contexts, motion sensors contribute to security
    and pest management. They can alert farmers to the presence of pests or wildlife
    that may threaten crops, enabling timely interventions. Additionally, motion sensors
    can be integrated with cameras to capture images or videos for further analysis.
    This technology not only aids in protecting crops from external threats but also
    assists in understanding and managing the dynamics of the agricultural environment.
    By adding a layer of situational awareness, motion sensors enhance the overall
    effectiveness of smart agriculture systems, promoting sustainable and secure farming
    practices. Fig. 8 Motion Sensor Show All The IoT-assisted Smart Agriculture Monitoring
    and Summarization System operates seamlessly through the orchestrated collaboration
    of NodeMCU devices, agricultural drones, and a network of sensors. NodeMCU, strategically
    placed in the agricultural area, collects real-time data from sensors measuring
    soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and drone-captured optical information.
    This data is then transmitted to a cloud-based analytics platform, where machine
    learning algorithms analyze and process it. The system''s user-friendly dashboard
    presents summarized insights, including trends, anomalies, and actionable recommendations,
    empowering farmers to make informed decisions. Real-time alerts ensure timely
    responses to critical events, enhancing the overall efficiency and sustainability
    of agricultural practices. This intelligent system represents a convergence of
    cutting-edge technologies, providing a transformative approach to modern farming.
    SECTION IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS The implementation of an IoT Assisted Smart
    Agriculture Monitoring and Summarization System involves seamlessly integrates
    various components for efficient data collection, analysis, and decision-making.
    The initial step focuses on the deployment of IoT devices, specifically NodeMCU
    boards. These boards, based on the ESP8266 microcontroller, are strategically
    installed in the agricultural area and programmed to establish Wi-Fi connectivity.
    The configuration ensures that NodeMCU can effectively communicate with the selected
    cloud platform, forming the backbone of the IoT infrastructure. The collected
    data is then transmitted to a cloud-based analytics platform, such as AWS IoT
    or Microsoft Azure, where it undergoes processing and analysis. Machine learning
    algorithms are employed for predictive analysis and anomaly detection, enabling
    the system to identify patterns and correlations in the agricultural data. This
    advanced analytical layer forms the basis for informed decision-making and actionable
    insights. TABLE 1. OPTICAL SENSOR DATA Fig. 9 Optical Sensor Data Show All The
    provided dataset represents in Table 1 and Figure 9 sensor readings over a 10-day
    period, measuring variables denoted as R1 through R5 on dates from August 1, 2023,
    to August 10, 2023. Each row corresponds to a specific date, and each column represents
    a different sensor reading. For instance, on August 3, 2023, the sensors recorded
    readings of 1235, 1240, 1222, 1218, and 1230 for R1 through R5, respectively.
    These readings likely pertain to distinct environmental factors, such as light
    intensity, soil moisture, temperature, or other parameters being monitored. The
    dataset is essential for understanding variations and trends in these sensor readings
    over time, offering valuable insights into the dynamic conditions experienced
    during this specific timeframe. Analyzing this data can inform decision-making
    processes, especially in the context of agricultural or environmental monitoring
    where precise measurements are crucial for optimal outcomes. TABLE 2. SOIL MOISTURE

    Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems ((LNNS,volume 645)) Abstract With the improvement
    of Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, the smart agricultural system
    is driven by data produced by the different sensors and smart computing devices
    in the agricultural land. A new methodological paradigm high-performance edge
    computing is incorporated with blockchain implemented precision agriculture system
    to improve the data processing operation related with resource management. Edge
    computing nodes collect and analyze the sensor data locally without transforming
    to the remote centralized cloud server, which rises data processing speed and
    reduce the network latency. The blockchain technology is incorporated with machine
    learning algorithm to maintain secured and protected distributed database for
    storing smart farm details like pH, soil moisture, temperature, crop management,
    humidity, and water irrigation level. The proposed system improves the productivity
    of food items and performance of the smart agricultural system by providing useful
    information to the farmers to make time-based decision about the land and increase
    the profit. Keywords Blockchain technology Internet of Things Edge computing Smart

    paper PDF 1 Introduction Unlike conventional distributed datastore, blockchain
    technology provides advanced cryptographic techniques and emerging tools to store
    and access smart agricultural data that are shared with several untrusted users.
    Blockchain technology solves a number of data integrity issues caused by following
    untrusted operations: 1. single point failure in a supply chain centralized database,
    2. lack of data integrity due to the regular use of smart agricultural management,
    3. hackers can access and modify sensitive data, and 4. third-party assistance
    for providing security. The blockchain technology is applied on smart agriculture
    system to achieve ecosystem of agricultural services. Blockchain-based precision
    agricultural system provides secured environment for storing, exchanging, and
    retrieving confidential data between the several farmers and other persons. The
    integration of smart accuracy agriculture, edge computing, IoT, and blockchain
    technology allows the agricultural environment system to reduce the wastage of
    natural resources and increase the profit. With the new development of edge computing
    and blockchain technology, a precision agricultural system produces more profit
    by increasing crop and food productivity and reducing usage of natural resources.
    In the agricultural land, several sensors and devices are used to capture the
    environmental data and land-related data and these data are transferred to the
    data server in the cloud environment. Edge computing plays an important role to
    reduce the workload of cloud data server and minimize the volume of data moved
    to the data server. Instead of transferring data to the cloud data server, edge
    computing nodes perform the operation locally which is closer to the IoT devices
    in agricultural environment. The edge computing node provides necessary information
    to the farmers, agriculture officers, agents, researchers, and producers to earn
    more profit. The farmers can receive required information at the correct time
    to take better decision. The sensor data are collected, processed, and analyzed
    locally closer to the data center without transforming data to the remote centralized
    cloud server so that network transport latency is reduced. In Fig. 1, we have
    explained the precision farming system constructed on blockchain and edge IoT-based
    computing technology. IoT devices such as cameras, environmental sensors collect
    large amount of data from the farm and transmitted to cloud storage system for
    data analysis. The process of transferring data from IoT application area to the
    cloud service will take more time and reduce the speed of the system. The edge
    computing service is introduced between the IoT application system and cloud system
    to reduce the network traffic and latency in cloud environment. The edge computing
    server increases the speed of the data analysis process and provides solution
    to the farmer and the other users immediately without delay. The edge computing
    paradigm allows sensor data to be stored and analyzed close to the data source
    and application devices using 5G network connection, which reduce the cost and
    increase the crop yield. Fig. 1 A precision agriculture system using blockchain
    technology Full size image The proposed work is explained in this paper which
    is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the related work in a precision smart
    efficient agricultural system using blockchain technology and an edge computing.
    The IoT, edge computing, and blockchain functionalities of the various layers
    are discussed in Sect. 3. The process flow of the projected system is explained.
    In Sect. 5, we have explained the experimental environment and parameters, results,
    and analyses of various algorithm. In Sect. 6, we have explained the result of
    the proposed efficient precision agricultural system and future enhancements.
    2 Related Works In 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.6 billion.
    To provide the food products to the large population, agriculture department should
    integrate with new technology [2, 5, 13]. Precision agriculture is a sensor-controlled
    and software-managed environment for automatic collection of land environmental
    data, data analysis, monitoring, and tracking of operations with advanced technologies
    to meet the food products’ demands in future. Precision agriculture uses IoT and
    blockchain technology to avoid centralized management of data [17]. Traditional
    centralized smart agriculture system has lack of data security, data misinterpretation,
    and data redundancy [1, 3]. Blockchain-based smart agriculture system provides
    efficient services to the different stockholders like farmers, farm product wholesalers,
    supply chain agents, and financial sectors participated in every process from
    farm to our plate [4, 6, 7]. Blockchain is a chain of secured and verified block
    of information with timestamp. Blockchain and smart contract already proved information
    transparency and security-based record keeping [8, 9]. It provides trusted way
    of storing and processing of data in a distributed environment. Blockchain information
    are immutable which avoids alteration of data in the blockchain. Distributed consensus
    algorithm is implemented using tamperproof method to support users to validate
    every transaction in the blockchain network [10, 12]. It ensures no false information
    is added in the blockchain hashed data with the support of timestamp and cryptographic
    footprint data. IoT devices are responsible for monitoring and collecting land
    environment data with minimum power and low cost and lack of information security.
    This security and traceability problem can be solved by smart contract and blockchain
    mechanism [11, 14]. Figure 2 shows the different components of three-layered precision
    agricultural system. Edge computing is a distributed environment, which moves
    storage and computing power nearer to the IoT wireless sensor network to reduce
    the workload of the cloud server and the latency [15, 19]. Edge computing node
    provides immediate response to the farmers to take better and efficient decision
    to improve the crop yield and reduce the usage of resources. It reduces the cost
    and increases the network efficiency by providing better security [16, 18]. Analysis
    of sensor data performed in the edge computing node reduces the network latency
    and increases reliability, modularity, and scalability. Raspberry Pi acts as an
    edge computing node, which executes a machine learning algorithm to predict the
    required information about the crop yield and status of resources using gateways
    [18]. Fig. 2 Precision agricultural system Full size image 3 IoT, Edge Computing,
    and Blockchain Technology in Precision Agricultural System Smart contract controls
    do not allow the third-party intermediate users to fix the price for food products
    in the market. The blockchain technology controls the usage and modification of
    data in the edge server and cloud server node using contracts and consensus algorithm.
    Food supply fully depends on the agricultural process, which is composed of pre-harvesting
    and post-harvesting. Pre-harvesting includes finding best quality seed, cultivation
    process, market demand, finding soil quality, and need of fertilizer. Post-harvesting
    represents distribution of food products in the market to the producer, supplier,
    and consumer. Food supply management involves direct and indirect users to accomplish
    the transfer of food products to consumer or producer through different agents.
    Blockchain allows different levels of users to access the centralized secured
    data and execute different operations on hashed data. 3.1 Proposed Blockchain-Based
    Agricultural Model The proposed system allows the users to trace the food product
    data from land to consumer and ensures the security and adoptability. In Fig.
    3, we have explained the different use cases of blockchain in precision agriculture
    system. The blockchain technology helps to create trustworthy environment between
    the producer and consumers in food supply chain management. Every transaction
    is stored as block in chain with time stamp, which cannot be modified in future.
    Sensors collects crop data and environment data from the agricultural and stored
    in edge computing node for data pre-processing. Some portion of the data is processed
    in the IOT side edge process node to provide information to the different users
    and farmers and other users immediately without any time delay. Machine learning
    algorithm is executed in the edge layer processing node to predict the crop yield
    and demand in the market. Fig. 3 Use cases of blockchain in precision agriculture
    Full size image 3.2 Functionality of Layered Architecture Blockchain-based precision
    agricultural system consists of different kind of components at each layer to
    perform agricultural land sensor data analysis, which are collected from agricultural
    land. In Fig. 4, we have explained different components and layers of the proposed
    system. The different functionalities of various layers are explained below: Data
    collection layer: It is responsible for collecting land- and crop-related data
    from different sensors and drones deployed in the agricultural area. The collected
    data is transferred to the highest level edge computing server node using wireless
    sensor network gateway. Edge computing layer: The edge computing layer comprises
    storage server and processing node, which is responsible for processing the data
    nearer to the data source to reduce the latency and network traffic. It provides
    required information to the user with minimum response time. Bigdata analytics
    layer: Data mining association rule algorithm is executed on the large volume
    of data to generate the pattern to be stored in the knowledge repository with
    contract-based blockchain technology. It can be used by the farmer and other stakeholders
    hashed in the blockchain. Blockchain service layer: Transaction details and data
    from each layer are stored in the blockchain in a distributed environment to support
    the property traceability for all users and security. Application layer: The user
    can access information or knowledge pattern from the knowledge repository using
    laptop, computer, or mobile phones at any time and everywhere. The farmer, retailer,
    agri-officer, supplier, and retailer can access information using mobile devices
    connected via Internet. Fig. 4 Layered architecture using blockchain technology
    Full size image 4 Performance Analysis The proposed blockchain system maintains
    transaction transparency using decentralized ledger when compared with traditional
    approach. The performance of the proposed secured blockchain system is measured
    in terms of speed, average latency, average throughput, resource utilization,
    and user performance. The experiment is performed on 250 transactions in two different
    blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. Ethereum is a distributed
    computing platform with smart contracts, open source, and public. Hyperledger
    Fabric is an open-source permissioned private blockchain technology with distributed
    ledger. Figure 5 shows the comparison of average throughput for Ethereum and Hyperledger
    with varying number of transactions. The experiment was conducted with two platforms
    on five different sizes of datasets. For all datasets, Hyperledger has more throughput
    than Ethereum. The next performance matrix latency is evaluated with different
    number of transactions for Ethereum and Hyperledger. In Fig. 6, we observed that
    the throughput increases when the number of transaction increases. The Ethereum
    has more latency than Hyperledger. Fig. 5 Comparison of throughput Full size image
    Fig. 6 Comparison of latency Full size image 5 Conclusion and Future Work With
    the development of edge computing efficient technologies and blockchain algorithm
    rapidly transfer traditional smart agricultural systems to advanced precision
    agricultural systems. The effective food supply chain system is developed with
    use of consensus algorithm in two different blockchain platforms. In this paper,
    we proposed secured advanced smart precision agricultural system deployed in the
    field of research and food supply, which provides transparency and security to
    the information stored in the knowledge repository. The farm management process
    is optimized with the use of machine learning algorithm and security contacts
    by improvising the food plant and crop yield and minimizing the convention of
    natural resources. The proposed system delivers the needed information or knowledge
    to the farmers at the correct time and correct place. The novelty of the proposed
    advanced system is to maximize the profit for the farmers and minimize the investment
    cost based on blockchain-based food supply system. In future, the proposed method
    can be extended for designing food chain management system in order to increase
    the profit for farmers and crop demand and disease analysis. References Antonucci

  description: The significant problem in the area of sustainable development is the
    effective management of water resources. There are a number of approaches for
    resolving this issue in the literature, particularly in the agricultural sector,
    which serves as the primary consumer through irrigation. As a result, irrigation
    management is a crucial and cutting-edge discipline that has been the focus of
    several research and study projects to address the various activities, behaviors,
    and conflicts between the various users. This paper introduces an intelligent
    irrigation system based on smart sensors that can be used sparingly and affordably
    to monitor farms. By incorporating some connected electronic devices and other
    useful tools frequently used in the field of IoT, it calculates the water requirement
    of each farm based on the water loss caused by the process of evapotranspiration.
    Data gathered from a number of sensors placed across the plantation farm are used
    to determine the amount of water needed. It may be utilized by farmer organizations
    whose endowments and irrigation planning are determined according to the requirement
    and quantity of water available in the rural municipality. This project focuses
    on smart irrigation based on IoT. Each node in the system functions as an IoT
    device and incorporates a microprocessor with the integration of sensors, actuators,
    and valve modules. An irrigation management system simplifies the operation of
    each node and configuration settings for irrigation allow for the direct monitoring
    of environmental factors. The Penman model is used to get the daily evapotranspiration
    baseline and is used to calculate the quantity of water needed for irrigation.
    The suggested irrigation approach is anticipated to help reduce water usage and
    distribute it fairly without affecting crop productivity compared to the traditional
    irrigation system.

    IEEE Conference Location: Dijon, France SECTION I. Introduction Morocco has a
    wide variety of irrigation methods. The State is now developing a new plan for
    managing its water resources. Additionally, a variety of projects are being carried
    out to enhance irrigation management as a whole. According to the same principle
    of association of agricultural water users, they strive to manage irrigation networks
    and are supposed to be participatory. Currently, we see that motorized well-based
    gravity-fed irrigation systems have a number of drawbacks and significantly wastewater.
    It is required because the management of these irrigation systems is primarily
    defined by improved water management and planning amongst the many participants.
    However, there are a number of restrictions on this management, including the
    water allocation allowed, the kind of crop for each plot, the date of each crop’s
    planting, meteorological information, the best irrigation planning, etc. Gravity-fed
    irrigation, which is most frequently employed in Morocco, has a number of drawbacks
    since it ignores factors like the kind of crop and soil, the climate, and the
    real water requirements. Therefore, for a better distribution of water resources
    in this form of irrigation system, it is required to include all the parties involved
    and initiate talks between them on the scheduling of sowing, crop rotation, the
    amount of water needed by the crop, and the distribution of water. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) provides the opportunity to enhance agricultural machinery maintenance,
    irrigation of farms, analysis, and remote control, among other things. The field-installed
    linked sensors enable irrigation optimization through thorough element analysis
    of the plant. We propose to model irrigation network management systems in an
    intelligent context approach coupled with IoT to address this issue of water resource
    allocation in rural communities. This model will serve as the foundation for the
    creation of a tool to aid in the negotiation of allocations and the planning of
    intelligent irrigation, which aims to increase profitability and better manage
    the distribution of water resources before the start of each agricultural season.
    Based on the anticipated soil moisture assessed at the time of precipitation,
    the system creates a real-time irrigation decision. Based on the analysis of the
    data collected by the soil moisture sensor and the anticipated rate of evaporation,
    soil moisture prediction is carried out. Five parameters are used to forecast
    evaporation (air temperature, wind speed and direction, and humidity). Additionally,
    according to [1], an IoT-based Smart Greenhouse system is created with a revolutionary
    monitoring combination, encompassing warning, automation, disease forecasting,
    and cloud repository, by utilizing a deployable whole package. To increase crop
    output and provide a prompt response in the case of anomalous conditions, it continuously
    maintains dynamic factors including temperature, humidity, and soil moisture state.
    The complexity of managing in real time the water distribution activities that
    occur asynchronously and dynamically, as well as being reactive and adaptive to
    the dynamic and unpredictable events that characterize the domain, is the key
    factor that led us to choose a smart solution. In this work, we suggest the creation
    of a practical prototype based on calculations of the water requirements of various
    agricultural crops, an Arduino UNO microcontroller, a soil moisture sensor, a
    temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, a relay module, and a motor. The whole
    system keeps track of all of its parts, distributes endowments after consulting
    with farmers, keeps track of irrigation schedules, and supports endowments. The
    remainder of the article is structured as follows: The related works on intelligent
    irrigation systems are analyzed and discussed in the second part. The irrigation
    problem and the multi-agent system concept are described in general detail in
    the third section. The recommended strategy is described in the fourth section.
    The comprehensive test and simulation findings are presented in the fifth section.
    Section six presents concluding remarks, alluding to lessons learned and future
    work. SECTION II. Related Works Utilizing the least amount of resources, such
    as water, fertilizer, and seeds, smart farming increases yields. Sensors are a
    simple tool that farmers may use to monitor their crops remotely, save resources,
    and lessen the effects of climate change on crops [2]. Several value parameter
    detection technologies, such as location, electrochemical, mechanical, airflow
    sensors, agricultural weather stations, humidity, and PH, are used in this agriculture
    to provide data and aid farmers in monitoring and optimizing their crops [3] as
    well as to adapt to environmental change factors. Soil moisture is one of the
    primary sensors used in smart farming. It is employed to calculate the volumetric
    water content (humidity) of the soil at the moment. With the upper and lower thresholds
    set at the appropriate levels, the threshold value is established, and the amount
    of soil moisture is measured and validated. Irrigation is a crucial component
    of agricultural operations. Three traditional irrigation techniques canal irrigation,
    sprinkler irrigation, and drip irrigation are employed to meet the demands of
    plants. In regards to the intelligent irrigation system, the researchers in [4]
    have demonstrated that water use is reduced when an automated irrigation system
    uses soil moisture as an implementation parameter. Among these irrigation methods,
    drip irrigation allows farmers to conserve the most water since water is distributed
    directly to the soil surface and plant roots in the form of droplets. To increase
    agricultural productivity and optimize resource usage, intelligence farming has
    been put into practice, and many of them were combined with Artificial Intelligence
    and Internet of Things technology. According to certain studies, sensors and cellphones
    may be used to remotely monitor the state of the soil and enable intelligent irrigation
    [5]. To handle various aspects, such as irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatment,
    and other things, a more complex system combines IoT and artificial intelligence
    techniques, such as machine learning [6], Fuzzy logic [7], deep Q-learning [8],
    artificial neural network [9]. The need for a homogenous data interpretation necessitates
    new and difficult approaches for data treatment since IoT works with a big data
    collection obtained from diverse sensors and represented in different formats.
    Integrating AI technologies that enable automated data collection and processing
    from diverse sensor types is important to overcome these difficulties [18]. Numerous
    writers [10] have used AI to create data processing in agriculture by learning
    from the data gathered by a variety of data sensors and responding continuously,
    automatically, and appropriately depending on the data acquired. An agent-based
    system is suggested in [11] to automate the data management process and provide
    an optimized irrigation system. The data gathered from various sensors are used
    by the irrigation management system to create a knowledge base that is used in
    the decision process to develop an irrigation strategy that satisfies environmental
    needs while conserving resources and enhancing agricultural productivity. In order
    to create a smart irrigation system, T. Wanyama and B. Far [12] use Multi-Agent
    and Fuzzy Logic methodologies; this work employs Fuzzy logic to deal with the
    uncertainty inherent in the data that influences the watering schedule. Agents
    represent various frames to determine how much water is required in the farm in
    another study that employs the irrigation management system negotiation mechanism
    [13]. To guarantee effective water distribution, the frame with extra water distributes
    it to those who have other farmers that need water. The hydrologic cycle studies
    are most interested in the estimation of evapotranspiration, although there are
    still some uncertainties. As a result, estimates and projections of the ET form
    a crucial part of irrigation management globally. Numerous investigations are
    conducted in this arena to enhance ET estimation. In particular, the study in
    [14] used Bowen ratio and eddy covariance methods to calibrate, extract, and calculate
    relevant parameters required for estimating ET of tea canopy for the entire growing
    season, in order to make further predictions about the adoption of this method
    for planning irrigation for other crops. Another comparative research compared
    the performance of three ET estimation techniques, including the eddy covariance
    (EC), Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB), and soil water balance (SWB), during
    the corn growing season in [15]. In addition, the FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO PM)
    approach has been acknowledged as the accepted technique for estimating ETo over
    the years. According to [16], the findings of this approach, consider a number
    of meteorological factors related to evapotranspiration activity, such as net
    radiation (Rn), air temperature (T), vapor pressure deficit (Δe), and wind speed
    (U), are highly excellent. SECTION III. Model for Irrigation Management A. IoT
    and Irrigation System The sensors and linked items positioned in physical infrastructures
    are the foundation of the Internet of Things. On IoT systems, these sensors will
    broadcast data across a wireless network. To make the most of these data, analysis
    and enrichment will come later. These new IoT solutions for data management and
    data visualization enable regions, businesses, or even individual users to analyze
    data and make conclusions in order to adopt habits and behaviors. By combining
    several linked electronic devices and other useful tools that are commonly used
    in the field of IoT, this work provides an autonomous watering system based on
    smart sensors that can be utilized in a reasonable and economical way to monitor
    the mint or any kind of plant. Our system as shown in Figure 1 incorporates a
    temperature sensor, a water flow sensor attached to the valve of the water pumping
    motor and a soil moisture sensor positioned in the plant’s root zone. An Arduino
    UNO microcontroller, relay module, DC pumping motor, and power battery are all
    combined with these sensors. To put it another way, the operation of this automated
    system is summed up in the detection of soil moisture and temperature levels and
    the automatic ON/OFF switching of the pumping motor in response to the soil moisture
    status at predetermined intervals. B. Materials And Methods The system gains from
    the communication that has been rapidly expanding in recent years on the Internet
    of Things. This system is made up of a wireless sensor network that gathers data
    from various environmental variables, and an actuation unit that uses a water
    planning strategy based on the typical water needs of the crop in question. This
    system aims to control an irrigation and water storage mechanism, and an ARDUINO
    UNO Microcontroller smart gateway to link the sensing unit and actuation unit
    to the irrigation management system. The sensors installed in farm fields continuously
    measure the soil temperature and humidity values, as well as the amount of rainfall
    and the level of the water tank. These values are then sent through the network
    to our agent, which uses an intelligent algorithm to analyze the data collected
    and derive insights that support decision-making. The sensor nodes are physically
    put in the farms, and the model includes the ARDUINO UNO Microcontroller that
    runs in synchrony with them. The sensors are placed in the crop so that they may
    function as the terminals of a point-to-point network. The ATMEGA 328P-based Arduino
    UNO microcontroller board comes with 32kB of flash memory for storing programs.
    On its panel, there are 14 digital pins for input and output, six analog pins
    for input, a reset button, USB, a (16 MHz) quartz crystal, and an ICSP circuit.
    Programming the Arduino UNO board typically involves using the Arduino software.
    The following sensor resources make up the proposed smart farm monitoring system:
    The soil moisture sensor is used to gauge the farm’s soil moisture content and
    has a working range of 0 to 1023 ADC values. It is made up of two conductive probes
    that can detect the amount of soil moisture in relation to the variation in resistance
    between the two conductive plates. The temperature sensor (DS18B20), is a digital
    temperature sensor used to measure the temperature of the mint soil. It has a
    working range of (-55 to 125 °C), an accuracy of (+5 percent), and is integrated
    with a resistor of (4.7K) with an accuracy of (+-5 percent). The Sea YF-S201 water
    flow sensor measures water flow rate and determines how much water is carried
    via the pipe. It is attached to the pipe of the submersible water pump, has a
    working flow rate between 1 and 30 L/min, and has a water pressure lower than
    1.95. The relay module is a switch that is electrically activated and used to
    control a circuit using a specific low-power signal. They can even integrate calibrated
    operating elements to safeguard electrical circuits from overload, and several
    operating coils may occasionally be employed. Power supply battery used to make
    the system independent and feed the circuit with electrical electricity instead
    of serial communication, we have experimented with connecting the Arduino board
    to the HW battery (9V) using the (9V/5V) Battery Adapter. SECTION IV. Proposed
    Approach Currently, the difficulties of designing a sustainable water resource
    system are causing many problems for agriculture. To assist farmers in overcoming
    their everyday challenges, a smart irrigation management system has been suggested.
    As stated earlier, the goal of our work is to model an intelligent irrigation
    management system that represents various actors and defines the negotiation interactions
    between them, and this is done prior to the start of each agricultural campaign
    to resolve the problem of water allocation for irrigation. These discussions are
    based on climate limits, agricultural constraints, and other factors. As seen
    in Figure 2, there will be four stages to this suggested approach’s implementation.
    The initial stage of gathering the information required for making decisions throughout
    the negotiating process. The gathering of needs and the functional definition
    are the topics of the second stage of analysis. The organization of the system
    into subsystems based on macro functions, the structuring of each subsystem, and
    the defining of interactions between subsystems are all topics covered in the
    third phase of modeling. A last phase of the subsystem installation and development.
    A. Modeling the smart irrigation management system In our approach, we consider
    each farm is seen as an independent node under the control of a collection of
    sensors. Fig. 1. Irrigation management system Show All Fig. 2. Process model Show
    All An intelligent agent uses different subsystems with tasks to complete and
    controls all nodes as well as actuation units. Fig. 3. System components Show
    All a) Data collection: The installation of a wireless sensor network is the first
    step in the development of an intelligent irrigation system for agricultural automation.
    Each node is connected to the network by a Wi-Fi module and deposits data on a
    central server, which is then able to query the data and send commands for the
    necessary operation. Figure 1 shows the general network structure of several sensor
    nodes; however, the actual network topology is determined by the local demography.
    Data must initially be gathered using a variety of sensors that are attached to
    the farms. The irrigation management system will serve as the gateway node in
    charge of coordinating communication with every other sensor node. The basic idea
    of receiver and transmitter is the foundation for connecting numerous sensors
    to the microcontroller. The recommended system’s initial phase is finished after
    building the network architecture and gathering data. Data processing starts with
    the collection of data using various sensors as a requirement. b) Analysis: All
    of the data that the sensors have gathered must be examined and processed in order
    for the actuators to get the subsequent signal and for the end user to receive
    warnings when manual intervention is necessary. From the data, it receives from
    the nodes and the web, the irrigation management system will examine a number
    of criteria. To automate the systems, irrigation would be dependent on soil type
    and a particular crop. As a result, after analyzing all the parameters, the water
    pump will be started by a control signal sent from the gateway node to the actuators.
    At a predetermined time interval, soil moisture will be continuously and iteratively
    surveyed, and watering will stop once the humidity reaches a particular threshold.
    c) Design system: In this phase, we’ll set up the irrigation management system
    infrastructure to record the dispersed nature of the system, as well as potential
    interactions and connections between its many parts. For this, we used the intelligent
    irrigation system’s categorization of various duties. Through this categorization,
    all the activities that are closely related to one another within a subsystem
    and all the tasks that are unrelated to one another within various subsystems
    might be grouped together. Thus, in the second sub-system, all tasks pertaining
    to the planning of the agricultural campaign, the yearly water allocation negotiation
    in the first sub-system, the tasks pertaining to the execution of irrigation,
    and the distribution of water resources are all discussed. Consequently, the following
    three subsystems will make up the intelligent irrigation system (see Figure 3):
    Supervision and planning: responsible for managing agreements, managing irrigation,
    programming the water tower, and organizing the opening and closing of irrigation
    valves, in addition to overseeing the whole system. In order to reduce the time
    spent on the trip, this subsystem, which supports a group of farmers, must improve
    the watering procedure. Variations in flow and water level at the subsidiary canals.
    Supervisor, Scheduling, and Water needs will be the components that will model
    this subsystem. Execution: accountable for ensuring that the scheduling water
    tower program is implemented and that the agricultural campaign runs well. These
    components will represent this subsystem: Source, Tank, Pump, and Farm. User system:
    composed of all the farmers who make up the Water User Association (WUA), which
    is in charge of overseeing the irrigation projects’ development and negotiating
    the water supply. A WUA component will model this subsystem. B. Supervision and
    planning subsystem The irrigation management system defines specific components
    in correspondence with the types of tasks in the precision subsystem. An agent
    achieves a specific role, through cooperation and interaction with other components
    in the same subsystem and the other subsystems. The agent is dedicated to achieving
    different roles: Supervisor: All irrigation procedures will be managed and supervised
    by the irrigation supervisor. The supervisor represents a development center for
    the irrigation of the plots; it receives crop needs from the Hydraulic Basin Agency
    (ABH) and establishes allocations based on the availability of an annual water
    allocation. The annual water allocation will be discussed with the WUA officers
    in order to reach an agreement for its distribution. Therefore, the following
    functions will fall under the responsibility of the supervisor: Know how much
    water has been allocated and which farmers are allowed to irrigate their plots.
    – Schedule water allocation for each farm Water tower program. Start irrigation.
    Manage problems that arise during the planning of the irrigation system. Create
    reports for each farm. Scheduling: The scheduling component is in charge of planning
    the tour by sending the supervisor a time diagram that is ideal for filling the
    network’s channels. Water requirement: Using environmental factors and a technique
    for predicting water demand, determine the amount of water that each farm needs.
    The water needs of a crop’s zone must be satisfied in order to assure possible
    crop yields. These requirements are often determined by a crop’s evapotranspiration,
    which is represented as ETc. Evapotranspiration combines transpiration from leaves
    with evaporation from the soil surface or moist surfaces of plants. Precipitation,
    groundwater, or irrigation are all potential sources of water for human use. Therefore,
    irrigation is required when crop water requirements (ETc) are higher than available
    water supplies and rainfall. The timing and amount of irrigation are crucial since
    ETc depends on crop stage and weather variations. ETc=ETr×Kc×Ks (1) View Source
    Where Kc is the crop coefficient that varies on the stage of growth (0 to 1),
    ETr is the reference crop’s evapotranspiration rate, Ks is the water stress coefficient,
    and (0 to 1). The Kc of each crop is essentially calculated at each stage of the
    growing season as the ratio of its ETc to the reference crop’s ETr [17]. While
    Kc denotes the features of the crop and its impact on plant requirements, ETr
    (reference evapotranspiration) represents the impact of meteorological circumstances
    on the net water requirements of crops. ETr is determined using climatological
    factors. Water (type of crop, development, phonological stage, etc.). Third, the
    actual quantity of irrigation is determined by the quality of the irrigation water,
    the homogeneity coefficient of the irrigation system, the size of the field, etc.
    This number provides a general notion of the amount of water required to satisfy
    the crop’s water requirements. To determine the irrigation volume for the stage
    of harvest, this number is balanced against the water content of the soil. C.
    Execution system a) Farm component: Each farm has a representation node, whose
    primary responsibility is to keep an eye on the implementation of the irrigation
    schedule that transmits through the component of the supervisor. It has the following
    responsibilities: \"distribute the amounts Q1,Q2,..., and Qn accordingly on the
    crops C1,C2,..., and Cn. It is also responsible for the watering of the crops
    in the zone for which he is accountable. b) Source component: The Source component,
    who is a representative of the rural commune, is in charge of activating the flow
    control valves that are situated at the level of the tank and are under his authority
    in order to distribute the flow requested by the fam component. Additionally,
    this component is responsible to check the tank level information obtained from
    the sensors to ensure that it is at a convenient level. c) Tank component: For
    tank control, this component is in charge. d) Pump component: This component keeps
    track of the initial requirement that the tank is full before water circulation
    begins. D. User system a) WUA component: Before the agricultural campaign, the
    WUA component negotiates the yearly water allotment with the component supervisor
    on behalf of a Water User Association that consists of a representative and the
    farmers who belong to it. This component is responsible for keeping an eye on
    irrigation progress and reporting any issues in the irrigation canals to the component
    of the farm or the supervisor. The user interface is played by this component.
    It serves as a human-machine interface and concentrates on informing users about
    the irrigation status. E. Priority irrigation planning In order to manage the
    irrigation, we have designed a subsystem at the level of our central system that
    allows serving a parcel by water, this subsystem is based on the algorithm of
    management of the execution of the processes according to their priorities that
    has been inspired by the algorithm [21]. In fact, after collecting the irrigation
    parameters whose weighting coefficient is calculated that will be the priority
    needed to decide which parcel will be affected by irrigation, the priorities are
    updated in real-time to reorganize the parts in the queue. The following Table
    I was considered as weighting. TABLE I Parameter weighting Given a set of crops
    each is characterized by a need for water, an irrigation frequency, a minimum
    water threshold, a maximum threshold, and a priority characterized by an earlier
    date and a later date late. The total amount of water available is fixed. Let
    Ci be a culture, with i ∈ 1,..,n QT the total amount of water Qi the amount of
    water to be carried out to Ci, with i ∈ 1,..,n fi irrigation frequency, i ∈ 1,..,n
    Pi priority of culture Ci, i ∈ 1,..,n The objective function is: maxF ( ∑ i=1
    N f i Q i ) i (2) View Source Where N ∑ i=1 f i Q i ≤ Q T (3) View Source and
    min Q i ≤ Q i ≤max Q i (4) View Source The problem is a Linear Programming problem,
    to do this, we propose the use of the Simplex algorithm [19]. To take priority
    into account, we propose task scheduling with the PERT method [20]. SECTION V.
    Experimental Results and Performance Analysis A. Case study Three farmer groups
    and the local office of the Haouz Regional Agricultural Development Office jointly
    administer the study area, particularly in terms of irrigation. They choose the
    number of water towers and the amounts allotted for irrigating cereal crops at
    the beginning of the season. This amount is determined by the yearly allotment
    agreed upon and negotiated with the Hydraulic Basin Agency, the primary irrigation
    water source. Regardless of the type of crop and its water requirements, farmers
    receive a certain amount of water at each turn, based on the size of their farms,
    even if certain parts remain unexploited or during biological comfort. B. Workflow
    of The System The water pump is initially turned off, but if the measured readings
    exceed the program’s thresholds (soil moisture > soil saturation = 360 or temperature
    > 30C), it activates and irrigates the farm’s soil. Every time the pump is switched
    on, the flow sensor starts monitoring the irrigation flow again, the horologe
    goes to sleep for a certain amount of time, and then the measurements are taken
    again until the soil moisture exceeds the soil saturation. By limiting water loss
    that may be associated with a lengthy irrigation period prior to resuming the
    sensing and the threshold verification, this time control enables an optimal irrigation
    duration that maximizes the quantity of water to the farm as shown in Figure 4.
    The Arduino UNO microcontroller checks for the threshold situation and changes
    the current date. The relay attached to the Arduino UNO will switch ON the motor
    to irrigate the field if the water content level is less than the soil saturation
    level (360) of the farm, meaning that the soil becomes dry or the temperature
    exceeds (30°C). To repeat step 3, the delay is set to five seconds. Otherwise,
    the motor will be switched OFF and the delay will be set to (1 hour) before step
    4 is repeated if the threshold condition isn’t met. C. Results and Analysis The
    temperature didn’t reach the threshold of 30°C, as shown in Figure 6, so when
    the soil moisture exceeded the saturation (360), as shown in Figure 5, the pump
    was turned on. After 5 seconds of irrigation, the water flow reached (144 L/Hour),
    and the water flow measure was sensed again (144L/Hour) after a sleep time equal
    to (5 seconds). The measurements are taken again after each sleep period of 5
    seconds, up until the soil saturation threshold (362 > saturation), at which point
    the pump is turned off and the measurements are taken once more after a sleep
    period of 5 seconds (1 hour). The variations in temperature are shown in Figure
    6. Fig. 4. Workflow of The System Show All Fig. 5. Water flow fluctuations and
    soil moisture variations over time Show All Fig. 6. Varying temperatures over
    time Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In this study, we suggest an internet-of-things-based
    smart collective irrigation system. The suggested system was developed using a
    specialized technique for designing intelligent irrigation systems that calculate
    each farm’s water needs based on water loss from evapotranspiration. Data gathered
    from a number of sensors placed across the plantation farm are used to determine
    the amount of water needed. The goal of this project is to provide efficient,
    IoT-based smart irrigation that farmer organizations may utilize. The project’s
    endowments and irrigation planning are based on the quantity and quality of water
    that is required in the rural municipality. With equity in determining requirements
    and providing endowments in proportion to those needs, the planned system can
    work well for irrigation reasons. It relieves farmers of the tiresome process
    of irrigation, optimizes large amounts of water, and keeps rural communities from
    controlling the distribution and allocation of water. The solution gives the farmer
    an appropriate working tool and enables remote field monitoring. With this approach,
    excessive watering may be prevented, which can harm crops. The technique can lessen
    the issues with conventional agriculture and communal irrigation. Our technique
    is quite flexible and may be used to many situations and communal irrigation problems.
    More functional and technological requirements are necessary, nonetheless, in
    order to use the solution in specific circumstances. It will be necessary to design
    independent modules that can be incorporated into the management systems. Additionally,
    we have created prototype applications; nevertheless, the actual implementation
    of such systems necessitates the involvement of several professionals in the area
    as well as the use of numerous pieces of equipment and significant material resources.
    The suggested system will eventually be evaluated and implemented in a suitable
    simulation platform. The efficacy and performance of the suggested system may
    be learned through the experimental results and performance analysis. Authors

  description: Smart farms are attracting attention as a solution to rural problems
    facing sustainability crises, such as slowing income, export, and growth rates
    due to the aging of the agricultural and livestock industries. In addition, if
    the concentration of atmospheric constituent gases changes due to global climate
    change, the amount of sunlight required for global warming and photosynthesis
    is not maintained, so a sufficient growth environment is not created, and quality
    degradation due to growth inhibition is expected, promoting aging and inappropriateness.
    In this study, considering these issues, an edge computing platform structure
    that can be quickly applied to smart farms was implemented. A smart farm consists
    of IoT systems. A smart farm consists of IoT systems. Basically, IoT systems have
    limited communication bandwidth and small code space. Typical IoT systems utilize
    MQTT, a low-overhead protocol, and edge computing concepts that place edge nodes
    near improve performance issues caused by limited communication bandwidth. Despite
    this adoption of MQTT and edge computing, challenges still exist. The problem
    with MQTT is that data order is not guaranteed. To solve this problem, the Kafka
    protocol generated to process continuously occurring sensor data was integrated
    with MQTT and applied to the Edge Computing platform to solve the problem based
    on the improved performance of the existing solution. So, we configure the edge
    node for each farm to be able to manage it. Sensor modules for smart farms are
    manufactured and the edge is configured to manage the data of each sensor module
    using the MQTT protocol. A distributed coordination system is implemented using
    Kafka for data interworking between each edge node.

  description: Smart farming or development in agriculture Cyber-Physical Systems
    has led to the development of various IOT based innovative platforms to aid automated
    systems for precision agriculture. There are smart devices (IoT devices, smart
    vehicles, UAVs, ROVs, and drones) and sensors (magnetic, electrochemical, and
    mechanical sensors)constantly connected at the edge and procure data that is uploaded
    to cloud-based interfaces for further processing. The sensors can be maneuvered
    using an insecure, intelligent farming system to create choreographed cybersecurity
    attacks on a particular farm. End-to-end system is achieved by putting together
    smart devices, communication media, uploading data to the cloud, intermediate
    nodes, and processing this data at a central unit like the cloud or intermediate
    processing at other nodes. Cyber-physical systems are a combination of many technologies,
    resulting in a large number of security threats. This chapter is to delineate
    the attack vectors and categories of threats that can be performed on these innovative
    IOT based agricultural products; if not appropriately secured, can lead to more
    strategized and sophisticated security attacks that can hinder production for
    a region under effect and thus bringing down the economy and food stocks of Nations
    who implemented smart agriculture.

    in agriculture Cyber-Physical Systems has led to the development of various IOT
    based innovative platforms to aid automated systems for precision agriculture.
    There are smart devices (IoT devices, smart vehicles, UAVs, ROVs, and drones)
    and sensors (magnetic, electrochemical, and mechanical sensors)constantly connected
    at the edge and procure data that is uploaded to cloud-based interfaces for further
    processing. The sensors can be maneuvered using an insecure, intelligent farming
    system to create choreographed cybersecurity attacks on a particular farm. End-to-end
    system is achieved by putting together smart devices, communication media, uploading
    data to the cloud, intermediate nodes, and processing this data at a central unit
    like the cloud or intermediate processing at other nodes. Cyber-physical systems
    are a combination of many technologies, resulting in a large number of security
    threats. This chapter is to delineate the attack vectors and categories of threats
    that can be performed on these innovative IOT based agricultural products; if
    not appropriately secured, can lead to more strategized and sophisticated security
    attacks that can hinder production for a region under effect and thus bringing
    down the economy and food stocks of Nations who implemented smart agriculture.

    intelligence 1. INTRODUCTION Agriculture practices have seen exponential growth
    as smart technologies have been implemented in the past decades. The evidence
    of technology being involved in various steps and tiers of food production has
    shown reliability on these innovative systems for adding additional ease in production.
    Various modules and tiers are conjugated together to implement the functionality.
    This chapter highlights the attack vectors and threat mechanisms that can be devised
    to spike or introduce subtle or negligible changes to disrupt the systems and
    ultimately affect the infrastructure at par. The ideology is to segregate and
    review various threat vectors that can be exploited on IOT based smart agriculture
    systems, such as exploitations of any vulnerabilities or flaws to compromise the
    system integration. In a basic IoT system, multiple parties gather, process, and
    store information; these functionalities are either handled by asingle handler
    or can be moduled and bought from third-party vendors [ 1]. A resultant can be
    easily explored for loopholes to disrupt the services or cause damage to the system
    and its dependencies Figure 1. Figure 1: Architechure model of CPS Display full
    size The majority of the IoT systems in farming are generally related to monitoring
    values such as soil humidity, soil Ph, temperature, luminosity. The sequence of
    events is generally monitored at the ground level and data passing through various
    nodes for final analysis to perpetuate results. These results are then used to
    make decisions that allow the handlers/users to take necessary actions such as
    whether to irrigate, fertilize the fields or not, and whether to regulate temperature
    or not [ 2]. This data is also stored for further check of future possibilities
    in crop yield, giving an overview of what conditions on a ground-level suited
    better to gain more yield in an area compared to lab-controlled environments.
    Undoubtedly, these devices have provided much-needed benefits and real-time monitoring
    ease for current agricultural practices, shaping for more gains in the future
    Figure 2. Figure 2: Layers in IoT based smart agriculture system [ 3] Display
    full size Figure 3 enlists the various layers present in any IoT-based system
    used in agricultural systems. The physical layer is mainly made up of devices
    such as sensors recording values at their end. Generally, these are raw values
    and often need processing for further usage. The physical layer ensures these
    sensors are connected on the ground and working in a calibrated manner for optimal
    system performance [ 4]. The values such as soil humidity, temperatures, ph values,
    etc., general observations from sensors are recorded at specific time intervals.
    The physical layer is further connected to the network layer, as the raw data
    cannot be processed by sensor nodes and has to be propagated to the next tier,
    which is the middle layer; this is often done via technologies of wireless band
    depending upon the location and feasibility to run the network layer without much
    data loss. Often rural farms might not have proper network connectivity and rely
    on slower networks [ 1, 3]. The middle layer is mainly introduced to ease the
    processing burden so that any pre-processing can be done beforehand. The Application
    layer is majorly for final presentation to user or administrator, decision making,
    result analysis [ 1, 5]. This chapter will explore the attack vectors/vulnerabilities
    or threat landscape of smart agriculture systems. Section 1, as the introduction,
    relates to the architecture used on IoT smart systems;the idea is to elaborate
    on how the tier-wise architecture can be explored on various levels of threats.
    Section 2 enunciates past work done towards ensuring security, mainly during the
    use of IoT; researchers have worked on wireless sensor networks as they are the
    backbone of IoT-built systems and provide for the communication channel between
    layers. Section 3 presents a detailed threat landscape that highlights the variety
    of vulnerabilities and attacks with case studies. Finally, section 4 refers to
    mitigation and practices involved. Figure 3: Estimated IoT adoption in Agricultural
    sector in terms of percentage globally Display full size 2. LITERATURE REVIEW
    The changing reliability ofIoT smart agriculture systems has brought in the majority
    of challenges on the forefront as the economy for the country would often depend
    on the agricultural produce and yield. Since a major part relies on technology,
    it becomes a more lucrative opportunity to attack these interfaces. Therefore,
    the IoT technology which has been deployed for aiding might be jeopardized. These
    systems are often made to sustain the ground scenarios and be cost-efficient;
    this leaves concern for the security of such devices [ 6]. Mainly, the usage of
    wireless sensor networks(WSNs) and securing their communication has been worked
    upon in recent years; apart from WSN; data protection has been another worked
    upon feature. Since the WSNs limit their processing power, it is important to
    secure the channels to ensure proper management, [ 7] have presented a schema
    against impersonation and insider attack by applying two-factor authentication
    methods. However, it lacked any high-level encryption schemes which can easily
    be cracked using cryptanalysis. Another authentication scheme was presented by
    [ 8] to combat the authentication and encryption problem by using remote authentication
    processes. Eventhough these schemes were used, but the threat of impersonation
    could still lead to spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Ref. [ 9] has proposed
    a session key management to secure the authenticated channel and secure it against
    password attacks. Ref. [ 10] proposed a novel remote authentication scheme using
    BAN logic and session key management, automated validation of internet security
    protocols and applications is used to provide this functionality. In [ 11], the
    authors have worked upon secure user authentication alongside WSN for secure monitoring
    of agricultural systems. The system firstly verifies the registered user with
    a smartcard mechanism; this smartcard is authenticated via a card reader to ensure
    the legit person is accessing the system alongside giving a password set by the
    user. Ref. [ 12] have researched possible usage of blockchain to aid the possibility
    to draw smart contracts and store data for processing and post-processing to smart
    ledgers to ensure enhanced security. As more and more data is being processed
    at edge and cloud nodes, it has become easier to use this for the ledger and application
    layer between two parties. Ref. [ 13] have proposed a system to use blockchain
    as the main data collection point from various sensor nodes, smart contracts are
    drawn between management nodes to capture data from sensors and analyze it. Another
    efficient approach of creating clusters has been explored by [ 14, 15] through
    Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy(LEACH), in the second phase of execution,
    the data is separated into multiple blocks uploaded as ledgers on the blockchain,
    hence securing the data them. Subsequent nodes will propagate data using Voronoi
    architecture; the methodology has also reduced the update of cluster data only
    when a new node is added and not advertising time and again. Ref. [ 16] have implemented
    a secure remote telemetry-based subsystem that can easily upload data via a secured
    channel through SSH/TLS, the storage system has been secured through a firewall,
    and IKE authentication through VPN has been used to propagate data from node to
    node. Furthermore, isolation has been established in the system using containerization-based
    SAAS and PAAS offerings on cloud interface Figure 4. Figure 4: Elements of Cyber-Physical
    System Display full size 3. THREAT LANDSCAPE Considering the threats that pertain
    to IoT systems, the threats can be categorized through four layers as specified
    in Figure 5 above, the vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems are more as they are
    mainly remotely located and comprise various components [ 17–19]. Therefore, it
    is important to protect against such threats; Figure 5 shows a brief scenario
    of what attacks can be more prominent at which layers. Figure 5: Threat Landscape
    for IOT-based smart agriculture devices [ 2, 16, 20] Display full size 3.1. Physical
    Layer/ Perception Layer Attacks The physical layer is generally exposed to attacks
    that can be done directly on the sensors, whereas there could be eminent manipulations
    on parts of sensors and actuators; this can easily change the crop''s analysis
    and lead to dire consequences [ 21–23]. The sensors are mainly designed to fabricate
    a single task and are not used to processing any overhead tasks; it is challenging
    to keep sensors in safe places. 3.1.1. Node Tampering/Jamming Equipment such as
    actuators, sensors are generally embedded in nature, having a single task to perform.
    Therefore, these nodes cannot have more security forefront. Attacks like node
    tampering, jamming are more prevalent. In such an attack, the data generated at
    the hardware is modified, which can set off an absolute difference in the data,
    further sent to higher layers for processing. Refs. [ 24–26] has discussed the
    usage of strong malicious nodes within the network to launch a tamper attack against
    existing nodes in the network. Such an attack can be detected by observing a significant
    drop in packets at the sink node [ 27–29]. 3.1.2. Interferences/Insider Attacks
    The perception layer in IoT is more susceptible to insider attacks wherein eavesdropping;
    interferences can be introduced by injecting an external agent in disguise. Ref.
    [ 30] have published the severity of insider attacks, wherein it was observed
    that these attacks could often lead to drastic consequences if left unchecked
    in critical IoT systems. 3.1.3. Node Injection/Code-Based Manipulation Injection-based
    attacks are often performed to spike or manipulate the values at lower layers
    that can go undetected and cause larger magnified differences, Ref. [ 31] defines
    this as a kind of salami attack that can easily magnify in the long run. For instance,
    spiking the values of fertilizers by a very insignificant amount, but in the long
    run, the value will show a larger increase and can compromise the yield quality
    or lead to crop destruction. 3.1.4. Physical Damage Physical damage to equipment
    can be natural as a result of calamity or otherwise. It can lead to null values
    at receiving end or missed values, which can cause an imbalance in the real-time
    processing of data. Ref. [ 32] described how a drone can be controlled to take
    over and remotely cause failure to other nodes in its vicinity through an insecure
    UDP channel. 3.2. Network Layer Attacks This layer is more prevalent in common
    wireless sensor attacks as the underlying hardware is low processing. It makes
    it easier to perform eavesdropping, sniffing, spoofing potentially; causing damage
    to data being sent or disruption of services to underlying nodes leading to missing
    data [ 33]. 3.2.1. Traffic Analysis/Wireless Sensor Node Sniffing MostIoT devices
    work on low power and have low processing capabilities, generally limited to single
    functionality; this remains a challenge to secure the intermediate layer. [demo]
    has introduced a 6LoWPAN based intrusion detection system that can detect and
    alert over IoT node-based 6LoWPAN; the tests show higher accuracy in detecting
    common sniffing-based attacks. Ref. [ 34] shows a simulation of sniffers onto
    node deployments that use graph theory to find convenient nodes to sniff in close
    locations. 3.2.2. Spoofing/Cloning Spoofing is an active category of threat that
    can cause disruptions in the system, inject codes through interfaces to manipulate
    upper layers. Spoofing in wireless sensor network nodes can sometimes be achieved
    by creating a clone of legit nodes and entering the network as an imposter. Ref.
    [ 35] shows how machine learning can enhance learning-based detection, authentication,
    access control system that can easily formulate alerts. They have used SVM, Q-learning,
    K-NN, Naive Bayes to detect and classify between various degrees of threats. Spoofing
    can cause potential data leaks,leading to data compromise for users attached to
    the system. Ref. [ 36] have explored spoofing against actuators, leading to integrity
    violation and DoS attacks after generating control-based spoof attacks in the
    network. The method of protecting actuators has been proposed using TEE[Trusted
    execution environment] that monitors all commands coming from actuators via simplex
    communications and generates alerts or ignores according to conditions for the
    trigger [ 37]. 3.2.3. Unauthorized Access To provide for crops through smart IOT
    based agriculture deployments, it is highly important to properly monitor conditions
    in real-time. It needs constant checks either by an automated system or user at
    their end; any unauthorized access to this system might lead to a drastic outcome.
    Chances of replay attacks [ 38], stolen credentials. might lead to any unauthorized
    person gaining virtue on the system. Ref. [ 24] have suggested using an unspent
    transaction outputs model for carrying out a single set of instructions, whereas
    an account-based online transaction model can be used for parallel execution in
    transactions. 3.2.4. Man-In-The-Middle MITM is commonly performed through insecure
    wireless channels where the communication path is not secure enough and can lead
    to packet capture, and any unauthorized user can gain access to all the information
    transferring over the insecure communication channel. Once the attacker gains
    access, they can easily escalate their privileges and gain access within the system
    to make any irregular changes without the actual users noticing. Ref. [ 39] has
    conducted security assessments on multiple farm-based types of equipment with
    smart sensors; they concluded that physical devices do come with added security
    fabrication, but through the upper layers, these implementations are in the hands
    of users, which creates a niche for a mistake. Department of Homeland security,
    US has also referred to threats of MITM attack due to negligence on the part of
    users while activating security obligations on their interfaces. 3.2.5. Denial
    of Service According to [ 5], in precision agricultural systems, the denial of
    service is more frequent towards users using smart services; the threats can be
    due to poorly managed systems, disruption to PNT(positioning, navigation, and
    timing) systems that use GPS to collect information for processing. Other disruptions
    can be accounted for at supply chains or communication channels in decision support
    systems. 3.3. Middle Layer/Edge Layer This layer generally consists of edge level
    processing, a practice of pre-processing data before uploading to cloud services;
    it is important to take careful security measures at this layer [ 11]. The methodology
    of securing the parameter consists of safekeeping data with encryption policies,
    transmitting data through safe means, maintaining data integrity at each node.
    Ref. [ 40] have proposed creatinga trust execution environment for edge devices
    by creating a trust zone at the real-time operating system''s thread level. Ref.
    [ 41] have used virtualization techniques at edge level to lightweight implementation,
    decreasing overhead during transmission of information, using Docker containerization,
    and building single-purpose appliances for ease of use. 3.3.1. Encryption Encryption
    of contents is extremely important when the data is transmitted or stored; the
    practice helps to secure the parameter to a vast extent. Ref. [ 11] have shown
    hybrid usage of hardware-based AES algorithm before transmission of data alongside
    the second layer of protection by adding public key protected with RSA algorithm.
    It is emphasized that an edge layer is maintained near the IoT devices to decrease
    the computation and communication load. In [ 6], an edge-aided searchable public-key
    encryption is created that uses bilinear mapping initially and in the second phase
    at the edge side uses a strategy of offline-online schema, the pre-computed data
    in offline phase is sent to online phase for second encryption. Ref. [ 42] have
    another approach of initiating hierarchical identity-based encryption to contain
    privacy and further use blockchain to create a tamper-proof ledger to propagate
    data across a network. 3.3.2. Data Based Attacks This category of threat is related
    to storage, data processing, and new age smart precision agricultural machinery
    uses modern techniques such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to
    enhance the efficiency of the systems and decrease the dependency on users for
    manual integration. The process of automation requires better data that can be
    used for prediction, which can yield better results; the decision support systems
    often require long-term data to determine decisions accordingly. Ref. [ 43] have
    created a smart security system for agriculture-based IoT systems which uses an
    ethereum server to store data instead of traditional servers; EVMs are used to
    contain data coming from sensors and collected in a single place; any queries
    from the user are also answered through the same server. The key is to hash the
    data coming from sensors initially to avoid any mid-way manipulations. 3.3.3.
    Policy-Based Threats In IoT-based implementations, there are various agents combined
    to capitulate better results. These elements need micro-managing through policies
    or alerts, required to be configured at the user''s end. The majority of the issues
    in security arise from weak passwords, default passwords, non-encrypted methods
    of sharing information, improper authentication, and authorization policies. Ref.
    [ 44] have shown using real-time policy management how nodes can be managed with
    different alert-based strategies to control nodes in a network; the implementation
    isbased on smart city and regulation control using thresholds for speed, area
    coverage, surveillance. 3.4. Application Layer This layer is responsible for creating
    an interactive interface between user and system. Thus, it is relatively crucial
    to mark a stricter front onthe application side. Depending upon the operating
    systems and underlying hardware, multiple vulnerabilities and exploits can be
    harnessed. 3.4.1. Social Engineering A naive user is often the most insecure point
    in the complete network; as [ 5] states how commercial farming practices require
    more sophisticated equipment for better agricultural practices, it is equally
    critical to ensure safety from the user''s end. Phishing is another social engineering
    attack strategy that is generally used to lure the users into clicking on synonymous
    links to gain access;In a more targeted form, spear phishing is usually associated
    with almost legit emails. 3.4.2. Code-Based Exploits According to [ 45], a mere
    malicious code could easily inject false data and project a different scenario.
    To deal with this practice, they have used post-quantum cryptography with parity
    check. In practice, an authentication on the server is run to verify the user;
    afterwards device anonymity and location privacy is practiced to ensure the attacker
    cannot reach the legit nodes. 3.4.3. Cloud-Based Threats As the data coming from
    sensors is used for real-time analysis, it is much efficient if the cloud systems
    are used for this purpose as they are ubiquitous, reduce latency, and increase
    ease of access and availability. The SAAS and PAAS platforms are devised to use
    services and applications for real-time analytics, management, decision-making.
    Mobile-based applications tend to use permissions and target data from the user''s
    end; fine-grained control must be established at the user''s end to maintain secure
    data exchange [ 11]. Identity privacy, location information, node compromise,
    and layer cloning/ forwarding can be easily attributed; third-party applications
    used from multiple cloud vendors can extract extra information without the user''s
    knowledge. Ref. [ 46] have explored gateway leaks in smart home technologies and
    showed that secret data leaks cannot be prevented due to a lack of interoperability
    standards. 4. MITIGATION PRACTICES The growing need to provide for a large population
    and ensure less food waste has led to increasing reliability on smart farming
    practices that involve machinery and sophisticated equipment [ 7, 16, 47]. It
    has increased upstanding towards IoT-based devices; the practices are automated
    to reduce manual intervention and burden. However, this has brought about vulnerabilities
    that can be explored and exploited to affect the associated users. Agriculture
    forms a large part of the economy; any disruptions or unprecedented crop failure
    can impact the economic growth of the country. If security breaches towards such
    devices are ignored or left unchecked, it could have repercussions on the economic
    prosperity and lead to crop failure. According to OWASP''s index of top ten vulnerabilities,the
    primary factors for insecure IoT systems are weak passwords, insecure and unreliable
    network usages, lack of security patch updates, outdated components, and insufficient
    privacy protection [ 48]. These collective factors have contributed to losses
    in IoT-based systems. Table 1 enlists some of the suggested mitigations methods
    layerwise that have been implemented, tested, observed, and deployed on other
    IoT-based smart systems and can be perpetuated for agriculture-based systems Figure

    IoT protocol system in order to find out the best-suited system for agricultural
    utility application to a large extent.Based on calculated examinations and comparison,
    we believe that that the best communication protocol is the one that can be widely
    deployed, accepted, and has clearly defined use-cases. In Figure 7, a virtual
    comparison has been developed to understand Signal ranges in comparison with data
    rate to actually determine the exact protocol as per the area of application Figure

    This chapter explored the variety of threats that can be exploited to cause disruptions
    in the services related to those systems, the majority of remotely controlled
    nodes are either unchecked for security, or the users are not using the built-in
    security features. The modern terminology of precision agriculture encloses multiple
    embedded systems providing for a single type of task and managed by controllers
    and services; this revolutionizing digital model needs to adapt to tighter security
    measures as negligence can have consequences and destruction of crops. Although
    the extent of the potential threat model has not been explored in this regard,
    it needs to emphasize security measures. Disclosure statement No potential conflict

    farm management while remaining environmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation

    Keywords: food security; precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture;
    heavy metal; wireless sensors; edge computing 1. Introduction The agricultural
    sector in developing countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we look at the
    production side, the first challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity
    challenge, as it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer
    but at the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity
    is a significant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which
    the farmer faces is with respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and
    pest attacks, as they can damage crops substantially. It is deemed necessary for
    the farmer to mitigate those challenges by adapting to the latest technologies
    and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to market connectivity,
    whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected to distant markets
    as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights. It is essential
    for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform and there should
    be seamless trade between different markets and different places. However, this
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in
    turn need to be streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of the
    developing country, it is a boon if more facility in nature and regulatory support
    has to be given for people who are looking to export outside their country or
    who are looking to have a value-added product across the globe. Now, this mismanagement
    in the agricultural sector can potentially lead to food security risk. Precision
    Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize the development of the farming
    sector and will also help to ensure food security [1]. It is to be highlighted
    that PA is a high-tech farming technology that observes, measures, and analyzes
    farming fields and crops. With the advent of PA, on-field sensors can provide
    detailed levels of data for problems of soil and weather conditions pertaining
    to heavy metal toxics and climate change. Big data obtained from sensor networks
    and farm inputs tracking have a significant role to play to increase farm productivity,
    reduce environmental impacts, and improve human welfare [2]. By combining artificial
    intelligence-based big data analytics with sensor and image data, an integrated
    system could be developed for the agricultural domain. Implementing intensive,
    high-value, personalized management of crops would increase both production and
    economic performance. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of
    smart sensors and high-performance computing in protecting stakeholders in the
    agrifood value chain and providing them with unlimited access to a large dataset
    of various categories in order to track their farms. The challenges and consideration
    for the farming sector in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1
    shows the number of articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.
    Figure 1. Distribution of reviewed articles. The structure of the paper is arranged
    as follows: The first section of the paper explains the paper’s scope and the
    reasoning for the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of food security
    by taking into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and heavy
    metal. In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart
    farming based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication
    protocols and sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section 3
    also emphasizes the importance of edge computing and also highlights the model
    of High Performance Computing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also details
    the various edge computing methodologies used by previous researchers in precision
    agriculture. Section 4 highlights the current challenges and considerations for
    the agricultural sector in developing countries. Finally, Section 5 presents the
    conclusion of the proposed review. 2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View
    of Soil Pollutants and Heavy Metal Toxicants Over the next 35 years, the world’s
    growing population will demand more food than mankind has ever produced. However,
    food security faces a variety of issues on both the development and consumption
    sides, which would necessitate further study in order to formulate a solution.
    The food system, on its current course, would likely absorb much of the remaining
    carbon budget if the temperature rises by 2 °C by the year 2050 [3]. As a result,
    it would leave no room for other industries, making reaching the Paris Agreement
    virtually impossible. Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of this
    magnitude would alter what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest
    and disease spread. Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher
    food prices and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of
    all freshwater, resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the
    loss of biodiversity and soil depletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably
    produce more food on available land will be crucial as agricultural land becomes
    scarce. This necessitates substantial assessment of agricultural soil monitoring
    and mitigating the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics from the soil. Heavy
    metal contamination is widely spread across the world, disrupting the atmosphere
    and thereby showing significant threats to human health. The reason behind heavy
    metal contamination, in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with
    industrialization and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations
    such as China and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization,
    there has been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants,
    with innumerable anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving
    issue pertaining to food security has become a serious concern for the world,
    specifically its inextricable relation to the health of human beings [6,7]. Several
    dangerous heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury
    are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered to
    be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top 20
    list of hazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
    and the Radioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10]. With
    respect to metabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and Cu are
    considered to be essential components along with enzymes and cytochromes, which
    are inextricably connected to the biota metabolic functioning [9,11]. With regard
    to urease, nickel is considered to be an important component; however, it may
    pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13]. Therefore, with respect to the
    above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a well-laid-out example
    of abiotic–biotic interactions. Heavy metal pollution generated from energy intensive
    industries poses a serious threat to the sustenance of soil. Apart from the ill
    effects on human health, heavy metal also puts an adverse impact on soil biota
    through soil microbe interaction and microbial processes [9,14,15]. It also hampers
    the ecosystem when it comes to beneficial soil insects [16,17,18]. It is worth
    noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation of heavy metals.
    A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii” Chinese medicinal plant
    [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to bioaccumulate various heavy
    metals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown near industrial zones [9,20,21,22,23].
    It is also essential to note that, even in the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation
    is susceptible to heavy metal such as Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased
    exposure to illumination [24]. For a successful technological remedy, it is essential
    to understand the soil–food crop transfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this
    purpose, this analysis first discusses the different causes of heavy metal contamination
    in the soil ecosystem and its relevance to the health of human beings. In general,
    this type of analysis gives an overall layout pertaining to heavy metal sources
    within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to anthropogenic influences.
    It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information regarding the global
    scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different continents in the
    agricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection elaborates on the heavy
    metal sources in the soil–crop ecosystem. 2.1. Heavy Metal Sources in Soil–Crop
    Ecosystems It is evident from numerous studies that the source of heavy metals
    in the agricultural ecosystem is due to industrial pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based
    fertilizers, metal pesticides, and contaminated water [9,25,26,27,28,29]. In addition
    to the mentioned sources of heavy metal pollution, it is also essential to understand
    the impact of anthropogenic pollutants, as they pose a risk to the health of human
    beings through dietary intake of contaminated food crops which become polluted
    either through soil or direct atmospheric deposition over the surface of plant
    leaves [17,30]. Waste effluents discharged from industries and automobiles accumulate
    in soil, thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also
    worth noting that coal-based power plants pose a significant threat with respect
    to Hg soil pollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect
    on human health caused by consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated
    soil area. Likewise, many strong sources present a grim outlook for global food
    safety. Figure 2 shows the ecosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy metals
    emitted from automobile and industrial smelters are transported to distant locations,
    i.e., up to several kilometers away from their sources by wet or dry deposition
    [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves through foliar transmission after
    the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface of the leaf [34]. Fernandez
    and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate the leaf tissue through
    the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata. Similar to root uptake,
    foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent manner. Nonetheless,
    one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration in agricultural soil
    also comes from sewage and sludge pollution. Figure 2. Ecosystem of heavy metal
    contamination. To address the concern of rising wastewater produced from domestic
    and industrial processes as a result of the growing human population, a reliable
    strategy and stable treatment systems are urgently needed. With the rapid growth
    of agriculture in the past decade, overuse of water resources, especially for
    agriculture, has become a problematic issue which threatens to intensify the effects
    of climate change. Agriculture constitutes by far the largest use of water in
    all countries [36]. In order to solve this problem, it has been found that wastewater
    reuse is a feasible option to minimize anthropogenic impact [37]. Furthermore,
    raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing countries
    to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising
    food production in water-scarce areas. The benefits of reusing water in agriculture
    are numerous and unquestionable, i.e., it saves significant quantities of freshwater
    which may be assigned for other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that
    may replace chemical fertilizers, thus helping to increase soil fertility and
    crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows for the expansion of agricultural
    land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method for raw wastewater;
    and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition, it has
    been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage in
    agriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets specified standards
    [38,39]. Having elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are also
    possible negative effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater contamination
    of metals and organic compounds. It should be noted that these are only theoretical
    at this point. Furthermore, the use of untreated water for agricultural production
    is potentially dangerous due to its microbial substance, especially bacteria,
    viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number of diseases because many of them
    can be sustained for longer periods in the environment. This in turn tends to
    affect the quality of the soil. It is crucial that farmers aim to keep the quality
    of their soil high in order to preserve the health of their soil species. Soil
    microbes are an important component of the ecosystem [40]. Soil fertility depends
    in part on the breakdown of organic matter and the flow of nutrients through the
    ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses like extreme temperature, pH, salinity,
    and chemical pollution, they are able to negatively affect productivity [41,42,43].
    Owing to the variety of anthropogenic activities, soil may become polluted with
    a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing and mining. Many forms of contaminants,
    i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge, chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can
    end up in the soil system and adversely affect soil microbes [43]. As another
    alternative, vegetables produced in greenhouses also become polluted by heavy
    metals, often from anthropogenic sources. Within the source, detection of heavy
    metals can be performed using sophisticated statistical and geospatial methods
    [9,44,45,46,47]. Greenhouse vegetables in China were more susceptible to Cd pollution
    than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The results of the Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and Cr are primarily discharged from weathered
    rocks, while metallic pollutants such as Hg and Pb are generated by industry,
    vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater for irrigation [48,49]. Nonetheless, it
    is worth noting that PCA has been used by several researchers in various agricultural
    domains for the assessment of soil heavy metal pollutants [50,51,52,53]. Identifying
    soil pollutants and their origins is important to research due to their close
    ties to human health [54,55,56]. In this regard, it has become deemed necessary
    to come up with tools and techniques which can monitor heavy metal composition
    in the soil which can be incorporated into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart
    farming is considered to be the next key segment in the agriculture sector as
    it has changed the methodological paradigm of how farmers operate on fields. The
    following subsection highlights the overview of smart farming and its benefits.
    2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need of the Hour With the advent of Internet
    of Things (IoT), smart devices have reached into all facets of our day-to-day
    life, i.e., healthcare and wellness, smart homes, automobile and logistics, intelligent
    cities and industries. In recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of technological
    changes, increasingly industrialized and technologically driven. Through different
    agriculture-based smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal
    husbandry and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive.
    This, along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped
    to increase the worldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies.
    It is worth noting that for the year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached
    $5.6 billion [57]. Modern agriculture can be addressed in several respects. For
    instance, AgriTech refers to the use of technology in the domain of agriculture
    [58]. In addition, intelligent agriculture is primarily used to describe the use
    of IoT-based agricultural solutions. With IoT sensors, farmers can make informed
    decisions and develop various parameters of their work, i.e., cattle to crop production,
    in order to collect environmental and machine metrics. For example, farmers can
    decide exactly how much pesticide and fertilizer is to be utilized to optimize
    productivity by using smart agriculture sensors for monitoring crop status. The
    same applies to the concept of intelligent farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective
    on a modern-day agricultural model, which incorporates various wireless sensor
    nodes to enable IoT-based farming with satellite communication, where different
    ground sensors are deployed which communicate with the cloud computing node for
    data processing and analysis, so that farmers can make correct decisions. Figure
    3. Modern day agriculture. Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common
    as consumer-connected devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT
    technologies are increasingly being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has
    had a positive impact on IoT market share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing
    market share is expected to hit $6.2 billion by the end of 2021, as reported recently
    [57]. It is evident that COVID-19 has made a significant impact on the farming
    sector across the world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential
    to make a strong comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate
    adoption of advanced technologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural
    sector. This initiative will make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions as
    a prominent business strategy, thus causing a reasonable increment in crop production.
    However, in the current situation, the market is expected to show a decline up
    to 0.8% for the first two quarters of year 2021 compared to 2020 and this trend
    will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59]. In addition to this, the smart
    world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 billion dollars by 2025,
    compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60]. If the sector continues
    to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities for companies. In the coming
    years, creating IoT products for agriculture will distinguish companies as early
    adopters, thus helping to pave the way for success. Today, the innovations on
    our immediate horizon include autonomous machines which have the capacity to pluck
    and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective plantation. A highly sophisticated
    sensing system includes microscopic sensors and cameras that help farmers track
    the growth of crops and warn them when something is wrong or inform them of the
    optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob developed by Deepfield Labs [61] can take
    a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus levels in
    real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land barley
    without humans ever entering the field as a proof of concept for autonomous farming
    technology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized software
    that analyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy vegetation,
    similar to a real-life game of SIM farming in which the farmer receives a warning
    on their computer when a disturbed area is detected. Machine learning is constantly
    improving the system’s ability to distinguish between crop varieties and weeds
    that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore, various pilots are hired by Micro
    Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to fly light aircraft equipped with multispectral
    cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms around the country [63]. Planet
    Labs has a fleet of CubSat satellites that take weekly photographs of entire farms
    from space to aid in crop monitoring [64]. To cope with this new wave of data,
    other companies are developing analytics tools to act as farm management systems,
    enabling farmers to work on a variety of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks
    can now integrate data from several farms into one large pool, giving their members
    access to macro-level insights that were previously only accessible to corporate
    mega farms. 2.3. Benefits of Smart Farming In certain ways, technology and IoT
    have the ability to change agriculture. There are five ways in which IoT can boost
    agriculture: Data: Loads of data gathered by sensors from the fields, i.e., temperature,
    soil quality, crop growth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the
    condition of the farm along with the performance of field workers and efficiency
    of equipment. Improved internal process management and therefore lower output
    risks: The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become
    prepared for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated
    production of the crop is known. Cost savings and waste reduction by improved
    quality control: If any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,
    then the risk of losing the yield can be minimized. Improved business productivity
    through process automation: Smart farming can automate several processes during
    the development cycle, i.e., irrigation, fertilization, or pest control with intelligent
    devices. Improved consistency and volume of the commodity: Greater control over
    production processes and retaining higher crop quality levels and growth potential
    by automation can be achieved. Helps to mitigate soil toxicity and monitor significant
    parameters, thereby providing sustainable agriculture: With the advent of low-cost
    sensors for monitoring agriculture, significant parameters in the agricultural
    ecosystem can be analyzed to increase the factor of sustainability, i.e., assessing
    soil quality and monitoring soil toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,
    weather conditions, and optimized usage of fertilizers. All the aforementioned
    variables will contribute to higher revenues. However, the benefits of smart farming
    can only be exploited if the quality of internet is able to accommodate the IoT
    infrastructure. In this regard, the following section discusses internet access
    quality in developing countries. 2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing
    Countries IoT provides an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have
    uniquely identified data that can be communicated over the internet without the
    need for computer interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over
    13.4 billion devices were linked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted
    that by the year 2020 there will be a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according
    to Juniper research (Juniper research 2015) [66]. Today, nearly every field of
    modern society is being overtaken by IoT [67]. The main areas include smart health,
    smart cities, intelligent industries, driverless cars, smart agriculture, precision
    farming, smart homes, etc. [68]. In this regard, it has been deemed necessary
    for every household and business sector to become connected with the internet,
    if we want to realize the maximum utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph
    of internet users worldwide on the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b
    shows the subsequent penetration rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting
    that, although the number of users in Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure
    4a, if Figure 4b is analyzed, then it becomes evident that there is a clear-cut
    digital division, as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is a mere 59.5% and
    47.1%. In most of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia and Africa,
    the agricultural sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall
    Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are
    deemed necessary in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural
    domain. Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration
    rate [69]. IoT has great potential and is one of the main areas for future internet
    services growth. IoT problems are exploratory in major IT companies and most countries.
    New uses of IoT are being searched for and developed, but most work has been done
    in the field of standardization of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in
    the European Digital Agenda (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for
    research and innovation HORIZON 2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to
    have been invested in IoT technology between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission,
    2015). In March 2015, the EU Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance.
    The objective of the alliance was to develop close cooperation on innovation and
    standardization of IoT (European Commission 2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders,
    and parties involved in IoT [66]. The fragmented existence of platforms and communications
    protocols is one of the major problems of the present day, and contributes to
    incompatibility problems between different IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT
    is well known in precision agriculture, but only proprietary solutions that lead
    to compatibility and connectivity issues between various equipment are being used
    [73]. New technologies need to be sought, based on open standards and frameworks
    that are compatible with smartphones. Many products that are based on open hardware
    at least partially are currently on the market and prices are considerably lower
    than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current infrastructure in
    consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to the next
    level by connecting to the IoT. 2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT Farmers today
    have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global population grows.
    Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming sector to bring major
    shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving change in agriculture,
    which has brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT refers to devices or objects
    embedded in the sensor for the purpose of measurement and transfer of datasets
    through network devices, from pumps and tractors to weather stations. In essence,
    IoT means that these physical machines can transmit and receive information from
    farms on devices using the internet in order to remotely measure all types of
    data and provide that information to the farmer. Soil moisture, chemical properties,
    dam levels, livestock health, and weather details can be collected in real time
    by IoT devices. IoT devices information helps farmers to track farms and accordingly
    helps to advise farmers to increase productivity and yields. Farmers can also
    respond faster to farm conditions and save time and money. Nonetheless, with the
    advent of IoT, there lies a major challenge in the processing of high volumes
    of data generated from the on-field sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle
    this issue by coming up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-field
    agricultural sensors. 2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT One of the biggest
    hurdles of IoT is to process large datasets in tandem. However, knowing what the
    data are, what the nature of the data is, and how they go through are some of
    the key components that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering the
    data forms the initial stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data
    to the system from the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data
    go through all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are
    actually cleansed and transformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights.
    The big question lies with how many specific points of computation should exist.
    Let us consider an instance, whereby there is a drip irrigation system which finds
    that one of the plants is not getting enough water. Now, this delay could not
    be disturbing for the system as the concerned person handling the drip irrigation
    system can come back the next morning and actually provide some water or maybe
    some other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring sustenance in
    the agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the factors
    that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In these
    kinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where the data
    originate from. Therefore, in this regard, one can realistically conduct some
    processing for something to be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns
    and do some planning for the long term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a
    spectrum on a scale of time as to where the processing needs to happen. So, by
    considering all these scenarios, it becomes evident that not all the data are
    important, and this is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This gives an insight
    of what data need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to be retained
    for short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where
    storage technologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems that
    are actually being worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet access
    infrastructure in developing countries, the feasibility of their implementation
    remains a challenge. One of the viable solutions to solve this problem could be
    via edge computing whereby the essential data could be offloaded from the cloud
    over the edge of the cloud, and this is where the paradigm of smart sensing with
    edge computing comes in. 2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing Numerous
    embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature. Some are
    personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full sensing/monitoring
    systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select their equipment according
    to the goals of each study or the main objective. Business pertaining to sensing
    services includes a range of features outside the box to allow scientists to concentrate
    on other aspects of IoT de-planting, such as meta-processing, smart tracking and
    monitoring algorithms, cloud interoperability, and more [74,75,76]. On the other
    hand, the programmable open approach gives designers versatility in monitoring
    the actions of the nodes and network and in programming new peripheral devices,
    such as new sensors or drive modules [77,78]. The next subsections discuss various
    communication paradigms and wireless sensors and nodes which are suitable to be
    used in the agricultural domain. 3. Communication in IoT Despite significant changes,
    IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many reviews, to achieve its final form
    [79]. The configuration of IoT is based on three layers: a network layer (data
    transfer), a perception layer, and an application layer for data storage and manipulation
    [80]. The network layer is considered to be the physical layer of the architecture,
    where the on-field sensors and actuators directly interact with the environment
    and gather data as per the requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network
    (WSN), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications
    (NFC) are used on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and
    RFID technology due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed
    as lower-computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally
    consists of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with
    digital sensor devices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller
    unit, and a Radio Frequency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power
    wireless communication technology [82]. At the network layer of the IoT, WSN communicates
    with physical objects and their surroundings, neighboring nodes, or gateways.
    The network layer is also responsible for building a network paradigm, by using
    which the data are typically forwarded to a remote storage infrastructure for
    further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which are used to develop
    communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among the internet-enabled
    gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise Sigfox, ZigBee,
    6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition to this, Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRa/LoRaWAN),
    and low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer. The application layer
    is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for getting data downloaded
    and delivering application-specific service to the users’ device via an application
    programming interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization of
    IoT in several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,
    such as system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions
    of devices around the world would provide them across the future internet with
    direct internet-like access and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and scalability
    are essential characteristics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6 can mitigate some
    system recognition problems with its aspects of internet mobility and is expected
    to play a key role in this sector [85]. The heterogeneity of the wireless nodes,
    diversity in data types, parallel operations, and integration of data from devices
    further exacerbate the problem [86]. While numerous theoretical parameters of
    the WSN have been studied extensively in literature, practical IoT/WSN implementations
    are very demanding for agriculture and remain a difficult task. Sensor modules
    must be sufficiently reliable, with the required measuring range available which
    is protected from environmental factors that either produce false readings or
    cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses distributed nature, therefore
    replacing the power source can be a very tough challenge for battery-operated
    nodes in open fields or other agricultural facilities. Consequently, very stringent
    power limitations influence the hardware selection and the low-power characteristics
    of the chosen peripherals are often taken into consideration when designing a
    new device. The software components to be implemented must be carefully inspected
    to incorporate the functionality of a system. The final function code includes
    a fully integrated understanding of software engineering and adequate testing
    to prevent field failures [87]. Other characteristics that allow an integrated,
    low-power system to be chosen for use are its longer-term reliability, the number
    of digital and analogue inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral devices
    (sensors and actuators) to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,
    and the effort needed to program the system. IoT is a dominant type of IT wireless
    technology in the seven major groups, i.e., the Global System for Mobile Communication
    (GSM), Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional
    Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio, mesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power
    Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication
    System (UMTS) and Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88]. Many
    wireless devices are produced in compliance with different wireless standards.
    One prominent problem is the interference between devices that run on the same
    band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or adjacent bands [89]. Table 1
    summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of bandwidth,
    operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies and
    specifications as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their unique
    criteria impede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena are high temperatures
    and high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments. Based on observations
    by Bannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases from 25 °C to 65 °C,
    it has a major effect on the signal intensity obtained. Boano et al. [91] presented
    similar findings. In addition, humidity in agricultural deployments can also be
    very high. For open fields, the wireless nodes are exposed directly to rain or
    irrigation systems. Relative humidity in greenhouses can also reach 80% for long
    periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly impact the distribution of radio waves
    [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of the number of nodes into account,
    i.e., the distance between them, the antenna height, and the operating frequency
    based on the appropriate size of the messages when selecting a wireless transceiver
    for the agricultural purpose. The next subsection discusses the sensors which
    are used or have the potential to be deployed over agricultural fields for soil
    assessment and monitoring soil pollutants such as heavy metal toxics. In addition,
    the next subsection also highlights the various wireless nodes and the associated
    microcontroller and transceiver. Table 1. Widely used IoT wireless technologies.
    3.1. Commonly Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identification Sensors
    for Soil Moisture (SM) have been used in crop fields for decades to measure water
    content. The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difficulties in manual soil
    moisture readings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology has
    been developed for wireless data collection, providing managers and users with
    real-time access to soil moisture data, resulting in more successful water management
    decisions. Some of the prominent sensing devices to measure soil moisture comprise
    gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors, capacitive sensors, and Ground Penetrating
    Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a direct and normal SM measurement tool
    [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry soil mass to wet soil mass including
    pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples taken from the field and oven
    sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water and the measuring of resistance
    changes based on soil water content are primarily resistive sensors, such as granular
    matrix sensors. This method includes sensor calibration for precise SM reading.
    Intelligent irrigation-based measurement to maintain soil moisture levels is significant
    to improve plant productivity and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors
    these days are expensive, i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around
    USD 169 [95]. In order to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95]
    proposed an RFID-based GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity
    and quality. In addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising
    aptamer and DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale
    and large scale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based
    biosensor is composed of genetically modified bacterial cells and a green fluorescent
    signal amplifier which detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its
    arsenic detection lasts for an hour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other
    methodologies pertaining to biosensors, i.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,
    have also been used to detect arsenic with the possibility of being developed
    as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98]. The EC-5 series sensors were
    also used by Wu et al. [99] for field-specific calibration and evaluation in sandy
    soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to reveal soil
    water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions. The
    ECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used for medium
    textured soil type with low electrical conductance conditions. In addition to
    this, there is ECHO-10HS soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil
    moisture sensor family and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables
    the sensors to accurately measure soil moisture in any of the soil or soilless
    media with minimum salinity and textural effects. In order to measure soil water
    content and salinity, Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors at different soil depths
    to assess dielectric permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity (ECa). It is
    to be noted that 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reflectometry (FDR);
    therefore, they use a fixed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the
    device cheaper and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors
    to evaluate near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function.
    Hydro probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the
    contrary, hydro probe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage
    et al. [103] used an MP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition
    of the expansive soil layer. They also used this sensor to measure volumetric
    water content values in the soil column during the wetting and drying process
    [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem services, air quality plays an
    essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to monitor the air
    quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study physiological
    and metabolic response of corn fields and paddy fields, the Pogo II VWC has been
    widely used [107,108]. Hu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy
    (PXRF) to assess the heavy metal content in soil for which they covered 301 farmland
    soils from Fuyang in Zhejiang Province, in the southern Yangtze River Delta, China.
    Conventional methods for heavy metal detection such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry
    (AAS), Atomic Fluorescence Spectrometry (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma
    Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), are expensive and lengthy procedures
    which are executed in laboratories. Therefore, these methods are not taken into
    consideration for rapid testing and high-density evaluation of soil heavy metals
    contamination. As an alternative method for rapid heavy metal detection, Portable
    X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess cumulative concentrations of soil
    heavy metals based on linear regression models between fluorescence intensity
    and specific heavy metal concentration. Due to its ease of use and rapid testing
    ability using non-destructive quantification, PXRF has been widely used by researchers
    in numerous domains [110,111,112,113]. For the heavy metal assessment in agricultural
    soil conducted by Hu et al. [109], VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties
    comprising pH, soil nitrogen, and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO
    color sensor can also be used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess
    of environmental thresholds in landfill soils [116]. Lately Zhao and Liu [117]
    have developed a Portable Electrochemical System (PES) for on-site heavy metal
    detection on farmland. Their system was composed of a three-electrode configuration
    which comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a microcontroller-based
    potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry. Their system
    was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include
    any wireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data. Other than
    the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors dedicated
    to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,
    i.e., SLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ΔLA-C; light intensity
    sensor, i.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118,119,120,121,122]. With the advent of these
    sensors, CO2 sensors also play an essential role, especially in greenhouse systems
    [123]. CO2 sensors have also been widely used to measure the subsequent level
    in peat soil, landfill, and forest control site [124,125]. In the smart farming
    ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch cannot be neglected. In this
    regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors which researchers
    have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed an optoelectronics
    sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed sensor was
    lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor
    was well tested in open field conditions. In addition to this, the effect of gas
    concentration during the fruit growth was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which
    a smart ethylene electrochemical sensor was established to investigate ethylene
    emission from fruits. Lately, Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat field
    deformation sensor to measure sap flow dynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat
    griddling of the peduncle was performed to differentiate flow of xylem and phloem
    with respect to developing fruits. Capacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis
    of changes in soil capacitance due to differences in water content [129]. Commercial
    UTs use capacitive sensors, which are usually more accurate than resistive sensors
    but cost more [130]. Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic
    wave absorption and reflection. SM sensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping,
    and frequency-modulated technologies. This method is used for measuring soil moisture
    near the surface (up to 10 cm). The most reliable soil humidity samples used in
    fields are neutron scattering samples [132] and scattering samples use radiation
    methods for calculating SM by estimating changes to the neutron flux density due
    to water content of the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases, specific licenses
    are required to carry out its implementation. Numerous research studies have been
    performed to develop electrochemical devices for various applications, which are
    known as potentiostat [135,136,137,138,139,140,141]. Lately, an Arduino-based
    potentiostat was fabricated from cost-efficient components and was able to execute
    simple electrochemical experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed
    in a Windows operating system via USB interface [136,137,138]. As an addition
    to Arduino-based potentiostat, Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to
    execute the electrochemical experiments, whereby the results were displayed on
    the LCD touch panel connected to the controller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry
    Pi-based potentiostat have the potential to incorporate wireless sensors for data
    transmission; however, these controllers do not contain a built-in Analog to Digital
    Converter (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) which make the overall design
    more sophisticated. In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came up with a portable
    Heavy Metal Potentiostat (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composition on-site. Their
    potentiostat comprised a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and the electronic
    component, which is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component (PRCC),
    as shown in Figure 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino
    and RPi controller board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules.
    Therefore, researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature
    sensors along with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller;
    thus, an integrated system for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat
    Read-out Circuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting
    of Screen Printed Electrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat [142].
    Other soil physical properties can be calculated to populate the map of the soil
    with other soil properties such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles
    percentage, and nutrients such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation
    K, base saturation Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143,144,145]. In situ, calculating these
    properties in real time also faces challenges due to scale, cost, and technology
    limitations. In precision farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken
    using yield monitoring. This method helps in providing spatial distribution of
    crop yields at the end of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally
    mounted on farm equipment and capture yield data automatically in the course of
    the harvest. In particular, mass flow sensors on grain containers are mounted
    to record grain inflows along with the position [148]. The collected data are
    analyzed with tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment System Analysis
    International [149]. In order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with
    field topography, Electrical Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s
    ability to conduct current is measured by electrical conductivity. EC assessment
    is used to assess the use of phosphorus, cations in water, drainage, and rooting
    depths [150]. EC maps are used for zoning the area. The zoning is also used to
    incorporate precision agricultural practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)
    methods can be used for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance
    (ECa) and Visible Near Infrared Reflectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of
    commercial tools available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with
    GPS systems [149,152]. In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen,
    potassium, and phosphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation
    of these nutrients helps to assess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.
    The optical detection is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s
    reflection and absorption [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic
    sensors has been developed in the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration
    in natural water resources [155]. This approach is used to detect the amounts
    of nitrate and sulphates by correlating the impedance of the sensor array with
    their concentration. The key approaches to soil macronutrients include electrochemical,
    VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156]. These approaches to soil macronutrients
    are limited to sensing a single desired ion because the membrane used in these
    methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultaneous multi-ion sensing,
    it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro nutrients
    [158]. There are several opportunities to advance the state of precision farming
    through the utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following Table 2
    summarizes the list of sensors along with their functionalities which can be widely
    utilized in the field of precision agriculture. Table 2. Sensors used in the agriculture
    domain. WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular
    configuration. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate
    to track and collect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized
    mode by sending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g., through
    a gateway). A broad variety of application-specific limitations is included in
    the project, design, prototype, and use of a WSN. The BTnode is a Bluetooth-based
    radio module and microcontroller for autonomous wireless communication [159].
    BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which can be configured on
    the basis of application specific requirement. BTnode can be utilized with several
    peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising factor
    of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface. A
    pictorial description of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises an
    Atmel ATmega128L microcontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160]. The
    microcontroller demonstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS at a maximum
    of 8 MHz. The on-chip memory comprises a programmable in-built 128 KB of flash
    memory along with 4 KB of static RAM. Other integrated peripherals consist of
    JTAG for debugging, timers, counters, pulse-width modulation, and 10-bit analog-to-digital
    converter. Figure 6. (a) Pictorial description of BTnode. (b) Illustration of
    BTnode [159]. Epic is a new open mote platform for SensorNet modules. Pictorial
    view of Epic is shown in Figure 7. SensorNet platforms, like most embedded systems,
    are tightly coupled to their applications and this can also be incorporated over
    parallel programming paradigm to enhance processing and reduce execution time
    [161,162]. A key aspect of Epic is the support of prototyping and reusability
    using composable hardware architecture. The research and development of Epic was
    carried out at Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley,
    in 2008 [161]. Figure 7. Pictorial description of Epic [161]. Irene Mote was an
    advanced stage development of Epic with numerous functionalities which makes it
    suitable to implement user-centric studies. The research and development of Irene
    Mote was carried out at Computer Science Division, University of California, Berkeley,
    in 2009 [163,164,165]. Figure 8 shows the pictorial representation and illustration
    of Irene Mote. Figure 8. Pictorial description and illustration of Irene Mote
    [164,165]. The CM5000 TelosB sensor was developed to measure temperature, relative
    humidity, and light intensity. The sensor is IEEE 802.15.4 compliant wireless
    sensor node based on the original open source TelosB/Tmote Sky platform design
    which was developed by the University of California, Berkeley [164,166,167]. Figure
    9 shows the pictorial description of CM5000-TelosB sensor. Figure 9. Pictorial
    description of CM5000-TelosB [164,168]. The Preon32 module is tailored for short-range
    wireless networks and is equipped with a universally usable sensor and actuator
    platform [169,170]. Figure 10 pictorially represents the Preon32 sensor. Preon32
    is incorporated with Cortex-M3 controller which is compatible with IEEE 802.15.4
    radio frequency module. In addition, this module enables developers to develop
    the wireless module codes using an object-oriented programming language like Java
    [169]. It also demonstrates the functionalities of external interfaces, i.e.,
    USB, CAN, and SPI, etc. [164,169]. Figure 10. Preon32 sensor [170]. The Mica2
    Mote is shown in Figure 11. These motes are CrossBow Technology’s mote technology
    of the second and third century. In combination with the CC1000/CC2420 RF Module,
    Mica2 and MicaZ use the Atmega128L controllers [171]. With the interface support
    for the link to the mote, the Mica2/MicaZ are fitted with moisture, temperature,
    and light sensors [162]. These motes also measure barometric pressure, seismic
    waves, etc. [172,173,174]. Figure 11. Mica2 Mote sensor [174]. Usually, the sensor
    nodes of a WSN consist of three basic building blocks: sensors, computer units,
    and communication units. The sensor nodes need a working device, a routing protocol,
    and eventually a simulator to allow a WSN to function properly. The most critical
    issues concerning WSN include the lack of standardization of the hardware nodes,
    limited consumption of energy, communication latency, out-of-order and loss of
    packets, distributed reconfiguration and scalability factors. In this regard,
    the Operating System (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It
    is worth noting that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK,
    and LiteOS [175]. TinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-specific
    and built for wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies with
    programs which require very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries that
    manage network protocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and data collection
    tools. TinyOS uses a monolithic architecture class to construct a static image
    on the node using the component model. TOS offers multithreading support from
    version, named TOS Threads, using a cooperative threading approach. In order to
    come up with a lightweight open source OS, Contiki was developed by the Swedish
    Institute of Computer Science [177]. The promising factor of Contiki is its portability
    factor which is based on an event-driven kernel. Contiki includes so-called protothreads,
    which can be used at the individual process level. Nonetheless, Contiki includes
    many applications supporting features like the multitasking kernel, preventive
    multithreading, prototype threads, TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol, light telnet
    client, and quick web server etc. [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports
    dynamic memory management; it does not support applications in real time [179].
    With the advent of cross platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models
    were developed. The MultimodAl system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks
    [164] is a multi-threaded WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that
    includes kernel, scheduler, and network stack, and is compatible to be used across
    various platforms, i.e., PDA or a PC. In addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs
    based on multitasking [175]. The design objectives for Nano-RK include multihop
    networking, effective power management to extend WSN lifetime, limited resources
    lighting applications, and priority scheduling. LiteOS based in Unix was developed
    by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in order to support the
    programming paradigm for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix, thread, and C programming
    environment and is built using a hybrid programming model which allows programming,
    both event-driven and thread-driven. Some of the common wireless nodes which can
    be used in precision agriculture are summarized in Table 3 along with the details
    of the transceiver and microcontroller. Table 3. Common wireless nodes used in
    the agriculture domain. Now, the question is how the previously discussed sensors
    could be deployed over an IoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework
    with optimized scheduling. In this regard, the next subsection discusses the significance
    of Edge Computing. 3.2. Role of Edge Computing It is essential to look at data
    that can be processed immediately close to where the data originate with the help
    of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind of storage, computing
    ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For long-term retention
    for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is to be done in the cloud.
    Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of storage solutions are we looking
    at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed in such a way that it could possess
    local processing power needed in decision-making ability and largely it is going
    to be right intensive. Thus, some storage is required at the edge level which
    is going to be fast, i.e., largely of course solid-state drive to overcome the
    issues of low latency. However, in the current scenario, data analysis and long-term
    planning are essential; therefore, users may compromise with lower degrees of
    latencies, but the factor of storage remains a priority. The prominent challenge
    in edge computing is with respect to the volume of the data. Having so many sensors
    deployed for computing, the heterogeneity of data themselves is another challenging
    issue. The coherency of data always exists at the edge level and it is essential
    for the user to correlate the data to discrete points, and without this correlation,
    one cannot get insights for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation of
    high-speed data becomes another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this
    issue, the workflow optimization along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes
    a necessity for edge computing. In this regard, flexibility and agility could
    be achieved with lower cost, whereby rapid provisioning of data could be enabled
    with continuous innovation, free flow of data transmission could be observed to
    and from sensors without being clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud
    and multicloud deployments could be met, and distributed storage could be created
    in order to manage high-volume generated data. Having mentioned the aforementioned
    parameters, it could be asserted in a nutshell that agility and flexibility need
    to be maintained at the seconds or subseconds level of computing to manage the
    real-time complex problems. Nonetheless, this has become possible with the help
    of IoT device sensors. Since at the edge level, a finite amount of storage is
    being maintained, therefore the workflow optimization is to be designed in such
    a way that it can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds
    level, i.e., the defined system needs to be able to address this problem of getting
    the data that come in quickly and starting to process them to gain some insights
    into certain correlation and then keep that storage free for the next set of data
    that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to workflow optimization, we need to
    look at the set of devices which needs to be employed to be able to address all
    the data that are coming in. In this context, if a High-Performance Computing
    (HPC) framework could be set over the edge level, then the aforementioned issues
    are feasible to be resolved. It is essential for the working of HPC framework
    attached to the edge to smoothen the workflow optimization and scheduling criteria.
    Various edge nodes require various types of resources. To this end, it is necessary
    to select an appropriate scheduling approach to ensure the consistency of resources
    and the availability of services. Researchers have suggested resource continuity
    management approaches, such as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog
    Reference Architecture (OpenFog RA) [180,181]. The F2C layered model is a novel
    architecture focused on data sharing and data integration that can achieve service
    parallelization and less service execution time. OpenFog RA has been designed
    to meet the same F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are proposing a distributed
    management system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efficiently achieve resource
    consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182]. Li et al.
    [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-constrained,
    heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited and space-complex
    are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration process. In edge
    computing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184] designed a lightweight
    scheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different layers of Deep Neural
    Networks (DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data center without profiling
    each program. By becoming adapted to the lightweight scheduler, working professionals
    can be adapted to a range of low-latency and energy-efficient DNN architectures,
    hardware systems, wireless networks, and server workloads. By embracing cooperative
    competition and game theory, Zhang et al. [122] established CoGTA, a system for
    allocation of tasks. For edge computing systems, CoGTA aims at delay-sensitive
    and social-sensing applications. CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems, such
    as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian stochastic
    channel was used by Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and offload
    strategy for collaborative operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem
    of minimal energy scheduling tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs
    as a restricted, shortest path problem. This problem is then solved using the
    regular Lagrange Relaxation-dependent Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm. Kwak
    et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation algorithm for CPU/network resource
    or task in the mobile networking context. To scale the CPU/network speed, they
    used the Lyapunov optimization technique. Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed
    a new approach to resource management by taking into account both bandwidth availability
    and source selection. Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed
    data processing, storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices
    tend to be heterogeneous, leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous
    data on-edge device. Furthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such,
    proposing an optimum, complex, and energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing
    is complicated. If resource abstraction and edge OS management would allow developers
    to focus on their applications without trying to think about hardware, connectivity,
    and code written for specific devices, this would be a huge leap forward for complex
    projects to be realized. This will reduce complexity, simplify growth, and reduce
    edge computing costs for the ecosystem. 3.3. HPC on Edge (HPCE) This new High-Performance
    Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond the agricultural services offered
    on edge and provide a comprehensive platform for precision farming and animal
    husbandry and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for stakeholders.
    The HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2]. The HPCE
    model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor readings,
    as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information
    for ready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC technology,
    it only uses the latest software platforms and projects that are being developed
    by HPCE’s e-controlled services, as well as increased HPC e-infrastructure to
    enable huge heterogeneous data processing to be done and find modern solutions
    to complex problems using dedicated algorithms. Due to the interconnection of
    large-oriented approaches, varying datasets, and available big data techniques,
    it is possible to scale distributed big data research to enormous scales when
    holding many types of datasets together in one place [2]. In doing so, it enables
    the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically to a standard scheme
    and data model and enables advanced data analytics to take secret information
    into account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture will also help in gaining
    insights from adaptive data visualization services. With reference to CYBELE [2],
    the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is illustrated in Figure 12. By
    organizing a product component based on interdependencies, this is intended to
    highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to promote compatibility
    and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent services. It is worth
    noting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform architecture. EdgeX
    platform comprises four core services, i.e., device services, core services, supporting
    services, and application services to enable smooth workflow optimization [188].
    In addition, it will be interesting to see a synchronization of EdgeX with a dedicated
    HPC framework for faster batch processing of data over edge. Figure 12. High Performance
    Computing on Edge. Big, heterogeneous data are made available through repositories
    powered by HPC which is responsible for the processing at the edge layer. In this
    regard, as can be seen in Figure 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN,
    Big Deep Learning (BigDL), Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed
    for the batch processing of data using distributed framework attached to the edge
    layer [189]. It is worth noting that Spark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks
    in many organizations for their open source and high degree of interoperability
    features. Spark and BigDL are based on MapReduce framework which has high room
    for tuning for smooth workflow optimization [190]. The transmission of the application
    process interface along with data from the cloud layer to the edge layer is conducted
    using 4G/5G or fiber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system. This is seen on the middle
    section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At first, the data are processed
    in the background prior to being passed on to the check-in stage for data validator
    or timestamp validator for resolution of data verification and timing problems.
    Once data are obtained in edge layer, quality checks are conducted to identify
    anomalies and any other data irregularities, maintaining their accuracy and validity,
    which are accompanied by a series of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.
    Finally, the HPE data provenance service provides the mechanisms required for
    recording all relevant information concerning incoming data of interest. With
    HPE, the data provenance platform is inherently connected to the data policy and
    asset brokerage engine that enables the platform to bind data providers and data
    users with data share and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability
    and reuse of data, the inspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically.
    Since the data come from a variety of physically distributed data sources, a standard
    data model will be created for the semantic definition and annotation of the data.
    To facilitate the pipeline and allow the various heterogeneous components to communicate
    seamlessly, the model will be used as a common language to annotate data and exchange
    messages between the components. Clean and semantically uplifted data are then
    available, i.e., open and proprietary data to be queried, analyzed, and viewed.
    An exemplification of how ground sensors have their data stored and analyzed at
    cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-field data are continuously assessed
    by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects if any threshold
    point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-field data are also stored in the cloud
    database from where the user can download the required data and at the same time,
    data analysis could be applied using the machine learning tools stored over the
    cloud database. Figure 13. Illustration for storage and analysis of data from
    ground sensors to cloud database. To facilitate simulation execution, a defined
    experimental composition setting is designed, as shown in the top right part of
    the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12. The composition framework of experiments
    aims to support the separate design, development, and execution of big data research
    procedures, the support of embedded scientific computation and reproductive tests.
    In the analysis method, its subsequent template is selected to provide each analytical
    template with its own software and execution endpoint and allow the user to modify
    the appropriate configuration variables (i.e., input algorithm, execution parameters,
    netting parameters, and output parameters). The results of each analytical template
    are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote the design
    and implementation of data analysis workflows consisting of a number of data analysis
    procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output artifacts.
    The outcome will constitute the input to another research template when a template
    is executed. The output of the research model is an object for session that contains
    all the memory output values. In addition to big data, advanced analysis must
    be implemented when selecting input datasets and developing workflows. For HPCE,
    advanced analytical algorithms are available to stakeholders that allow them to
    explore various forms of data visually and to find and solve new trends. In order
    to achieve improved delivery and monitoring, machining and predictive modelling
    methods should be modified so as to handle the predictive life cycle of data planning,
    detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced analytics along
    with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power and a higher
    processing memory, so that information can be collected within a realistic timeframe.
    When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes are needed, including
    storage power, speed of the device, memory capacity, and quick turnaround time.
    The next section discusses the IoT-based communication methodologies in edge computing
    used for precision farming developed by several researchers. 3.4. Edge Computing
    in Precision Farming IoT incorporation in precision farming has brought about
    changes in the communications of actuators and sensors with remote servers. With
    respect to networking technologies, modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving
    transceivers and network topologies that are tailored to field conditions where
    mobile and WiFi base stations are rare [191]. Multiple topologies that use wireless
    sensor networks can route data messages via communication nodes to reach a gateway
    with the internet connectivity, as shown in the proposal from Akka and Sokullu
    [192]. More recent developments with IoT involve network protocols to communicate
    through the internet with remote devices via applications designed for data reduction.
    For monitoring purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT
    protocol for data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols
    allowed the gathering and analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud
    middleware [195]. A further expanded analysis of this topic can be found in the
    work of Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway using ZigBee collects data from a real deployment
    of sensors, which are then sent to a data cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based
    protocols. The work takes advantage of open interfaces to build a number of client
    applications that can access the cloud module. However, no IoT protocols are used,
    and only an early version of FIWARE is used. Martinez et al. [197] presented research
    on how to handle crops in PA environments using the cloud plane. The FIWARE core
    is used here, along with a collection of additional enablers, to communicate with
    IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such as Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), where current and
    historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics. The output of FIWARE is
    assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests, but no real implementation
    of the proposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et al. [198], a refined optimization
    has to be made in FIWARE to get it implemented over fog computing domain. The
    incorporation of intermediate processing stages in the data path is an evolution
    of mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending monitored data to the cloud, Liu
    [199] performed local preprocessing at data collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor
    et al. [200] expanded on this concept by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and
    technologies in a real hydroponic implementation to achieve effective computation-offloading.
    Moreover, a similar method for computation offloading was also implemented by
    Chang et al. [201] in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack
    of flexibility is noticeable in the way edge computing is implemented, and this
    layer is exclusively oriented to data fusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a
    hybridization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with IoT in precision agriculture.
    However, it was found that there is still a big gap between AI and IoT due to
    computational resources. In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical
    Processing Unit (GPU) in the edge device to enhance the computational services
    [202]. For an efficient computation offloading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge
    which has the substantial potential to support computational intensive tasks by
    proper offloading across local device and edge cloud in proximity. ThriftyEdge
    is well suited to be deployed in ad hoc networks for precision agriculture [203].
    The IoT-based generic monitoring system was defined by Oliver et al. [204]. It
    was deployed and validated on floriculture domain, with a setup of monitoring
    weather and soil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee such diseases
    which could impede plantations proactively. For example, bacterial leaf spots,
    damp-off root rots, soft rots, and bacterial spots are among such diseases. HPE’s
    overall architecture is cloud-centric and uses an edge computer node to gather
    information from the distributed sensor network. MySense is a generic framework
    for the rapid development and use of precision wine scenarios monitoring application
    [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators, WSN/gateway, web,
    and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm generation, fog computing
    is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was used in a winery to study the
    dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic setting. The necessary ingredient
    that makes farming operations work is consistent, productive soil. Lavanya et
    al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based sensing framework for assessing
    nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations in soil. In order to allow
    a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) and Light
    Emitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based method implemented on an
    edge computer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess the sensed values pertaining
    to nutrient deficiency. To assess other nutrient shortages, additional rules were
    added to this rationale. This method was low-cost and provided a quick alternative
    compared to laboratory testing methods, which take a longer time and are also
    costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting farmers in effectively managing
    their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings, improved field management, and
    increased environmental conservation by eliminating runoff and leaching pollution.
    Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case study in the domain of tomato production
    that demonstrated how edge computing generated scalable data analytics. In this
    case, a Raspberry Pi served as a sensor setup base station and a network edge
    node. On the edge node, a prediction analysis was implemented for the growth state
    of cherry tomato, and the data generated were sent to a cloud-based central server
    for model integration and analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict
    results. This strategy not only reduces data flow, but it also allows farmers
    to preserve their data. Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity
    of plants, and in this regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning
    and greenhouse management. Krintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA)
    along with linear regression to introduce a temperature forecast system using
    low-cost microcontrollers and single board computer. The introduction of edge
    computing in their methodological paradigm drastically reduced the factor of latency.
    The advantageous part of their developed system is that the farmers can opt for
    a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a sophisticated weather
    station. Fan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile edge computing.
    An offloading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics. In
    addition, computation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while determining
    when to continue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked at edge computing
    as a foundation for metagenomics research in agriculture, and found feasibility
    for remote microbial studies of water, air, and soil. Traditional methods for
    metagenomics research necessitate a large amount of data transfer to the cloud.
    However, with the advent of advanced edge technologies, remote analyses can be
    performed, and the results can be sent to the cloud using a combination of System-on-a-Chip
    (SoC) and edge computing. A mix of edge and cloud provides a highly appealing
    approach to provide complete analysis workflows. The results of the experiments
    revealed a 95 percent reduction in data streaming, thereby demonstrating the feasibility
    of metagenomic research at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge solution
    is feasible. On the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain
    of metagenomics revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost
    and efficiency as the frequency of analyses increases [211]. Nonetheless, if AI
    and blockchain can be incorporated over IoT services, then the farmers and the
    stakeholders will obtain a better understanding of the crops along with a fast
    and easy way to characterize genetically modified crops [212]. In addition, with
    the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it will also be possible to determine
    whether the treated wastewater is suitable for irrigation at a given point in
    time and what are the relevant crops on which the treated wastewater can be used,
    depending upon its composition [212]. Table 4 summarizes previous researchers’
    edge computing techniques in their respective agricultural domains. Table 4. Usage
    of edge computing techniques in the domain of agriculture. 4. Challenges and Considerations
    for Farmers Advanced technologies which can provide economically competitive domain
    to farming sector along with financial viability whilst enhancing environmental
    efficiency and being socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of
    sustainability. However, given the availability of capital, meeting these sustainability
    targets would often entail trade-offs. Furthermore, the objectives are “moving
    goals” that must adapt to new problems and priorities. Technological advancements
    are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming sector remains incomplete.
    It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing nations that they tend
    to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than following
    a systematic way. This could have significant consequences for farm structure
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future. 4.1.
    Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology An initiative toward better
    farmer education and training along with the help of financial resources, non-government
    organizations, the media, and the general public can contribute to making sustainable
    farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws can be put forward by the government
    which may comprise incentives and disincentives for the adoption of the latest
    technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes, animal welfare guidelines,
    and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’ actions. In
    this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology which
    the farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous parameters
    comprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in different contexts,
    there is no adequate explanation for why farmers implement specific technologies.
    Therefore, it becomes necessary for the respective governments to furnish substantial
    knowledge and infrastructure to farmers to uplift their respective agriculture
    segments. 4.2. Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure It is important
    to determine which innovations are most effective in particular situations in
    respective agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate
    mechanism to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals
    for the benefit of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production
    in an environmentally friendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable
    technologies. To achieve these objectives, some goals need to be tweaked in agricultural
    activities by aligning interests with those goals. Additional perks can be allocated
    to the farmers who understand the benefits from technology and practice them.
    More follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation of innovations in order
    to ensure transparency in policy factor and research activities pertaining to
    the adoption of new technology in the agrisector. Post implementation evaluations
    of results will help to correct mistakes before too much money is pumped into
    the wrong segment. This is critical because agricultural innovations come from
    a variety of places. Rating technologies and predicting potential future patterns
    will aid policymakers in moving toward sustainable agriculture. A broader participatory
    approach involving a variety of stakeholders would promote the implementation
    of innovations for sustainable farming systems. Farmers along with consumer groups
    and the associated agricultural food industry who are inclined towards sustainable
    farming should be included as stakeholders. Since sustainable technologies are
    applied at the farm level, therefore the farmers must be involved in the technology
    adoption discussion. In an ideal world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership
    in the selection of technology in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’
    adoption of technology is influenced by the associated industries. However, the
    industrial segment should learn from the farmers’ requirements, which will help
    them to standardize the latest technology, which in turn will make a substantial
    impact on the farming sector. 4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth
    In countries where farming is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow
    crops by planting without understanding the properties of soil and its quality.
    As a result of this, in the long run, farmers will not benefit from the amount
    of money they will earn from their farming. The current soil testing process uses
    a manual method which first involves the sampling of soil and then the submission
    of samples to laboratories for analysis. Due to the lengthy and laborious process,
    this manual process is inefficient. Because of human interference, there is a
    risk of human error. As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate information.
    In that case, there is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop
    prediction. Soil testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding
    the fertility of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential
    crop yield. Therefore, a system could be proposed that consists of a handheld
    device which will provide a pH reading and will help estimate the quantity of
    nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in the soil. In addition, a classification
    algorithm can be developed to determine crops suitable for specific applications
    based on the data obtained from the system, and accordingly the appropriate fertilizers
    for the field can be provided. 4.4. Providing Meteorological Services to the Farmers
    Bringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision making has contributed
    to an increase in agricultural production in many countries. However, in developing
    countries where several small farms are rain-fed, it is difficult to get access
    to weather and climate information to help direct decision making. Government
    officials should consider this critical knowledge which is useful to farmers and
    others dealing with poverty and hunger. This situation continues because national
    meteorological and hydrological services in developing countries do not receive
    adequate funding to cover the expense of delivering these services to the farmers.
    The government lacks substantial information about the significant role of meteorological
    services which contribute to the socioeconomic development of the nation. This
    state of obliviousness prevails even though governments confront multiple challenging
    issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources management, health, and disaster
    risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected by weather and environment.
    Despite repeated periods of drought and crop failure, as well as occasional famines,
    flooding often leads to losses of human life and major property destruction. In
    addition, it also causes wide-ranging impacts on socioeconomic growth. Therefore,
    it is only with the advent of recent development that there has been substantial
    study into quantifying the benefits of weather and climate knowledge-related services.
    It is deemed necessary to take small steps by undertaking pilot projects to research
    the socioeconomic gains of using weather and climate information-related services
    in agriculture. 4.5. Yield Production The feasibility of smart farming relies
    on internet connectivity and a panel to accommodate the sensor hub. Using these
    features, it has become easier for the farmers to monitor the process of cultivation
    using their smart devices. With the aid of sensors and interconnectivity, the
    smart farming initiative helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water, pesticide,
    and fertilizers to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters
    such as soil condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system
    can be made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying
    systems, all of which can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide
    which variety of crop is compatible for cultivation with their respective farm.
    Accordingly, the farmers can opt for innovative technologies such as drone-based
    farming and various weather prediction tools, etc. Young agropreneurs involved
    in cultivation business can benefit from smart farming in terms of farm maintenance,
    irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The sensors in the smart
    farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including measurements
    pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump status,
    humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,
    the date it was cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT is
    seen as a prominent and promising factor in the agricultural domain which can
    boost the yield in a quick manner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm can
    also serve as an avenue for the startup companies to invest in. 4.6. Sustainable
    Land Use There have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify the
    effect of agricultural policies associated with land use sustainability; however,
    these studies turned out to be inconclusive. Although different opinions on the
    relationship between prices and soil deterioration derive from differences in
    discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is important to define these
    differences as this allows for better clarification when participating in discussions
    with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices on agricultural
    resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished: (i) expansion
    of the total agricultural area (extensification); (ii) rise in the number of agricultural
    inputs used, also known as intensification; (iii) change in technology; and (iv)
    change in crop choices. A differentiation is to be made among recurring costs
    that are capable of raising productivity and fixed asset investments that work
    to enhance soil quality in the long term. If greater agricultural production occurs
    as a result of increased area, impact on the environment in terms of deforestation,
    overgrazing, flooding, and sedimentation is a likely result. If there are changes
    in cropping activities at the same time as the expansion of the land area, then
    the new cropping activities will have an effect due to the soil quality that depends
    on the negative impacts of previous cropping activities on the resource. Therefore,
    it is unclear whether the interplay among agricultural policies, along with the
    supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable land use has been
    adequately explored. 5. Conclusions The scope of the current paper is to introduce
    and pave the way for smart sensing with edge computing technology in the developing
    nations, whose gross domestic product relies substantially on agriculture. In
    this regard, the applicability of various sensing technologies with an ease of
    edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart sensors offer intriguing
    possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing research in edge computing
    and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only in its initial stage. Nonetheless,
    prototypes of edge computing systems have already been developed by many researchers
    for specific agricultural domains; however, the interpretability of edge computing
    techniques with various sensing units still remains a challenge. There is a need
    to set up and deploy cost-effective high-performance computing-based edge nodes
    to enable smooth data flow operations for precision agriculture. Implementing
    these sophisticated and efficient edge technologies will solve these issues and
    in a broader perspective, this will open up a new segment for farmers in developing
    nations. In addition to this, a major problem to be dealt with in this context
    is inadequate internet connectivity, which is seen as a global issue and which
    affects the growth of developing and underdeveloped nations because not every
    region of the world has access to the internet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural
    domain in developing nations, a dedicated cost-effective infrastructure is required
    which can completely digitize the farming sector in the best possible way. Author

    Introduction Vegetation phenology, as the recording of seasonally recurring events
    (e.g., leaf emergence and senescence), has been long studied to characterize the
    ecosystem structures and functions (Lieth, 2013). The phenological dynamic of
    vegetation over the course of a year regulates the terrestrial gross primary productivity,
    biogeochemical cycling, and water-energy-carbon fluxes (Morisette et al., 2008,
    Peñuelas and Filella, 2001). It has been increasingly utilized in parameterizing
    climate models, hydrological models, and terrestrial biosphere models to improve
    the understanding of biosphere-atmosphere-hydrosphere interactions (Foley et al.,
    2000, MacBean et al., 2015, Richardson et al., 2012). This seasonal dynamic of
    vegetation is also a sensitive indicator of vegetation response to global climate
    and environmental changes (Kramer et al., 2000, Richardson et al., 2013). To understand
    the mechanisms driving the phenological process and its subsequent feedback to
    earth systems, tracking the vegetation growth along the phenological trajectory
    is essentially crucial. Among a range of terrestrial ecosystems, phenological
    monitoring in agriculture is particularly important. The growth and development
    stages of crops are closely associated with various management activities (e.g.,
    fertilizer and irrigation scheduling), and have considerable implications for
    yield estimation (Sakamoto et al., 2013, Walthall et al., 2013, Zhang and Zhang,
    2016). The crop requirement of resources (e.g., water and nutrient) varies along
    the phenological trajectory. Its response to climate change and environmental
    stress also differs (Brown et al., 2012, Gao et al., 2017). For instance, the
    silking stage of corn is particularly sensitive to drought stress, as drought
    may cause poor pollination and sterility of corn and a subsequent decrease in
    corn yield (Lauer, 2012). The setting pods stage of soybean is sensitive to environmental
    stress (e.g., moisture and high temperature) with regard to the yield reduction
    (Kilgore and Fjell, 1997). The crop phenological progress also constitutes a key
    component in crop simulation models for predicting the yields (Bolton and Friedl,
    2013, Jin et al., 2017, Lobell et al., 2015), and in operational crop mapping
    (Dong and Xiao, 2016, Gómez et al., 2016, Qin et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2017,
    Zhong et al., 2016). Large-scale monitoring of crop phenological development in
    a rapid, consistent, and repeated fashion is indispensably a critical step towards
    assessing the agricultural response to future climate change and increasingly
    growing population. The increasing availability of earth observation satellites,
    along with the technical advancements in remotely sensed imagery processing, has
    facilitated the remote tracking of phenological development of vegetation over
    wide geographical regions through time (Diao and Wang, 2016a, Diao and Wang, 2018,
    Liu et al., 2017, White et al., 1997). Time series of remotely sensed imagery
    acquired over the course of a year is employed to characterize the crop phenophases
    and to capture the critical phenological transition dates (e.g., onset, end, and
    length of growing season) (Boschetti et al., 2009, Gao et al., 2017, Manfron et
    al., 2017, Sakamoto et al., 2005, Wardlow et al., 2006). Over the past decade,
    a suite of curve-fitting based phenological methods have been developed, including
    double logistic methods, wavelet methods, harmonic methods, two-step filtering
    methods, asymmetric Gaussian methods, and high-order spline methods (Beck et al.,
    2006, Diao and Wang, 2014, Hermance et al., 2007, Jonsson and Eklundh, 2002, Moreira
    et al., 2019, Sakamoto et al., 2010, Sakamoto et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2003).
    With those phenological methods, the remotely sensed greenup onset of the growing
    season has been found to be closely associated with the ground-observed emergence
    stage of crops. The remotely retrieved dormancy onset has been indicated to be
    related to the field-observed harvest stage of crops (Gao et al., 2017, Wardlow
    et al., 2006). Despite the promising detection results, those phenological methods
    are typically parametric by assuming that the process of phenological development
    can be modeled by defined mathematical equations (e.g., logistic functions). They
    usually require year-long satellite observations for parameter training and optimization.
    Affected by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, the increasing
    agricultural diversification and intensification complicate the phenological signal
    captured by the satellites. The phenological process in those complex systems
    might not be adequately modeled by defined mathematical forms (Atkinson et al.,
    2012). Besides, the satellite observations may be contaminated by cloud and atmospheric
    aerosols to varying degrees, which can make the acquisition of year-long remotely
    sensed data challenging, particularly in tropical and high latitude regions. The
    recent advance in network science opens up new opportunities to model various
    complex systems (Barabási, 2009, Newman et al., 2011). Rooted in network theory,
    complex networks characterize the sophisticated relationships between constituents
    of systems with collections of nodes and edges, such as social networks, biological
    networks, and narrative networks (Brockmann and Helbing, 2013, Buldyrev et al.,
    2010, Eagle et al., 2009, Rubinov and Sporns, 2010, Watts and Strogatz, 1998).
    The nodes are defined as the objects of interest in complex systems, and the edges
    define the interactions between those objects. It provides an abstract representation
    of complex systems by capturing the fundamental structures and patterns (Newman,
    2010). Complex networks have been actively explored in a multitude of fields,
    ranging from biological to social sciences. The flexibility of defining the nodes
    and edges in complex networks provides a wealth of possibilities to understand
    the complicated phenomena, which may shed light on the aforementioned phenological
    challenges with remote sensing imagery. Yet complex networks have seldom been
    studied in remote sensing to represent the massive information contained by time
    series of satellite imagery. Its potential to model the complex remotely sensed
    phenological process, particularly in agricultural systems, is to be explored.
    The objective of this study is to estimate the crop phenological stages with partial
    satellite time series using a complex network-based phenological model (i.e.,
    “pheno-network”). The pheno-network model tracks the temporal changes of spectral
    reflectance of agricultural crops across the phenological development stages,
    with an innovative network-based representation. Specifically, this study is designed
    to capture the critical phenological transition dates when the agricultural crops
    shift from green leaf-dominating growth stages to the soil-dominating harvest
    stage along the leaf senescence trajectory, through uncovering the underlying
    structures of relationships of spectral reflectance across corresponding phenological
    stages. As a case study, the pheno-network model is applied to the partial time
    series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to remotely estimate
    the mature stage of corn and the dropping leaves stage of soybean in Illinois
    from 2002 to 2017. 2. Study site and data 2.1. Study site The study site is the
    state of Illinois in the Midwestern US, which covers an area of 150,000 km2. It
    is lying within the Central Plains, characterized by relatively flat topography.
    The climate in most of Illinois is humid continental, with hot humid summers and
    cold snowy winters. The average annual rainfall is over 48 in. in the southern
    Illinois, and around 35 in. in the north. Illinois is a major agricultural state
    in the US Corn Belt region, and ranks among the top in corn and soybean production.
    It is partitioned into nine agricultural statistics districts (ASDs) according
    to climate, geography, and cropping practices (Fig. 1). These nine ASDs are northwestern
    (NW), northeastern (NE), western (W), central (C), eastern (E), west southwestern
    (WSW), east southeastern (ESE), southwestern (SW), and southeastern (SE) districts.
    As two predominant crop types, corn and soybean are typically rotated in consecutive
    years. According to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural
    Statistics Service (NASS), there are six phenological development stages for corn
    and soybean, respectively. The phenological stages for corn are emerged, silking,
    dough, dent, mature, and harvest stages. The phenological stages for soybean are
    emerged, blooming, setting pods, turning yellow, dropping leaves, and harvest
    stages. Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download full-size

    Data 2.2.1. MODIS data and pre-processing The MODIS Nadir Bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data (MCD43A4, version 6), acquired
    from Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC), were used in
    this study to construct the pheno-network model. The MCD43A4 data are daily 16-day
    composite imagery, with a spatial resolution of 500 m. At each date, the surface
    reflectance is composited during a 16-day retrieval period (including its eight
    preceding days and seven following days) using all the imagery from both Terra
    and Aqua sensors. This composite imagery reduces the influence of atmospheric
    aerosols, illumination differences, and cloud contamination. To take into account
    solar and viewing geometries, the MCD43A4 data employ the bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (BRDF) correction algorithm to normalize the surface reflectance
    under a nadir view. Compared to other satellite-based observations, this high
    temporal resolution and BRDF-corrected imagery is more appropriate to construct
    the time series throughout the year to track the crop phenological progress. The
    MCD43A4 data covering the Illinois from 2002 to 2017 were acquired in this study.
    Seven bands (bands 1–7) that are characteristic of crop properties (e.g., chlorophyll
    content, water content, and leaf cell structure) were taken as the spectral reflectance
    in the pheno-network model. To further diminish the influence of atmospheric interference
    and noise, the MCD43A4 data were pre-processed with ancillary quality assurance
    layers. First, the MCD43A4 data were filtered using the snow/ice quality layer
    of the MODIS BRDF/Albedo Quality data (MCD43A2, version 6). As snow and ice may
    cause abnormal and outlying spectral reflectance values in the data, this quality
    assurance layer was used to filter out the pixels of each observation date that
    were subject to snow/ice contamination. Second, the MCD43A4 data were further
    pre-processed using the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data (MOD11A1, version
    6). Corn and soybean are typically harvested before the winter season. The daytime
    surface skin temperature layer of the MODIS LST data was employed to identify
    the winter period when snow might occur. For each acquisition date, the pixels
    with the daytime LST values lower than 5 °C were flagged as spurious spectral
    values (Zhang et al., 2006). Those invalid or missing observations, identified
    by quality assurance layers, were then replaced by the moving average of the surrounding
    closest good quality neighbors in the time series of the MCD43A4 data. After the
    pre-processing, only the downward period of the time series was retained for each
    pixel, as the pheno-network model was to be built with the partial-year data.
    The downward period denotes the temporal trajectory when the normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) of the pixel has a decreasing trend in the time series.
    The downward period is also taken as the leaf senescence trajectory of crops in
    this study. The pheno-network model was constructed in this downward period to
    estimate the critical phenological transition dates when the agricultural crops
    shift from green leaf-dominating growth stages to the soil-dominating harvest
    stage, namely the mature stage of corn and the dropping leaves stage of soybean.
    2.2.2. Reference data Two predominant crop types in Illinois are corn and soybean.
    According to Cropland Data Layer (CDL) in 2017, corn was grown in about 31% of
    the land in Illinois, and soybean was planted in 28% of Illinois. The CDL data
    are generated by USDA on an annual basis using the remotely sensed imagery to
    map the distribution and extent of major crop types in the US (Johnson and Mueller,
    2010). In Illinois, the remote sensing data for deriving CDL are mainly from the
    Landsat, the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) DEIMOS-1 and UK2, the Indian
    Space Research Organization (ISRO) ResourceSat-1 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS),
    ResourceSat-2 LISS-3, and the Sentinel-2 sensors. The CDL data are produced using
    the decision tree classifier or maximum likelihood classifier at a spatial resolution
    of 30 m (or 56 m), with high accuracy achieved for both corn and soybean classes
    in Illinois. The producer’s accuracies and user’s accuracies for both classes
    are higher than 90% for most of the years. In this study, the CDL data were resampled
    to the spatial resolution of the MCD43A4 data (i.e., 500 m) and the fractions
    of corn and soybean were calculated for each resampled pixel. At 500 m spatial
    resolution, the phenology recorded by satellites may be affected by the mixture
    of multiple land covers, and may not correspond to the phenology of any particular
    crop type. This mixed pixel effect complicates the tracking of crop phenological
    progress and the characterization of phenological transition dates (Diao and Wang,
    2016b, Peng et al., 2017). Hence, only the pixels with the fractions of corn or
    soybean greater than 90% in each agricultural statistics district were selected
    for constructing the pheno-network model and conducting the subsequent phenological
    analysis. To date, the best available field-based crop progress and condition
    information at regional to state scales are Crop Progress Reports (CPRs), released
    by NASS, USDA. The CPRs record the percentage of major crops achieving a specific
    phenological development stage (e.g., mature stage of corn or dropping leaves
    stage of soybean), and are updated weekly by state NASS offices during the growing
    season from early April to late November (reports are available at https://www.nass.usda.gov/).
    Weekly CPRs are among the most popular and requested reports published by NASS,
    and have significant impacts on farming practices and agricultural market prices
    (Lehecka, 2014). About 4000 trained reporters across states conduct ground-level
    field observations of crop progress by following NASS standard definitions. These
    ground survey observations are aggregated and summarized to the ASD- or state-level
    to be reported in CPRs. ASD- or state-level reports provide a general summary
    of crop phenological development across multiple counties, and will serve as the
    ground reference data to evaluate the remotely sensed phenological retrieval results
    from the pheno-network model. 3. Methods 3.1. Pheno-network model The pheno-network
    model is a newly developed framework for representing the time series of a pixel
    using complex networks. In the pheno-network model, the spectral reflectance obtained
    on each date of the time series is considered as a node, namely a spectral node.
    These nodes are further connected together according to their relationships, referred
    to as edges. The collection of nodes and edges constitutes a pheno-network. By
    formalizing the edges in different ways, the pheno-network model can be utilized
    to represent different behaviors of the satellite time series. As the study focuses
    on estimating the critical phenological transition dates of crops in a satellite
    time series, two criteria are designed to construct the pheno-network. First,
    the edges are formalized according to the spectral similarity between the spectral
    nodes. The similarity between a pair of spectral nodes A and B is measured as
    the cosine distance between them: (1) Here, A and B are vectors representing spectral
    reflectance of the nodes, and Distance(A,B) is the cosine distance between A and
    B. and are the norms of the vectors A and B, respectively. A short cosine distance
    implies that the two nodes share similar spectral reflectance. The cosine distance
    compares the similarity between the orientations of the vectors of spectral reflectance.
    It does not take into account the magnitudes of the vectors, and hence diminishes
    the influence of illumination and albedo differences on spectral reflectance.
    Second, a “tolerance value” (d0) is employed as a constraint to filter out connections
    between spectral nodes that share little similarity. In this way, the pheno-network
    only retains the edges with a cosine distance lower than the tolerance value.
    The tolerance value serves as a control parameter to adjust the level of temporal
    constraint embedded in the pheno-network model. As the change of crop phenology
    is a gradual process, the spectral nodes obtained on nearby dates are more likely
    to share similar spectral reflectance with shorter cosine distances. The spectral
    nodes at different phenological stages tend to be more distinct with longer cosine
    distances. With a sufficiently high tolerance value, the resulting pheno-network
    will become a fully connected network, meaning that every pair of spectral nodes
    are directly connected by edges. There is no temporal constraint on such pheno-network.
    In contrast, selecting a low tolerance value is equivalent to setting a strict
    temporal constraint on the pheno-network. This will result in a sparse network,
    where only spectral nodes representing nearby dates are directly connected. With
    different tolerance values, the pheno-network can model different temporal dynamic
    processes of crop phenology. Unlike conventional curve-fitting based phenological
    methods, where the time constraint is explicit, the pheno-network model implicitly
    embeds the time constraint into the tolerance value. That gives the model more
    flexibility to track various levels of crop phenological dynamics, as well as
    higher tolerances to missing and abnormal data in the satellite time series. The
    pheno-network model typically needs to explore a range of tolerance values in
    order to identify the most appropriate one for estimating the phenological transition
    dates of crops. First, the candidate edges between all possible pairs of spectral
    nodes are created and sorted based on their cosine distances. Second, we locate
    the 5th, 10th, 15th, …, 95th percentiles of the sorted candidate edges, and select
    the corresponding cosine distances as the tolerance values. For example, when
    d0 is set to the 5th percentile, the 5% of candidate edges with the smallest cosine
    distances are selected to construct the pheno-network. Each tolerance value will
    yield a single pheno-network. Network measures are calculated for each network
    to estimate the transition dates. The results are then compared between different
    networks to determine the most appropriate date. 3.2. Network measures of crop
    phenological transition dates To detect the phenological transition period of
    crops, the pheno-network model needs to capture the spectral nodes that can represent
    the transition period using their network characteristics. The spectral reflectance
    of crops usually changes gradually before and after the phenological transition
    period, and dramatically during the transition period. In the network representation,
    those spectral nodes representing the dates before the transition period share
    comparable spectral reflectance and are inclined to form a densely linked group
    among themselves, referred to as the “pre-transition group”. Similarly, those
    spectral nodes corresponding to the dates after the transition period would tend
    to form the “post-transition group”. Due to the drastic change in spectral reflectance
    during the transition period, the two groups would have entirely different spectral
    reflectance and appear to be far apart in the network with few direct connections.
    Those spectral nodes representing the dates during the transition period would
    be linked to both the pre- and post-transition groups, and serve as a bridge standing
    between them. We refer those nodes as the “transition group”. Among the three
    groups, the edges would be dense within the pre- and post-transition groups, as
    the change of spectral reflectance is gradual within these two periods, but sparse
    within the transition group because of the drastic change of spectral reflectance
    during this period. An example of a pheno-network with these three node groups
    is shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (189KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Pheno-network with three groups, namely the pre-transition,
    transition, and post-transition groups. As a whole, the transition group would
    consist of spectral nodes that serve as the hub connecting the nodes across all
    three crop phenological stages in the pheno-network. These nodes are also connected
    by relatively sparse edges between them. By virtue of the unique network-based
    representation, an innovative network measure, called “bridging coefficient”,
    is designed in the pheno-network model to identify spectral nodes possessing these
    characteristics. For a node i, its bridging coefficient, noted as bci, is the
    ratio of its betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient: (2) Here, bi and
    ci are the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient values of node i,
    respectively. Some pairs of nodes in a network are directly connected by an edge,
    while others need to be linked by a chain of edges, called “paths”. In path-based
    connections, there may be multiple paths connecting a pair of nodes, and each
    of the paths may comprise different number of edges. Among these paths, the one
    with the lowest number of edges is taken as the shortest path between the pair
    of nodes. The betweenness centrality of node i is calculated as the fraction of
    all shortest paths between all pairs of nodes that pass through node i (Freeman,
    1978): (3) Here, is the total number of shortest paths between a pair of nodes
    s and t, and is the number of these paths that go through node i. A node with
    a high betweenness centrality value has a large fraction of shortest paths passing
    through it and plays an important role in linking other nodes together in the
    network. For example, a network of airports consists of all airports as nodes
    and flights between airports as edges. The O’Hare international airport in Chicago,
    IL is one of the nodes with high betweenness centrality values, as it serves as
    a regional hub for a large number of airports in the Midwestern United States
    (Jia et al., 2014). As for the pheno-network case, all paths connecting the pre-
    and post-transition groups need to pass through the spectral nodes in the transition
    group. These nodes would have high betweenness centrality values in the network
    representation. Despite the importance of betweenness centrality in identifying
    the nodes in the transition group, we find that the irregular or abnormal spectral
    nodes, caused by atmospheric interference and noise, might have comparable betweenness
    centrality values. To reduce the effects of those spectral nodes, another network
    measure, namely clustering coefficient, is taken into account. The clustering
    coefficient of a node is measured as the total number of edges between its neighbors
    divided by the maximum number of edges that potentially exist between the neighbors
    (Watts and Strogatz, 1998): (4) Here, nodes j and k are any two neighbors of node
    i, and ejk is the edge between these two nodes, and ki is the total number of
    neighbors of node i. The clustering coefficient measures the extent to which neighbors
    of a node cluster together, and tends to be low for the nodes with sparse edges
    in the pheno-network. Due to the rapid change of spectral reflectance during the
    transition period, the neighbors of the nodes in the transition group are inclined
    to be sparsely connected to each other. As discussed above, the spectral nodes
    in the transition group would have high betweenness centrality and relatively
    low clustering coefficient values, which gives rise to high bridging coefficient
    values. With this network measure, the pheno-network model is to capture those
    spectral nodes that are characteristic of the crop phenological transition period.
    The compositing process of the MCD43A4 data, along with its pre-processing via
    quality assurance layers, is utilized to filter out the abnormal and outlying
    spectral reflectance in this study. To further reduce the influence of potential
    abnormal (or outlying) spectral nodes on the network-derived measures, a moving
    window is applied to calculate the average bridging coefficient for each observation
    date to smooth out fluctuations. For example, a seven-day moving window of an
    observation date includes its three preceding days and three succeeding days.
    After experimenting a range of moving window sizes (i.e., one to ten days), the
    seven-day moving window was found to be the best tradeoff among spectral smoothness,
    spectral representations of nodes, and duration of crop phenological transition
    periods. Hence, the average bridging coefficient within a seven-day moving window
    of each observation day is calculated as its moving average bridging coefficient.
    Since there is no clear boundary of the crop phenological transition period, we
    focus on estimating the most critical phenological transition date, namely the
    date with the highest moving average bridging coefficient value. As discussed
    in Section 3.1, this study explores a range of tolerance values, each of which
    yields a unique pheno-network (Fig. 3). For a given network, the moving average
    bridging coefficient will be calculated for all spectral nodes. The spectral node
    with the highest value and the corresponding date will be identified. We will
    then compare all identified nodes among all pheno-networks and select the spectral
    node with the highest moving average bridging coefficient as the critical crop
    phenological transition date. Download : Download high-res image (280KB) Download

    With the moving average bridging coefficient measure of the pheno-network model,
    the phenological transition dates for the downward period of a pixel can be estimated.
    For all the corn and soybean pixels considered in Illinois, the transition dates
    are calculated through the pheno-network model for all the monitoring years (2002–2017).
    The retrieved phenological transition dates are compared to the field-based observations
    of crop phenological progress in CPRs at ASD levels. For each ASD, the cumulative
    percentages of the retrieved transition dates over time are calculated for both
    corn and soybean. The derived cumulative percentages are then compared to the
    percentage of crops going into specific phenological development stages in CPRs.
    For instance, the cumulative percentage of the retrieved transition dates of corn
    during the downward period is compared to the percentage of corn entering the
    dough, dent, mature, and harvest stages, respectively. The comparisons are expected
    to unveil how pheno-network retrieved phenology aligns with field-based phenological
    observations. For the crop phenological stage most closely relevant to the pheno-network
    retrieved result, the median date of crop achieving that stage is compared to
    that of the corresponding transition dates using root mean square error (RMSE)
    and R square. The performance of the pheno-network model is further compared to
    that of a parametric curve-fitting based phenological method. As one of the most
    widely used phenological curve-fitting methods, the double logistic method is
    utilized in this study to retrieve the phenological transition dates of crops
    using year-long satellite observations (Zhang et al., 2003). It assumes that the
    phenological trajectory of crop development can be modeled using the logistic
    functions, and fits the logistic curve to the NDVI observations over the course
    of a year. The rate of change in the curvature of the fitted curve is then employed
    to retrieve the crop phenological transition dates. It estimates the transition
    dates by capturing the local extremes (e.g., minimum or maximum) in the rate of
    change in the curve curvature. For all the corn and soybean pixels in Illinois
    throughout 2002–2017, the transition dates of the onset of dormancy are calculated
    using the curve-fitting based method, and compared to those from the pheno-network
    model using the ground reference data. The conventional curve-fitting based phenological
    methods typically require year-long satellite observations to estimate the phenological
    transition dates. In contrast, the pheno-network model can be constructed with
    partial-year remote sensing data (e.g., pheno-network model for the downward period).
    The size of the temporal window defines the maximum number of spectral nodes considered
    in the model. In this study, the role of the size of the temporal window in estimating
    phenological transition dates is evaluated through sensitivity analysis. Specifically,
    a multitude of temporal segment windows for the downward period of corn and soybean
    are tested for phenological estimates. The size of temporal segment windows for
    constructing the pheno-network model varies from 140 days (day of year [DOY] 191–330)
    to 20 days (DOY 251–270), with an increment of 10 days. Each time the change of
    the temporal window size is via 5 days deduction from both ends of the window,
    with reference to field-observed crop phenological progress. For example, when
    the size of the temporal window reduces from 140 days to 130 days, the window
    changes from DOY 191–330 to DOY 196–325. This way in changing the temporal window
    size would ensure that the critical phenological transition periods could be included
    in most of testing windows. For each temporal segment window, the median date
    of the estimated transition dates is compared to that of the corresponding field-observed
    phenological stage using RMSE and R square. 4. Results By defining the nodes of
    spectral reflectance and edges of spectral similarities between the nodes, the
    pheno-network model characterizes the structure of temporal dynamics of remotely
    sensed spectral reflectance along the phenological trajectory. It provides a network-based
    representation of the crop phenological process. In this study, the pheno-network
    model was constructed for each corn or soybean pixel of Illinois during the downward
    period of a year. With a corn pixel in 2006 as an example, the network representation
    of its downward phenological progress was shown in Fig. 4a. Three node groups,
    namely the pre-transition, transition, and post-transition groups, could be roughly
    identified in this pheno-network. The colors of the nodes denoted the values of
    the moving average bridging coefficients, with an orange tone indicating a high
    moving average value, a yellow tone denoting a value in the middle, and a blue
    tone suggesting a low value. Compared to the ones in pre- and post-transition
    groups, the spectral nodes in the transition group had higher moving average bridging
    coefficient values. In Fig. 4a, the nodes in the transition group served as the
    bridging hub connecting the nodes across groups, and exerted a critical role in
    controlling the temporal phenological dynamics of spectral reflectance. The neighbors
    of those nodes were sparsely connected between themselves. Through integrating
    the betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient, the bridging coefficient
    measure was characteristic of the distinct network structure during the transition
    period of crop phenology. The high moving average bridging coefficient values
    of those transition nodes indicated that this network measure could be utilized
    to capture the node representing the critical phenological transition date of
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (178KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Network measures of crop phenology to estimate the critical phenological
    transition date. During the downward period (DOY 191–330) of the pixel, the one-day
    bridging coefficient (i.e., without moving average) and seven-day moving average
    bridging coefficient of each observation date were shown in Fig. 4b. Compared
    to the one-day network measure, the moving average bridging coefficient exhibited
    much smoother and clearer temporal patterns of spectral nodes. Specifically, the
    spectral nodes around DOY 255–265 achieved high moving average bridging coefficient
    values, with the highest one at DOY 260 representing the critical phenological
    transition date. These nodes were colored in orange in the pheno-network, demonstrating
    their transitional roles in representing the crop phenological progress (Fig.
    4a). The fluctuations of the one-day bridging coefficient values, including relatively
    high values at DOY 241 and 272, were smoothed out in the seven-day measures. Thus
    the moving average bridging coefficient could further reduce the outlying and
    abnormal spectral reflectance in the satellite time series caused by atmospheric
    interferences. With the pheno-network model, the phenological transition dates
    during the downward period were estimated for all relatively pure corn and soybean
    pixels in Illinois. The cumulative percentages of the transition dates were calculated
    and summarized according to ASDs from 2002 to 2017. For corn, this cumulative
    percentage of the transition dates was compared to the ground reference cumulative
    percentage of corn going through the dough, dent, mature, and harvest stages,
    respectively (Fig. 5, with 2006 as an example). In light of the ground survey
    data, corn entering the dough stage varied from location to location in 2006,
    with the earliest around DOY 183 and the latest around DOY 239. Across the ASDs,
    the median date of the dough stage of corn in the southern districts was around
    8 days earlier than that of the central districts, which was on average 7 days
    before that in the northern districts. Following the dough stage, corn went into
    the dent stage from DOY 225 to 253, then to the mature stage from DOY 246 to 281,
    and finally to the harvest stage from DOY 260 to 316. The cumulative percentage
    of the transition dates estimated through the pheno-network model ranged from
    DOY 241 to 276, and was found to align well with that of the mature stage of corn
    (Fig. 5). In 2006, the median ground observation date of corn entering the mature
    stage throughout Illinois was DOY 256, which was the same as the median transition
    date (i.e., DOY 256) estimated using the pheno-network model. Download : Download

    phenological transition dates was also calculated for soybean, which was compared
    to the ground reference cumulative percentage of soybean entering the setting
    pods, turning yellow, dropping leaves, and harvest stages, respectively (Fig.
    6, with 2006 as an example). According to the ground reference data, soybean started
    to set pods during the reproductive stages from DOY 190 to 239 throughout Illinois.
    Following the setting pods stage, the leaves of soybean turned yellow around DOY
    246 to 267, and typically started to drop one week after. Similar to corn, soybean
    also exhibited spatial variation in phenological development across agricultural
    districts. Affected by a combination of climate factors and management strategies,
    the median date of the dropping leaves stage of soybean in the southern districts
    was about one week behind that in the central and northern districts. Subsequently,
    the soybean was harvested, with the date varying from DOY 274 to 316. The cumulative
    percentage of the derived transition dates was compared to those four phenological
    development stages of soybean, and was found to be more correlated with that of
    the dropping leaves stage of soybean (Fig. 6). Throughout Illinois, the median
    date of soybean (i.e., DOY 264) going into this phenological stage in terms of
    ground observations was one day different from that of the pheno-network derived
    estimate (i.e., DOY 263) in 2006. Download : Download high-res image (433KB) Download

    percentage of corn achieving the mature phenological stage was depicted as the
    solid line in Fig. 7. In most of the monitoring years, the phenological pattern
    of the ground-observed mature stage throughout Illinois could be approximated
    by that of pheno-network derived measures. These two cumulative curves aligned
    with each other well. Due to the weekly observation interval for ground crop phenology
    and the missing data issue in CPRs, we further evaluated the alignment by focusing
    on calculating the difference between the median date of corn in the mature stage
    and the median of the estimated transition dates (Table 1). During 2002 to 2017,
    the absolute difference of median dates varied from 0 to 10 days, with an average
    of 4.5 days. These comparisons indicated that the retrieved phenological transition
    date was characteristic of the mature stage of corn. At this phenological stage,
    corn is about ready to harvest with shucks opening. The foliage of corn turns
    yellow, with no green color tone remaining. The spectral reflectance of corn is
    different from that in the preceding growth stages (e.g., dough and dent stages)
    and from that in the succeeding stages (e.g., harvest). It serves as the transition
    from green leaf-dominating spectral reflectance to soil-dominating harvest reflectance.

    265 263 266 262 The moving average bridging coefficient was calculated for each
    spectral node in the pheno-network. The phenological transition date, identified
    by the maximum moving average bridging coefficient value, indicated that the spectral
    node on that date was a connecting hub linking all the spectral reflectance across
    the crop growth stages. As the bridging coefficient was a synthesized measure
    of betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient, the neighbors of the identified
    spectral node tended to be loosely connected between themselves because of the
    rapid change of spectral reflectance during the transition period. The spectral
    node at the phenological transition date had significant controls on the spectral
    dynamic changes along the crop leaf senescence trajectory. Characterized by a
    combination of changing leaf color, leaf water content, and leaf cell structure,
    the nodes at the mature stage of corn in the pheno-network are spectrally distinct,
    yet serve as the transitional bridge connecting the nodes from the leaf-on dough
    (or dent) stage to the leaf-off harvest stage. The unique network structure formulated
    according to spectral similarities is characteristic of the complex phenological
    process, and the network measures can be employed to estimate transition dates
    with critical phenological implications. This mature stage of corn has not been
    adequately captured in previous remotely sensed phenological studies (but see
    Sakamoto (2018) for phenological estimates with prior information), yet can be
    represented by the pheno-network model. The phenological transition dates of soybean
    retrieved by the pheno-network model at the state level were summarized in Fig.
    8. From 2002 to 2017, the cumulative percentage of remotely sensed transition
    dates throughout Illinois was compared to that of soybean going into the dropping
    leaves phenological stage on ground. As shown in Fig. 8, this remotely sensed
    cumulative estimation result aligned well with the ground-based phenological observations
    in most years. The phenological pattern of the dropping leaves stage of soybean
    throughout Illinois was closely correlated with that of the pheno-network retrieved
    measures. The median of the estimated transition dates ranged from DOY 251 to
    275 across the years (Table 1). Comparably, the median date of soybean entering
    the dropping leaves stage from CPRs varied from DOY 256 to 273. The absolute difference
    of median dates varied from 1 to 10 days, with an average of 4.4 days. The comparisons
    revealed that the dropping leaves phenological stage of soybean could be remotely
    retrieved by the pheno-network model with satellite time series. At this growing
    stage, the leaves of soybean are 30–50% yellow and the leaves near the bottom
    part start dropping. Similar to the mature stage of corn, the spectral reflectance
    of soybean at the dropping leaves stage (e.g., leaves changing to a yellowish
    tone with decreasing water content) exerts a critical transitional role in connecting
    the spectral reflectance across the phenological stages in the pheno-network.
    It serves as the transitional bridge from the green leaf-dominating growth stages
    (e.g., setting pods and turning yellow) to the soil-dominating harvest phenological
    stage. Therefore, the temporal dynamic changes of spectral reflectance of both
    corn and soybean along the phenological trajectory can be represented via network
    structures. The critical phenological transition dates can then be estimated through
    the corresponding network measures. To further evaluate how remotely retrieved
    phenological transition dates reconcile with ground-based phenological observations,
    the median dates retrieved by the pheno-network model and by the curve-fitting
    based method were compared at the ASD level using R square and RMSE (Fig. 9).
    For each ASD, the median of pheno-network retrieved (or curve-fitting retrieved)
    transition dates for every year (horizontal axis in Fig. 9) was plotted against
    the median date of crop achieving the most relevant growth stage, namely the mature
    stage of corn or dropping leaves stage of soybean (vertical axis in Fig. 9). The
    one-to-one line in Fig. 9 denoted that remotely retrieved and ground observed
    median measures matched each other exactly. As for corn, most of these comparison
    pairs by the pheno-network model were distributed along the one-to-one line, with
    the R square being 0.55 and the RMSE being 7.77 days. It indicated that about
    55% percent of variability in the median dates of ground-observed mature stage
    of corn could be explained by the pheno-network based measures. The average of
    the difference between the network- and ground-based maturity measures was around
    7 days. Given the weekly observation frequency of CPRs and the compositing process
    in the daily 16-day MODIS data, the 7-day difference should be adequate for demonstrating
    the capabilities of the devised pheno-network model in retrieving critical crop
    growth transition dates, particularly for large-scale repetitive estimation. As
    for the curve-fitting based method, most of these comparison pairs were distributed
    below the one-to-one line, with the R square being 0.56 and the RMSE being 26.8 days.
    It indicated that the median transition dates estimated by the curve-fitting method
    were about 3–4 weeks later than the median dates of ground-observed mature stage
    of corn. Thus this critical phenological stage of corn might not be appropriately
    represented by the curve-fitting retrieved phenological measures. Download : Download

    comparison pairs by the pheno-network model at the ASD level were also distributed
    along the one-to-one line (Fig. 9). The R square value was 0.55 and the RMSE value
    was 5.05 days. About 55% percent of variability in the median dates of field-based
    dropping leaves stage of soybean was explained by the median of estimated transition
    dates. The average of the difference between the network- and ground-based phenological
    measures was about 5 days. In Fig. 9, the comparison pairs for soybean were mostly
    distributed within the temporal window DOY 250 to 280 across ASDs throughout the
    years, while the comparison pairs for corn were distributed in a wider temporal
    range DOY 230 to 285. It indicated that, compared to the dropping leaves stage
    of soybean, there was higher spatial and inter-annual variability in the mature
    stage of corn throughout Illinois. Though the further comparative analysis was
    beyond the scope of this study, the comparable and relatively high R square values
    suggested that the spatio-temporal variability in the ground phenological observations
    could be captured by the pheno-network derived measures. With respect to the curve-fitting
    based method, most of the comparison pairs were below the one-to-one line, with
    the R square being 0.5 and the RMSE being 22.36 days. Comparable to corn, the
    median transition dates estimated by the curve-fitting method were noticeably
    later than the median dates of ground-observed dropping leaves stage of soybean.
    The curve-fitting derived phenological measures of soybean were about 2–3 weeks
    after its dropping leaves stage. As the turning yellow stage and dropping leaves
    stage of soybean were closely related and typically one week apart (e.g., Fig.
    6), we further evaluated the alignment between the median date of soybean going
    into the turning yellow stage and that of the pheno-network estimated transition
    dates (Fig. 10). As shown in Fig. 10, the comparison pairs shifted away from the
    one-to-one line, with the RMSE value increasing to 10.59 days and R square value
    decreasing to 0.47. Despite the amount of variability in this turning yellow stage
    explained by the pheno-network measures, the increasing difference between these
    two measures and the deviation from the one-to-one line suggested that the estimated
    transition dates might not be directly indicative of the turning yellow stage
    of soybean. In general, these quantitative measures conducted at the ASD level
    implied that the transition dates estimated by the pheno-network model had remarkable
    phenological implications. The critical phenological stages (i.e., the mature
    stage of corn and the dropping leaves stage of soybean), which may not be adequately
    captured with conventional phenological models, can be retrieved via innovative
    network structures. Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download : Download

    One significant challenge in conventional phenological models is the requirement
    of year-long satellite observations for model building. In contrast, the pheno-network
    model can be constructed with partial-year remote sensing data. A sensitivity
    analysis was conducted in this study to evaluate the influence of the temporal
    window size on the retrieved phenological transition dates. With reference to
    field crop phenological stages, the size of the temporal window for constructing
    the pheno-network model changed from 140 days (DOY 191–330) to 20 days (DOY 251–270),
    with an increment of 10 days. With respect to each temporal window, the median
    date of the estimated transition dates was compared to that of the corresponding
    ground-observed phenological stage at the ASD level using R square and RMSE (Fig.
    11). Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 11. The R square and RMSE values of the pheno-network retrieved results
    with varying temporal window sizes. With the increasing size of the temporal window,
    the R square value for corn rose from 0.15 to 0.61 and the RMSE value decreased
    from about 10 to 7 days. When the size of the temporal window increased to 80 days,
    the R square value achieved 0.5, along with the RMSE value decreasing to around
    8 days. Hence, the pheno-network model showed great potential in estimating the
    mature stage of corn within a limited temporal observation period. Compared to
    corn, the R square and RMSE values of soybean changed even more drastically with
    the increment of the temporal window size. The R square value approached 0.5 and
    the RMSE value decreased to around 5.5 days with a temporal window size of 40 days.
    This more rapid increase of R square values and decrease of RMSE values may be
    attributable to two factors. First, soybean typically has a shorter growing season
    than corn. The transition date for soybean is more inclined to be identified than
    that for corn given a limited temporal window. Second, the dropping leaves stage
    of soybean exhibits lower spatial and inter-annual variability across ASDs, compared
    to the mature stage of corn (Fig. 9). The sensitivity analysis revealed that the
    pheno-network model could be built with partial-year satellite observations. The
    network structure for identifying the phenological transition dates was relatively
    robust to the change of the number of spectral nodes arising from the changing
    temporal window size. 5. Discussion In recent years, complex networks have been
    increasingly utilized in a variety of disciplines, ranging from social science
    to biological science, to investigate the associations and relationships between
    the constituents of complex systems. The network representation is designed to
    capture the most fundamental structure and pattern of key components in a system.
    The flexibility of defining the nodes and edges in complex networks opens up unique
    opportunities to understand and characterize collective behaviors of inter-connected
    components in complex systems. This continuously flourishing network representation
    has nurtured breakthrough discoveries and insights in a wealth of fields, yet
    it has seldom been explored in time series remote sensing. The potential of complex
    networks in representing the complex crop phenological progress with satellite
    time series was hence investigated in this study. The pheno-network model provides
    an innovative phenological representation of crop through modeling the temporal
    dynamics of its spectral reflectance along the leaf senescence trajectory. This
    network representation characterizes the structure of relationships between the
    spectral reflectance to estimate the critical phenological transition dates. In
    the pheno-network, the nodes are defined as the spectral reflectance of crops
    on each observation date, and the edges are defined according to the spectral
    similarities between the nodes. The tolerance value controls the structure of
    the entire network. The moving average bridging coefficient is devised as the
    network measure to capture the spectral nodes that serve as the transitional bridge
    in linking the spectral reflectance across the phenological stages. By integrating
    betweenness centrality and clustering coefficient, this synthesized measure weights
    the neighborhood connection effects to identify the spectral nodes as the connecting
    hub in the network. This new phenological representation was able to estimate
    the crop phenological transition dates in Illinois, particularly the mature stage
    of corn and the dropping leaves stage of soybean, with high accuracy achieved.
    At the ASD level, the R square values for both corn and soybean are 0.55. The
    RMSE values for corn and soybean are 7.77 and 5.05 days, respectively. The pheno-network
    model shows marked potential to extract crucial crop phenological characteristics,
    complementary to the conventional phenological methods. Compared to conventional
    curve-fitting based phenological methods, the pheno-network model maintains several
    distinct characteristics and potential advantages. First, the pheno-network model
    does not assume that crop phenological processes follow specific mathematical
    functions. Without limiting the phenological processes to defined mathematical
    forms, this non-parametric model may be more adequate to characterize the complex
    crop phenological trajectory, particularly in diversified and intensified agricultural
    systems. Second, the pheno-network model can be constructed with partial-year
    remote sensing data. Unlike the conventional curve-fitting based phenological
    methods, the pheno-network does not require the year-long data for model building.
    The sensitivity analysis conducted in this study indicates that the pheno-network
    model can be built within a limited temporal observation period (e.g., 80 days
    for corn). The pheno-network model is relatively robust to the change of the temporal
    window size for estimating critical phenological transition dates. Third, the
    pheno-network model tracks the collective change of spectral reflectance for phenological
    estimation. Remotely sensed crop phenology is typically monitored using the time
    series of vegetation index (e.g., NDVI, enhanced vegetation index [EVI], and wide
    dynamic range vegetation index [WDRVI]). As vegetation indices are developed for
    characterizing specific vegetation properties, the adoption of different vegetation
    indices may yield different or even conflicting phenological estimation results
    (Tornos et al., 2015). Tracking the collective change of spectral reflectance
    along the phenological trajectory may be an alternative solution, given the vegetation
    properties (e.g., chlorophyll content, water content, and leaf cell structure)
    can be characterized by a multitude of spectral wavelengths. Therefore, with these
    unique characteristics, the pheno-network model provides an innovative perspective
    in representing the crop phenological process. In this study, the retrieved phenological
    estimates, in alignment with ground phenological observations, also indicate that
    the pheno-network model shows great promise in monitoring the crop growth progress
    and understanding its subsequent response to climate and environmental changes.
    Along the leaf senescence trajectory, the estimated critical phenological transition
    periods via the pheno-network model are the mature stage for corn and the dropping
    leaves stage for soybean. Corn and soybean share comparable traits during their
    respectively detected stages. Their leaves change to yellowish tones, with drastic
    chlorophyll and water content change. Corn is about to harvest within 2–4 weeks
    and soybean is about to harvest within 2–3 weeks. Hence, accurate estimation of
    those phenophases are imperatively crucial for operational harvest preparation
    and scheduling to reduce pre-harvest loss. The crop growth conditions at those
    phenophases are important for crop management and yield estimation. Remotely sensed
    retrieval of crop growth stages may further shed light on the crop phenological
    responses to climate change and environmental stress, as well as the changing
    farm management practices and strategies (e.g., development of new crop genotypes)
    (Kucharik, 2006). Yet those critical phenophases have not been adequately captured
    by previous studies. With the curve-fitting (i.e. double logistic) based phenological
    method, Gao et al. (2017) retrieved the dormancy dates for both corn and soybean
    in central Iowa using satellite time series. The dormancy date retrieved for corn
    was found to be between its mature and harvest stages. The retrieved dormancy
    date for soybean was between the dropping leaves and harvest stages. Given the
    phenological implications of those growing stages, it would be desired to have
    more accurate retrieval results from remote sensing. Validating the remotely sensed
    phenology with ground-based observations remains one of the most significant challenges
    in phenological studies. The ground-based phenological measure of individual crop
    may not match with that of 500 m spatial coverage of an individual pixel in the
    MODIS imagery. Besides, the field observation locations of crop phenology are
    proprietary and not available to the public in CPRs. Only the aggregated phenological
    observations at the ASD- or state-levels are released by NASS. At the ASD level,
    the good alignment between ground-based and remotely sensed crop phenology in
    this study demonstrates the potential of the proposed pheno-network model in estimating
    critical crop phenological transition dates. Despite being the most comprehensive
    dataset throughout Illinois, the ASD- or state-level phenological aggregates and
    the CDL-based MODIS aggregates may bring some uncertainties to the evaluation
    results. The recent initiative in near-surface remote sensing (e.g., unmanned
    aerial vehicle and phenocam) may provide solutions to collect geo-referenced ground
    phenological observations of crops in a more systematic and objective fashion,
    which may facilitate the pixel-based phenological evaluation and reduce the uncertainties
    arising from the ASD-level comparisons (Richardson et al., 2018). It would be
    conducive to explore those near-surface remote sensing techniques in future studies.
    Remote monitoring of crop phenological progress at 500 m spatial resolution benefits
    the large-scale crop management and yield estimation. The pixel-based phenological
    estimates, beyond the ASD-level, provide farmers substantial information at finer
    spatial granularity to advance crop and farm management strategies that can ultimately
    alleviate environmental stresses in crops and improve crop productivity (Wu et
    al., 2013, Zhou et al., 2017). With its daily 16-day compositing and BRDF-corrected
    properties, the MCD43A4 data is a desired candidate for conducting the repetitive
    phenological monitoring over wide geographical regions through time. Despite its
    high temporal revisit frequency, its coarse spatial resolution (i.e., 500 m) may
    make it inadequate for capturing field-level crop phenological dynamics, particularly
    in smallholder agricultural systems. Under those circumstances, it may be conducive
    to build the satellite time series by synthesizing the higher spatial resolution
    imagery (e.g., Landsat and Sentinel-2) with the MODIS imagery using data fusion
    algorithms (Feng et al., 2006). With both higher spatial and temporal resolutions
    (e.g., daily imagery at 30 m spatial resolution), the fused imagery may help retrieve
    more comprehensive phenological information to further benefit the smallholder
    agricultural systems. 6. Conclusions In this study, we estimated the critical
    phenological transition dates of crops via an innovative pheno-network model.
    Rooted in network theory, this model characterizes the complex phenological process
    with spectrally defined nodes and edges. It provides a network representation
    to model the temporal dynamics of spectral reflectance of crops along the phenological
    trajectory. With the moving average bridging coefficient measure, the pheno-network
    model attempts to capture the spectral nodes that serve as the transitional bridge
    linking the nodes across the phenological stages, and to estimate the corresponding
    transition dates. The pheno-network model was utilized to represent the phenological
    progress of corn and soybean in Illinois from 2002 to 2017. With reference to
    the ASD-level ground phenological observations, the detected transition dates
    for corn were found to align with its mature stage. The R square was 0.55 and
    the RMSE was 7.77 days. As for soybean, the estimated transition dates corresponded
    to its dropping leaves stage, with the R square being 0.55 and the RMSE being
    5.05 days. Compared to conventional phenological methods, the non-parametric pheno-network
    model does not make mathematical assumptions of crop phenological processes, and
    can be constructed with partial-year remote sensing data. The pheno-network model,
    with those unique characteristics, shows great promise to improve the phenological
    monitoring in complex and intensified agricultural systems. Acknowledgements This

    of Environment Citation Excerpt : Yang et al. (2020) determined the phenological
    stages of various crops from feature points (e.g., the peaks of the first and
    second derivations of the VI time series). Diao (2019) innovatively used a complex
    network to resolve the transition dates of spectral reflectance time series to
    obtain the maturity stage of maize and the leaf-drop stage of soybean. In fact,
    the feature points estimated from fitted VI time series normally indicate the
    transition dates of vegetation greenness changes, which are somewhat different
    from the crop phenology definitions used in agriculture; thus, these feature points
    may be difficult to associate with the agronomic stages of various crops (Guo
    et al., 2016; Sakamoto, 2018). Show abstract Hybrid phenology matching model for
    robust crop phenological retrieval 2021, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote
    Sensing Citation Excerpt : Remote sensing provides a feasible solution to monitor
    crop phenological stages over large geographical regions in a repeated and consistent
    fashion. With the satellite time series, a range of phenological transition dates
    that are characteristic of crop phenological stages have been explored (Diao,
    2019; Gao et al., 2020a; Gao et al., 2020b; Gao et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018;
    Wardlow et al., 2006; Zeng et al., 2020). In particular, Diao (2020) developed
    a remote sensing phenological monitoring framework that comprises three major
    constituents to detect a multitude of crop phenological stages. Show abstract

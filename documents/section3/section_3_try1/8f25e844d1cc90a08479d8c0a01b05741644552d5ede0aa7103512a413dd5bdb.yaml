    the globe demands more food production. However, the changing climate causes declining
    water availability and thus leading to the water and energy shortages across all
    the sectors including mainly the agriculture [1]. To maintain the current per
    capita supply, the food production needs to be increased by around 50 % in the
    next 50 years to feed the rising population, which further intensifies the demand
    for water and energy [2]. In this scenario, any poor agricultural practices will
    further intensify the negative effects, leading to more vulnerable situations.
    While the accessibility to surface water resources is limited, groundwater contribution
    is a major source of irrigation. Nearly two-third (64 %) of irrigated agriculture
    in India depends on groundwater sources, which is depleting at an alarming rate
    due to inefficient irrigation management and unreliable power supply [3]. Consequently,
    about 30 % of the aquifers are in a critical state, threatening the sustainability
    of groundwater utilization [4]. The urgency of this water-energy nexus investigation
    stems from the shortage of water and energy, a phenomenon that is intensifying
    recently both in India and across the world. Irrigation efficiency has direct
    implications on the nexus between water usage and power consumption. According
    to the organization for economic co-operation and development''s environmental
    outlook 2050, Indian agriculture would face severe water constraints/shortages
    in the next thirty years [5]. Supplying precise amount of irrigation water (i.e.,
    right quantity at the right time) not only saves water used for irrigation but
    also protects the groundwater resources and further reduces power consumption
    used for pumping. For this endeavor, solar water pumps could be a viable alternative
    for both optimal irrigation and energy from the utility grid [6]. Irrigation scheduling
    can be categorized into plant-based-, soil moisture based-, and weather-based
    approach [7]. In the existing literature most of the automatic irrigation and
    monitoring systems are typically based on soil moisture approach, often integrated
    with weather parameters (e.g. rainfall) [8]. There are a variety of water-saving
    techniques for diverse crops, ranging from the most basic to the most technologically
    advanced. Notably, a remote canopy temperature-based approach employed infrared
    thermometers to automate the cotton crop irrigation, the automatic irrigation
    system activated by canopy temperature threshold [9]. Similarly, implementing
    an evapotranspiration (ET) based automatic irrigation scheduling system to compute
    the crop irrigation requirement and time of water application achieved up to 42
    % water saving [10]. Innovative strategies, such as soil sensors and evaporimeters
    are used to further reduce/adjust the irrigation based on the daily weather or
    substrate moisture content fluctuations [11]. Advancements in wireless sensor
    networks (WSN) have facilitated irrigation machinery control. Multiple studies
    have explored WSNs to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and illumination to maintain optimal conditions for crop growth [12,13].
    A novel irrigation scheduling system was developed in Ref. [14] to plan for more
    accurate water allocation using earth observation data, weather forecasts, and
    numerical simulations. To overcoming the challenges in WSN systems, recent advancements
    in microelectronics and wireless technologies generated low-cost, low-power components,
    power-aware protocols, task management, and communication solutions [15,13] are
    useful. Since the groundwater based irrigated agriculture contributes major share
    of total agricultural products, approximately 31.8 million pumps have been installed,
    which are being operated by grid power and diesel engines [16]. Recently, the
    solar powered water pumping systems have gained significant attention [17,18],
    which can be off-grid or grid connected. The solar based pumping mainly helps
    in effective utilization of grid power, effective use of sensors, to achieve high
    efficiency in the power electronic conversion modules, and thus to reduce the
    loading on utility grid. Several research papers have discussed the performance
    improvement of solar pumps in terms of battery storage [19], environmental impact
    assessment [20], comparison of DC and AC motors [21], comparing the pumps such
    as centrifugal, submersible and displacement pumps [22]. Further, solar water
    pumping system with water storage tank was introduced to address the reliability
    and life cycle cost issues [23]. Based on the literature review presented, it
    was noted that the integration of both water and energy management still needs
    further improvements especially at field scale. Therefore, the paper proposes
    an energy management scheme to maximize the utilization of photovoltaic (PV) capacity
    and ensure the power supply security during overcast conditions. The goal of the
    study is to demonstrate that automated irrigation system reduces water and power
    consumption for enhancing the Water-Energy-Food nexus at field scale. This was
    achieved adopting the following tasks a) to develop wireless sensor network (WSN)
    nodes to measure soil moisture and local weather and cloud-based irrigation decision
    support system using the Internet of Things (IoT), b) to develop an onsite optimal
    energy management strategy to operate the solar-powered automated irrigation system,
    c) to implement a well-structured integration of all the sources and loads (pump),
    d) to demonstrate the interconnected system for irrigation experimentally, and
    e) to apply the energy management and control systems for improving irrigation
    in more economical and energy-efficient way. Fig. 1 illustrates the overall integration
    of the water and energy-efficient reliable irrigation system (WatEr-ERIS). Download

    Water and energy-efficient reliable irrigation system (WatEr-ERIS). The WatEr-ERIS
    encompasses an array of modules which are explained in detail in the subsequent
    sections. The main focus of this paper includes: • A rule-based energy management
    and control schemes for a grid connected solar water pumping system for water
    and energy-efficient reliable irrigation system. • The seamless operation of the
    Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (IPMSM) drive is reported with Battery,
    PV on grid-connected mode or island mode based on energy management scheme. •
    A Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) operation for PV is achieved along with
    the DC-link voltage regulation. • The abnormal condition of grid performance is
    also analyzed with voltage sag and swell scenarios. The paper is arranged in the
    following manner. The realization of the proposed work is given in Section 2.
    Section 3 elaborates various modules to achieve automated irrigation system. The
    proposed energy management scheme is explained in Section 4. The discussion over
    experimental results is made in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the paper.
    2. Realization of proposed system The proposed study focuses on the rural areas
    (Kataula, Salgi etc.) of Mandi District, Himachal Pradesh, India, where significant
    water shortage is affecting mainly groundwater irrigation. The open-source satellite
    products are updated on a daily basis, and field observed meteorological parameters
    are used to forecast the local weather for 5–7 days lead period and store it in
    the cloud [24]. The soil moisture and temperature sensors along with Internet
    of Things (IoT) devices, are used to transmit the data to the cloud. The cloud
    provides crop-specific irrigation information to the users along with other weather
    parameters such as rainfall, solar irradiation, temperature, and soil moisture
    level. The pump can be operated through mobile apps to irrigate, irrespective
    of power supply from the grid is available or not. During the power shutdown,
    pumps are operated from the onsite power backups, which are recharged by the solar
    PV system. The integration of all the entities such as PMSM drive, PV, and energy
    storage system are achieved with help of power electronics converters. Based on
    the power conversion stage, converters can be classified as single-stage and two-stage
    topologies. In power electronics, there exist a major challenge to establish a
    regulation of desired voltage or current and hence the configuration must be chosen
    carefully. For this purpose, a two-stage power electronics topology typically
    consisting of two converters in the overall power conversion process is chosen.
    The key advantage of the two-stage topology is that it requires the small capacitance
    size for strict voltage regulation and achieving in better maximum power point
    tracking capability. In a two-stage topology, the voltage regulation is excellent
    as compared to the single-stage converter topology. Several converters are used
    to accomplish the objective. A front-end DC-DC boost converter is interfaced between
    the PV panel and DC link. For PV application, two-stage configuration also provides
    the MPPT efficiency and system dependability. Another DC-DC bi-directional converter
    is connected to battery. In combined, both circuitry makes it a two-stage DC-DC
    converter. Here, first DC-DC converter is used for extracting maximum power and
    the second converter is used for maintaining the constant DC link voltage [[25],
    [26], [27]]. To extract the maximum power from the PV, the perturb and observation
    (P&O) algorithm is used. Another, two-stage configuration is used for interconnection
    of PMSM drive and the AC grid. In this, front-end single phase voltage source
    inverter (VSC) connects AC grid to the common DC link. Whereas another three phase
    VSC is used to connect PMSM drive with DC link. In order to control the speed
    of the PMSM, a hysteresis current controller is used. The performance is analyzed
    with different operating conditions such as motoring and regenerative braking
    condition. The more details about the power stage of the converters are elaborated
    in section 5 which is an experimental part of this study. 3. Automated irrigation

    [28]. A weather station is installed on the campus, connected to the LoRa gateway,

    of soil moisture measurement. 3.2. Module 2: short-range soil moisture forecasting
    Module 1 provides the information of the soil moisture and weather information
    measured at the field. In Module 2, a machine learning based long short-term memory
    (LSTM) model was developed to forecast the soil moisture (SM). LSTM is a robust
    model in forecasting the sequential timeseries information by accounting vanishing
    gradient problem. For scheduling the irrigation, 5 days ahead prediction of the
    soil moisture content is required. Accordingly, the SM was forecasted for up to
    5 days ahead including the 1 and 3 days ahead forecasting. The input variables
    for the LSTM model consists of meteorological parameters such as rainfall [P]
    (mm), temperature [T] (oC), relative humidity [H] (%), wind speed [W] (kmph),
    dew point [D] (oC) along with soil moisture measured using field sensors. The
    summary statistics of selected input variables for modelling is presented in Table
    1. Based on the cross, and auto correlation the most significant inputs were identified
    correspondingly to current time (t) and different lagged time (up to t-2). The
    final input model structure was fixed and the outputs are the soil moisture corresponding
    to the required forecast lead (t+1, t+3 and t+5). Table 1. Summary statistics

    between different input variables also with output (soil moisture at time ‘t’).
    It is clear that despite different levels of correlation estimated among the input
    variables, the overall correlation with output variable varied between −0.125
    and 0.2907. Unlike other hydrological variables such as surface runoff, evapotranspiration,
    the correlation was not very strong in the case of soil moisture corresponds to
    weather parameters. However, the influence of weather parameters on the soil moisture
    cannot be ignored so as to allow the LSTM model to train with diverse sets of
    inputs capturing the underlying physics of the system. Download : Download high-res

    of input and output variables. The model is constructed using single layer LSTM
    cells with 32 units connected to 4 layers of fully connected neural networks.
    The LSTM model is optimized using Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) with mean
    squared error as the loss function. The model is trained and tested to forecast
    SM 5-days ahead (SMt+5). To achieve better accuracy, the 5-days ahead rainfall
    forecast collected from block level India Meteorological Department forecast was
    used. The observed hourly data of the weather information and soil moisture from
    December 2021 to April 2022 was used to develop the SM forecast module. The model
    was trained optimizing the 5697 parameters (weights and biases) with the hyperparameters
    learning rate, 0.001 and batch size of 32. The model performance was assessed
    using Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency index (NSE) for 1-day, 3-day and 5-day ahead forecast.
    Overall a good fit between observed and forecasted was found and the NSE estimated
    are presented in Table 2. As the dynamics of SM was very consistent, the model
    performance was almost similar across all the lead time. Furthermore, the ability
    of LSTM learning sequentially the underline trend of the data allows the model
    performance not to deteriorating even the lead time increases. The testing period
    results of 5 days ahead SM forecast is illustrated in Fig. 5. The results of 1-
    and 3- days ahead forecast are not presented herein for brevity. Further, it is
    confirmed from Table 3 that the statistical estimates (mean, standard deviation
    and skewness) of observed and forecasted soil moisture closely matches with each
    other across all the lead time (1- day, 3-day and 5-day). Table 2. Performance

    Module 3: smart irrigation scheduling All the data received from Module 2 helps
    calculate the actual crop water requirement (CWR). In this study, the CROPWAT
    8.0 simulation platform has been used to calculate the net CWR. The CROPWAT 8.0
    utilizes weather data including rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, and
    wind speed, crop data, and soil data in order to evaluate CWR [29]. Here, weather
    data is taken from the automatic weather station installed near the experimental
    field. According to crop water requirements, the decision support scheme turns
    ON/OFF the motor. The process to check the status of water requirement is given
    in Fig. 6. The amount of net irrigation required by the crop is a very important
    aspect. To achieve this Module 3 processes and computes the net irrigation. The
    computed irrigation required, and the water supplied by the pump and reservoir
    together are represented as D (liters/hectare) and S (liters/hectare), respectively
    in Fig. 6. The net irrigation depends on various parameters such as field capacity,
    the water level of the reservoir, rainfall status, etc. Download : Download high-res

    of water requirement [D indicates water supplied by pump and reservoir together
    in liters/hectare]. The soil present in the experimental field is silty loam with
    field capacity (FC) of 32 % and wilting point of 12 % (available water 20 %).
    Field capacity is defined as water retained in the field due to molecular attraction
    and by loose chemical bonds after irrigation or rain. The FC can be expresses
    as eq. (1). Allowable depletion is 80 % of available water (i.e. irrigation water
    is applied when the soil moisture goes below 16 % to bring back to 32 %). The
    effective root zone depth is measured as 47 cm. The depth of water (d) stored
    in the root zone is calculated using eq. (2) [30] and is comes out to be 11.3
    cm. (1) (2) where, and are the density of dry soil and water, respectively. The
    values of and taken from the field are 14.78 KN/m3 and 9.81 KN/m3, respectively.
    Considering the irrigation efficiency of 80 %, volume of water stored in the root
    zone is 33.9 m3 (field size is 20 m × 15 m) and volume of water pumped/supplied
    from the source is 42.375 m3. The data for decadal crop water requirement for
    potato, effective rainfall, soil water availability are presented in Table 4.
    It can be noticed that for crop periods, November to March, two-time irrigation
    is required. Therefore, total volume of water supplied for the experimental field
    is 84.75 m3 (equivalent to 2825 m3/ha). However, conventional irrigation requirement
    is calculated as 3086.25 m3/ha based on the flood irrigation method and potential
    evapotranspiration requirement of the crop for the field location [31]. Here,
    water saving achieved is around 261.25 m3/ha (9.24 %) under no water stress condition.
    With pump discharge rate of 0.03 m3/Sec, the total time to run the pump is calculated
    as 84.75/0.03 = 2825 Sec or 0.78 h. At last, the total energy consumed is computed
    in eq. (3) (3) Total energy Consumed = 3.7 kW × 0.78/0.9 = 3.2 kWh Table 4. Irrigation

    irrigation requires around 26.15 h of pumping which consume about 96.80 kWh of
    energy, whereas conventional irrigation requires around 28.57 h of pumping which
    consume 105.7 kWh of energy. Compared conventional irrigation, soil moisture-based
    irrigation saved around 8.9 kWh. 3.4. Module 4: energy management scheme The energy
    management scheme (EMS) is initiated with reference to the inputs received from
    the forecasting and crop simulation models, which deal with soil moisture forecasting,
    growth prediction, genetic features of specific cultivar, environmental variables
    and management practices etc. If solar powered automated irrigation system is
    not adequately managed and operated, it may lead to wasteful energy and water
    use. Hence, an EMS is proposed and a detailed discussion is presented in the next
    section. 4. Proposed energy management scheme Irrigation can be improved in a
    more cost-effective and energy-efficient manner with well-implemented energy management
    and control systems. Therefore, this paper proposes a rule-based energy management
    and control schemes for a grid connected solar water pumping system. The EMS is
    initiated with reference to the inputs received from the forecasting and crop
    simulation models, which deal with soil moisture forecasting, growth prediction,
    genetic features of specific cultivar, environmental variables and management
    practices etc. The EMS requires the prior knowledge regarding operational status
    of various entities such as availability of PV power, water level in storage tank,
    state of charge of storage battery and availability of grid by means of placing
    suitable sensors. Estimation of State of Charge (SoC) of battery is an important
    parameter and the estimated SoC decides the operational states of the energy management
    scheme. Finally based on objective function defined, EMS generates the reference
    variables for controllers, that control the power electronic interfacing devices.
    Whole data is transferred to cloud through IoT, which is retrieved by other modules
    and monitored. To achieve this objective, the proposed EMS is implemented on the
    system shown in Fig. 7. The flowchart of proposed EMS is shown in Fig. 8. This
    figure also illustrates various control strategy for different converters. The
    operation is carried out in such a way where, PV side DC-DC boost converter operates
    in the MPPT mode derived using P&O algorithm. The proposed system operates in
    two modes i.e., grid-connected mode and island mode. The working modes of the
    converters are chosen in accordance with the EMS, as indicated in Fig. 8. This
    EMS leads to the definition of distinct cases, which are then carried out and
    confirmed through experimental tests. In the following section, these studies
    are well-explained. Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download : Download

    for different converters. When the AC grid is OFF, battery side BI-DI DC-DC converter
    regulates the DC-link voltage. If the irrigation is not required i.e., IPMSM pump
    drive is OFF, the PV power injects into the battery completely. Therefore, the
    battery begins to charge up to its maximum capacity. As the battery is fully charged,
    the PV feeds the power into the grid. Once the sun is not available, then the
    battery provides the energy to the IPMSM drive pump. If the SOC of battery (SOCB)
    is less than 10 %, then grid feeds power to the pump. The grid assumes control
    of the DC link voltage as soon as it is connected and regulates it to the required
    value. In this instance, the system contains both a PV and an AC grid, and the
    PV supplies electricity to the AC grid. The whole process ensures the maintenance
    of power flow. So that maximum power of PV is utilized completely. The pump operates
    in its optimal condition. According to water requirements, the motor operates
    at different speeds. Here, a dual loop control (inner current loop and outer voltage
    loop) is used. When PV current (iPV) is more than the required current, the DC-link
    voltage (VDC) is greater than the reference voltage (Vref), and both the voltages
    are compared, and error is fed to the PI controller. At this time, the outer voltage
    controller generates the negative reference current. The actual battery current
    (Ib) is compared to the generated reference current (Ibref), and again, error
    is fed to the PI controller that generates the pulses for the respective switches.
    Another PI controller is used for control the speed of IPMSM. Fig. 8 illustrates
    the control strategies on the individual converters. 5. Experimental study The
    experimental prototype of the grid integrated solar PV array and battery fed IPMSM
    drive is developed in the laboratory as in Fig. 9. Here, the IPMSM motor emulates
    a water pumping system for irrigation. In the power stage, a PV, battery, and
    AC grid utility are used as active sources and IPMSM motor is used as pump load.
    The 3.7 kW IPMSM (JD engineering works) is coupled with the DC machine and connected
    to DC link through IGBT based VSC (Semikron converters). To emulate solar PV,
    a TerraSAS photovoltaic simulator (EGAR) is utilized. In the control unit, a digital
    controller dSPACE-1104 is used to operate the system in real-time. To acquire
    the voltage and current data, the hall effect voltage and the current sensors
    are used, respectively. The parameters selected for experimental study are given
    in Table 5. The different cases have been studied which are as follows. Download

    performance is tested at different solar irradiance. At 1200 W/m2 and 200 W/m2
    (at 25 °C constant temperature), the PV current and voltage are the 3.9 A and
    110 V, and 0.4 A and 102 V, respectively. In this case, the pump load is not connected
    hence, the PV feeds the power to the battery. The tracking efficiency of MPPT
    achieved is 98 %–99 %. The experimental results for this case are shown in Fig.
    10. It can be observed that at t1, t2, t3, and t4, when solar irradiance decreases,
    the power is delivered to battery is also decreases. But the DC-link voltage (VDC)
    remains regulated. Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download : Download

    solar irradiance. (i.e., PVON, battery = ON, pump = OFF, AC grid = OFF). 5.2.
    Case 2: PV with AC grid utility This case occurs when the battery is charged completely
    then the PV power is transferred to the AC grid utility. At this time, the grid
    maintains the VDC. Since the reference is zero before the grid is ON, PV current
    iPV begin to increase, hence, the grid reference current Igref also increases
    to maintain the constant DC-link voltage. Fig. 11 illustrates the results for
    this case. In Fig. 11(a), it can be seen that at t5, as the solar irradiance change
    from 800 W/m2 to 1200 W/m2, the iPV also increases from 3.2 A to 4.8 A. Hence,
    the ig also increases up to some level. Similarly, the effect of iPV and ig under
    decrement in solar irradiance form 1200 W/m2 to 800 W/m2 at t6 is shown in Fig.
    11(b). The transients during turning ON of PV while grid is ON can be seen in
    Fig. 12. Here, the PV (solar irradiance: 1000 W/m2) is turned ON at t7 and delivers
    the power to the AC grid. In this mode, the ig is out of phase from Vg. Download

    2: Transient during turning ON of PV. 5.3. Case 3: pump load with AC grid This
    case represents a scenario when solar power is not available (i.e., PV is OFF),
    the battery is fully discharged and the pump (IPMSM) requires the power to run.
    At this time the AC grid feed the power to the IPMSM. The transient and steady-state
    behavior of IPMSM is shown in Fig. 13. At t8, IMPSM gets turned ON and start to
    run and then settle at 400 RPM. The peak value of grid current (ig) and motor
    stator phase current (istator) are 2 A and 2.5 A, respectively. Download : Download

    during AC grid feeds power to IPMSM. (i.e., PVOFF, battery = OFF, pump = ON, AC
    grid = ON). The AC grid performance is observed at Vg = 120 V (RMS). At t9, the
    speed has been changed to 1000 RPM. During this time, ig and istator are 9 A and
    9 A, respectively. 5.4. Case 4: pump load with PV and AC grid In this case, the
    PV and AC grid both feed the power to the IPMSM. Fig. 14 illustrates the PV, AC
    grid and IPMSM performances for this case. Solar irradiance is kept constant throughout
    i.e., 400 W/m2. Initially PV and AC grid both present in the system till t10.
    During this time, PV feeds power to the AC grid and it can be seen through section
    Z5. Here, ig and Vg both are out of phase from each other. Later, at t10 the IPMSM
    is connected and begin to run then reaches to 500 RPM in steady-state. In steady-state,
    the VPV, iPV and ig are 107 V, 2 A and −0.5 A, respectively. After some time,
    at t11, the speed of IPMSM is increased up to 1000 RPM. This increment in the
    speed requires extra power than PV. Therefore, AC grid start to deliver power
    and feed to IPMSM. A change in ig can be seen in zoomed version Z6. Here, ig is
    changed from −0.5 A to 6.5 A when speed changes from 500 to 1000 RPM. Download

    can be arisen when both PV and AC grid is not available and irrigation is needed.
    At this time, battery feeds the power to IPMSM. The steady state performances
    of battery and IPMSM at 500 RPM and 800 RPM, respectively are illustrated in Fig.
    15(a) and (b). At t12, it can be observed that as the motor speed increases from
    500 to 800 RPM, the battery current ibat also rises from 3.5A to 8 A. Download

    (i.e., PVOFF, AC grid = OFF, battery = ON, pump = ON). 6. Conclusion An energy
    management scheme is proposed for PV-battery based grid-connected system to drive
    the water pump. This helps to make water and energy-saving reliable irrigation
    system. The proposed scheme is based on data such as rainfall, solar irradiation,
    temperature, and soil moisture level. These aforesaid data are used to operate
    solar pump based on availability of the power sources such as PV, battery and
    AC grid utility. In this paper, various real-time scenario such as PV with battery,
    PV with grid, water pump with AC grid, both PV and AC grid with water pump, and
    battery with water pump have been implemented experimentally. Hence, the optimal
    operation of pump and harvesting maximum power from PV along with the power injection
    into AC grid if needed, have assured the water and energy-saving during irrigation.
    The results show that around 9.24 % of water and energy saving is achieved with
    the proposed irrigation system for potato crop with full irrigation. However,
    extensive studies are required to explore more water and energy saving possibilities
    for different crops under different levels of deficit irrigation. Ethical standards
    The research meets all ethical guidelines, including adherence to the legal requirements
    of the study country. Data availability The data used will be shared upon the

  description: Agricultural production in the western United States relies on water
    supplies from mountain source-water systems that are sensitive to impacts from
    wildfire and a changing climate. The resultant challenges to water supply forecasting
    directly impact agricultural producers and irrigation managers who rely on snowmelt
    and streamflow forecasts for crop selection and irrigation scheduling. To date,
    much research has focused on source-water system processes and agricultural production
    separately, but in this short communication we highlight a substantial need for
    new research connecting these disparate systems to improve forecasting accuracy.
    We identify key knowledge and data gaps regarding the functioning of source watersheds
    and their contributions to agricultural water resources with associated uncertainties
    in the context of wildfire and changing climate. In doing so, we encourage researchers,
    resource managers, and agricultural producers to consider the interdependency
    of water supply source and sink relationships through improved observations, monitoring,
    and modeling to ensure sustainable food production in the western US.

    • Wildfire and climate change are affecting water yields of forested river basins
    dominated by snow melt. • There are substantial knowledge gaps among disparate,
    but intrinsically linked, mountain and agricultural systems. • Knowledge and data
    gaps challenge forecasting short- and long-term availability with high confidence.

    improved observations, monitoring, and modeling to ensure sustainable food production

    in the western US relies on mountain source-water systems Increasingly limited
    water supplies threaten agricultural production, especially in the western United
    States where irrigated crops use ∼80% of all surface water withdrawals (Maupin,
    2018). Surface water supplies for irrigation come from rivers and reservoirs fed
    by seasonal melt of high-elevation snowpacks that have declined over recent decades
    and are further impacted by increasing wildfire (Fassnacht and López-Moreno, 2020,
    Kampf et al., 2022, Li et al., 2017, McGrath et al., 2023, Viviroli et al., 2007).
    There is limited research linking ecohydrological change in mountain source-water
    systems to water availability for agricultural production, despite a growing reliance
    on snowmelt and streamflow forecasting for crop and irrigation planning (Wallander
    et al., 2022). This knowledge gap, combined with a changing climate, increases
    uncertainties with decision making and planning for reservoirs, aquifers, and
    agricultural irrigation management (Harmel et al., 2020, Mankin et al., 2022a,
    Musselman et al., 2021). Roughly 75% of total precipitation in the western US
    falls in forested mountain watersheds (Liu et al., 2022) where wildfire severity
    and extent is increasing (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). Climate change could
    amplify the impacts of wildfire and subsequent ecohydrological feedbacks (Fig.
    1). These changes and their interactions can lead to uncertainty in various factors,
    such as streamflow predictions, flood risk and sedimentation, biogeochemistry,
    soil microbial and ecosystem functioning, and snow accumulation and melt timing
    (Kampf et al., 2020, Kampf et al., 2022, Nelson et al., 2022, Rhoades et al.,
    2011, Williams et al., 2022). Moreover, the impacts of fires can vary broadly
    based on hydrological scale and fire size, but need further characterization to
    refine downstream impacts on agricultural production (Heindel et al., 2022, Riggan
    et al., 1994, Rust et al., 2018). When combined, these uncertainties complicate
    water supply forecasting for agricultural production (Qin et al., 2020). Wildfire
    may further affect water supply infrastructure through sedimentation and altered
    flows, impacting diversion and ditch networks regardless of streamflow volumes
    and reservoir levels. In addition, wildfire patterns are changing (Andela et al.,
    2017), with increasing encroachment on urban and agricultural areas previously
    free from the threat of fire. Hence, research is needed to link change and disturbance
    in source-water systems to water availability for agriculture and other downstream
    users to ensure sustainable food production in the future. Download : Download

    Uncertainty in estimating snowpack water content highlights spatiotemporal scaling
    issues and data gaps Snow monitoring stations are not always representative of
    surrounding areas (Mankin et al., 2022a). Moreover, snow station data are fine-scale
    point measurements that are typically more sparsely distributed than what would
    be ideal for forecasting (Blöschl, 1999). Especially to inform agricultural water
    management downstream of mountainous regions (Kaune et al., 2020, Tennant et al.,
    2017). Western US water supply forecasts are commonly made using statistical models
    developed to historical runoff volumes and snow water equivalent (SWE) from SNOTEL
    stations or snow courses (Helms et al., 2008). While more complex methods have
    been developed, including advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence
    algorithms, their testing has been too limited to justify broad adoption at operational-scales
    thus far (Fleming et al., 2021). Nevertheless, these models trained to past data
    have become less reliable as the climate increasingly deviates from historical
    norms (Lehner et al., 2017, Livneh and Badger, 2020). Remotely sensed snow data,
    such as airborne lidar, have increased the spatial resolution of basin-wide snow
    metrics (Painter et al., 2016). However, landscape factors, such as vegetation
    and topography can affect these estimates, especially when snowpack depth exceeds
    50 cm (Deems et al., 2013, Raleigh and Small, 2017). Additionally, the high costs
    of airborne lidar flights and data processing restrict widespread adoption of
    these methods, continuing a reliance on sparsely distributed sensor networks that
    may delay improvements to snowmelt and streamflow forecasting. 3. An uncertain
    future, measurement gaps, and incomplete understanding further complicate snowmelt
    and streamflow forecasting The impacts of wildfire and other disturbances (e.g.
    deforestation from bark beetle outbreaks) on snow accumulation and melt timing
    in forested areas are highly variable and amplified by a changing climate. Although
    snowpacks are generally declining across the western US (Fassnacht and López-Moreno,
    2020), reduced canopy interception of snow due to fire or disturbance can increase
    snowpack accumulation and reduce canopy sublimation losses (Moeser et al., 2020).
    However, these same canopy changes can also result in higher insolation and turbulent
    fluxes at the snow surface, increasing melt rate (Harpold et al., 2014, McGrath
    et al., 2023). Characterizing these factors across the landscape can be challenging
    as they vary by topographic position and can be affected by decreased albedo from
    ash or dust on the snow surface (Fassnacht et al., 2022, Gleason et al., 2013).
    As a result, continued research is needed to improve the understanding of these
    interactive factors and reduce uncertainty in predictions of snowmelt rate and
    timing and streamflow generation from burned watersheds (Giovando and Niemann,
    2022, Holden et al., 2012, Pomeroy et al., 2012, Smoot and Gleason, 2021). Similarly,
    the magnitude of wildfire impacts on hydrologic function is spatially variable,
    depending on burn severity, topography, soils, climate, and changes to vegetation
    (Goeking and Tarboton, 2020, Hallema et al., 2017). Higher burn severity increases
    soil hydrophobicity and reduces soil organic matter and surface roughness, reducing
    soil infiltration and increasing overland flow (Ebel and Moody, 2017, Shakesby
    et al., 2000). This can lead to “flashier” streamflow responses with faster and
    higher peak-flows, especially after high-intensity rain storms (Moeser and Douglas-Mankin,
    2021, Moody and Martin, 2001). Moreover, vegetation mortality reduces evapotranspiration
    losses post-fire, potentially increasing baseflow (Bart and Tague, 2017, Kinoshita
    and Hogue, 2015). Conversely, rapid vegetation recovery post-fire can increase
    soil-water uptake (Buckley et al., 2012). These interactive and multifaceted effects
    can lead to both acute (2–3 years post-fire) and chronic (decadal) changes that
    can vary across burn areas (Hallema et al., 2018). Water supply reservoirs are
    especially important in snow-dominated river basins. This includes larger reservoirs
    with declining operating capacities (e.g. Lake Mead, Lake Powell) and smaller
    regional reservoirs that are more likely to fill to capacity each year. However,
    wildfires and a changing climate are highlighting limitations with reservoir capacity,
    operating levels, and release rates that were designed based on historical climate
    and pre-fire landcover. The combination of unique streamflow responses, flash
    floods, and sediment and debris loading that may emerge post-fire are often outside
    of the ranges of historical variability used during reservoir design (Basso et
    al., 2021, Floyd et al., 2019, Nyman et al., 2019). Therefore critical research
    is needed to quantify the potential impacts of wildfire and climate change on
    streamflow variability impacts to reservoir design and irrigation water distribution
    networks. Reservoir operating criteria are further challenged by uncertainty in
    the timing of watershed hydrologic recovery which can range from 3 to 45 years
    after fire (Hampton and Basu, 2022, Wine and Cadol, 2016). Increasing aridity
    and uncertain future wildfire regimes can further confound these predictions.
    For example, decreasing precipitation and increasing wildfire extent and severity
    in the western US may result in reduced vegetation recovery or shifts in ecological
    states slowing hydrologic recovery, or shifting to a new hydrologic regime altogether
    (Lian et al., 2021, Rodman et al., 2020, Stevens-Rumann and Morgan, 2019). 4.
    Forest soils moderate wildfire effects on nutrient cycling, water quality, and
    ecosystem recovery Severe wildfires combust forest vegetation and organic soil
    layers and expose mineral soils to surface runoff and leaching with direct consequences
    for downstream water quality (Rhoades et al., 2011, Rhoades et al., 2019b). However,
    little is known about these effects on irrigated agriculture. Sediment and ash
    mobilization are the primary short-term water quality concerns after severe wildfires.
    Ash is alkaline and often contains high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
    and trace metals with lasting effects at local and regional scales (Rhoades et
    al., 2019a, Rust et al., 2018). Although additions of char in irrigation water
    from burned lands may benefit crop production through nutrient enrichment (Spokas
    et al., 2012), char may also contribute to eutrophication and harmful algal production
    in water bodies (Hohner et al., 2019) and foul irrigation infrastructure. For
    water treatment and pre-treatment of water for high-efficiency irrigation systems,
    particulates are an important concern, especially following high intensity rainstorms
    (Hohner et al., 2016). Nutrients, metals, and char deposited within reservoirs
    and floodplain sediments can also be longer-term concerns for agricultural water
    quality when remobilized during high flows (Martens et al., 2019). Microbial communities
    fill essential roles in nutrient cycling and forest soil and vegetation functioning
    that are altered by wildfire. The resilience of soil microbiomes regulates the
    rate of post-fire vegetation recovery and nutrient cycling, with downstream effects
    on agricultural water quality. For example, microbial communities can frequently
    transform ammonium (abundant after fire), to nitrate, which can leach into adjacent
    fluvial systems. Microbes can also play critical roles in the methylation of mercury
    that is exported from burned watersheds and can bioaccumulate in the food web
    (Jensen et al., 2017). Additionally, fire can substantially deplete ectomycorrhizal
    fungi (EMF), which are critical symbiotic partners to many plant species, including
    dominant pine vegetation in the western US. Recent studies have indicated that
    EMF populations are mostly absent one-year post fire, especially following high
    severity fires (Nelson et al., 2022). These changes likely affect the ability
    of seedlings to establish and grow (Rhoades et al., 2021), with subsequent impacts
    on hydrology and the trajectory of ecosystem recovery. Widespread regeneration
    failures and state transitions in the forests and shrublands of the western US
    (Mahood and Balch, 2019, Shriver et al., 2019) are likely to lead to alterations
    in the pools and fluxes of soil nutrients (Mahood et al., 2022), for which the
    role of EMF reductions are largely unexplored. Moreover, the full extent of post-fire
    changes to microbial communities and their impacts on soil health, vegetation
    recovery, water quality, and source-water yields remain to be identified. 5. Modeling
    and data limitations lower confidence in water supply forecasts Wildfire impacts
    are often considered in the context of local utilities and land disturbance (Blount
    and Kroepsch, 2019). However, downstream impacts on agriculture can be indirect,
    difficult to quantify, and as a result, remain poorly investigated. Process-based
    hydrologic models can simulate future risks related to climate change, and are
    thus important tools for improving our understanding of hydrologic responses (Hay
    et al., 2011, Mankin et al., 2022b). However, no models have been developed specifically
    to represent fire effects or post-fire recovery on ecohydrologic processes (Ebel
    et al., 2023). Instead, integrating measurements and simulations “from fire to
    farm” involves many challenges including conceptual and data gaps. For example,
    complex terrain and spatially variable climate, vegetation, and geology in mountain
    systems confound observations and simulations of surface and groundwater flow
    paths (Frisbee et al., 2011, Somers and McKenzie, 2020, Viviroli et al., 2007).
    Water management and water supply forecasts downstream would benefit from research
    that improves systems-level understanding of the inputs, feedbacks, and alterations
    in system dynamics due to disturbance and climate change. 6. Farm-level impacts
    of a decreasing yet uncertain water supply Planning crop irrigation requirements
    is increasingly difficult due to multi-year droughts, variable precipitation,
    wildfire, and disturbance in source-water areas. Water managers and ditch companies
    that supply irrigation water rely on snowpack reports and streamflow monitoring
    for short-term planning, and extended weather forecasts and reservoir reports
    for long-term planning (Wallander et al., 2022). However, without reliable long-term
    climate outlooks and a comprehensive modeling framework (as described above),
    high-resolution water supply forecasts are limited to short-term (i.e. 7–10 days).
    Insufficient water supplies, post-fire sediment impacts on irrigation infrastructure,
    or poor confidence in forecasts will compel curtailments to surface and groundwater
    extractions. This will lead producers to reduce irrigated acreage or the amount
    of irrigation applied, or to select more drought tolerant (but less productive)
    crops (Schneekloth and Andales, 2017). It is worth noting, however, that water
    user organizations and irrigation ditch companies are attempting to coordinate
    water supplies (river diversions, reservoir releases, groundwater pumping) to
    effectuate exchanges, trades, and leases to maximize basin water use and address
    future uncertainties. These efforts will be further aided by improved understanding
    of crop water requirements and new research focused on the development of comprehensive
    modeling frameworks and improved weather forecasting. The timing of water delivery
    is also essential for planning irrigation to maximize crop yield and economic
    return. However, timing water delivery to crop requirements becomes challenging
    post-fire and under increasing aridity as supply limitations often coincide with
    peak irrigation demand. Many modern crop hybrids (e.g. maize) have been bred with
    specific growth phase timing (Abendroth et al., 2011). Water limitations at key
    growth stages can cause substantial yield losses, especially during the middle
    and end of season (Comas et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019). Hence, peak streamflow
    from snowmelt and reservoir releases earlier in the season, resulting in less
    water being available later, are unlikely to provide sufficient water supply for
    these crops. Farm-level water management, as a result, may require a shift away
    from full irrigation of crops with large water requirements later in the season
    (e.g., maize, alfalfa) to crops with more flexible timing of water requirements
    (e.g., sorghum, sunflower). Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI; strategic irrigation
    shortfalls during targeted growth stages), to a degree, can maintain crop yields
    while saving crop water use (Comas et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019). Many producers,
    however, lack flexibility in their irrigation systems to apply RDI. Sprinkler
    systems often lack the capacity to rapidly replenish soil moisture after the root
    zone is depleted. Furrow systems require water to reach the end of the field but
    could achieve RDI by supplying fewer well-timed irrigations if the ditch schedule
    allows. If farms must use less water, fully irrigating a smaller portion of a
    farm for a crop with high water requirements and producing an alternative crop
    with lower water requirements on the remainder of the farm may provide better
    options. Ultimately, more advanced tools are needed for evaluating farm management
    options if farms are able to use RDI to save water for leasing (Manning et al.,
    2018, Trout and Manning, 2019, Wichelns, 2015). New research and development of
    adaptable decision support tools that can evaluate alternative cropping choices,
    decision making tools (e.g. using soil moisture, evapotranspiration estimates),
    and management options will be critical for effective management of irrigation
    water on farms and for the development of municipal drought response plans. Sedimentation
    in water supplies can also negatively impact irrigation systems. While most surface
    water supplies non-pressurized irrigation systems, pressurized systems (sprinkler
    and drip irrigation) require settling ponds or filtration of fine sediments to
    prevent clogging of nozzles and emitters. Sediment yields post-fire can reach
    1000 mg/L, far exceeding the 50 mg/L thresholds for emitter function (Capra and
    Scicolone, 2007, Murphy et al., 2012). 7. Thinking outside the box will advance
    agricultural adaptation to an uncertain future There is a critical shortage of
    research linking source-water systems to irrigation for downstream agricultural
    production. This has resulted in a substantial knowledge gap and a clear opportunity
    to develop resilient systems that can respond to uncertain agriculture water supplies
    in the western US. Snowpacks are declining, and wildfire size, extent, and severity
    are increasing, with large destructive fires extending into winter months and
    encroaching on agricultural land and the wildland-urban interface (e.g. Marshall
    fire in Colorado and the Kansas grassland fire outbreak in December of 2021).
    A new perspective on agricultural production is now needed that encompasses both
    farm-level decision support and broader preparation for modeling and forecasting
    unpredictable water supply and delivery. Increased focus on state-of-the-art technology
    to characterize spatial distributions of snowpack water (e.g. airborne lidar)
    and improved snowmelt models will reduce uncertainty in the timing and volume
    of snowmelt. An increase in resources for mitigating risk pre-fire (e.g. fuels
    reduction treatments, prescribed burning) and for post-fire recovery (e.g. mulching
    treatments, stream channel restoration) will benefit downstream water users through
    improvements to water quality, increasing the predictability of post-fire hydrologic
    functioning, and decreasing time to watershed recovery. Flexibility and constraints
    in the management of infrastructure used to store and distribute source waters
    to agricultural users must be included explicitly in systems-level research. At
    the farm level, improved irrigation management and crop genetics and selection
    may sustain or improve current levels of crop production but must also be considered
    in the context of water shortages and uncertainties in water supply. Numerous
    watershed partnerships and water management organizations have emerged across
    the western US with broad focus on these aspects of water resources in semi-arid
    regions, although few have drought or fire built into management models (Wallander
    et al., 2022). Increased interactions among the research community, watershed
    partnerships, conservation agencies, water and resource managers, and agricultural
    producers will enhance a broader understanding of water supply issues, develop
    innovative management strategies, and grow relationships among disparate groups
    of stakeholders toward new, effective water management strategies. Declaration

    as a precision irrigation tool on fresh-market tomato production in a plasticulture
    system. Four irrigation scheduling treatments were designed and tested, including
    irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration (ET), soil matric potential sensors
    (Watermark 200SS-5) at -60 kPa (MP60) or -40 kPa (MP40), and GesCoN fertigation
    decision support system (DSS). The treatments were arranged based on a randomized
    complete block design with four replicates. System feasibility, irrigation water
    use efficiency (iWUE), and crop yield were evaluated. Throughout the season, the
    overall water use efficiencies were 22.2, 26.5, 27.9, and 28.4 kg·m−3 for ET,
    MP60, MP40, and GesCoN, respectively. The results indicated that treatment MP60
    and GesCoN had 15.2 and 22.1% higher marketable fruit yield than ET, while, MP40
    had 12.5% lower marketable yield compared to ET. Overall, the LoRaWAN-based IoT
    system performed well in terms of power consumption, communication, sensor reading,
    and valve control. These results suggested that the IoT system can be implemented
    for precision and automatic irrigation operations for vegetable and other horticultural
    crops with enhancing crop's water use efficiency and sustainability.

    use efficiency 1. Introduction In the United States, agriculture is a major consumer
    of ground and surface water, accounting for approximately 80% of the nation''s
    consumptive water use, and this percentage can be higher in the western states
    characterized by a dryer climate [1]. As the global population continues to increase,
    food-crop production is expected to increase dramatically while water resources
    are increasingly limited [2,3]. It is important to use water efficiently for crops
    such as vegetables, characterized by shallow roots and relatively highwater content,
    and thus very sensitive to water stress [4,5]. Water can be in excess or deficit,
    and thus irrigation water management can substantially impact vegetable yield
    and quality [6,7]. Conventionally, farm managers determine when and how much to
    irrigate primarily based on their experiences and time availability, which often
    led to inefficient water usage and reduction in crop yield and quality either
    by over-irrigating or under-irrigating. Precision irrigation is defined as a modern
    irrigation management strategy that allows growers to avoid plant water stress
    at critical growth stages by applying only the necessary amount of water directly
    to the crop, with varying rate and duration as needed based on site-specific conditions
    [8]. By applying precision irrigation on agricultural crops, farmers are expected
    to benefit from lower costs of irrigation water and manpower, while improving
    crop yield and quality. Adoption of precision irrigation for crop production systems
    requires the development of integrated sensing, decision-making strategies, and
    control systems, eventually to precisely control the timing, rate and distribution
    of water as needed [9]. Precision irrigation can be applied based on soil moisture,
    plant stress, and evapotranspiration (ET) [10]. Among these methods, soil moisture
    sensor-based precision irrigation has been widely tested and used in vegetable
    fields and protected culture systems. Soil volumetric water content (VWC) and
    soil matric potential (MP) are two indicators for available water in the soil
    which can be used to implement soil moisture-based irrigation systems [11,12].
    VWC is the ratio of water volume and soil volume with a unit of percentage. MP
    describes the force with which soil matrix holds water [13]. MP measures the required
    energy for water movement in the soil which is always a negative number expressed
    in kPa. Based on our preliminary study, soil MP sensors were selected for this
    study for their higher compatibility with internet of things (IoT) systems and
    higher sensitivity to variations of soil moisture, which is very critical for
    vegetable crops irrigation management [14,15]. A wired or wireless sensor network
    is one of the key technologies for precision and automated irrigation systems
    [16]. IoT is a combination of networked sensors and machines for capturing, transmitting,
    managing, and analyzing data. The data from sensors are first uploaded wirelessly
    to a server. Data are then available on the internet for analysis and computing.
    Finally, the server sends commands wirelessly to the actuators in the field for
    executing tasks. Various wireless technologies in IoT systems have been investigated
    for crop irrigation management, such as Wi-Fi, cellular network (GPRS, LTE), ZigBee,
    and LoRaWAN. Zhao et al. [17] compared the performance of Wi-Fi, ZigBee, GPRS,
    and LoRaWAN for irrigation systems. The results indicated that Wi-Fi and ZigBee
    had low coverage and only worked for the vegetable fields near the gateway. GPRS
    is good for long-distance communication, but it has high-power consumption, and
    high cost of maintenance and deployment. LoRaWAN technology has a maximum range
    of 10 km with low power consumption and cost, which could allow small farms to
    have affordable precision irrigation. This technology was originally published
    in 2015 by LoRa Alliance, a non-profit association supporting the LoRaWAN protocol.
    Goap et al. [18] developed a Wi-Fi based IoT smart irrigation management system
    with a machine learning algorithm to improve irrigation control. Some studies
    have reported the LoRaWAN-based architecture and the potential of implementation
    in smart irrigation [[19], [20], [21]]. A project called SWAMP tested the effect
    of their LoRaWAN IoT-based irrigation system at four pilot locations in Brazil
    and Europe [22]. While LoRaWAN based IoT technology has not been widely tested
    in precision irrigation systems for vegetable crops with soil moisture monitoring,
    valve control, and water usage efficiency analysis. Therefore, the primary goal
    of this study was to develop an effective IoT-based precision irrigation system
    using LoRaWAN technology for vegetable production. The specific objectives were
    to: (1) develop a LoRaWAN technology-based IoT wireless sensing network system
    for precision irrigation for vegetable irrigation, (2) conduct a performance evaluation
    of the irrigation system in terms of data communication, irrigation execution,
    and power consumption, and (3) evaluate the efficacy of the IoT-based precision
    irrigation system at field scale using fresh-market tomato as a test crop, and
    compare it to other irrigation approaches such as evapotranspiration based method
    and a decision support system. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental design
    An open field irrigation management experiment was conducted at the Horticultural
    Research Farm of the Penn State Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Center
    (Furnace, PA) during the 2020 growing season. The soil type in the experimental
    field was silty clay loam soil with 13.5% of sand, 47.8% of silt, and 38.8% of
    clay. Soil pH was 6.5, and the initial contents of phosphate, potash, magnesium,
    and calcium was equivalent to 175, 298, 584, and 3590 kg ha−1, respectively. Total
    nitrogen and carbon soil contents were 0.13% and 1.13%, respectively. The content
    of ammonium nitrogen was 2.34 mg/kg. Fresh-market tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) cv. Red Deuce F1 (HM Clause, Davis, CA) was used as the test crop. Seedlings
    were planted at the fourth true-leaf stage on May 21st, 2020, on raised beds mulched
    with black polyethylene film served by a single drip tape per bed. Beds were 0.91
    m wide and spaced at 2.13 m, and plants were planted at an in-row distance of
    0.46 m, establishing a density of 1.03 plants per m2. The 16 mm diameter drip
    tape had emitters spaced at 0.30 m and had a flow rate of 1.0 L per hour per emitter
    at 55 kPa (T-Tape, Rivulis Irrigation Ltd. San Diego, CA). Plants were trellised
    using the stake and Florida weave method [23], and the crop was managed according
    to local practices using an integrated pest management approach. A view of the
    open field experiment is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (396KB)

    system setup for the irrigation experiment. Four treatments using different irrigation
    scheduling were designed and tested. Treatment 1 (denoted ET) was based on crop
    evapotranspiration using a dual crop coefficient model according to FAO Paper
    56 [24]. Treatments 2 and 3 were based on soil matric potential (MP) sensors (Watermark
    200SS-5, Irrometer Company, Inc., Riverside, CA) at different thresholds of -60
    kPa (denoted MP60) and -40 kPa (denoted MP40), respectively. Once the average
    sensor readings at 20 cm depth reached the thresholds, the IoT system would send
    a notification and valves were manually controlled through the IoT system interface.
    Treatment 4 (denoted GesCoN) was based on recommendations provided by a decision
    support system (DSS) named GesCoN [25,26] using the web-platform EcoFert (https://www.ecofert.it/)
    and their smart phone application [27,28]. The layout of the experimental field
    is shown in Fig. 2. The overall field (planting area) was 27.74 × 42.67 m. The
    field consisted of twelve raised beds. Three long beds constitute a block, each
    block was divided into four sections, and each section hosted one irrigation strategy
    treatment (T1 to T4). In overall, the field was divided into 16 experimental sections
    of the same size consisting of three 9.14 m beds. A space of 1.52 m served as
    a buffer zone to separate different treatments and replications. Twenty plants
    were placed in each bed, for a total of 60 plants per experimental section. Treatments
    were arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replicates.
    Four treatments were randomly distributed in each block. The crop was managed
    according to local standards and following integrated pest management practices.

    and GesCoN treatment, respectively. 2.2. Irrigation system setup Fig. 3 shows
    the structure of the irrigation system, including pipelines, valves, pressure
    sensors, flow meters, and other accessories. The water was supplied from the main
    water line of the farm. The main irrigation line after a screen filter was divided
    into four pipelines, one for each treatment. Four latching DC solenoid valves
    (PGV Series 2.54 cm, Hunter Inc., San Marcos, CA) were installed at the beginning
    of each line, followed by the pressure sensors (G1/4, 5 V, 0–1.2 MPa) installed
    at each line behind the solenoid valves to measure the water pressure. The pressure
    indicated the status of the valves. The pressure regulators (241 kPa) behind the
    pressure sensors limited the water pressure reaching the following components.
    The flow meters measured the cumulative flow volume during the experiment. The
    fertigation system constituted by a by-pass with a Venturi injector was used to
    apply fertilizers when recommended by the GesCoN. When fertigation started, the
    injector was opened first, then the switch in the pipeline was closed. When fertigation
    ended, the switch in the pipeline was opened first, then the injector was closed.
    The pressure gauges were used to measure the real-time water pressure and calibrate
    pressure sensors. The last components were pressure regulators at 103 kPa, which
    was the suggested pressure for the irrigation drip tapes. Drip tapes were placed
    underneath the mulch for each section. Then the drip lines on the same treatment
    were connected to the pipes in the field pathway. Finally, these pathway pipes
    were connected to the corresponding pipelines (2.54 cm) for each treatment. Download

    systems setup As indicated in Fig. 2, soil matric potential (MP) sensors, pressure
    sensors, and valves were connected to six data loggers in the irrigation system.
    Fig. 4 illustrates the installation of soil moisture sensors, solenoid valves,
    pressure sensors, and data loggers in the field. The major components of the data
    loggers included a base control board (Vinduino LLC, Temecula, CA) and a LoRaWAN
    wireless Module (LM513-H, GlobalSat WorldCom Corp., New Taipei City, Taiwan) with
    an antenna. Each data logger was powered by a 3.7 V lithium-ion polymer (LiPo)
    battery, and a solar panel (70 × 70 mm) was connected to charge the battery. Data
    loggers 1 and 6 used 10,000 mAh batteries and data loggers 2, 3, 4, and 5 used
    5,000 mAh batteries. Download : Download high-res image (918KB) Download : Download

    sensors (middle), and datalogger (right) in the field. 2.3.1. Soil MP sensor system
    Fig. 5 shows the connection of the soil MP sensors to the data loggers. In each
    treatment, four soil MP sensors (Watermark 200SS-5, Irrometer Company, Inc., Riverside,
    CA) were used, and these MP sensors were connected to one data logger. These four
    sensors were installed in two experimental sections and at two depths (20 and
    40 cm). During the installation, a soil sampler was used to dig a cylinder hole
    at 40 cm depth. The MP sensors were placed into the hole. The original soil was
    backfilled, and water was added to ensure close contact between sensors and soil.
    The average soil MP of two experimental sections at 20 cm was used for starting
    the irrigation in the treatments MP60 and MP40. The sensors at 40 cm were used
    as a reference to check if the water went down to the depth after each irrigation
    or fertigation event. The sensors installed in treatments ET and GesCoN were used
    only for monitoring the soil moisture levels. Download : Download high-res image

    and one power ports SP. Each one has two pins, “+” and “-”. The two wires of a
    sensor can be connected to either pin since MP sensor has no polarity. 2.3.2.
    Water pressure sensor system In the pipeline for each treatment, a pressure sensor
    was installed behind the solenoid valve to indicate the valve status (on or off).
    The sensors were calibrated with the pressure gauges installed on the same pipeline.
    By adjusting the opening of the ball valve, eleven pairs of pressure sensor readings
    and pressure gauge readings from 0 to 207 kPa were used to calibrate the pressure
    sensor. Fig. 6 shows the connection of the pressure sensors to the data loggers.

    VCC of pressure sensors was connected to the corresponding “+” pins of S1–S4.
    The pressure sensors output voltage by signal wire was connected to the “-” pins.
    All the sensor GNDs were connected together to the SP-. 2.3.3. Irrigation valve
    control DC latching solenoid valves were used to control irrigation by connecting
    and disconnecting the water supply. Fig. 7 shows the connection of valves and
    the data logger. The Vinduino board originally supported only one valve. To control
    four valves, the sensor ports on the board were used to extend the capability.
    Sensor ports can send high/low signals at 3.3/0 V, but the current was not enough
    for executing the valves. Four 2-way relays were added to connect the valves to
    the main battery. The signals sent to the IN1 and IN2 on each relay could determine
    the status of the collected valve. When IN1/IN2 is high/low, the valve opens.
    When IN1/IN2 is low/high, the valve closes. When IN1/IN2 remains the same or no
    input, the valve does not respond. Download : Download high-res image (213KB)

    and IN2 ports of the 2-way relay to change electric potential at OUT1 and OUT2
    to turn on or off the valve. 2.4. IoT system and data collection An Internet of
    things (IoT) system was established to connect the sensors, valves, and data loggers
    in the field as shown in Fig. 8. A LoRaWAN gateway (Sentrius™ RG191, Laird Technologies,
    Inc., Chesterfield, MO) was placed in an office at 150 m away from the field.
    These data loggers were set up as end nodes in the IoT system, which were pre-configurated
    with basic algorithms for sensor data recording and communication. Some modifications
    were made in the program to fit for our application for sensor data recording
    and valve control. The gateway and end nodes were configured in a free IoT server
    ‘The Things Network’, newly named ‘The Things Stack’ (TTS, The Things Network,
    Amsterdam, Netherlands). The main specifications of the gateway and the end nodes
    are listed in Table 1. An IoT platform named AllThingsTalk (AllThingsTalk NV,
    Mechelen, Belgium) was used to store and display the sensor data and control the
    valves. Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download : Download full-size

    power +27 dBm +20 dBm To establish the IoT system, the first step was to configure
    the gateway and the end nodes. The LoRaWAN gateway was connected to a computer
    with Wi-Fi for matching the parameters, including using TTS as server and ‘915MHz’
    as band frequency. In the TTS interface, the gateway, application (the whole irrigation
    system), and devices (data loggers) was created. The Application Extended Unique
    Identifier (EUI) and App Key provided by the server were set in the data loggers,
    establishing the connection of the data loggers and the gateway. Once the end
    nodes were powered, they were connected to the TTS after a few seconds. The next
    step was to transmit the data to the AllThingsTalk IoT platform and process the
    data. In TTS interface, AllThingsTalk was integrated to the created application.
    Then AllThingsTalk was linked to TTS. Sensor data were uploaded and stored in
    AllThingsTalk for monitoring and irrigation control. Six ‘Devices’ and several
    ‘Assets’ under ‘Devices’ were added in AllThingsTalk interface corresponding to
    the six data loggers and the sensors or valves in each data logger. The data communication
    frequency was applied with a pre-set time interval, which was 1 min. The time
    for each data transmission duration was 100 ms, which followed the LoRaWAN duty
    cycle regulation of less than 1% of duty cycle. The sensor data (uplink) and valve
    control (downlink) were communicated as binary payload. Each value, such as the
    battery voltage, sensor reading, and valve status was parsed from a byte between
    0 and 255. These were converted to actual values by editing the payload format
    in the ‘Devices’ interface. The valves can be separately controlled to turn on
    or off through AllThingsTalk. The real-time status of the sensors and valves was
    displayed on a pinboard (Fig. 9), which is a customized dashboard in AllThingsTalk.
    The historic data can be displayed, stored, and exported in a comma-separated
    values (CSV) file. The status of the solenoid valves was shown by a circular indicator
    with black color for close and green color for open. The valves were controlled
    to be opened individually or simultaneously. For the two MP-based irrigation treatments,
    the MP sensor readings were compared with the pre-set thresholds, and a notification
    can be sent by email or mobile application when the threshold was reached. However,
    full automation was tested but not applied routinely for the irrigation, instead
    of a manual control through the IoT platform was used to start and end irrigations.
    The major reason was that there was signal loss occasionally on the farm which
    could lead to a delayed response of valves with automatic setting. Download :

    data display and irrigation valve control on the IoT platform (part of the whole
    interface). 2.5. IoT irrigation system performance evaluation The IoT precision
    irrigation system was evaluated throughout the growing season. The IoT system
    function was evaluated, including connectivity and battery usage. The robustness
    of valve control was also tested. Soil moisture from all the sensors was recorded
    and closely monitored. The water usage was recorded after the last harvest by
    reading the flow meter. The crop was harvested five times throughout the growing
    season from August 7, 2020, to September 22, 2020. Harvests were conducted on
    ten representative plants selected in the central row of each experimental unit,
    tomatoes were harvested as single fruits as they turned color, following standard
    harvesting practices [29], and marketable fruit yield was recorded for each treatment.
    Irrigation water use efficiency (iWUE) was calculated by dividing the marketable
    fruit fresh weight by the total water usage for each treatment. Analysis of variance
    (ANOVA) was applied to marketable fruit yield and iWUE for the four treatments.
    Statistical analysis was performed using the MIXED and GLIMMIX procedures in SAS
    9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA., 2016). All means were compared by the
    least significant difference (LSD) test at P ≤ 0.05. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Feasibility of the IoT system In general, the IoT system worked properly
    during the entire irrigation period. There were only a few occasions of data loss
    in the IoT system. Six data loggers had an average data loss rate of 5.51%. The
    gateway was placed inside a building without a window directly facing to the field,
    which may have led to some signal loss. This can be improved if the gateway is
    installed outside with less occlusion. The disconnection of any component such
    as the gateway, the server The Things Network, and the IoT platform AllThingsTalk
    contributed to signal loss. However, the sensing system was not affected significantly
    since data were uploaded at the high frequency of every minute without long period
    of data loss. During the experiment, a few instances of data losses lasted more
    than 10 min were observed. If the irrigation was applied during these periods,
    it is possible that the valves would not respond on time. The batteries in the
    six data loggers were charged by solar panels and maintained sufficient power
    throughout the three-month experiment period. Fig. 8 shows the voltage of these
    batteries over time. There were a few occasions of voltage drop for all data loggers
    due to continuing cloudy and rainy weather. Solar panel wires were inadvertently
    disconnected for data logger 3 between 60 and 70 days after transplanting (DAT),
    resulting in an obvious voltage drop. Overall, the battery voltages were above
    4.0 V throughout the experiment, which showed that the 5,000 mAh LiPo battery
    with a solar panel could support a data logger working continuously in the open
    field (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (482KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. The battery voltage of the six data loggers during the
    experiment. 3.2. Valve control During the experiment, irrigation was applied successfully
    by controlling the status of the solenoid valves with the implemented IoT system.
    When the soil moisture threshold was reached, the platform sent a notification
    through the mobile application and an email to the end-user. The operator then
    turned the corresponding valves on, and the irrigation started. When the valves
    were opened, the status of the valves showed ‘Green’ on the IoT interface, and
    the pressure of the water line indicated a positive reading. When the valves were
    closed after the given time of each irrigation event, the valve status showed
    ‘Black’, and the reading of the pressure sensors returned to zero. It was also
    observed that the valve status changed to ‘Green’ while the pressure sensor reading
    did not change accordingly. In this situation, the valve did not actually open
    with pressurized flowing water. In other words, the solenoid did not respond even
    if the signal was received by the controller. By sending the signal several times,
    the valve did finally open or close. This can be attributed to a clogging in the
    solenoid or a small voltage used for powering the valves (4.0 V). In the future,
    a higher voltage (9.0 V) will be used to improve the robustness of the valve.
    A remote control with manual operation was used in the experiment, while for a
    fully automatic irrigation system, the start and end of an irrigation cycle need
    to be programmed into the controller according to the soil moisture thresholds.
    3.3. Soil moisture monitoring with the IoT system Generally, the sensor readings
    represented the changes in the soil moisture level in the test field. When irrigation
    or relevant rainfall events occurred, the sensor readings responded accordingly,
    showing increased soil moisture levels. For example, Fig. 11 illustrates the daily
    average soil MP60 sensor readings, rainfall, and irrigation of four treatments
    between 35 and 125 DAT. When the average sensor reading at 20 cm reached -60 kPa,
    irrigation started. Thus, the daily average readings of sensors at 20 cm were
    usually above -60 kPa during the experiment. The sensor readings at 40 cm indicated
    that water reached that depth during the irrigation events, but the soil was not
    too wet, which proved that the irrigation was sufficient but not in excess. For
    this treatment, we observed one sensor failure at the beginning of the experiment,
    which is shown by the MP reading that reached large negative values during 45–55
    DAT in one of the 20 cm locations. After replacing the malfunctioning sensor,
    the normal soil matric potential data resumed. Download : Download high-res image

    readings, rainfall, and irrigation of treatment MP60 during the experiment. Fig.
    12 shows the sensor readings around an irrigation event of treatment MP60 at 77
    DAT. The irrigation was applied based on the average readings of two sensors at
    20 cm depth. When the average readings reached -60 kPa at 18:50, the notification
    was sent, and the valve was opened remotely. The increased water pressure readings
    showed that the water was on. The MP sensor readings increased after 30 min and
    stopped increasing after about 2 h. Sensors at 40 cm and at the first installation
    position responded first. Commonly, water reached 20 cm first, then 40 cm. But
    the sensors were not close to the drip tapes, and the irrigation water spread
    in both the vertical and horizontal direction to reach the sensors. For this reason,
    sometimes the irrigation water reached the 40 cm sensors first. At 22:20, the
    irrigation ended, and the water pressure readings went back to 0. Before the irrigation,
    the sensors readings at 20 cm were near -60 kPa, and the sensor readings at 40
    cm were at -100 and -140 kPa. During the irrigation, all the sensor readings gradually
    reached the soil matric potential values above -20 kPa, while sensors at 40 cm
    were still dryer than sensors at 20 cm. There was a slight variation for the MP
    2–1 40 cm sensor after irrigation, which may be due to the accuracy of the sensor
    itself. Sensors at 40 cm depth usually would become dryer faster than sensors
    placed at 20 cm depth. Download : Download high-res image (371KB) Download : Download

    and crop yield performance Table 2 shows the total water usage per unit area,
    the fruit marketable yield, and iWUE of the four treatments. Treatment MP40 used
    30.6% less irrigation water compared to the ET treatment, while there was no significant
    difference in marketable fruit yield between MP40 and ET. However, MP40 marketable
    yield was significantly lower compared to that of MP60 and GesCoN. ET recorded
    the highest irrigation water usage, and MP60 and GesCoN followed by using 3.4
    and 4.1% less irrigation volume compared to ET. At the same time, GesCoN and MP60
    provided 22.1 and 15.2% higher marketable yield compared to ET plots. Tomato fruit
    marketable yield was highest in plots managed with GesCoN, and lowest in plots
    managed with MP40. MP60 provided marketable yield comparable to both GesCoN and
    ET, and higher compared to MP40. ET managed Plots provided marketable yield lower
    than GesCoN, while not statistically different from MP40. Plants irrigated based
    on MP40 and GesCoN had 25.7% and 27.7%, respectively, higher iWUE compared to
    those irrigated based on ET. The iWUE of MP60 plots was not different from those
    of all the other treatments. However, considering the lower marketable yield observed
    in MP40 plots, its high iWUE was not advantageous compared to MP60 and GesCoN.

    irrigation system performed well and could be an excellent tool for the precision
    irrigation management of plasticulture fresh-market tomato. The batteries for
    the data loggers were charged sufficiently by the attached solar panels. A series
    of data were recorded and displayed for the soil matric potential sensors and
    pressure sensors. Irrigation was applied successfully by controlling the solenoid
    valves based on the soil moisture level. Even though no significant negative effects
    were observed in the sensor data monitoring and valve control, the IoT system
    had a data loss rate of 5.5% on average, which may be attributed to the indoor
    gateway placement and disconnection of each component in the network. In future
    studies, more attention will be given to the signal strength and path loss to
    assist addressing the signal loss issues. High frequency of data communication
    (every minute) largely mitigated this problem. Meanwhile, it was observed that
    the valves did not respond with the first sent signal on some occasions, which
    was possibly caused by the low voltage power used for the valves. A higher voltage
    power supply is suggested for future system design. The marketable fruit yield
    and iWUE were analyzed and compared for all four treatments. MP40 used much lower
    irrigation volume than other treatments likely because of improper installation
    and positioning of the soil matric potential sensor. The other three treatments
    used similar irrigation volume, nevertheless, the higher marketable fruit yield
    obtained with GesCoN compared to ET could be explained by a better distribution
    of irrigation water throughout the growing season and potentially by lower loss
    of nutrients. The gain in marketable yield while saving water observed in both
    GesCoN and MP60, compared to ET-based irrigation management, is consistent with
    the results of previous studies. Therefore, we can suggest both methods have the
    potential to improve vegetable crop water use efficiency and sustainability. Moreover,
    the IoT-based system developed using LoRaWAN technology and employing MP sensors
    can be potentially used for precision and automatic irrigation applications in
    vegetable production systems, and could be integrated with the GesCoN that currently
    does not allow automatic irrigation and/or fertigation. To effectively use sensor-based
    irrigation, an adequate number of sensors should be installed in representative
    areas across the field. If the sensors installed do not represent the average
    condition of the field, as was observed with MP40, using multiple sensors can
    mitigate the error induced by malfunctioning or misplaced soil moisture sensors.
    It is important for the sensors to provide representative readings to ensure the
    effectiveness of the sensor-based irrigation. DSS systems such as GesCoN, on the
    other hand, require the use of a nearby weather station and the development and
    calibration of the water balance model for specific crops and environments. If
    the models at the base of the DSS are not accurate, the DSS-based irrigation cannot
    assure optimal crop performances. While the GesCoN does not require the use of
    soil moisture sensors, in the future the two methods could be combined. The sensors’
    readings can be used to double-check the recommendations provided by the DSS.
    Moreover, the sensors’ readings can be used to validate and improve the accuracy
    of the DSS model. In this experiment, the irrigation was controlled manually through
    the IoT platform. The signal loss of the system and no response of valves limited
    the possibility to apply automatic irrigation control. Future improvements will
    be made with adding automatic irrigation rules to the IoT platform or in the data
    logger to achieve fully automatic irrigation. 4. Conclusion An IoT-based precision
    irrigation system with LoRaWAN technology was developed and evaluated in a plasticulture
    fresh-market tomato field. The following major conclusions can be drawn from the
    study: (1) In general, the system worked effectively for irrigation application
    in the tomato field. The soil moisture levels were monitored and recorded throughout
    the growing season. The irrigation was applied successfully by controlling the
    solenoid valves based on the soil moisture level. The batteries for the data loggers
    were charged sufficiently by the attached solar panels. (2) The IoT system provided
    real-time soil moisture data and indicated that the scheduled irrigations for
    the matric potential treatments are sufficient. (3) Among tested treatments, MP40
    provided the worst performance in terms of marketable yield, while GesCoN provided
    the best performance increasing yield (22.1%) and iWUE (27.7%) compared to ET-based
    irrigation scheduling. MP60 provided the second-best performance, although marketable
    yield and iWUE were not significantly different from both GesCoN and ET-based
    irrigation scheduling. The results suggest that the developed IoT-based system
    using LoRaWAN technology can be potentially used for precision and automatic irrigation
    applications and improve the sustainability of vegetable production systems enhancing
    marketable yield while saving irrigation water. In the future, using outdoor gateway
    and higher voltage batteries for driving the solenoid valve may further improve
    the LoRaWAN IoT based irrigation system. Declaration of Competing Interest The

  description: The digitalization of the agricultural sector through the implementation
    of cutting-edge technologies allows for the optimization of the use of water,
    whose scarcity has become one of the most relevant and complex environmental global
    problems. Water consumption data collected on site using different technologies
    is key to achieving optimal irrigation scheduling. Technology is also a useful
    tool that provides a real and transparent inventory of water use in irrigated
    crops. The water footprint obtained in accordance with ISO standard 14046 (using
    the Life Cycle Analysis methodology) and jointly with irrigation management information
    allows determining water use efficiency with great accuracy. This work presents
    a decision support system developed for precision irrigation management at farm
    scale called DSSPIM. The system provides a verifiable inventory of water use and
    an analysis/diagnosis of the adequacy of the irrigation performed using information
    and communication technologies (ICTs), as well as real-time knowledge of water
    inputs and outputs during crop development based on data received from water meters
    and soil moisture sensors installed in the field. Additionally, to achieve both
    purposes, a methodology is proposed to more accurately estimate rainwater use
    (green water) based on real measurements and the use of ICTs. The proposed methodology
    was applied during one season in two organic crops (greenhouse tomatoes and orange
    trees) located in southern Spain. The model allowed detecting inefficiencies in
    irrigation water use. A comparison between the actual management practices and
    the practices recommended by the DSSPIM underlines the importance of irrigation
    management in improving water use. In the case of orange trees, different irrigation
    system management scenarios were compared and showed that the application of controlled
    deficit irrigation strategies using DSSPIM can reduce irrigation water use by
    20%.

    has become one of the greatest and most complex challenges in the world as human
    activity is one of the main drivers of water resources pressures (UNESCO, 2009).
    Irrigated agriculture is the largest human activity using water resources. Agricultural
    production accounts for 70% of the world’s freshwater withdrawals (FAO, 2017).
    The demand for freshwater in the agricultural sector is driven by increasing food
    demand, which is directly linked to population growth. Due to exponential demographic
    growth, the new production systems are characterized by a greater use of inputs
    (Sanz, 1990). The growing use of inputs along with climate change has intensified
    the negative effects on both the quantity and quality of water resources (FAO,
    2017). To address this problem, global agriculture must increase food production
    without compromising environmental preservation (Monaghan et al., 2013) through
    strategies for more efficient water use. In this context, the implementation of
    precision irrigation systems using cutting-edge technologies is among the proposed
    strategies to use water more efficiently. Information gathered from the field
    through remote sensors and sent to be analyzed using information and communication
    technologies (ICTs) is key to accurately determine crop water needs and apply
    the optimal amount of water at the right time (Fernández García et al., 2020).
    Several authors have developed ICT tools to support irrigation water management.
    González Perea et al. (2017) developed a mobile and desktop application that uses
    ICT tools to determine the daily irrigation time for strawberry crops in southwestern
    Spain using agroclimatic and soil information as well as the hydraulic characteristics
    of the irrigation network. Alcaide et al. (2019) used climate forecasting to determine
    the optimal fertigation schedule for olive groves in real time based on the theoretical
    soil water balance, the quality of the irrigation water and the crop and soil
    characteristics. In both works, soil moisture sensors were used to control scheduled
    irrigation. Goldstein et al. (2018) applied machine learning techniques to meteorological
    data, soil moisture sensor readings and historical irrigation schedules to capture
    the unstructured decision-making process of the irrigation manager and automatically
    provide irrigation scheduling. Similar works (Casadesús et al., 2012, Millán et
    al., 2019) have also performed a water balance readjusted with sensor information
    to determine irrigation scheduling but only for woody crops. Although rainfall
    is an essential parameter in optimal irrigation scheduling, some works do not
    take it into account (Goldstein et al., 2018). Irrigation programming models usually
    include rainfall in a simplistic way through general formulations to estimate
    the effective rainfall and to account for the rainwater water used by the crop
    (Alcaide et al., 2019, Smith and FAO, 1992). The water footprint (WF) indicator
    is a useful tool for analyzing potential water scarcity scenarios because it quantifies
    the volume of direct and indirect crop water use to produce a unit of output (Hoekstra,
    2003). Since it was first introduced in 2002, the WF concept has been in constant
    evolution and some authors have addressed it in the context of life cycle analysis
    (LCA) in terms of potential impacts on the environment (Bayart et al., 2010, Berger
    and Finkbeiner, 2010, Boulay et al., 2016, Chapagain and Orr, 2009, Jefferies
    et al., 2012, Pfister et al., 2009). For this reason, ISO standard 14046 (ISO,
    2014) aims to unify the multiple definitions and methodologies of WF assessment
    in the methodological context of LCA (ISO standard 14040, ISO, 2006). The accuracy
    and interpretation of WF results depend on the spatial-temporal scale and quality
    of the WF inventory phase (González Perea et al., 2016, Montesinos et al., 2011).
    In this phase, the water input and outputs of the system being assessed are recorded
    and quantified. In irrigated crops, water footprint accounting can be applied
    to evaluate water use efficiency through the relationship between water use and
    crop yield (García Morillo et al., 2015). However, WF does not provide information
    about the adequacy of applied irrigation. For this reason, it is essential to
    obtain verifiable, quality data on farm water use to identify problems in irrigation
    facilities and/or their operation. Irrigation management indicators, such as relative
    irrigation supply (RIS) (Levine, 1982), are used to diagnose such situations and
    make decisions to improve water use efficiency. Some authors have used ICTs to
    acquire the data needed to accurately account for crop WF and linked this information
    with additional indicators to provide details of how irrigation has been carried
    out (García Morillo et al., 2015, González Perea et al., 2016). However, recorded
    data have not yet been used to perform optimal irrigation scheduling that takes
    into account crop water needs in real time. This study aims to develop an irrigation
    management tool that takes full advantage of the utilities of the available field
    technology (sensors and telecommunication systems) by jointly analyzing WF, RIS
    and irrigation scheduling to maximize water use efficiency. To this end, a decision
    support system (DSS) has been developed to determine the real-time scheduling
    of a precision irrigation system for outdoor woody crops and greenhouse horticultural
    crops with a drip irrigation system. The methodological approach involves the
    use of weather forecasts and real-time data recorded by soil water sensors and
    water meters combined with ICTs to update irrigation scheduling in real time.
    The information is also analyzed to obtain verifiable WF inventories and irrigation
    performance indicators and evaluate the efficiency of the precision irrigation
    system at farm scale (in accordance with the ISO standard 14046). In addition,
    the proposed decision support system includes a procedure to estimate the amount
    of green water used by the crops from real soil water data. The methodology was
    applied during the 2019/2020 irrigation season on two commercial farms that produce
    greenhouse tomato and orange crops in southern Spain. 2. Methodology 2.1. Decision
    support system for precision irrigation management The decision support system
    developed for precision irrigation management (DSSPIM) uses data recorded by sensors
    installed in the field, as well as data on the crop characteristics, soil type,
    hydraulic characteristics of the irrigation network, climate (historical and predicted
    data) and information on water availability and crop yield to provide an optimal,
    weekly irrigation schedule. Additionally, DSSPIM measures the amount of water
    the crops use in real time throughout the growing season to obtain an accurate
    and verifiable WF and uses several irrigation management indicators to assess
    the irrigation water efficiency. Thus, DSSPIM is composed of four modules: farm
    characteristics, climate and irrigation monitoring data, irrigation scheduling
    and water use analysis/diagnosis. Each of the modules is described below and their
    interrelations are shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (377KB)

    System for Precision Irrigation Management). 2.1.1. Farm characteristics This
    module collects and manages information about the cultivation of drip irrigated
    crops on a given farm, as well as the data needed to estimate the WF of the crops.
    For woody crops, the required data are plantation frame (m∙m) and average diameter
    of the tree canopy (m). In the case of greenhouse crops, the required data include
    planting dates, the spacing between crop lines, the slope of the greenhouse roof
    (°), the start and end dates of roof whitening and the whitening dose (kg lime/100 L
    of water). The irrigation network is characterized by the number of pipes per
    crop line, the distance between emitters (m), the nominal flow rate of the emitters
    (L/h) and the sector area (ha). Farm water management and use depend on the contracted
    electricity rate. Power supply rates differ according to the number, duration
    and distribution of tariff periods. The daily number of hours available for irrigation
    are usually limited due to the farm’s electricity rate (low-cost period) or operational
    conditions. To keep the recommended irrigation time within the limits of the available
    irrigation hours, the user must select the tariff type and the irrigation period
    or manually enter the maximum number of hours available for irrigation from Monday
    to Friday and weekends. Finally, the water allowance (m3/ha∙year), electrical
    conductivity of irrigation water (dS/m), soil texture, the yield of the previous
    season and the first day of the growing season and the last day of harvest (t/ha)
    must be known. 2.1.2. Climate and irrigation monitoring data collection This module
    collects climate and water use monitoring data by means of ICTs. The information
    is then used to calculate the theoretical crop irrigation needs. Historical climate
    date and weather forecasts are obtained from public weather services. Using web
    scraping techniques, real precipitation (P) and historical potential evapotranspiration
    (ETo) records are obtained from the nearest public agroclimatic station (NAS)
    of the regional agroclimatic information network (RIA, 1999). The complete ETo
    time series is used to determine the historical crop requirements. Daily crop
    evapotranspiration under optimal and well-watered conditions (ETc) (Pereira et
    al., 2021) is estimated based on ETo forecasts calculated from open weather data
    (maximum and minimum daily relative humidity information, %) and data obtained
    from online weather forecasts (maximum and minimum temperature, °C; cloud index,
    %; wind speed, km/h). The open weather data were taken from the AEMET Open Data
    system, which is the API REST (application programming interface representational
    state transfer) of the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET, 2015). The online
    weather forecast data were obtained from the eltiempo.es website (Pelmorex Corp,
    2017) by web scraping techniques. These data are used to calculate the ETo of
    outdoor crops for the next 7 days by the Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al.,
    1998). The ETo for greenhouse crops is estimated using the equation of a locally
    calibrated radiation method proposed by Fernández et al. (2010). Weather precipitation
    forecasts are also obtained from eltiempo.es and used in the irrigation scheduling
    of outdoor crops. Soil moisture sensors and water meters are used to monitor crop
    water use. Although several types of commercial sensors are available for this
    purpose, frequency domain reflectrometry (FDR) capacitance moisture sensors are
    the most widely used to monitor and measure changes in soil volumetric water content
    (VWC) due to their reliability and ease of use (Vera et al., 2017). For each crop,
    a measurement device with three ECHO20 10HS capacitive sensors (Meter Group, USA)
    was placed at different soil depths to record variations in soil moisture due
    to crop absorption during the growing season. The three sensors were installed
    in different soil layers: one in the upper soil layer (at a depth of 10–15 cm),
    one at the depth with the highest root density (20–35 cm) and one in the bottom
    soil layer with few roots. A high moisture content in the deepest layer indicates
    water losses by percolation and hence an inefficient use of irrigation water.
    Since irrigation scheduling is done for homogeneous sectors, it is necessary to
    install at least one soil moisture monitoring device in a representative location
    of each irrigation sector. The level of sectorization of each farm will depend
    on the variability of several factors (soil, topography and crop variety, among
    others). Inadequate sectorization would compromise the accuracy of DSSPIM. The
    amount of water used is recorded by water meters installed at the inlet of each
    irrigation sector. These water meters have an electronic sensor that emits a signal
    once a volume unit has flowed through the meter. Soil moisture sensors and water
    meters are connected to dataloggers with General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) communication
    that records and transmits measured data in real time to a cloud platform accessible
    via an API. 2.1.3. Irrigation scheduling The aim of this module is to determine
    daily irrigation time for outdoor and greenhouse crops. For outdoor crops, soil
    water content is an essential variable in irrigation scheduling. When the amount
    of water stored in the soil can satisfy crop irrigation needs, then irrigation
    is not necessary. To determine whether irrigation is needed or not, a daily soil
    water balance is performed. For greenhouse crops that do not receive rainwater
    and are watered with high frequency irrigation, the soil’s function as a water
    store is negligible, and it can be assumed that soil water content does not change
    over time (Fernández et al., 2001). The soil water balance is updated daily using
    the information gathered in the data collection modules. The irrigation scheduling
    module is described in what follows and the module flowchart is shown in Fig.
    2. Download : Download high-res image (788KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Flowchart of the irrigation scheduling module. The total water available
    in the soil (TAW, mm) for a crop is a function of the crop’s depth of roots (Zr,
    m) and the soil water contents at field capacity (θFC, m3/m3) and at the permanent
    wilting point (θPWP, m3/m3). The last two parameters depend on the hydrophilic
    characteristics of the soil. They were estimated using the soil water retention
    curves resulting from the application of the ROSETTA model, which bases its estimations
    on the soil texture characteristics (Schaap et al., 2001). Soil textures were
    determined in the laboratory from soil samples taken on each farm. Only a fraction
    of TAW is available for the crop, what is known as the readily available water
    (RAW, mm) (Allen et al., 1998). When the soil moisture deficit (Dr, mm), or level
    of moisture depletion, reaches RAW in the root zone, water extraction is more
    difficult for the plant and its ETc is reduced. The RAW for the orange grove was
    50% of TAW (Allen et al., 1998). Therefore, to avoid a decrease in ETc, 20% of
    TAW was set as the threshold of the allowable depletion level (ADL, mm) in the
    soil to start irrigation. To determine Drn (mm) in the soil at the end of day
    n (soil water balance), Drtheoretical,n (mm) and Drreal,n (mm) must be previously
    calculated using Eqs. (1), (2), respectively, adapted from Allen et al. (1998).
    Eq. (1) estimates the soil water deficit without considering runoff and percolation
    losses. (1) Where Drn-1 is the soil moisture depletion of the previous day (mm),
    ERn is the effective rainfall on day n (mm) whose calculation is described below
    for outdoor crops (Section 2.1.3.1), and for greenhouse crops ERn is zero. In
    is the real applied irrigation depth measured by the water meter (mm) and is the
    crop evapotranspiration (mm) calculated as the product of ETo on day n and the
    crop coefficient (Kc). can be calculated from historical ETo values (recorded
    by the nearest agroclimatic station) or ETo predictions (calculated using the
    methodology described in Section 2.1.2). When the objective is to determine the
    Dr value of the current day, the ETo value recorded the previous day by the NAS
    is used. However, if the purpose is to estimate the Dr of the next 7 days, ETo
    predictions are used. Kc at day n (Allen et al., 1998) which depends on the crop
    type and stage of development. In woody crops, Kc is related to the ground area
    shaded by trees (Castel Sánchez, 2001), while for greenhouse crops it is a function
    of the accumulated thermal time (ATT) since emergence (Fernández et al., 2001).
    Ks is a non-dimensional coefficient of water stress (Allen et al., 1998) that
    quantifies the reduction in transpiration when the soil water deficit exceeds
    the RAW. If the water depletion in the root zone is less than the RAW, the value
    of this coefficient is equal to 1. Eq. (2) calculates actual soil moisture depletion
    from the VWC at field capacity and the VWC recorded on site (θreal, m3/m3). The
    latter value is the average of soil moisture records taken at sunset by sensors
    located in the top and middle soil layers. (2) After irrigation, the soil water
    content exceeds θFC for a while, after which the soil drains and the water content
    is stabilized. At sunset, the sensors provide information about the remaining
    water content in the soil after the daily evapotranspiration period. When θreal
    exceeds a certain percentage of the θFC value, x, the moisture deficit at the
    end of the day (Drn) is considered 0 and the soil at field capacity. Conversely,
    if θreal is lower than the set threshold, the value assigned to Drn will be the
    highest between Drreal,n and Drtheorical,n, so the most limiting value was considered
    to determine the irrigation timing (3). (3) Once the irrigation timing is determined
    using Drn, daily crop irrigation requirements are calculated according to equation
    ( 4): (4) Where ETc is the crop evapotranspiration under optimal and well-watered
    conditions and is calculated using the forecast ETo values. The coefficients fCE,
    fPte and fRs are correction factors that depend on the electrical conductivity
    of irrigation water, the slope of the greenhouse roof and whitening, respectively
    (Fernández et al., 2001). For outdoor crops, the value of the fPte and fRs factors
    is 1. In water scarce regions, deficit irrigation strategies are usually applied
    in woody crops when the water irrigation requirements exceed water rights. Therefore,
    the theoretical daily irrigation dose (INn) is calculated according to Eq. (5),
    where IDCn is the irrigation deficit coefficient and ranges from 0 to 1 depending
    on the selected irrigation strategy. (5) When the crop irrigation needs are fully
    satisfied (FIR strategy), IDCn is equal to 1 for the entire irrigation season.
    In a sustained deficit irrigation (SDI) strategy, IDCn is a fraction of the crop
    irrigation needs and its value remains constant throughout the irrigation season.
    On the other hand, in a regulated deficit irrigation strategy (RDI) a variable
    fraction of crop irrigation requirements is applied throughout the irrigation
    season. This fraction of the crop irrigation needs depends on the crop cycle and
    aims to prevent or reduce to the greatest possible extent water stress in the
    most sensitive crop stages such as flowering or fruit set (Gonzalez-Altozano and
    Castel, 1999). Therefore, IDC varies during the irrigation season. The total amount
    of irrigation water to be applied in the irrigation season cannot exceed the irrigation
    water allowance (IWA), regardless of the irrigation strategy chosen. For this
    reason, IDC is combined with the average fortnightly ETc (historical data) to
    distribute the water allowance according to the crop irrigation needs and a fortnightly
    IWA (IWAf) is set. Any deviation from the established limit is recorded by the
    irrigation meter and at the end of each fortnight the remaining allocation is
    redistributed proportionally to the irrigation needs of the remaining months of
    the irrigation season, readjusting the established limits every 15 days. To avoid
    exceeding the IWA value at the end of the irrigation season, a daily limit of
    water availability (ILn) is established. ILn is the quotient between IWAf and
    the number of days in each half-month (between 13 and 16 days). Therefore, the
    actual crop irrigation requirement (IRn), i.e., the volume of water to be applied
    in each irrigation event, will be equal to the minimum of INn and ILn Eq. (6).
    (6) The theoretical irrigation time tt,n (hours) is calculated by Eq. (7) considering
    the efficiency of the irrigation system IE, the area of the irrigation sector
    A (ha), the nominal emitters flow qe (l/h) and the number of emitters of the irrigation
    sector ne (7) The programmed watering time cannot exceed the number of available
    irrigation hours established in the electric supply contract (te,n). Thus, the
    recommended irrigation time (tr,n) is the minimum of tt,n and te,n. Fig. 2 shows
    the flowchart of the irrigation scheduling procedure using data collected by the
    sensors via ICTs. The boxes with rounded edges and thick lines in the figure indicate
    that the data are from the farm characteristics module. In the boxes with dashed
    lines, the data have been recorded by sensors (on site or remotely) and sent via
    ICTs to the climate and irrigation monitoring data module. The precipitation and
    ETo records at the NAS, as well as the soil moisture content readings at sunset
    are updated according to the weather forecasts. The aim of this DSSPIM module
    is to provide daily optimal irrigation programming for a week, so predictions
    of the soil moisture depletion for the next 7 days are needed. To do this, the
    last Drn that was calculated is used as a starting value, In is the recommended
    irrigation depth (In = IRn) and the effective precipitation, ERn, is obtained
    with Eq. (8) using precipitation predictions for the value of Pn. The accuracy
    of the irrigation programming affects the values of blue and green water uses
    by the crops and hence the irrigation water use efficiency. 2.1.3.1. Efficient
    rainfall estimation for outdoor crops The water needs of outdoor crops are partially
    satisfied with rainwater. Effective rainfall, ERn in Eq. (1), is the rainwater
    fraction stored in the soil that can be used by the plant. Most existing methodologies
    estimate ER based on monthly rainwater volume (Ali and Mubarak, 2017, Allen et
    al., 1998, Smith and FAO, 1992, Villalobos et al., 2009), which reduces the accuracy
    of daily irrigation scheduling. To overcome this problem, DSSPIM includes a procedure
    to calculate daily ER that considers the water storage capacity of the soil, which
    depends on the soil type and the soil moisture content at the onset of the rainfall
    event. Eq. (8) estimates the effective rainfall using information from the previous
    day’s soil moisture deficit, Drn-1 (Eq. 3), and the gross rainfall at day n, (mm).
    This equation uses rainfall forecasts and rainfall data recorded by the NAS. NAS
    rainfall data are used to calculate the effective rainfall of the last day. When
    the purpose is to predict the effective rainfall of the next 7 days, precipitation
    forecasts are used (8) If Pn is lower than , the total gross precipitation can
    be stored, so ERn equals Pn. Otherwise, ER is 0 because soil moisture content
    is at field capacity. The 7-day forward irrigation scheduling requires the ERn
    and ETc, n forecasts. Thus, Eq. (8) is calculated using ETo and rainfall forecasts.
    2.1.4. Water use analysis/diagnosis This module determines the adequacy of the
    amount of water used according to the crop irrigation needs by means of a joint
    analysis of the WF and RIS indicators. The module performs a WF inventory according
    to ISO standard 14046 (ISO, 2014), which provides information on the volume of
    water used to produce a unit of product. The WF inventory estimates the crop water
    footprint (WFC) as the sum of the blue (WFblue) and green (WFgreen) water footprint
    components. Grey water has not been considered in the WF inventory because it
    is not a real volume of water used by crops. This water represents the amount
    of fresh water that would theoretically be needed to restore the quality of irrigation
    water returns that have been contaminated during the production process. For this
    reason, ISO 14046 does not include grey water in the calculation of WF of products
    and/or services (Lovarelli et al., 2016). WFC is normally expressed in m3/t or
    in L/kg and is the sum of the green crop water footprint (WFcgreen) and the blue
    crop water footprint (WFcblue). WFcgreen can be calculated as green crop water
    use (CWUgreen, m3/ ha) divided by the crop yield (Y, t/ha): (9) CWUgreen is calculated
    by Eq. (10) for outdoor crops and is null for greenhouse crops: (10) Where the
    term 10 is a unit conversion factor to change mm into m3/ha, lds is the duration
    of the crop growing season in days and ERn is calculated by Eq. (8). For permanent
    crops, the first day of the growing season is the last harvest day of the previous
    season. To estimate WFcblue, the following equation is applied (11) Where CWAblue
    (m3/ha) is the total volume of blue water applied to the crop as recorded by the
    water meters installed on the farm. The approach to calculate WFblue presented
    here differs from other works where WFblue is estimated with the CWUblue indicator,
    which is calculated using theoretical irrigation requirements (Chapagain and Orr,
    2009, Hoekstra et al., 2009). These methodologies do not take into account indirect
    water uses or water losses (water that does not return to the environment) due
    to inefficiencies in the irrigation system. Furthermore, it ignores situations
    of over- or under-irrigation due to the irrigation strategies applied. Thus, CWAblue
    includes all water applications during the crop season, including water applied
    to satisfy crop irrigation needs and water used in different crop management practices
    (e.g., soil preparation, salt washing, pipe cleaning, etc.) and water leaks in
    the irrigation system. Unless crop management practices involving water use are
    performed during non-irrigation periods or via a separate water network, it is
    difficult to identify the fraction of the water volumes recorded in the meter
    that correspond to irrigation or other uses required to obtain the product. Therefore,
    the amount of blue water used during the cropping season is obtained by Eq. (12).
    (12) Where In is the daily applied blue water depth (mm) recorded by the water
    meter i, wm represents the total number of water meters installed on the farm
    and Ai is the area (ha) associated to each water meter i installed in the different
    irrigation sectors. The denominator of this equation represents the total surface
    area of the farm monitored with irrigation meters. Since CWAblue is used to calculate
    WFblue, it provides information about the amount of blue water used directly and
    indirectly to produce a crop production unit. In short, the crop water footprint
    is determined by Eq. (13). (13) When used alone, the WF only reports information
    about how much water was used to obtain a unit of product, but it does not provide
    information about whether the amount of water applied was correct or not. Therefore,
    to check irrigation water use suitability, irrigation adequacy indicators should
    be used in combination with the WF. To evaluate the suitability of the actual
    applied irrigation, the RIS indicator was used (Levine, 1982). RIS (Eq. 14) relates
    the amount of water applied (recorded in the water meters) and the theoretical
    crop irrigation requirements during crop growing (García Morillo et al., 2015,
    González Perea et al., 2016). (14) RIS values around 1.2 indicate that irrigation
    has been adequately performed, considering the inefficiencies of the soil and
    the irrigation system. Values below and above 1.2 indicate deficit and excess
    irrigation, respectively. 2.2. Case studies The methodology was tested on two
    organic farms in southern Spain: one with orange tree crops (37° 44′ 9.39′’ N,
    −5° 6′ 58.69′’ W) and the other with greenhouse tomato crops (36° 51′ 23.32′’
    N, −2° 24′ 37.54′’ W). The citrus fruit plantation (Navelina variety) is located
    in the Guadalquivir valley, an area that receives about 600 mm of average annual
    rainfall and where a high percentage of the cultivated land area is dedicated
    to irrigated crops 28.92% of total national irrigation; (MAPA, 2019). The high
    demand for irrigation water in the Guadalquivir basin means that water rights
    are usually lower than the crop water requirements. Consequently, deficit irrigation
    strategies are a common practice in the region. The planting frame of the trial
    orange grove was 5.5 m x 4 m and was drip irrigated by an irrigation network organized
    in 2-ha sectors where irrigation water is distributed through two irrigation laterals
    per tree line. The nominal flow rate of the emitters was 2.8 L/h (1 m separation
    between emitters) with a pressure compensation range of 10–40 m. The farm receives
    water from the Fuente Palmera Irrigation Association from 00:00–8:00 a.m. Monday
    to Friday and 24 h a day on weekends. During the 2019 irrigation season, the water
    allocation assigned to this farm was 5000 m3/ha with a daily ETo in the range
    0.5–7.8 mm. The soil texture of the farm was analyzed in the laboratory and identified
    as sandy loam with a moisture content at field capacity of 0.28 m3/m3 and a permanent
    wilting point of 0.1 m3/m3. The average annual yield of the orange grove was 15 t/ha,
    considering the growing season as the natural year from the time the harvest finishes
    in January. The trial tomato greenhouse is located in Almería, southeast Spain.
    The water resources in this area are very scarce and under severe pressure from
    intensive agriculture, which aggravates problems of overexploitation, pollution
    and the salinization of aquifers (Gallardo et al., 2013). These circumstances
    require the optimal use of irrigation water, so greenhouse tomatoes are particularly
    interesting for testing the methodology developed. The greenhouse tomato cycle
    extends from mid-August to the end of May without rainfall inputs. The greenhouse
    roof whitening technique was applied from planting to mid-September at a dose
    of 0.25 kg lime/L. This technique is used to reduce the temperature inside the
    greenhouse, but it also reduces solar radiation inside the greenhouse, leading
    to a reduction in ETo (Fernández et al., 2010). During the 2019–2020 season, the
    ETo values inside the greenhouse ranged from 0.1 to 4.5 mm. The water source for
    the greenhouse is an irrigation pond fed by a groundwater intake. The irrigation
    network is composed of four irrigation sectors (0.7 ha) in which each drip pipe
    irrigates a line of plants spaced 2.05 m apart. The nominal flow rate of the drippers
    was 4 L/h (non-pressure compensating) placed every 0.4 m. The average electrical
    conductivity of the irrigation water was 2 dS/m. The greenhouse soil was of loamy
    texture and 27 cm in depth (bounded by a hardened profile). The moisture content
    at field capacity was 0.34 m3/m3 and the permanent wilting point was 0.08 m3/m3.
    Under these conditions, the average yield of the tomato greenhouse was 109 t/ha
    (10.9 kg/m2) for a planting density of 1.5 plants/m2 (branch and cocktail varieties).
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Application of DSSPIM to the case studies To test
    the effectiveness of the methodology described in this work, DSSPIM was implemented
    during the 2019 crop season to manage the precision irrigation systems of two
    commercial organic farms that produce oranges and greenhouse tomatoes. In both
    case studies, weather forecasts from the AEMET Open Data system (AEMET, 2015)
    and the eltiempo.es website (Pelmorex Corp, 2017) were used. Historical climate
    data were obtained from the public agroclimatic stations closest to each farm
    (Palma del Río for the orange trees and Almería for the greenhouse tomatoes).
    Likewise, the evolution of soil water content was monitored using capacitive sensors
    installed at depths of 15, 40 and 55 cm in the orange tree test plot and at depths
    of 10, 17 and 25 cm in the tomato greenhouse. 3.1.1. Irrigation management of
    the orange grove DSSPIM was applied to analyze various irrigation scheduling strategies
    (FIR and RDI) in an orange grove farm during the growing season. The results of
    DSSPIM have been compared with the actual irrigation scheduling. Three scenarios
    defined for different irrigation strategies were studied. In scenario 1, the FIR
    strategy was applied (Fig. 3), while the RDI strategy was applied in scenario
    2 (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the actual irrigation management on the farm (scenario
    3) during the study season. Download : Download high-res image (227KB) Download

    depletion level (ADL), readily available water (RAW) and total available water
    (TAW). DOY is the day of the year. To calculate the daily soil moisture deficit
    in scenarios 1 and 2, Eq. (1) was used. In scenario 3, Eq. (3) was used to determine
    Drn, taking 0.2 as the value of parameter “x”. Fig. 3A shows the daily rainfall
    distribution recorded at the NAS and the effective rainfall (ER), which were calculated
    from January 1 to December 31, 2019 (365 days of the year [DOY]) using Eq. (8).
    The irrigation scheduling proposed by DSSPIM for the FIR strategy is presented
    in Fig. 3B and Fig. 3C, which show the evolution of the soil moisture depletion
    level throughout the crop season with respect to the ADL, RAW and TAW thresholds
    of soil water deficit (Section 2.1.3). Although the objective of this irrigation
    strategy was to satisfy crop irrigation needs, the irrigation schedule was conditioned
    by the IWA (500 mm), since the water needs of the orange trees exceeded this value
    by 42%. The total irrigation applied following this strategy was 495 mm. The soil
    water content decreased rapidly during the first months of the year due to low
    rainfall (Fig. 3C), so the irrigation season started in mid-March. Several precipitation
    events in spring (Fig. 3A) from DOY 90 to DOY 120 increased the soil water content
    above the ADL level, so irrigation was not necessary. Later, in the summer months,
    crop water demand was higher than the applied irrigation (limited by IWA), so
    the plants took water from the soil until the soil moisture deficit (Dr) reached
    the RAW value (Fig. 3C). From this threshold, water extraction was more difficult
    for the plants and ETc was reduced (Ks < 1), so the rate of increase of the moisture
    deficit decreased. In the autumn months, from DOY 300, Dr decreased due to new
    rainfall events and the amount of water stored in the soil increased. In 2019,
    the gross precipitation recorded on the farm by the NAS was 318 mm and the total
    effective precipitation estimated for 2019 using the FIR strategy was 247 mm.
    For the same precipitation value, the lower the soil moisture deficit (which depends
    on the irrigation strategy), the lower the ER value. Thus, for example, on DOY
    31 (Fig. 3A), when the gross precipitation was 22 mm, only 5 mm were useful for
    the plants and the rest of the gross precipitation was lost by percolation, runoff
    or evaporation. In contrast, from DOY 91–121, ER was equal to P because the value
    of Dr was high, and the soil had the capacity to store all the precipitation.
    Fig. 4 shows the irrigation management in the second scenario in which the RDI
    strategy was applied using IDC values adapted to the local conditions (García-Tejero
    et al., 2010). Unlike the first scenario, daily irrigation scheduling was not
    as constrained by the daily IWA value. The theoretical irrigation requirements
    at the critical phenological stages of the crop were more restrictive than the
    daily IWA values. This situation caused the moisture deficit to exceed the RAW
    for a longer time and the plants were subjected to a reduction in ETc. In the
    first scenario (Fig. 3C), this situation occurred between DOY 198 and 323, while
    in the second scenario (Fig. 4C) it started 28 days earlier (DOY 170). However,
    both strategies prevented the reduction of ETc during flowering, the most sensitive
    period for the crop. At this phenological stage, water stress can lead to yield
    losses. In the RDI strategy, 403 mm of irrigation water were applied, 20% less
    than that applied with the FIR strategy. This irrigation strategy, which led to
    higher values of the moisture deficit at the end of summer, achieved higher ER
    values (266 mm for the whole season) than scenario 1 and scenario 3. The actual
    irrigation management is shown in Fig. 5. In the 2019 irrigation season, the total
    irrigation water use recorded in the water meter was 497 mm (Fig. 5B). The total
    volume of water applied was equal to the recommended volume obtained by the FIR
    strategy. However, because the irrigation management performed by the farmer was
    not the same as the schedule obtained with DSSPIM, the evolution of the soil moisture
    differed significantly from that shown in Fig. 3C. Due to the longer duration
    and frequency of irrigations, the soil moisture content was maintained at values
    close to θFC, thus indicating non-optimal water use. In this situation, the soil
    moisture content is sufficient to meet the ETc requirements of the plants and
    no further irrigations would be necessary until Dr reaches ADL. Even so, the farmer
    applied irrigations between DOY 150 and 197. Moreover, unlike the first two scenarios,
    the Dr in the actual irrigation management was kept close to the RAW between DOY
    143 and 150 (end of May); a situation that should have been avoided since reductions
    in ETc during flowering can affect yield. As a result, the calculated ER for this
    scenario was 238 mm, which represents 75% of the gross annual precipitation (318.4 mm).
    When using ER calculation procedures based on empirical equations (Smith and FAO,
    1992), the ER is higher (between 7% and 20%) than that obtained with DSSPIM, as
    the other procedures do not consider the soil moisture content before rainfall
    events. The moisture deficit in winter is very low (Fig. 5C) so the soil can only
    store a small portion of the rainwater. 3.1.2. Irrigation management of the tomato
    greenhouse In the case study of greenhouse tomato, there is no limit for water
    allocation and the soil’s water storage capacity is not considered in the irrigation
    scheduling of this type of crops (Fernández et al., 2001). Consequently, irrigation
    programming is only conditioned by crop evapotranspiration and since it is a horticultural
    crop, the FIR irrigation strategy is used to manage irrigation. The crop growing
    season started on August 20, 2019 and ended on May 25, 2020. Because water meters
    were installed after the crops were planted, only water inputs were monitored
    during the growing period, without considering previous watering for soil preparation.
    In this case, the soil moisture sensors were used only to monitor the applied
    irrigation. Fig. 6 shows both the actual water application during the irrigation
    season and the irrigation scheduling computed by DSSPIM. Download : Download high-res

    management by DSSPIM for greenhouse tomatoes throughout the 2019/2020 crop season.
    DOY is the day of the year. The actual amount of irrigation water applied by the
    farmer during the season was 558 mm (according to the water meter records), while
    the volume recommended by DSSPIM was 654 mm. From DOY 352 (2019), significant
    deviations were observed between the proposed and actual schedule. In contrast
    to the recommended irrigation schedule, in the actual schedule there were days
    when no irrigation occurred. This is because certain environmental conditions
    inside the greenhouse (relative humidity and ventilation) were not included in
    DSSPIM. The main difference occurred in the last month of the crop season (May,
    from DOY 122–146) when the farmer decided to apply 65% of the water needs in the
    first fortnight and reduced irrigation to 33% of the crop needs on the last 10
    days. This decision was related to yield decline at the end of the crop cycle.
    3.2. Water use analysis in the organic orange grove and greenhouse tomatoes The
    aim of DSSPIM is to analyze current irrigation management practices with a view
    to future decisions. The analysis/diagnostic module described in Section 2.1.4
    was performed using the WF and RIS indicators. The results of the main indicators
    of the water use analysis for the orange and greenhouse tomato crops are presented
    in Table 1. Table 1. Water use analysis for the 2019/2020 season. Crop Orange

    RIS – relative irrigation supply; WFgreen – green component of crop water footprint;
    WFblue – blue component of crop water footprint; WFC – crop water footprint The
    amount of blue water used (CWUblue) for both crops was obtained from the records
    of the water meters installed on each farm. For the crops grown outdoors, CWUgreen
    is the total amount of rainwater available for the crops and is estimated from
    the measurements of the soil moisture sensors. The crop yield data of the studied
    season were provided by the farm managers. Under the actual irrigation management,
    the crop yield values for oranges and greenhouse tomatoes were 16.50 t/ha and
    109.5 t/ha, respectively. Both farms are classified as organic farms, so quality
    is given priority over quantity. Consequently, when these crops are produced under
    conventional agricultural conditions, they can reach higher yield values (around
    20% higher than on organic production farms). For the orange groves, 7348 m3/ha
    of water were used to obtain a crop yield of 16.50 t/ha. Of the total amount of
    water used, 2382 m3/ha corresponded to green water and 4966 m3/ha corresponded
    to blue water for irrigation and other cultivation practices. The total applied
    irrigation water was lower than the IWA (5000 m3/ha) and considerably lower than
    the theoretical crop irrigation needs (7112 m3/ha). The RIS value was 0.7, thus
    indicating the application of a deficit irrigation strategy. The total WForange
    value was 445 m3/t, of which 68% was WFblue. The production of tomatoes was not
    affected by rainwater, so CWUgreen was zero. The CWUbllue value in this crop was
    5576 m3/ha and lower than CWR (6536 m3/ha). The RIS value for the entire irrigation
    season was 0.85 due to the deficit irrigation performed by the farm manager at
    the end of the season. Given the high production of greenhouse crops, the resulting
    WFtomato was 51 m3/t, which is much lower than the WF of the orange crop. Although
    the methodology has been tested on orange and tomato greenhouse crops, the methodology
    is applicable to outdoor woody crops and greenhouse horticultural crops with similar
    characteristics and management, e.g. olive trees (outdoor) or greenhouses crops
    like cucumber, pepper and eggplant. The information obtained from the water use
    analysis and the results of the DSSPIM simulations enable detecting moments when
    the irrigator’s management differs from the recommended irrigation schedule. Identifying
    the causes and consequence of this difference allows the irrigator to take corrective
    measures and improve irrigation management in the following season. DSSPIM uses
    ICT tools and weather forecasts and records to estimate effective precipitation
    from daily soil moisture content measurements and obtain more accurate daily irrigation
    schedules than other DSSs that use only historical weather records and general
    formulations to estimate effective rainfall (Alcaide et al., 2019, González Perea
    et al., 2017, Mérida García et al., 2018). Moreover, the increase in water use
    efficiency through precision irrigation scheduled by DSSPIM, in which various
    irrigation strategies such as controlled deficit irrigation can be considered,
    are evaluated by the joint use of WF and RIS indicators (García Morillo et al.,
    2015, González Perea et al., 2016) together with the irrigation schedules. Finally,
    DSSPIM permits comparing water use (total volume and timing) based on schedules
    to a farm’s usual irrigation programming to identify irrigation inefficiencies
    which, if corrected, can lead to water savings of up to 20% while maintaining
    the same level of production and reducing costs for the farmer. However, DSSPIM
    has certain limitations. The accuracy of the results could be conditioned by the
    quality of the information used (weather forecasts, soil water content measured
    by soil sensors, water consumption recorded by water meters, etc.), failures in
    the coverage of the communication system of the sensors, as well as the inadequate
    maintenance of the control devices. The suitability of the network sectorization
    (depending on the spatial variability of soils, topography, etc.) determines the
    minimum number of soil moisture sensors (one per sector) needed to obtain accurate
    results. Precise sectorization may be unaffordable for some farms to obtain quality
    results with DSSIPM. Other disadvantages include constraints related to crop development,
    personnel management, market prices or environmental conditions inside the greenhouse
    which affect irrigation management and are known by the farmer but not addressed
    in the current version of DSSPIM. 4. Conclusions A precision irrigation management
    decision support model, DSSPIM, has been developed to perform and evaluate optimal
    irrigation management for outdoor crops as well as for greenhouse horticultural
    crops. The procedure performs an optimal weekly irrigation scheduling adapted
    to the characteristics of each farm using ICTs and real data are collected on
    site by remote sensors and from open data weather forecasts. The on-site remote
    sensors are used to send information in real time to the calculation platform
    via ICTs, which is then stored in the cloud for subsequent analysis. Real-time
    information on the applied crop water and the evolution of soil moisture content
    is used to determine the optimal irrigation timing, as well as the amount of water
    to be applied. Accurate data on daily crop water use (green and blue water) are
    evaluated in the water use analysis module. The use of soil water content information
    in outdoor crops allows the determination of daily effective rainfall (green water)
    on a more precise and appropriate time scale for optimal irrigation, which in
    turn improves the management of water resources and allows for more accurate green
    water accounting. DSSPIM was developed and applied to two organic farms (orange
    grove and greenhouse tomatoes) during an agricultural season in southern Spain.
    Optimal irrigation schedules were obtained for each crop. At the end of the crop
    season, crop water use was accounted for and analyzed in the water use analysis
    module. The comparison between scenarios of different irrigation management systems
    (FIR and RDI) in orange trees shows that the application of regulated deficit
    irrigation strategies in tree crops can reduce irrigation water use by 20%. Moreover,
    the model maintains the irrigation water recommendation below the water allocation
    in all the simulated scenarios. Additionally, the results show that for the same
    irrigation water consumption, the differences in irrigation management (frequency
    and duration) result in a lower use of rainwater stored in the soil. In the tomato
    crop, the management recommended by DSSPIM and the actual irrigator’s management
    closely matched the crop needs, with the exception of the end of the cycle, when
    the farmer made a decision related to factors not considered in DSSPIM. The joint
    analysis of WFC, RIS and DSSPIM irrigation schedules provide useful information
    about both the amount of water needed to obtain a unit of product and the level
    of adequacy of the applied irrigation. This information is essential to detect
    inefficiencies in irrigation management and deviations in the actual irrigation
    schedule compared to the recommended DSSPIM schedule and undertake improvement
    actions aimed at increasing water use efficiency. The automation of irrigation
    scheduling using DSSPIM data, as well as the incorporation of other factors that
    affect irrigation scheduling (crop management, production status, prices, etc.)
    and improved irrigation network sectorization (increasing the number of sensors
    to better monitor crop and environmental conditions on farms or in greenhouses)
    could contribute to irrigation scheduling that is more in line with the reality
    of each farm; a key aspect for irrigators to rely on tools such as this one. Declaration

  description: Water is one of the most essential natural resources, which plays an
    important role in agriculture. The ever-increasing shortage of water and the continuous
    deterioration of its quality are evident in many countries of the world. The rational
    use of water in irrigation can be achieved by adopting scientific irrigation scheduling.
    Today, the traditional irrigation systems should be transformed to smart-irrigation
    systems for sustainable water management. This highlights the importance of adopting
    a set of emerging technologies that promise minimising implications of water scarcity.
    An Internet of Things (IoT) system uses various enabling technologies, such as
    wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, big data, embedded systems, security
    protocols and architectures, communication protocols, and web services. In this
    paper is presented an IoT-based precision irrigation technology using wireless
    sensor network (WSN). The system was installed in hemp plots to monitor soil moisture
    and satellite images were analyzed to understand the impact of soil moisture on
    hemp canopy. The results showed that the soil moisture variability remained the
    same at each plot during the one-year experiment while canopy properties depended
    on other factors that will be studied next year. This emerging technology is promising
    to improve irrigation water use efficiency.

  description: In the North Gujarat region, the implementation of smart irrigation
    systems are less; one of the factors can be considered as shared Tubewell culture.
    In shared Tubewell culture small farmers irrigate their farm from nearer Tubewell
    and pay for the water used to Tubewell owner. The major source of irrigation in
    the North Gujarat region is Tubewell. The water level in Tubewell goes dipper
    and dipper and, as a result, Tubewell loses its serving area. The soil type in
    the North Gujarat region is loamy sand, which needs frequent irrigation. In shared
    Tubewell culture, crop-specific or owner-specific smart irrigation systems cannot
    be used. In this paper, researchers tried to highlight smart irrigation systems
    that are able to work in shared Tubewell culture. In proposed system, different
    sensor data and weather data are used to compute irrigation needs of all farms
    associated with a particular Tubewell. IoT device Node MCU is used to read the
    sensor data and forward to cloud using GSM module. Proposed algorithm calculates
    the average of sensor data of all farms. It also checks for erroneous data from
    sensors. It affects the water sequencing of different farms with respect to their
    crop water requirement. The proposed system is able to supply the desired water
    to the crop by applying a sequencing algorithm to different farm data.Before starting
    irrigation, our proposed system also checks for rain prediction. If the chances
    of rain are high, irrigation will not start. In areas with less rain probability,
    we can have partial irrigation. The proposed architecture was named as IAA Architecture
    (Irrigation Anytime from Anywhere Architecture).

    Location: Dharan, Nepal SECTION I. Introduction India is an agricultural nation
    as agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy. To gain more productivity,
    irrigation can be considered as the main factor. Indian farmers are dealing with
    water scarcity in several places as ground water reducing its level day by day
    [14]. It is one of the region’s problems. The use of technology in irrigation
    can help to supply the desired amount of water with less water wastage [15]. Saving
    a ground water is booming issue of whole country. Proposed A smart irrigation
    system can help to overcome this problem by identifying crop water needs and providing
    the right amount of water. The use of IoT and cloud help to find actual crop water
    need [8]. In north GUjarat region the major irrigation source is Tubewell irrigation
    [16]. Farmers mostly depend on shared Tubewell culture, a smart irrigation system
    for a single crop or single farmer won’t work. The proposed system architecture
    makes for smart irrigation in shared Tubewell culture. SECTION II. Related Work
    Smart irrigation systems have become a need of the era. Different researchers
    have presented different technologies used for smart irrigation systems, and upgrading
    is going on. The researcher has gone through the below work carried out by different
    researchers. The system by GUtiérrez, J., Villa-Medin a, J. F., NietoGaribay,
    A., & Porta-Gándara, M. Á shows the implementation of a wireless sensor network.
    The GPRS module was used to provide a remote interface. The system uses a moisture
    sensor -VH400 and a soil temperature sensor-DS1822 to take input parameters. The
    input data was first stored on a memory chip and then sent to the web. The proposed
    system works on solar energy, so it’s power efficient. The system was tested in
    a greenhouse for organic sage production. The system saves up to 90% of water
    compared to traditional irrigation methods. The results are shown by graphical
    repres entation [1]. The system suggested by Serdaroglu, K. C., Onel, C., & Baydere,
    S. makes the decision from data taken by the soil moisture sensor and learns the
    irrigation schedule for the crop. Water was supplied first manually to make the
    system self-sufficient. The decision-making process is performed at a central
    server as it stores all the data. A user can add or update any plant irrigation
    information through their mobile phone. It shows test results in graphical format
    [2]. In the system proposed by Laksiri, H. G. C. R, Dharmagunawardhana, H. A.
    C., & Wijayakulasooriya, J. V. weather prediction algorithms are used. The Sliding
    Window algorithm and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) are used by the researchers
    to forecast rainfall. The author used different sensors like moisture, temperature,
    and humidity to predict the rain forecast. After getting a result, the predicted
    accuracy of days that are rainy or dry days found to be 76% of the 29 predicted
    days [3]. In this systent Pavithra, K., & Jayalakshmi, M. indicate that the use
    of different irrigation systems saves water by up to 70% compared to traditional
    methods like surface irrigation. The weather-based model utilizes temperature,
    solar radiation, humidity, velocity of wind, root depth, soil texture, crop coefficient
    (Kc), and rainfall data for further processing. The water need of the crop is
    calculated by all these collected values. The crop’s water need is measured by
    Evapotranspiration (ET) [4]. In this systent Vaishali, S., Suraj, S., Vignesh,
    G., Dhivya, S., & Udhayakumar, S. proposed an automatic irrigation and monitoring
    system The system uses a Raspberry Pi, temperature sensors and moisture sensors,
    and a water pump. For system communication, a smart phone module is used. The
    controller communicates with Bluetooth. The Blue Term Android application is used
    to compose system logical code and send it back to the principal controller [5].
    Rajalakshmi, P., & Mahalakshmi, S. D. have proposed a system that uses Evapotranspiration
    (ET) and electromagnetic soil moisture sensors. Both techniques are used to assess
    soil moisture levels and crop water requirements. It uses two different threshold
    values for irrigation, one for light intensity and one for soil moisture. Using
    the ET method, water can be saved up to 47%, and by using soil moisture sensors,
    water can be saved up to 53%. The suggested model can work on medium-grade land
    for any yield [6]. Dr. V. Suma indicates that the use of IoT in agriculture can
    accelerate the productivity. The use of modem technology in agriculture can bring
    revolution [7]. Bhanu, K. N., Mahadevaswamy, H. S., & Jasmine, H. J. have proposed
    IoT based system which uses arduino uno micro controller and cloud to store data.
    It shows the data classification according to the different threshold values.
    Two different techniques used to classify data and achieved good result. These
    data classification helps to take right decision from dataset used [9]. Kondaveti,
    R, Reddy, A., & Palabtla, S. indicated the different problems faced during irrigating
    the crop. It shows different soil type and different crops have different water
    need. The machine learning techniques proposed by author helps to take decision
    to supply right amount of water to crop according to soil and rain prediction
    [10]. GUpta, S., Malhotra, V., & Vashisht, V. proposed IoT based irrigation and
    flood preventing system This system contains arduin 0 uno Controller, GSM Modules,
    Soil mo isture sensor, water suction pump etc. When water level reached to the
    threshold value the water suction pump automatically ON and remove the excessive
    water. This systemhelps to prevent crop from flood [11]. The system suggested
    by Sarala, S. M used raspberry pi and cloud to store data. It uses hydroponic
    system to reduce the water consumption. System also used data analysis to provide
    nutrient solution in water for efficient yield growth [12]. Yusof, Z. M., Billah,
    M. M., Kadir, K., Ali, A. M. M., & Ahmad, I.proposed system to improve the crop
    production. System consideis different input data like Soil Moisture, Soil Temperature,
    and Humidity data. It store all the data to cloud as a output of a system This
    system monitors the condition of crop. Farmer can monitor the soil condition from
    anywhere [13]. SECTION III. System Design The proposed system is able to work
    in shared Tubewell culture. System Architecture, Working Phases of System Architecture,
    and System Implementation are the three parts of the system design. A. System
    Architecture The below mentioned system architecture is used in the shared Tubewell
    culture. This architecture is named as IAA Architecture stands for Irrigation
    Anytime Anywhere. Firstly, let’s go through block diagram of IAA Architecture.
    This block diagram indicates the different module at their operational levels.
    To make the irrigation scheduling automated IoT(Internet of Things) technology
    was used in proposed system The Node MCU IoT device was used in proposed system
    For quick prototyping of the proposed system and considering the requirement of
    system like ADC to sense the mo isture, temperature, humidity data, GPIO to control
    the relay, GPS interface for IoT connectivity arduin 0 uno NodeMCU is selected.
    The farm level module contains different components like sensors, soil moisture,
    ADC-analog to digital converter, NodeMCU (a microcontroller) and a GSM module.
    Different sensors read the data from the farm The analogue to digital converter
    is used to convert the analogue sensor data into digital form for further processing.
    For the further control of this sensor data, NodeMCU is used along with a GSM
    (Global System for Mobile Communication) module to transfer data to the cloud.
    The Tubewell level module contains humidity and temperature sensors, NodeMCU,
    GSM module, relay drivers, and relay/solenoid valves. The data sent by the farm
    level module is stored and processed in the cloud. The processed data of the sequencing
    algorithm is sent to the Tubewell module to start or stop irrigation of the farm.
    The GSM module receives and sends data to NodeMCU. It controls relays or solenoid
    valves to start or stop irrigation. The architecture in Fig. 2 explain the overview
    of all the involved modules/components in detail. It also shows the successful
    implementation of IoT technology in proposed system The description of the components
    used in architecture is as follows. F1, F2, F3 … .Fn are different farms connected
    to Tubewell. Fn is maximum no of farm associated with Tubewell. Sensor Module
    at farm contains Soil moisture sensor, ADC, Microcontroller and GSM module. Module
    at Tubewell contains Humidity and Temperature sensor, ADC, Microcontroller and
    GSM Module. Fig. 1 Block Diagram of system Show All This block diagram is further
    explained in detail IAA Architecture; Irrigation Anytime from Anywhere. Fig. 2
    IAA Architecture Show All The sub-diagram of the architecture depicts the internal
    details of the sensor module at the farm, cloud, and data processing. B. Working
    Phases of System Architecture The proposed system architecture works in different
    phases like: Data acquisition, Data analysis, Decision controller, Peripheral
    controlling, System Application. The first working phase is Data Acquisition.
    Data is collected from different sensors: soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor,
    temperature sensor. Data from weather applications includes humidity data and
    rain forecasting. data. Tubewell hardware data like the status of valves and relays
    connected to the farm. After completion of the data collection phase, the next
    phase is data analysis. Signal processing and conditioning is performed on sensor
    data output to remove unwanted noise. Signal processing is the process which removes
    the unwanted noise and extract the original signals from received signals. Implementation
    of software based low pass filtration remove the noise. This process makes the
    signal immune to the external noisy environment. Using an ADC data read by different
    sensors is converted to digital form as it was in analogue form The collected
    data from each farm is analyzed against an average sensor value. It helps to minimize
    the prediction errors and find the faulty sensor. At the decision controller phase,
    different algorithms are processed on the analyzed data. Data received from humidity
    sensors at Tubewell level is used to compare with humidity data of the weather
    application to predict the chances of rain in the Tubewell area. All the collected
    data is analyzed to predict the irrigation sequence. The flow chart and algorithm
    shown in the system Implementation part can better explain the decision controller
    phase of the system The peripheral control phase controls and integrates all the
    hardware as well as software components. Hardware devices are sensors in the farm,
    sensors at Tubewell, controller modules, relays/solenoid valves, and software
    components are UI at Tubewell etc. The last phase of system deployment includes
    the deployment of sensors and controllers at the farm and at Tubewell. This phase
    makes the whole system work. System deployment contain different component as
    explained in system implementation part. C. System Implementation System design
    includes following components. Working of all the used components is explained
    in system architecture. The table: 1 contain component used at farm, all these
    component can be implemented as shown in Fig. 3 Table: 1 Components Used At Farm
    Fig 3. Controller system for farm Show All The table: 2 contain component used
    at tubewell, these component can be implemented as shown in Fig. 4 Table: 2 Components
    Used At Tubewell Fig 4. Controller system for farm Show All After implementing
    these entire hardware components at the farm and Tubewell, the logical implementation
    part has taken place. The procedure to find soil moisture in a farm and error
    in sensors can be implemented as follows: The flowchart in Fig. 5 shows the way
    data is read from soil moisture sensors and the detection of error in the any
    deployed sensor at a farm. Receiving erroneous data from a sensor indicates the
    problem in the sensor. Mistaken data should be identified before processing the
    data for irrigation sequence. This entire procedure will be carried out in the
    cloud. Fig 5. Read soil moisture at farm With error detection in sensor Show All
    The above flowchart shows the way data is read from soil moisture sensors and
    the detection of any error in the deployed sensor at a farm. Receiving erroneous
    data from a sensor indicates a problem in the sensor. In this case, two count
    variables, “i” and “j”, are used: j is the farm counter, and i is the sensor counter
    deployed at the jth farm. Sn indicates the maximum number of sensors deployed
    at a given farm. Fn indicates the maximum number of farms associated with Tubewell.
    It stores all the s ensors’ data starting from 1 to Sn. Each sensor value is verified
    and is compared with the 1000. There could be errors in sensor data if we found
    the value more than 1000. If an error is found, the error counter for ith sensor
    and jth farm will be increased by 1. If no error is found, then the system starts
    to analyse data for the next farm. This process continues till all the farms’
    data is stored, or we can say the farm counter reaches Fn (Maximum no of farm).
    The output value of the soil moisture sensor can be varies in the range of 0 to
    1023. If the sensor detect the value 1000 or more than 1000 then sensor is disconnected
    from soil, values between 370 to 600 indicates humid soil and below 370 indicates
    sensoris in water. After completion of this process, an average sensor value is
    calculated for all farms. Simultaneously, weather data is also stored in a database
    to predict the rain for irrigation sequencing. After finding the average soil
    moisture of all farms, the sorting algorithm was run to make irrigation sequencing
    of farms according to their average soil moisture level. Algorithm arranged farm
    with lowest moisture value as first and so on. After making sequence of farm the
    next step performed in system was staring irrigation in farm. The procedure to
    start irrigation in farm is shown in Fig 6. Rain prediction data were checked
    for every time when farm irrigation starts. This predicted data is used to check
    rain prediction value. The high value of rain data indicates that rain is possible
    and that irrigation should not be started. In other cases, it will check the final
    average moisture of all farms for irrigation sequence. It will start the associated
    relay of the farms that needs irrigation. This process remains continuous till
    the value of i reaches Fn. The Fn indicates the maximum number of farms. Fig.
    6 Start Irrigation in farm Show All The average soil moisture of the farm has
    been continuously observed during irrigation. At the specified reach point system
    sent STOP signal to controller to stop the irrigation in farm. The threshold value
    can be different for different crop and type of soil. Threshold value is minimum
    moisture value that soil should contain to sustain the crop. Fig. 7 Atmosphere
    data Show All Fig. 8 Sensor data Show All Figure 7 and figure 8 shows the atmosphere
    data and sensor data taken at different time interval. These data were used to
    take irrigation decision. Both the data read through API and converted to compatible
    format for further use. SECTION IV. Results and Discussion The proposed IAA architecture
    works with a shared Tubewell, which serves many farmers ’ lands. The proposed
    IoT based system automates the irrigation scheduling of different farms associated
    with one Tubewell. The IoT based smart irrigation system automates the micro irrigation
    system for shared Tubewell culture, having many advantages compared to current
    irrigation or flood irrigation systems. Water consumption can be reduced in variable
    range of 20-80%. It also reduces the water wastage as system provides water to
    crops root zone. A single Tubewell can serve more land and expand the irrigation
    area, which accelerates the ‘More Crop Per Drop’ objective of the Pradhan Mantri
    Krishi Sinchayee Yojana. SECTION V. Conclusion The proposed IoT based architecture
    efficiently works for the smart irrigation system in shared tubewell culture.
    Water scarcity is a booming issue where agriculture is more dependent on Tubewell
    irrigation like the North GUjarat region. The model helps to serve more land as
    it reduces water wastage and supplies water as per crop needs. Authors Figures

    Water is a fundamental resource for life and having importance in many sectors
    such as agriculture, industry, recreation and residential. The freshwater resources
    are groundwater and surface water. These resources are insufficient as demand
    for freshwater increase with population growth. In human civilization, agriculture
    consumes approximately seventy percent of freshwater [1]. The continuous population
    growth requires more crop production to meet increasing food requirements of the
    population. The effective utilization of water in agriculture is need of hour
    owing to limited resources, climate change and depletion of ground water resources.
    Water conservation is a major concern in developing countries where economies
    are primarily driven by agriculture. The Indian irrigation mainly dependent on
    groundwater, facing several challenges like over exploitation, poor water supply
    infrastructure and depletion of groundwater resources. The country has a huge
    area of 39 mha irrigated with groundwater, followed by China with 19 mha and USA
    with 17 mha. The country has a requirement to conserve current water resources
    to meet urban, industrial and agricultural needs of present and future [1]. Farmers
    are an integral part of society as 50% of the workforce in India depend on agriculture
    for their livelihood. There are several challenges from routine activities to
    harvest in this sector. The current era is of IT and varied technology provides
    solutions for these challenges encompassing sensors, autonomous vehicles, automatic
    devices, web services, mobile devices and IoT. In modern age, automation of the
    irrigation processes using sensors and machine learning techniques is an eminent
    idea for research. 1.1 Motivation The IoT and WSN technologies link real-world
    objects to the internet through wireless and wired technologies. These objects
    are on the network can interact and exchange the data aiming at enhancement in
    service, cost cutting in procedures and saving manpower. Farmers have started
    to use computer and internet to organize data, monitor crop cultivation and to
    automate routine tasks. IoT is a dynamic field to due rapid advancements in technology
    of sensors, communication and microcontrollers. Therefore, this is an eminent
    area for research and gaining more attention from the researchers. There are many
    automated irrigation systems based on evapotranspiration and sensors readings
    based on crop and geography of location. Punjab is an agricultural state where
    those crops are grown which consumes a lot of water. As a result, the water resources
    like surface water and groundwater are not properly utilized. The automation of
    irrigation system using IOT techniques is proposed in this paper to conserve groundwater
    according to the climate of state. 1.2 Literature Review Irrigation is an accurate
    supply of water to plants for optimum plant growth in terms of quantity and frequency.
    The plant growth and yield are influenced by the amount of water supply as the
    excess water harms the crops by making roots inefficient in taking nutrients from
    the soil while lower supply causes slow seed germination [2]. The different ways
    to supply water are flood, drip and sprinkler irrigation. Many of these procedures
    are manual and involve human labor to ON/OFF supply based on estimation. The various
    pitfalls of these methods are: less supply, more supply and late supply. These
    issues can be addressed in automated irrigation system. The automation of irrigation
    systems is categorized as open loop and closed loop based on control. The various
    inputs like length of watering, volume of water, start time, end time and watering
    periods are provided by the operator of the system in open loop. In a closed loop,
    a computer program recommends time and length of irrigation [3]. Gutierrez et
    al. [4] proposed automated drip irrigation in Canada that saved 90% more water
    as compare to manual irrigation. The system had two components such as WSU (Wireless
    Sensor Units) to obtain sensor information and a WIU (Wireless Information Unit)
    to transmit that information for analysis. The WSU consist of an RF transceiver,
    sensors and a microcontroller. It was a wireless network of soil moisture and
    temperature sensors situated in the roots of plants. The WIU had a GPRS module
    that used public mobile network to transmit the sensor observations to a web server.
    Giusti and Libelli [2] proposed a fuzzy decision support system based on soil
    water predictions to improve a web based irrigation system. The system took the
    decisions based on climate data (rain, temperature and solar radiation) and agricultural
    data (soil composition, crop characteristics and site location). Ghosh et al.
    [5] proposed an Arduino based automated irrigation system with remote control
    from an Android smartphone. The system had user interface which displays sensor
    data on smartphone and irrigation frequency and volume were recorded through the
    android app. The results showed that the automated fields consumed less water
    as compared to the manually irrigated fields. Hu and Shao [6] provided a remote
    irrigation system with a cloud platform. The various parameters such as soil temperature,
    humidity and CO2 concentration considered to take the irrigation decisions. Bandara
    et al. [7] presented an artificial sprinkler irrigation mechanism for green roof
    vegetation in Sri Lanka. It had predicted evapotranspiration to determine crop
    water need. Sivagami et al. [8] proposed an automatic irrigation system in a greenhouse
    for both drip and sprinkler, which calculated the irrigation requirements based
    on soil moisture and environmental conditions. Kwok and Sun [9] developed a machine
    learning based irrigation system that utilized information like crop water requirements
    and sensor inputs. The system has two main modules: plant recognizing mobile app
    to detect plant type by taking a photograph and an Arduino based irrigation controller.
    Aydin et al [10] presented a technique to receive sensor data withy WeMos D1 Mini
    microcontroller and sent it to MQTT server. Murthy et al. [11] proposed an Irrigation
    Control that predicted the Maximum Allowable Runtime (MAR) for each sprinkler
    zone with weather data acquired from imminent weather station and soil surface
    runoff. An et al. [12] presented a sensor based automated irrigation system by
    monitoring substrate temperature. The performance of system measured by considering
    the total number of leaves, the length and width of the leaves, chlorophyll content
    in leaves and roots length. Munir et al [13] presented an approach where decision
    dependent on two things KNN based ontology and sensor data. 1.3 Objective The
    literature review presents many methods to automate irrigation systems like IoT
    based systems, fuzzy decision support system, evapotranspiration based irrigation
    scheduling and machine learning based irrigation system. Following a review of
    the pros and cons of previous studies, the objective of this paper is to propose
    an automated system using IoT that will use sensor inputs, evapotranspiration
    and precipitation information from internet to schedule irrigation and to take
    decisions about irrigation. The paper consists of five main sections. The second
    section presents the background of the paper. Third section describes the proposed
    system. The fourth section consists of results, fifth section contains conclusion
    and sixth section provides future scope. 2 Background This section presents main
    activities and a common framework of automated irrigation system. The main activities
    of system are sensor data collection, data transfer, data storage and analysis.
    The Fig. 1 describes the common framework of the system having sensor nodes, base
    station and server. The base station collects data from sensor nodes and then
    transmits the obtained information to the server. The server side has a remote
    user or web application to take the decisions based on analysis of collected sensor
    data. Fig. 1 Common framework of automated irrigation system Full size image The
    automated system corresponds to various factors such as sensors used, number and
    types of sensor nodes, communication, data storage and power sources. The main
    activities and hardware components are discussed as follows: 2.1 Data Acquisition
    On a base station, the data is collected from in-field sensor nodes made up from
    various sensors such as soil moisture sensor, humidity and temperature sensor.
    The base station uses appropriate internet technologies to send it to a cloud
    network or web server. Gutierrez et al. [4] employed the use of web application
    for data collection and analysis. Ghosh et al. [5] proposed the use of a cloud
    computing platform to store and analyze data. Murthy et al. [11] used MQTT protocol
    to transfer zone wise sensor data on web server implemented on AWS platform. 2.2
    Data Storage and Analysis After data collection, the various values obtained from
    sensors are analyzed against some threshold values and then decisions are taken
    accordingly. Lenka and Mohapatra [14] developed a hybrid system for crop-specific
    irrigation based on a feed forward neural network and fuzzy logic-based decision
    support system (DSS). The fuzzy logic-based DSS predicts soil moisture, which
    is delivered to the farmer with SMS notification. The real-time agriculture data
    becomes the input and training data to the feedforward neural network, which trained
    to take the decisions in fully automated irrigation system. 2.3 Sensors Used Sensors
    are used to collect readings of soil temperature, soil moisture, soil pH and humidity,
    which are important for irrigation scheduling. These parameters are determined
    by the type of crop and irrigation technique. 2.4 Microcontroller A microcontroller
    is an essential component of an automated irrigation system that collects data
    from sensor nodes, converts that data into digital form and then transmits that
    data to cloud or web server. The various characteristics, such as low cost, versatility
    to connect with sensor nodes and low power consumption taken into account while
    selecting a microcontroller. Gutierrez et al. [4] used single chip (PIC24FJ64GB004)
    16-bit microcontroller programmed in C compiler to transfer data. 2.5 Communication
    Protocols The automated irrigation system needs two types of communication technologies:
    short-range communication from sensors to the base station and long-range communication
    from the base station to the internet. The Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6),
    ZigBee and Near Field Communication (NFC) are used for low range private area
    network communication while GPRS and Wi-Fi are technologies used for communicating
    over the internet. 2.6 Power Sources The power requirements of sensor nodes and
    base station are met by rechargeable batteries, dry cell batteries and solar power.
    The low power consumptions are always preferred to design a modest system, which
    can be used in real life situations. Gutierrez et al. [4] used solar powered photovoltaic
    cell to supply power to a wireless sensor unit (WSU) and rechargeable battery
    to supply power to wireless information unit (WIU). 3 Proposed System In this
    section, the system is proposed to automate irrigation processes using IoT infrastructure
    and sensor network by considering the influencing factors such as weather, surface
    runoffs, deep percolation and precipitation. The system takes advantages of feedforward
    and feedback control mechanisms. The feedforward control is focused on crop evapotranspiration
    to determine crop water requirements and feedback control takes sensor readings
    to inquire about soil moisture in the fields. The evapotranspiration, sensor feedback
    and precipitation information from online weather forecasts are used to produce
    irrigation schedules. Figure 2 illustrates schematic diagram of proposed system
    where evapotranspiration, precipitation and sensor readings are used as input
    parameters, and the outputs is irrigation schedules. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram
    of proposed system Full size image The system involves use of historical weather
    data, online weather forecast and sensor feedback in various modules. The various
    modules of proposed system are discussed as follows: 3.1 Evapotranspiration Prediction
    The crop water requirements are determined from crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    that in turn calculated with reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo). The ETo
    is estimating the evapotranspiration on the reference hypothetical crop of grass
    with height 0.12 m. It depends on many factors such as humidity, temperature,
    atmospheric pressure, solar radiation and wind speed. The present method is to
    predict ETo of upcoming days from historical weather data of the region involves
    machine learning. The dataset is in JSON format having hourly values of previous
    five years. The training part consists of calculating reference evapotranspiration
    is calculated with the Hargreaves Samani empirical method that uses the air temperature
    as main parameter. The equation of method as follows: $${\\text{ET}}_{\\text{o}}
    = \\alpha *\\left( {T_{{\\text{mean}}} + {17}.{8}} \\right)\\left( {T_{{\\text{max}}}
    - T_{{\\text{min}}} } \\right)^{{1}/{2}} R_{\\text{a}}$$ (1) where ETo is the
    reference evapotranspiration [mm day−1] is a measure of maximum removal water
    from the surface with the processes of evaporation and transpiration by the atmosphere.
    Tmean is the mean daily temperature [°C] as Tmean = (Tmax + Tmin)/ 2. α is empirical
    constant having value 0.0023 and Ra is extraterrestrial solar radiation [15].
    The reference evapotranspiration is used to calculate the crop evapotranspiration.
    The crop evapotranspiration is calculated from Eq. 2. $${\\text{ET}}_{\\text{c}}
    = K_{\\text{c}} *{\\text{ET}}_{\\text{o}}$$ (2) ETc is crop evapotranspiration.
    Kc is the crop coefficient of evapotranspiration depends upon the type of crop
    and geographical location [15]. The system predicts ETo of upcoming days with
    an artificial neural network which trained and tested on past weather data [16].
    3.2 Precipitation Information from Online Weather Forecast It is important factor
    to decide timings, number of irrigation cycles, duration and interval between
    successive irrigation. Punjab has semi-arid climate and having deep water tables.
    It requires regular irrigation at small intervals to minimize the effect of percolation
    and evaporation. The system collects weather forecast information of next five
    days from internet. 3.3 Data Collection from Sensors The hardware of proposed
    system consists of sensor nodes having soil moisture and soil temperature sensors
    connected to ESP32 microcontroller. The ESP 32 has 32-bit LX6 microprocessor that
    can operate at 160 or 240 MHz having Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules for data transfer
    act as base station to send data on Thingspeak cloud platform. The sensor data
    is collected over cloud platform with Wi-Fi module for analysis and decision making.
    3.4 Data Analysis It involves designing a system capable of generating irrigation
    schedules for crops based on evapotranspiration, weather forecasts and sensor
    inputs. The irrigation time and duration will be decided by the system. The steps
    of data analysis as follows: 1. Collect historical weather data and precipitation
    information of selected region. 2. Maintain the information in a dataset. 3. Using
    the Hargreaves Samani empirical method, calculate the crop evapotranspiration
    in dataset [15]. 4. Train and Test the model for prediction of evapotranspiration
    using Artificial Neural Network [17]. 5. Make a prediction of potential evapotranspiration
    for upcoming days. 6. Find out the crop irrigation requirements from potential
    evapotranspiration. 7. Classify the day as rainy, cloudy, partly cloudy or sunshine
    based on the amount of precipitation. 8. The intervals between sensor readings
    and the duration of irrigation cycles are determined by the type of day. 9. Make
    decisions using a rule-driven structure based on sensor inputs and potential crop
    evapotranspiration. 10. Supply water according to need and generate irrigation
    schedule. This system addresses irrigation water requirements in open fields and
    experimental test will be conducted using flood irrigation in a small garden in
    Fatehgarh Sahib, Indian Punjab. 4 Results The results of various modules are presented
    this section. The hardware unit for sensor data capturing and watering system
    is proposed. The main components of system are Microcontroller, 5v DC Motor, L293
    Motor Driver Module, Resistive Soil Moisture Sensor and Breadboard. The soil moisture
    sensor continuously monitors the moisture content of the soil and transmits readings
    to the microcontroller every minute. The device is attached to the DC submersible
    motor through the L293 motor driver module. When the moisture content is less
    than the threshold value motor pumps water. Figure 3 shows moisture data collected
    over a serial port which are represented in graphical form in Figs. 4 and 5. The
    soil moisture sensor data retrieved in minute (Time interval of 3 min) and second
    (Time interval of 3 s) intervals are plotted as a graph in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively.
    The sensor reading was obtained with various soil moisture conditions such as
    highly, moderately and low. The maximum and minimum values of moisture content
    of soil in minute interval are 41.06 and 16.62% respectively. The maximum and
    minimum values of soil moisture in second interval are 68.9 and 0.29% respectively.

    Automated irrigation systems can save energy and human labor while also contributing
    significantly to water conservation. In this paper, various irrigation techniques
    available from literature have been explored in based techniques of hardware deployment,
    sensors usage and background of study. The fundamental activities and common infrastructure
    are presented in the consecutive section. By considering the benefits and limitations
    of various techniques, an automated irrigation system based on irrigation scheduling
    is proposed to obtain robust high performance system that utilizes precipitation
    forecast, evapotranspiration and sensor information. The main challenge for automated
    irrigation system is high deployment cost, power sources and effected by uncertainties
    and disturbances such as climate change, weather uncertainties, type of soil and
    salinization. In order to minimize these factors and improve the response of the
    system are areas for future work. 6 Future Scope The few advancements for automated
    irrigation system are listed as follows: 1. Cost: The cost involves in wireless
    sensor network set up and maintenance of those networks. To minimize the deployment
    and maintenance cost will increase scope of applications. 2. Control approaches
    in the presence of model uncertainties and disturbances: These factors can interfere
    in system performance. To minimize these factors and improve the response characteristics
    of the system are areas for development. 3. User Friendliness: These users of
    these systems are farmers, therefore user friendly interface and closed loop operations
    thrust areas. References Water Ethics and the World Commission on the Ethics of

  description: Precision irrigation with sensors has proven to be effective for water
    saving in crop production. Internet of things (IoT) system is necessary for monitoring
    real-time data from sensors and automating irrigation systems. Long-range wide-area
    network (LoRaWAN) is low-cost and easy to be implemented in IoT systems that can
    be used for precision crop irrigation. In this study, an IoT-based precision irrigation
    system with LoRaWAN technology was developed and evaluated as a precision management
    tool on fresh-market tomato production in an open field. Four irrigation scheduling
    treatments were designed and tested, including ET (ETc), MP60 (Watermark 200SS-5
    soil matric potential sensors, -60 kPa), MP40 (-40 kPa), and GesCoN (decision
    support system). The treatments were arranged based on a randomized complete block
    design (RCBD) with four replications. System feasibility, yield, and irrigation
    water use efficiency (iWUE) were evaluated during the experiment. The results
    indicated that treatment MP60 and GesCoN had a marketable yield 15.2% and 22.1%
    higher than ET, respectively. MP40 had a marketable yield 12.5% lower than ET.
    GesCoN had a significantly higher yield than ET and MP40. However, MP60 did not
    produce significantly different results from GesCoN and ET but had higher yield
    than MP40. MP40 received relatively low water via irrigation because of unproper
    installation and positioning of the soil moisture sensors, which caused a higher
    incidence of blossom end-rot and thus lower marketable yield. Nevertheless, the
    LoRaWAN-based IoT system worked well in terms of power consumption, communication,
    sensors reading and valve control. It can be potentially implemented for precision
    and automatic irrigation operation in vegetable fields.

    paper PDF 1 Introduction Agricultural productions consume more than 85% of freshwater
    over the planet than any other water uses. Freshwater consumption for agricultural
    uses will continue to increase because of increasing population and food demand
    [1]. Day by day freshwater resources getting reduced so it is mandatory to optimize
    water use in agriculture. In India, most of agricultural part is irrigated through
    the manual system. The manual system gives irrigation only based on observation.
    The microcontroller and sensor-based automated system that will provide irrigation
    based on sensor data has many advantages [2]. Proposed system has been considering
    all aspects of water requirement and irrigation system like water requirement
    based on crop growth stage, canopy of crop, crop age, landscape information like
    slope of farm, sea-level elevation, soil type, total sunshine hours, dew point
    temperature, relative humidity, actual and saturation vapor pressure etc. Some
    static information is fed at the time of installation, and remaining information
    updated periodically to execute the algorithm and estimate water requirement,
    if any, also adjust any aperiodic task with water requirement calculations. This
    paper focus on the different methodology used previously for automated irrigation
    system followed by the proposed methodology. A proposed system is fully automatic,
    as compared to other method that send alerts to farmer for further processing.
    The system uses Machine learning approach to fulfill irrigation requirements in
    modern days by making full automation and smart water utilization. Once configured
    this system calculates irrigation needs and provides an irrigation schedule that
    includes time, duration and interval of irrigation that is handled automatically
    by sending signal to the solenoid valve. Solenoid valve opens automatically as
    per irrigation schedule and also taking extra care of maintaining the water level
    in the tank using ultrasonic sensors. The water requirement is different in every
    stage of the crop. Proposed system considering three crop stages i.e. Initial,
    Mid, Harvesting stage. Based on that crop coefficient gets changed in the machine
    learning algorithm. This paper discusses related work followed by the proposed
    framework research methodology, assumptions, mathematical work, algorithm, evaluation,
    optimization, and a conclusion. 2 Related Work Evapotranspiration is an important
    parameter for most of the agricultural evaluation process and water resource management
    studies. Water evaporated through crop is estimated with the help of evapotranspiration
    and crop coefficient, which depends on many things like crop growth stage, canopy
    and age of crop [5]. Different methods exist to estimate reference evapotranspiration,
    among them Ravazzanietal method [8] is used when only temperature data is available.
    In this method, the Hargreaves coefficient is adjusted based on local elevation.
    $$ {\\text{ET}}0 = (0.817 + 0.00022{\\text{z}})0.0023{\\text{Ra}}({\\text{Tmean}}
    + 17.8)({\\text{Tmax}} - {\\text{Tmin}})^{0.5} $$ (1) Another method is Hargreaves
    and Samani (1985) method [4] that is radiation based method used when some weather
    data is missing [8]. It is expressed as: $$ {\\text{ET}}0 = 0.0023{\\text{Ra}}({\\text{Tmean}}
    + 17.8)({\\text{Tmax}} - {\\text{Tmin}})^{0.5} $$ (2) Here Ra is extraterrestrial
    radiation, daily Temperature is represented by Tmin, daily minimum Temperature
    is represented by T_(min) and daily max Temperature by T_(max). Another method
    is solar radiation-based method (Irmak, 2003). It is expressed as $$ {\\text{ET}}0
    = 0.489 \\, + 0.289R_{s} + 0.023T_{mean} $$ (3) Here \\(R_{{s{ }}}\\) is solar
    shortwave Radiation and Teman is average of Min and max temperature [10]. Net
    Radiation based method (Irmak, 2003). It is expressed as, $$ ET0 = 0.489 \\, +
    0.289R_{n} + \\, 0.023T_{mean} $$ (4) Here \\(R_{n }\\) is Net radiation and Tmean
    is average of Tmax and Tmin [10]. By using the FAO Penman-Monteith equation, crop
    coefficients can be calculated by using this equation. Crop Coefficient = Crop
    Evapotranspiration/Reference. Evapotranspiration Penman method giving best results
    to calculate water requirements. Artificial neural network and Fuzzy logic are
    used to optimize green roof irrigation [11]. The model is trained using Artificial
    neural network and Fuzzy logic to calculate soil moisture for irrigation scheduling.
    Aperiodic conditions are not considered in this system. This system uses weather
    data from nearby weather station. CommonKADS expert system [12] provided solution
    to optimize water usage for crops. The main objective of the CommonKADS expert
    system is to determine optimal water quantity and time. Parameters considered
    are the crop, climate, water, soil, and farm data. Fababean crop is taken for
    case study. Knowledge base of Fababean crop is extracted from the existing knowledge
    base of fababean crop built based on the Common-KADS methodology. The system is
    considering all required parameters. While considering any crop for case studies,
    its knowledge base should be exist to use commonKADS methodology. Not any a-periodic
    tasks are not considered in the system. Gene Expression Programming (GEP) [13]
    is used to develop predictive model for furrow irrigation infiltration. Genetic
    Programming is the successor of Genetic Algorithm. GEP encodes information in
    linear chromosomes, which then expressed in expression trees. GEP model is developed
    using ready dataset of available literature. Z under furrow irrigation is estimated
    using this model. In this method data set is randomly distributed as training,
    testing and validation set. In training stage model is trained to get the best
    performance. Testing phase measures statistical fit of the model. Furrow irrigation
    is a complex phenomenon. The model is giving good results for furrow irrigation.
    IRRINET is developed using Artificial Intelligence Expert – Decision support system
    (DSS) based on daily water balance methodology [14] of soil-plant-atmosphere.
    It determines daily irrigation schedule including water quantity and duration
    of watering. Web based interface is used to gather all data on Central sever for
    further analysis. Parameter used are climate and soil data. Real time data are
    used for irrigation scheduling. Web based server is used to collect data on a
    central server. Aperiodic conditions are not considered in this system. A feed
    forward neural network and fuzzy logic-based hybrid smart decision support system
    (DSS) [15] is implemented to determine soil moisture for irrigation. The model
    is trained using real time data to predict soil moisture contents and Evapotranspiration
    is calculated by Blaney-Criddle methodology. Advantages of this system are real
    time monitoring of data and quick SMS alerts provided to farmer. Soil moisture
    is measured with the help of training data. To summarize, Most of the methods
    are based on Artificial Intelligence and fuzzy logic. The actual soil data collection
    is challenging task, to overcome that most of researcher train their models to
    predict soil moisture [11, 15]. Some methods use ready dataset from previous literature
    instead of real time data. Proposed method using real time weather data and trying
    to optimize the use of water and making irrigation fully automatic task for farmers.
    In proposing method Modern Machine Learning algorithm with multiple regression
    analysis is used to predict water requirement using real time data. IOT architecture
    is designed and implemented to read real time weather data. This method tries
    to reduce the error deviation of actual and predicted water requirement with a
    small error value among all available methods in literature. 3 Details of Proposed
    Framework 3.1 Mathematical Model Over the last 50 years, several methods developed
    by various scientists all over the world with various climatic parameters. However,
    accuracy testing of the method is time-consuming and costly and not possible to
    calculate it in short duration, Evapotranspiration data are repeatedly required
    at a short interval to schedule the irrigation. Among the method given in the
    paper [6], the modified Penman-Monteith method was offered better results with
    a tiniest possible error about a living grass reference crop. $$ ETo = \\frac{{0.408\\Delta
    \\left( {R_{n} - G} \\right) + \\gamma \\frac{900}{{T + 273{ }}}u_{2)} (e_{{s{
    }}} - e_{a)} }}{{\\Delta + \\gamma (1 + 0.34u_{2)} }}{ } $$ (5) Where ET0 is reference
    Evapotranspiration [mm day-1], Rn is net radiation at the crop surface [MJ m-2
    day-1], G is soil heat flux density [MJ m-2 day-1], T is mean daily air temperature
    at 2 m height [°C], \\(u_{2}\\) is Wind speed at 2 m height [m s − 1], \\(e_{s}\\)
    is Saturation vapor pressure [kPa], \\(e_{a}\\) is Actual vapor pressure [kPa],
    \\(e_{s} - e_{a}\\) is Saturation vapor pressure deficit [kPa], ∆ is Slope vapor
    pressure curve [kPa °C − 1], Γ is psychrometric constant [kPa °C − 1]. Rn is net
    radiation expressed as the difference of Net shortwave (solar) radiation (Rns)
    and Net Longwave radiation (Rnl). The Soil Heat flux is presented here follows
    the idea of soil temperature follows air temperature. $$ {\\text{G}} = C_{{s{
    }}} \\frac{{T_{{i{ }}} + T_{i - 1} }}{\\Delta t}\\Delta z $$ (6) Where G soil
    heat flux [MJ m-2 day-1], Cs soil heat capacity [MJ m-3 °C − 1], Ti air temperature
    at the time i [°C], Ti − 1 air temperature at the time i − 1 [°C], ∆t length of
    time interval [day], ∆ effective soil depth. For one day to ten days, period soil
    heat flux considered approximate to zero. Wind speed instrument placed at the
    site may be at a different height, so wind speed data is adjusted at 2-m height
    using following logarithmic wind speed profile calculations. $$ u_{2} = u_{z}
    \\frac{4.87}{{ln\\left( {67.8z - 5.42} \\right)}} $$ (7) Where \\(u_{2 }\\) wind
    speed at 2 m above ground surface [m s − 1], \\(u_{z }\\) measured wind speed
    at z m above ground surface [m s − 1], z height of measurement above ground surface
    [m]. Saturation vapor pressure is related to air temperature $$ e^{0} \\left(
    T \\right) = 0.0618exp\\left[ {\\frac{17.27T}{{T + 237.3}}} \\right] $$ (8) Where
    e° (T) saturation vapor pressure at the air temperature T [kPa], T air temperature
    [°C]. Because of non-linearity of Eq. 8, the mean saturation vapor pressure for
    any period must be computed as the mean between the saturation vapor pressure
    at the mean daily maximum and minimum air temperatures for that period: $$ e_{s}
    = \\frac{{e^{0} \\left( {T_{max} } \\right) + e^{0} (T_{min)} }}{2} $$ (9) Slope
    vapor pressure can be calculated using the following formula, $$ \\Delta = \\frac{{4098e^{0}
    \\left( T \\right)}}{{\\left( {T + 237.3} \\right)^{2} }} $$ (10) Where: ∆ slope

    pressure at temperature T [kPa]. Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of ET0 (Dependent
    variable) and Max Temperature (Independent variable). As per plot Temp_max data

    is considered. 8 Arduino nodes are used to measure weather, soil and landscape
    data by applying different orientation. Raspberry-pi is used and equipped with
    WIFI module acting as gateway to send data over the internet. Soil, Temperature,
    Rain, Humidity and ultrasonic sensor are placed using different orientation. Vineyard
    main season started from mid - October and ends at March. October to November
    is the initial stage, December–January is mid stage and February- March is the
    end stage of vineyard. Type of soil in selected region is loam/clay. The Site
    is located in Nashik district at 19.9975° N, 73.7898° E. Elevation level of Nashik
    is 980m. Hardware and site design details are as given in below. As shown in Fig.
    3 the system uses 8 Arduino Uno R3 controller that acting as slaves. Each Arduino
    is connected to Bluetooth HC-05, Temperature and Humidity sensor ( DHT11) and
    soil moisture sensor. Raspberry – Pi 4 model is connected to Wi-Fi (ESP8266) model
    to send data to a central server. Ultrasonic sensors are used to maintain adequate
    water levels in a water tank. The test bed of 20 feet * 20 feet is used for plantation
    of 40 crops. 2 emitters of speed ½ gph for each plant are considered, thus for
    40 plant 80 emitters of speed ½ gph are required. The total water requirement
    is calculated with the help of proposed irrigation water requirement algorithm.
    As per calculations 40 plants we require 40 gallons water per hour per plant (Fig.
    4). Fig. 4. Test bed design with IOT framework Full size image $$ \\begin{aligned}

    Irrigation schedule Method 1: Suppose we decided to give irrigation after every
    6th day means 5 times in a month. 360/5 = 71 min = watering cycle time. 240/5 = 48
    gallons water is required for each cycle. Irrigation Schedule method 2: Suppose
    we decided to give irrigation after every 4th day (30/4 = 7) means 7 times in
    a month. 360/7 = 51 min watering time. 240/7 = 34 gallons water is required for
    each cycle. The time complexity of the system is O (N). Three loops are used in
    the implementation, but only one of them is executed based on crop stage. If the
    day is between 1st of October and 30th November then 1st for loop get executed
    because this period is the initial stage of crop. So N is the number of days and
    each statement in the loop is executed in O (1) time. 5 Conclusion Irrigation
    methods used in literature are based on fuzzy logic, Knowledge base expert system,
    Genetic programming. Fuzzy logic based methods train the model to predict soil
    moisture values and trying to overcome soil moisture reading challenge. Knowledge
    base methods require a ready knowledge base of required crop. IRRINET system using
    web based server to store tank scheduling. Main objective of proposed method is
    not only irrigation but also optimization of water used in irrigation. Modern
    Machine Learning approach used in the proposed system to make it more intelligent
    and perform all task in irrigation automatically based on real time data and proposed
    algorithms. As compared to other method proposed system does not require any manual
    interruption once installed on the farm. The proposed system is totally automatic
    collecting real time data, executing algorithms, generating irrigation schedule
    and executing irrigation schedule by automatically opening solenoid valve. References

    power systems are subject to high electricity consumption in specific time durations.
    In countries with hot summer days, power systems experience high peak demand during
    midday hours. For example, the Iran Power Grid (IPG) suffers from a lack of power
    generation in the summer while faces overproduction during cold seasons, that
    is, autumn and winter. The main reasons for the deficit of electrical energy in
    the summer are as follows: Increase in the electrical demand of cooling systems
    in summer, especially in the south of Iran with a tropical climate. Reduction
    in the generation efficiency of the thermal power plants in the hot days of summer.
    Reduction in the power generation of hydroelectric power plants due to noticeable
    rainfall reduction as a result of climate change. In this way, the first reason
    is the key factor, and the second and third reasons have been deteriorating the
    conditions in recent years. In such conditions, the most economical way is to
    use demand response (DR) potentials of electrical demands to overcome the problem.1
    Electrical demands have flexibility potentials that can provide functional flexibility
    to the power system.2 In this way, if DR potentials are extracted and aggregated
    properly, power system flexibility can be guaranteed. In recent years, some research
    studies were carried out in the areas of residential, commercial, and industrial
    sectors. In Ref.3 the DR programs for household appliances are suggested for residential
    consumers. In the industrial sector, an industrial demand response aggregator
    is proposed for heavy industries.4 Moreover, a study is conducted recently to
    coordinate the demand flexibilities of residential and industrial sectors in a
    power system with high penetration of renewable power.5 In contrast, in the agricultural
    sector, there is a limited number of studies investigating DR opportunities for
    farms. To fill the gap, this study provides an applicable model to integrate the
    DR potentials of Iran''s agricultural lands into the IPG. The ultimate aim is
    to reduce the peak demand of the IPG. 1.2 Literature review In the literature,
    some research studies have been carried out to optimize the irrigation systems’
    operation. First of all, in 2010, a comparative analysis of energy consumption
    in irrigation systems was carried out.6 The study investigated new strategies
    to optimize the energy consumption of surface water and groundwater pumps. In
    2011, a risk and uncertainty analysis was performed to identify the different
    factors that impact the energy consumption of the irrigation systems.7 In 2012,
    a scoping study was carried out to survey the energy intensities of irrigation
    systems, including surface water, groundwater, and booster water pumps.8 In 2013,
    a research study was done in China to determine the cost-effective strategies
    of operational plans for irrigation systems.9 Besides, a scoping study was conducted
    by the US Department of Energy to introduce the DR opportunities in California
    agricultural systems.10 In 2014, a photovoltaic system was proposed for irrigation
    systems not only to reduce evaporation of water but also to inject electricity
    to the grid.11 In 2015, a solar-powered irrigation system was suggested to increase
    the energy efficiency of farms. In this study, an electrical storage system was
    addressed to store the electricity generated by solar panels and injects it into
    the water pumps during low irradiation hours.12 In 2016, a standalone pumping
    photovoltaic irrigation system was designed in Spain.13 The approach aimed to
    increase the values of peak power of the solar system and provide an energy balance
    in the photovoltaic irrigation system. In 2017, a novel approach was suggested
    in China to locate photovoltaic water pumping systems with the aim of cost minimization.14
    While the previous research studies focused on the water-efficient measures and
    optimization of water-energy nexuses, a new challenge emerged in the power system.
    Increasing the penetration of renewable power, that is, wind and solar energies,
    new forms of demand-side flexibilities are needed to overcome the intermittency
    and volatility of renewable power.15 Besides increasing the electrification of
    the agricultural sector, alternative flexibilities are needed to reduce the peak
    demand of power systems, which suffer from a power shortage in critical hours.
    Therefore, new issues are raised as follows: Providing real-time demand flexibility
    to hedge against the intermittency of renewable power. This issue is subject to
    power systems with high penetration of renewable power, for example, Nordic Electricity
    Market. Offering DR opportunities for day-ahead peak shaving. This issue is subject
    to power systems where the power shortage can be mitigated by long notice DR programs.
    Recently, some research studies are carried out to fulfill these aims. First of
    all, in 2018, a research study presented a novel coordination approach to optimize
    the operation of the pumped-storage unit, water irrigation system, and intermittent
    wind turbines in an agricultural microgrid.16 Afterward, an energy management
    framework was suggested to supply the irrigation systems by the joint solar and
    diesel power generators.17 Besides, a research study investigated the practicality
    of using solar power-based irrigation systems for the agricultural sector.18 In
    2019, a prominent research study suggested the deregulation in the agricultural
    industry to facilitate the integration of renewable energies to electricity markets.19
    The study stated that farmers not only can provide a great deal of flexibility
    to the grid but also can monetize their energy generation. The study suggested
    the irrigation systems as potential demands to overcome the intermittency of renewable
    energies. In Ref.,20 a novel dynamic mathematical model was designed to electrify
    the irrigation systems of remote areas with photovoltaic water pumping systems.
    This study aimed to overcome the problems due to low coverage of conventional
    electricity networks in areas with irrigation potential. Moreover, the research
    study21 proposed solar-driven desalination for greenhouses. This study evaluated
    the energy consumption of the irrigation systems to justify the cost-effective
    usage of the suggested solar-powered irrigation systems. Moreover, a research
    study proposed an energy management model in farms to facilitate the use of solar
    systems and hydropower.22 The study simulated a farm near a river to use the run-of-the-river
    hydroelectricity in the irrigation systems. Optimizing the energy management strategies
    in the presence of uncertain variables, two non-deterministic approaches, including
    robust optimization and stochastic programming, are addressed. The research study23
    addressed robust optimization to optimize power consumption in an energy management
    system regarding demand uncertainty. In Ref.,24 a stochastic energy management
    framework was proposed for a multi-carrier building. In Ref.,25 a hybrid robust-stochastic
    approach is proposed to obtain the optimized strategies of energy consumers addressing
    the uncertainties associated with load level, electricity price, and renewable
    power. Recently, a research study designed a direct pumping solar irrigation system
    to lower the peak demand of energy consumption.26 Higher energy use efficiency
    and lower energy costs are two main advantages of the approach. In Ref.,27 an
    energy management approach was suggested to integrate the flexibility potentials
    of water-energy consumption into a virtual power plant. The study was successful
    in increasing the self-consumption of renewable energy and decreasing electricity
    supply costs. The research study28 investigated the techno-economic feasibility
    of off-grid hybrid renewable energy systems for rural farms where there is a lack
    of conventional power network coverage. In this study, different combinations
    of solar panels, wind generation units, and biogas generators are optimized in
    the energy management system. In Ref.,29 a solar desalination system was designed
    not only to supply the irrigation systems but also to generate electricity for
    other consumptions in remote rural areas where there is no access to the electricity
    grid. A recent study proposed a renewable-based energy system for remote farms
    based on photovoltaic panels. In this study, a novel multigeneration system was
    suggested to extract energy through the animal residues produced at the farmhouse.30
    In Ref.,31 a financial and renewable multi-objective optimization framework was
    proposed for dairy farms. The study concluded that load shifting and solar sites
    can alleviate the need for battery storage on farms. In Ref.,32 farm energy policies
    were investigated to optimize the electricity consumption of groundwater irrigation
    pumps. In Ref.,33 new strategies were developed to produce heat and electricity
    from agricultural crop residues in Denmark. The results showed that the suggested
    frameworks not only improve energy efficiency but also increase farms'' income
    and diversity of energy supply. Finally, the study34 proposed an algorithm of
    DR for the agricultural sector using a stepwise power tariff. The study suggested
    that a large amount of space available on farms is a good opportunity to install
    renewable energy sources. In this way, farms can take advantage of the subsidy
    provided by the government for installing solar plants. In order to find the existing
    gaps in the literature, Table 1 surveys the main characteristics of some prominent
    recent studies from 2018 to 2020. The common feature of the studies is that the
    flexibility potentials of the irrigation systems are normally described qualitatively.
    In this way, barely a mathematical structure can be found to facilitate the integration
    of farm DRs to power systems. Moreover, most research studies are concentrated
    on supplying the irrigation systems while the flexibility requirements of the
    supply-side are neglected. Therefore, based on the table, what is missing in the
    literature can be stated as follows: Modeling a mathematical framework to collect,
    aggregate, and integrate DR opportunities of farms into power systems. Incorporating
    the DR requirements of power systems to agricultural electricity consumption/generation.

    Supplying the irrigation/drinking water in deserts without access to conventional
    power network To narrow these gaps, this study takes advantage of the following
    contributions. First, to narrow the first gap, this paper proposes a novel mathematical
    framework to integrate the DR opportunities of farms into the power systems. The
    new application is to integrate the water-energy management of farms to the power
    system to reduce the peak demand in the day-ahead market when a severe power shortage
    is expected for the next 24 hours. In order to aggregate the DR potentials of
    farms, a mathematical structure is formulated for the agricultural demand response
    aggregator (ADRA) for the first time. The ADRA collects, coordinates, and integrates
    the DR opportunities of contracted farms to reduce the peak demand of the power
    system. To fill the second gap, a price-based DR program is addressed to indicate
    the flexibility requirements of the power systems. Therefore, the ADRA informs
    the farms of the possible critical hours in the next 24 hours when a power shortage
    may occur. In this way, the ADRA uses the day-ahead market floor where the possible
    hours with power shortage are determined for the next day. Finally, to narrow
    the third gap, a data-driven approach is used to estimate the solar power generation
    of a huge number of on-farm solar sites in rural remote areas without needing
    costly measurement and communication infrastructures. In this way, the solar generation
    of the significant number of sites can be estimated using the measured data of
    a low number of solar sites. Besides, a mathematical framework is formulated to
    state the electricity consumption of a modern irrigation system, including surface
    water, groundwater, and booster water pumps. Moreover, water tank storage is mathematically
    modeled to increase the DR opportunities of farms in response to DR requests.
    It is worth mentioning that the long-term aim of the study is to use the DR opportunities
    of farms to decrease the peak demand of the power systems. 1.3 Paper contributions
    and organization Based on the research gaps in the literature, the main contributions
    of this paper can be stated as follows: Proposing mathematical frameworks for
    the ADRA to provide day-ahead peak shaving for power systems. Formulating a mathematical
    model for responsive irrigation systems with water storage. Addressing a cost-effective
    data-driven approach to estimate the power generation of a significant number
    of rural on-farm solar sites. Figure 1 describes the main idea behind the suggested
    approach. The idea is that how the water storage of irrigation systems can be
    interpreted as the potential to provide DR to the power system. FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Changing attitudes toward the irrigation system from
    the traditional agriculture to the restructured agricultural industry [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] It is worth mentioning that the
    use of solar power and electricity storage is not conventional in Iran''s farms.
    Therefore, this paper aims to show the applicability of the modern irrigation
    systems as well as the on-farm solar sites in peak shaving of the IPG. This issue
    can motivate energy experts to schedule DR programs for the agricultural sector.
    The remainder of the study is organized as follows: in Section 5, the methodology
    of the study is described. In Section 6, the fundamental of the suggested approach
    is described qualitatively. In Section 6, the modern structure of the responsive
    irrigation system with thermal DGs, on-farm solar sites, and electrical storage
    systems is formulated mathematically. Section 13 describes the ADRA. In Section
    14, the robust optimization approach is illustrated as the solution methodology.
    In Section 16, simulation results are illustrated and discussed. Section 18 concludes
    the proposed approach. 2 METHODOLOGY DESCRIPTION In this section, the methodology
    of the problem is described qualitatively. The main aim of the study is to provide
    day-ahead peak shaving for the power system. To achieve the aim, the problem is
    split into three sides, including the supply-side, intermediary-side, and the
    demand-side. The three sides are located in three layers of a schematic diagram.
    To clarify the issue, Figure 2 depicts the schematic diagram. FIGURE 2 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint A general overview of the proposed approach in the form
    of the three-layer structure [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    In the first layer, that is, supply-side, the electricity market is located. The
    market participant, that is, the ADRA, located in the second layer, can procure
    the required energy from two trading floors of the first layer, including the
    wholesale market and wholesale contract. In this layer, the ADRA trades its energy
    in the day-ahead market and bilateral contracts. In the second layer, the ADRA
    is located. The ADRA is an intermediary agent between the supply-side, that is,
    electricity market, and demand-side, that is, farms. The ADRA is a grid-dependent
    not-for-profit organization that aims to market the farm DR and motivates farmers
    to participate in DR programs or compensates for the lack thereof. The ADRA receives
    DR from contracted farms, that is, the third layer, and integrates the aggregated
    DR to the electricity market. In the third layer, prosumer farms are located.
    The farms are comprised of three sections as follows: The responsive irrigation
    system as the main consumption. The thermal DG and on-farm solar sites as generation
    units. The electrical storage system. The responsive irrigation system is comprised
    of three types of water pumps, including groundwater pumps, surface water pumps
    (SWP), and water booster pumps (WBPs). To increase the DR potentials of the irrigation
    system, water storage tanks are modeled mathematically. The water tanks make it
    possible to draw water from water resources during low price hours. Therefore,
    the electricity consumption of the irrigation system decreases noticeably during
    peak hours when the electricity price is relatively high. In order to cover the
    price uncertainty, the robust optimization approach is adopted. The uncertain
    electricity price is modeled as an uncertainty set including lower and upper thresholds.
    The robust approach determines the optimized operation strategies of farms in
    the worst-case realization of the uncertain electricity price. Besides, a data-driven
    approach is used to estimate the power generation of on-farm solar sites. The
    idea is to estimate the solar power generation of rural solar sites in remote
    areas where the communication network may be inaccessible. Therefore, the approach
    estimates the solar power generation without needing to install costly measuring,
    monitoring, and communicating infrastructures. In the next sections, the mathematical
    formulations of the problem are described. 3 RESPONSIVE PROSUMER FARMS In this
    section, the suggested prosumer farm is modeled mathematically. As mentioned above,
    the prosumer farm is comprised of a responsive irrigation system, on-farm solar
    sites, thermal DGs, and electrical storage systems. In the following subsections,
    the mathematical structures of the above objects are illustrated. 3.1 Responsive
    irrigation system In agricultural lands, the irrigation system is one of the highest
    energy-intensive operations. Generally, the irrigation system aims to move water
    from water resources to crops. In order to suggest a responsive model for the
    irrigation system, it is supposed that the irrigation system uses two kinds of
    water resources, including an underground reservoir and surface water resource.
    Therefore, groundwater pumps (GWP) and SWPs are used to draw water from the associated
    resources to the farm. To increase the potential of farms to provide DR to the
    power system, water storage is designed between the GWP/SWP and the end-use consumer,
    that is, sprinkler. The water storage makes it possible to change the power consumption
    of GWP/SWP in response to DR requests from the ADRA. Storing water in the storage
    tank out of DR events and using the stored water during DR events, the water storage
    can provide DR to the power system in two ways as follows: Turning off/on the
    whole GWP-SWP in critical hours. Turning down/up the electricity consumption of
    the irrigation system through substituting one pump, that is, SWP (GWP), for the
    other one, that is, GWP (SWP). Drawing water from two water resources, the irrigation
    system can turn the electricity consumption up/down by switching the pumps in
    the critical hours. It is worth mentioning that the water pumps in this study
    are not equipped with variable speed drives. Therefore, the DR of water pumps
    is provided by switching the pumps while one pump can be substituted for the other
    one. In this way, the total electricity consumption of the irrigation system can
    be turned down/up due to turning off/on one pump instead of the whole irrigation
    system. Generally, there are two types of water storages as follows: Overhead
    Water Storage (OWS) Groundwater Storage (GWS) Regarding the overhead storage,
    the energy intensities of GWP and SWP increase moderately in comparison to the
    groundwater storage. The reason is that the pumps need to push water to a higher
    altitude. However, the overhead water storage takes advantage of crop irrigation
    with gravity during DR events. This makes it possible to irrigate crops without
    electricity consumption or less energy consumption to inject water to the end-use
    sprinklers/drippers. Consequently, to propose a complete model for the irrigation
    system compatible with real farms, WBP is designed between the water storage and
    end-use water consumer. To sum up, the mathematical structure of the responsive
    irrigation system is as follows: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) In the suggested model, Equation
    (1) illustrates the total electricity demand of the farm. Equation (2) expresses
    the electricity demand of the irrigation system in farm i as the total electricity
    consumption of GWP, SWP, and WBP. The matrix structure (3) shows the electricity
    consumption of pump X, X = {GWP,SWP,WBP}, as a function of nominal electricity
    demand and water flow. This equation describes a linear relationship between the
    rate of electricity consumption as a constant and the water flow as a variable.
    Moreover, the relation between the input and output volumes of water flows is
    illustrated by Equation (4). Note that water loss occurs due to the evapotranspiration
    of surface water and/or water leakage in water distribution systems. Finally,
    the state of storage (SoS) for water storage Y, Y = {GWS,OWS}, is stated by matrix
    Equation (5). The suggested structure must meet the following conditions: (6)
    (7) (8) where Equation (6) restricts the water flow from water resources to the
    water storage between lower and upper thresholds. Inequality Equation (7) limits
    the flow of water from the storage to the farm. The capacity of storage is limited
    to lower and upper levels by Equation (8). Moreover, a linear relation is considered
    between the water flow and evapotranspiration as follows35: (9) (10) Equality
    (9) shows the water balance equation of the irrigation system. In this equation,
    the left terms describe the summation of precipitation and applied water by the
    irrigation system. The right terms state the evapotranspiration values of the
    farm in terms of crop evapotranspiration and non-crop ones plus the discharge
    to drainage. The non-crop evapotranspiration illustrates evapotranspiration from
    the water surface and soil. Finally, Equation (10) illustrates a linear relationship
    between applied water and crop evapotranspiration. In this study, a linear relationship
    is used between the applied irrigation water and evapotranspiration. Regression
    analysis between seasonal applied irrigation and observed crop evapotranspiration
    values justifies the linear relationship. The constants, ρ1 and ρ2, depend on
    crop type and local characteristics. These factors are determined by regression
    analysis between applied irrigation and observed crop evapotranspiration values.
    Finally, Figure 3 depicts the schematic diagram of the proposed irrigation system.

    irrigation system [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] 3.2
    Thermal generation units In most agricultural lands of Iran, farms are equipped
    with thermal DGs to supply electricity consumption during a power system outage.
    Generally, two kinds of thermal DGs are used as (a) gas-fired engines and (b)
    diesel engines. The gas-fired engines are mostly used in greenhouse complexes
    that have access to a gas distribution network. In the open-air farms, which regularly
    are located in rural areas without having access to the gas network, diesel engines
    are used as the emergency power supply. Therefore, regardless of the types of
    farms and thermal engines, there are generation potentials in farms that can provide
    DR to the power system. Without loss of generality, the mathematical formulation
    of the thermal DGs is stated as follows36: (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17)
    (18) (19) The objective function (11) illustrates the cost function of power generation
    for thermal DGs. The operation cost of DG includes fuel, startup, and shutdown
    costs. The first term describes the cost of fuel consumption. In Equation (12),
    a quadratic cost function is considered. Ui,j is status binary variable of DG
    unit (Ui,j = 1 when the DG unit is on, and Ui,j = 0 otherwise). The second and
    third terms show the startup and shutdown costs of generation units, respectively.
    In this study, the constant startup and shutdown costs are considered. Therefore,
    the linear formulations of the startup and shutdown cost functions are presented
    in Equations (13) and (14), respectively. ui,j and vi,j are the startup and shutdown
    decision binary variable of DG. In addition, the relationship between μi,j, νi,j,
    and Ui,j is described in Equations (15) and (16). Inequality (17) limits the power
    generation of DGs to lower and upper thresholds. Finally, the constraints (18)
    and (19) show the ramp-up and ramp-down rates of the DG units, respectively. 3.3
    On-farm solar sites Agricultural lands are normally located in rural areas suffering
    from a lack of communication systems. Collecting data from a large number of on-farm
    solar sites, a reliable communication system, and costly measurement infrastructures
    are needed to be installed on farms.37 This issue decreases the applicability
    of the suggested problem, making growers unwilling to participate in the DR programs.
    To break the barrier, a data-driven approach is a practical solution to estimate
    the solar power data of a large number of sites from a limited number of informative
    sites. This approach obviates the need for installing costly measurement/communication
    infrastructures. To make the proposed approach compatible with the IPG, the statistical
    data-driven approach is used in accordance with Ref.38 The data-driven approach
    is not in the main scope of this paper due to the length limit; therefore, the
    approach is rewritten in simple steps to be clear to the readers. Note that some
    structural changes are made on the original approach to be compatible with the
    proposed agricultural problem. In order to illustrate the approach, first, the
    fundamental of the data-driven approach is described. Afterward, to clarify the
    approach, the training method and the related data are explained. 3.3.1 Data-driven
    approach In this section, the fundamental of the data-driven approach is described.
    This is a practical solution to estimate the solar power data of a large number
    of sites from a limited number of informative sites without needing to install
    costly measurement infrastructure. The data-driven approach has three stages as
    follows38: Data collection: Firstly, the data, including power generation and
    geographical information of on-farm solar sites, are gathered from the whole farm
    sites for a specific time-period. The locational information includes longitude
    and latitude of sites as (xz, yz). The statistical data of all on-farm sites are
    expressed as follows: (20) The measured power generation for all sites is expressed
    as follows: (21) Data dimension reduction: In the second stage, a data dimension
    reduction technique is considered to decrease the dimension of large-scale data.
    Therefore, the set Ψ is reduced into set as follows: (22) where is the smaller
    subset of the on-farm solar sites whose data are used to estimate the total solar
    power production of all primary sites. In this way, Z is relatively large and
    <<Z. In this study, a hybrid approach is addressed as the data dimension reduction
    technique to use two schemes concurrently as: (a) k-means clustering and (b) principal
    component analysis (PCA). The k-means technique clusters the on-farm sites based
    on longitude and latitude data. In continuation, the PCA prioritizes all the solar
    sites regarding the information they contain. Afterward, running a backward elimination,
    the solar sites corresponding to small Eigenvalues are omitted to find a reduced
    rank of most important solar sites. Finally, the informative sites are determined.
    Building mapping function: Finally, a mapping function (F) is generated to map
    the total electricity production from all Z on-farm sites to reduced sites. The
    power estimation can be expressed as follows: (23) The constraint (23) guarantees
    that the difference value between estimated and measured electricity generation
    is less than a specific mapping error ε. Note that, in order to measure the accuracy
    of the solar power estimation, root mean squared error (RMSE) is defined as follows:
    (24) 3.3.2 Data mining and training method In the first step of the approach,
    that is, data collection, the solar data of 87 solar sites in the east of Iran
    are collected. In order to generate the solar data, PVSyst software is used. The
    software generates the solar information of sites based on the locational information,
    which includes longitude and latitude of sites as (xz, yz). Therefore, in this
    stage, it is supposed that all the data corresponding to the solar sites are available.
    In this way, the solar data of a full year, corresponding to the days between
    1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017, are generated. In the second stage, that
    is, the data dimension reduction, the approach aims to find informative sites
    that can be used to estimate the solar data of Z primary sites. In order to train
    the dimension reduction technique, power generation data of 4 months, from 1 January
    to the end of April, is used. In this stage, in order to find the informative
    sites, k-means + PCA approach is adopted. The k-means + PCA approach is simulated
    for different values of . In continuation, the results confirm that the rate of
    estimation accuracy improvement decreases as the number of informative sites goes
    up. Moreover, by increasing the number of informative sites, the computation burden
    of the problem increases. For this reason, a tradeoff between the number of informative
    sites and the desired accuracy is necessary and inevitable. The tradeoff can be
    obtained by trial and error. Therefore, the 87 primary solar sites are turned
    into seven informative sites. In the third stage, the aim of building the model
    is to estimate the mapping function, F, such that the mapping error, ε, is minimized.
    To train the model, different mapping functions, including linear regression,
    Kalman filter, multi-layer perceptron, and wavelet neural networks, can be used.
    In this study, linear regression is adopted. The main reason is that this approach
    is simple and easy to implement in industrial projects. In this stage, to train
    the mapping function, solar site data for 8 months, from 1 May to the end of December,
    is used. All in all, the ADRA can estimate the power output of Z on-farm solar
    sites measuring the data of sites obviating the need to establish expensive equipment
    to monitor and analyze power production data of individual sites. This approach
    plays an important role in agricultural lands located in rural areas suffering
    from a lack of communication systems. While most of the farms in the IPG are not
    covered by communication systems, this approach can help the ADRA to collect the
    solar power data of on-farm sites without needing to install costly infrastructure,
    especially costly communication systems. Moreover, this is a crucial issue to
    the IPG to prevent discouraging growers due to the high cost of the installations.
    3.4 Electrical storage system In this approach, to increase the applicability
    of DR programs, an electrical storage system is considered. The mathematical structure
    of the electrical storage system is stated as the following state-transition equations39:
    (25) (26) (27) (28) In the formulation of the electrical storage system, Equation
    (25) describes the state of charge (SoC) as the function of previous SoC, charging,
    and discharging powers. Inequality (26) determines upper and lower thresholds
    for the SoC. Equations (27) and (28) illustrate the rate of charging and discharging,
    respectively. To sum up, Figure 4 shows the schematic diagram of the suggested
    prosumer farm. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The structure of the
    prosumer farm with thermal DGs, solar site, and electrical storage system [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] In this section, the structure
    of the proposed prosumer farm, including the responsive irrigation system, thermal
    DGs, on-farm solar sites, and electrical storage systems, are described in detail.
    In the next section, the ADRA is illustrated. 4 AGRICULTURAL DEMAND RESPONSE AGGREGATOR
    Demand response aggregator (DRA) is defined as a marketer, broker, public agency,
    city/county/special district that combines loads of multiple end-use customers
    in facilitating the sale and purchase of electrical energy, transmission, and
    other services on behalf of the customers. In the agricultural sector, the ADRA
    is introduced as an entity that gives contracted consumers, that is, farms, opportunities
    to know their DR capabilities on one side and integrate aggregated flexibility
    potentials to the power system on the other side. In the power system, the ADRA
    is an intermediary entity between the supply-side, that is, the electricity market,
    and the demand-sides, that is, farms. The ADRA can be a profit-based or not-for-profit
    organization. The main duty of the ADRA is to make DR programs compelling or compensate
    for the lack thereof. In order to motivate farmers to participate in DR programs,
    the ADRA uses two kinds of programs, such as (a) price-based DR programs and (b)
    incentive-based DR programs. In the price-based programs, farmers participate
    in DR programs based on the electricity price. In this way, consumers are responsible
    for their loss and/or profit. In contrast, in incentive-based programs, financial
    support is offered to farmers who respond to the DR request.40 In the former,
    no supportive plans are designed for consumers. Adversely, in the latter, the
    governmental subsidy plays an important role. All in all, the ADRA has four main
    duties as follows: Market DR programs on farms. Facilitate the integration of
    agricultural DR to the electricity market. Trade the farm DR in the electricity
    market to increase/decrease the profit/cost of farmers. Motivate the farmers to
    participate in the DR programs or compensate for the lack thereof. Therefore,
    the ADRA participates in the electricity market to procure the required energy
    of the contracted farm on one side and provide DR to the power system on the other
    side. In this paper, the ADRA can procure the required energy from both the wholesale
    electricity market and contracts. In the wholesale electricity market, the day-ahead
    market is addressed. The day-ahead market is cleared 24 hours before the power
    delivery time. Regarding the wholesale contracts, the ADRA can purchase some parts
    of energy from the bilateral contracts. In this study, the ADRA optimizes the
    electricity consumption/generation of the prosumer farms based on price-based
    DR programs. Therefore, instead of subsidizing the responsive farms, the ADRA
    maximizes the profit of the market participants, that is, farms, through trading
    integrated DR in the electricity market. The objective function of the ADRA can
    be formulated as follows4: (29) The objective function (29) minimizes the procurement
    cost of energy for the contracted farms. The objective function is subject to
    technical constraints as follows: (30) (31) (32) Equality (30) states the demand
    balance of the ARDA. The constraint (31) determines the electricity price for
    the bilateral contract. The ADRA signs bilateral contracts with the electrical
    power producers to supply a part of the farms'' demand. In this study, the price
    of contract n equals the average value of the reference price of the contract
    and the day-ahead electricity price. Finally, inequality (32) limits the power
    of bilateral contracts within lower and upper thresholds. Note that in the objective
    function (29), with constraints 30-32), the decision variables are . It is worth
    mentioning that the ADRA is considered as an intermediary entity in the distribution
    network. However, to avoid complexity and to concentrate on the agricultural DR
    programs, the distribution network constraints are not modeled. 5 ROBUST OPTIMIZATION
    Robust optimization is a young and active research field that has been mainly
    developed in the last 15 years. This approach is introduced to incorporate uncertainty
    into mathematical programming models.41 The key idea is to hedge the solutions
    against worst-case realizations of the uncertain parameters.42 In power system
    studies, a hybrid robust-stochastic model is presented recently to hedge against
    the uncertainties associated with demand level, electricity price, and renewable
    energy resources.25 Recently, robust optimization has attracted much attention
    in energy management studies. A bi-level robust-based model was proposed to optimize
    the energy management of a retailer in the wholesale electricity market in the
    presence of self-generation facilities.43 In Ref.,44 a distributed robust optimization
    approach is suggested to optimize the total operational cost of the microgrid.
    In this study, the ADRA aims to minimize the procurement cost of contracted farms
    under the objective function (29). The electricity price of the day-ahead market
    is a variable with imperfect data. Therefore, the problem is to optimize the objective
    function (29) under electricity price uncertainty. To achieve the aim, the robust
    optimization approach is adopted. The robust optimization approach aims to find
    a solution to the objective function Equation (29) meeting two conditions. First,
    it must be feasible for all the realizations of the day-ahead electricity price
    uncertainty. Moreover, it must be optimal for the worst-case realization of the
    uncertain electricity price. Therefore, the aim is to determine the procurement
    strategies of the ADRA under the worst-case realization of the wholesale market
    price uncertainty. As a result, minimization of the ADRA''s cost for the worst-case
    realization of the day-ahead price uncertainty is expressed as the following minimum-maximum
    structure45: (33) In order to solve Equation (33), in this paper, the duality
    theorem is used to convert the primary minimum-maximum structure to a dual robust-based
    mixed-integer quadratic program (R-MIQP) as following: (34) Subject to: (35) In
    the R-MIQP, that is, Equation (34), the symbols (ξt, ψ) ∈ ℝ+ show the dual variables
    in the robust theory. The values of the wholesale price, , are taken in the interval
    [-,+. In this interval, is the nominal electricity price, and denotes the upper
    threshold of deviation from the nominal value. Moreover, the total deviation is
    confined so that the electricity price is not able to take value in more than
    Γ ∈ ℕ+ time slots. Consequently, the deterministic set Ω is determined for the
    uncertain price sequence: (36) As mentioned before, the ADRA aims to optimize
    the procurement strategies of the farms considering the worst-case realization
    of the electricity market price. Moreover, to address the impacts of electricity
    price uncertainty on the procurement strategies, an uncertainty set, Ω, is determined
    by Equation (36). To investigate the optimal strategies in the uncertain electricity
    market, an iterative algorithm is addressed. In the iterative algorithm, the uncertainty
    set of electricity price, including lower and upper thresholds, is split into
    Q subintervals. In continuation, the procedure iterates to cover the whole interval
    of the uncertainty set, Ω. Consequently, robust farm decisions are made covering
    the full response from farms for all subintervals of the electricity price uncertainty.
    The suggested approach is illustrated in Algorithm 1. Note that the electricity
    price of bilateral contracts is equal to the average value of the reference price
    of the contract and the day-ahead electricity price. Therefore, it is not required
    to break down the electricity price of bilateral contracts as uncertainty set
    Ω to Q subintervals of the day-ahead price in Algorithm 1. The main reason is
    to avoid an unnecessary increase in the computational burden of the program. Finally,
    in order to clarify the problem, the suggested approach is described in Figure
    5. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The flowchart of the proposed approach
    with input, output data [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    Algorithm 1. Robust Farm Decisions toward the Electricity Price Uncertainty Step
    1: Construct day-ahead electricity price uncertainty set as Ω = [λmin, λmax] =
    [-, +. Step 2: Split the uncertainty set Ω to Q subintervals as follows: where
    q = {1,…,Q} is an interval index for the robust iterative loop. Step 3: For q
    = 1,..,Q: determine robust market trading strategies for subinterval Ω(q) by solving
    R-MIQP (34). In this way, the uncertainty set of the day-ahead electricity price,
    that is, Ω(q), is inserted into the objective function, that is, Equation (34).
    The solutions of the objective function are the optimized strategies for the uncertainty
    sets Ω(q). Step 4: Increase the interval index q. This ensures the full coverage
    of all subintervals. If q < Q, return back to step 2, otherwise stop the algorithm.
    Note: Covering the Q subintervals, Q optimized solutions are found. Each solution
    corresponds to the associated uncertainty set, Ω(q). The algorithm finds optimized
    solutions for different sets of the uncertain variable. It means that the algorithm
    gives the decision-maker a set of solutions. The final solution depends on the
    uncertainty set chosen by the decision-maker. 6 NUMERICAL STUDIES In this section,
    numerical simulations are illustrated. Firstly, the input information of the electricity
    market and test farm is explained. Afterward, the numerical results are stated
    and discussed. 6.1 Input data In this study, the suggested approach optimizes
    the operation of 103 ha agricultural lands in the northeast of Iran in the province
    of Great Khorasan.46 The main aim is to integrate the farm DR to the IPG during
    a warm day in summer. Figure 6 shows the locational information of the understudied
    farms in terms of latitude and longitude. The constants of ρ1 and ρ2 for ETP,
    that is, Equation (10), is extracted from the local regression analysis as (ρ1,
    ρ2) = (0.975, 254.09).47 FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The locational
    data of understudied agricultural lands in the province of Khorasan in the northeast
    of Iran46 [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The agricultural
    lands comprise open-air farms and greenhouse complexes. A large greenhouse complex,
    called Persia Greenhouse Complex (PGC), is designed virtually as the test farm.
    The PGC has gas-fired generation units, on-farm solar sites, and electrical storage
    systems with capacities of 1 MW, 500 kW, and 500 kWh, respectively. The technical
    characteristics of the responsive irrigation system are described in Table 2.
    The electricity consumption and pumping capacities are calculated in accordance
    with Ref.48 Besides, Table 3 illustrates the main technical data of the thermal
    DG and electrical storage system.45 TABLE 2. Technical data of the irrigation

    is simulated for Q = 25 iterations to obtain robust decisions. The value of Q
    is mainly dependent on the size of the uncertainty set, Ω. The data for electricity
    price belong to the Iran Electricity Market in June 2017.49 Generally, Iran Electricity
    Market (IREMA) is mainly supplied by thermal generation facilities. In the IREMA,
    the electricity is traded in two trading floors, that is, day-ahead and ancillary
    service markets. The day-ahead market is a competitive auction, which is taken
    place 24 hours before energy delivery time. Approaching the energy delivery time,
    ancillary service markets are performed. The main aim of the ancillary market
    is to make the power balance in near real-time. The power in this floor is procured
    in a noncompetitive fashion. In addition, consumers can supply some parts of the
    demands from bilateral contracts. Figure 7 illustrates the robustness bound of
    the wholesale market price uncertainty addressing lower and upper thresholds.
    The robust price region is split into 25 subintervals (Q = 25). FIGURE 7 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Robustness area of day-ahead electricity price [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] The ADRA can procure some parts
    of electrical energy from four different bilateral contracts. One contract is
    considered for the whole day and three contracts cover the valley (off-peak),
    shoulder (base-load), and peak hours. Table 4 presents the characteristics of
    bilateral contracts.4 Contract decisions should be made at the beginning of the
    day. TABLE 4. Data of bilateral contracts for the agricultural demand response

    at the midday hours of summer, that is, 12-16, when the EEP of the power system
    coincides with the ETP of the agricultural sector. Figure 8 shows the local EEP
    of IPG and ETP of the Great Khorasan Province. As the graph reveals, due to the
    coincidence of EEP and ETP at midday hours, farm DR is needed to overcome the
    severe power shortage, or the system reliability may be jeopardized. FIGURE 8

    which is publicly available. The data correspond to the date from 5 June to 5
    September 2018 [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] In order
    to estimate the power generation of Z invisible solar sites from informative sites,
    a multiple linear regression model is used to find a linear relationship between
    the output power of Z primary sites and selected sites. Note that the solar generation
    data are extracted from Iran solar atlas50 and simulated in PVSYS software.51
    7 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS The proposed frameworks are solved using the CONOPT
    3 solver in GAMS 24 software linked with MATLAB 8.4 on an Intel Pentium CPU at
    1.8 GHz and 16 GB of RAM. Figure 9 describes the classification of 87 on-farm
    solar sites (Z = 87) into seven clusters (=7) by using k-means and hybrid PCA + k-means
    clustering approaches. Based on the figure, the centroid of clusters can be determined
    as the informative site of the members in the corresponding cluster. Therefore,
    the generation data of 87 sites can be estimated by the measured data of seven
    informative sites. In this way, the need for costly monitoring and measurement
    infrastructures is eliminated. FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification
    of 87 primary solar sites into seven informative sites [Colour figure can be viewed

    for 4 days. The estimated power is the output power of seven reduced sites. Based
    on the graph, some minor residuals are observed in high production times. In the
    remaining hours, the algorithm estimates the power generation of 87 sites from
    seven selective sites with high precision. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    shows the peak estimation error for solar power generation of seven informative
    sites. In this way, the RMSE in Equation (24) is used. Based on the boxplot, the
    difference between the estimated and measured power is less than 7.5% of the peak
    power generation. In addition, it is confirmed that the combination of k-means + PCA
    approach outperforms the individual PCA and k-means. FIGURE 11 Open in figure

    solar sites [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Figure 12
    describes the optimized operation of the responsive irrigation system for PGC.
    In this figure, the exploitation of the irrigation system is described in four
    subfigures. As the graph reveals, the operation of GWP is scheduled mainly in
    the off-peak (valley) period when the electricity price is low. Similarly, the
    operation of SWP is carried out in the valley period, that is, hours 1 to 10.
    The water drawn by the SWP and GWP is stored in the water storage to be used by
    WBP during the peak hours. The operation of WBP depends heavily on ETP characteristics.
    Therefore, the WBPs are scheduled in the shoulder and peak durations of the power
    grid to meet the water requirements of crops during ETP hours, that is, 12 to
    16. Considering the total consumption of the irrigation system, the major consumption
    of the farm is scheduled in the off-peak periods, that is, valley and shoulder
    hours out of DR events. As a result, it presents a great opportunity for the IPG
    to prevent power shortage (peak shaving) during peak hours of hot summer days.
    FIGURE 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Optimized operation of responsive irrigation
    system for PGC [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Figure
    13 shows the optimized operation of the electrical storage of the PGC. In this
    figure, it is shown how the storage system behaves in response to the electricity
    price. Based on the bar graph, the storage system receives power in the valley
    and shoulder periods, that is, hours 6 to 8 and 18 to 20, when the electricity
    price is relatively low. Then, the storage system discharges the power to the
    grid during day and night peak hours, that is, 14 to 15 and 22 to 23, when the
    electricity prices reach the highest points. Therefore, the electrical storage
    system is a practical solution to the IPG where the ETP coincides with the EEP.
    In this way, the storage system can inject power to the grid during simultaneous
    EEP and ETP hours. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Optimized operation
    of the electrical storage system with respect to electricity price for PGC [Colour
    figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Figure 14 describes the robust
    decisions of farms to trade power in the electricity market with price uncertainty.
    According to Algorithm 1, the algorithm gives the decision-maker a set of solutions
    for 25 iterations (Q = 25). The final solution depends on the uncertainty set
    chosen by the decision-maker. Therefore, as the figure reveals, different optimized
    solutions, that is, 25 solutions for 25 robustness intervals are determined for
    PDA, PBC, and PDG. Different strategies of energy procurement are determined based
    on the risk-bearing capacity of farms. As the line graph reveals, when the robustness
    level increases, farmers decrease the energy procurement from the uncertain wholesale
    market. In contrast, the procurement from deterministic power sources, that is,
    bilateral contract, and self-generation facilities, increases noticeably. One
    interesting result is that the risk-taker farmer relies on uncertain energy resources,
    that is, day-ahead market, while the risk-averse farmer prefers to make more robust
    decisions by choosing deterministic energy resources, that is, bilateral contracts
    and self-generation facilities. FIGURE 14 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Farmers''
    robust decisions in the uncertain electricity market [Colour figure can be viewed
    at wileyonlinelibrary.com] Figure 15 describes the role of the water storage tank
    in providing farm DR to the electricity market. Based on the figure, as the storage
    capacity decreases, the peak demand of the irrigation system moves toward the
    EEP and ETP. In fact, by designing proper capacity for the water storage, the
    farms can guarantee agricultural DR to the power system and vice versa. FIGURE

    DR to the power system A, 100% capacity B, 50% capacity [Colour figure can be

    profiles of the agricultural sector in two states: (a) the traditional agricultural
    lands with segregated farms and (b) restructured agricultural industry with the
    aggregated responsive farms. Based on the graph, aggregating the farms through
    the ADRA, an average of 240 MW DR is obtained during peak hours 12 to 16, in comparison
    with the segregated farms. Therefore, the aggregated farms provide 240 MW DR to
    the IPG. Supposing an investment cost of 600 × 103 $/MW for a thermal power plant
    with a 30-year lifetime, a cost-saving of 48 × 105 $/year is obtained and prevents
    a massive investment in installing load-following power plants. Finally, the suggested
    approach can be addressed as a roadmap for the future structure of the Iran Agricultural
    Industry. FIGURE 16 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Total demand of farms in
    aggregated and segregated states [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
    Table 5 describes the average annual income of the electrical storage and solar
    panels for the test farm. Considering the lifetime of 25 and 7 years for solar
    panels and electrical storage, the payback period will be 3.72 and 3.14 for the
    solar panel and electrical storage, respectively. Regarding the lifetime, installing
    solar panels is much more economic decision in comparison with the electrical
    storage devices. Note that the annual costs/incomes of the electrical storage
    and solar panels are calculated based on an average electricity price of the IPG
    in 2018. TABLE 5. Investment cost and payback period for solar panels and electrical
    storage system Device Capacity (kW) Investment cost ($) Payback period (y) Electrical
    storage 500 0.104 × 106 3.14 Solar panels 500 0.5 × 106 3.72 Note: According to
    Ref.,52 the investment cost for 1 MW solar panel and electrical storage are addressed
    as 0.209 × 106 and 1 × 106 $, respectively. In order to investigate the role of
    solar panels and electrical storage systems in the power system flexibility, a
    sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results of the analysis are depicted in
    Figures 17-19. The sensitivity analysis is carried out for different generation
    and storage capacities of solar panels and electrical storage systems. FIGURE

    FIGURE 19 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Integration of Farm''s DR into the
    IPG in presence of on-farm solar sites A, whole day B, day peak [Colour figure
    can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com] First of all, Figure 17 describes the
    DR provided by the test farm (PGC), addressing both on-farm solar sites and electrical
    storages. Based on the graph, as the capacities of the solar panels and electrical
    storage increase, the value of DR provided for the power system increases in the
    day and night peak hours. In the day peak of the IPG, that is, hours 12 to 16,
    the solar site and electrical storage provide a considerable DR to the power system.
    Similarly, in the night peak of the IPG, that is, hours 21 to 23, a moderate DR
    is injected by the responsive farm. In order to discriminate between the DR provided
    by the solar panels and the electrical storage systems, Figures 18 and 19 depict
    the DR in the presence of electrical storage and solar panels, separately. As
    Figure 18 reveals, the electrical storage system provides DR to the IPG in both
    the day and night peak hours. Besides increasing the capacity of the electrical
    storage system, the value of DR increases gradually. Similarly, Figure 19 illustrates
    the DR provided by on-farm solar sites. Based on the line graph, as the generation
    capacity of the solar panels increases, the values of DR increases moderately.
    In contrast to the electrical storage, the solar panels can provide DR to the
    day peak hours only. In this way, the on-farm solar site fails to provide DR for
    the night peak hours. As a result, to provide DR, both in the day and night peak
    hours, the farms should be equipped with combined solar-battery systems. 8 CONCLUSIONS
    AND FUTURE WORKS This paper proposed a novel approach to investigate the agricultural
    demand response and integrate it into the electricity market. In order to facilitate
    the integration of agricultural demand response to the power system, a mathematical
    structure was suggested for the ADRA. Moreover, the robust optimization approach
    is addressed to determine the robust decisions of farmers toward the uncertain
    electricity price. In order to design a responsive irrigation system, a mathematical
    model was proposed. The suggested model shifted the power consumption of energy-intensive
    electrical pumps out of DR events. In addition, water storage is designed between
    the primary and secondary irrigation sub-systems to increase the DR opportunities
    of the farms. Incorporating the evapotranspiration constraints into the problem,
    the suggested irrigation system can meet the water requirement of crops during
    DR implementation. In this approach, on-farm solar sites were suggested as a workable
    solution to reduce the EEP of the power system. To make the farmers compelling
    to use the solar panels in their farms, a data-driven approach was addressed to
    eliminate the need for installing costly measurement and communication infrastructures.
    Based on robust optimization results, the risk-taker farmers preferred to procure
    more energy from energy resources with price uncertainty, that is, the wholesale
    market. In contrast, the risk-averse farmers procured more energy from power resources
    with less uncertainty level, that is, bilateral contracts and self-generation
    facilities. Regarding the responsive irrigation system, water storage played an
    important role in power system flexibility. Based on the results, inappropriate
    water storage capacity may fail to ensure farm DR to the power system. Although
    the suggested approach was successful in providing agricultural DR to the power
    system, some technical challenges can be further studied. To overcome the challenges,
    the following issues can be original ideas for future researches: The suggested
    approach addressed robust decisions against price uncertainty. In reality, climate
    data, for example, solar irradiation, and prosumers'' behavior have a great deal
    of uncertainty. Studying the problem under several uncertain variables, stochastic
    programming is a workable solution for future researches. In this way, probability
    distribution functions can be determined for the uncertainties associated with
    solar power and consumers'' behavior. The proposed approach used the DR potentials
    of irrigation pumps for peak shaving in a power system with low/zero penetration
    of intermittent power. In contrast, in power systems with a high level of renewable
    power penetration, the DR potentials of the water pumps can be unlocked to provide
    ancillary services in near real-time. In this study, the electricity consumption
    of irrigation pumps is considered constant. Addressing variable frequency drive
    in the water pumps, the electricity consumption of the irrigation system can be
    adjusted in response to real-time signals of DR requests. CONFLICT OF INTEREST

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract A growing international human population and rising
    living standards are increasing the demand for agricultural products. Under higher
    pressure over natural resources, environmental concerns are increasing as well,
    challenging current water use decision-making processes in irrigated agriculture.
    Higher agricultural productivity means water should be applied more efficiently,
    which requires instant information on weather, soil, and plant conditions throughout
    the growing season. An information-based irrigation scheduling application tightened
    to the spatiotemporal variability of the fields is critical for enhancing the
    current irrigation system and making better irrigation scheduling decisions. The
    aim of this study is to review current irrigation scheduling methodologies based
    on two case studies (woody and field crops) located in semi-arid areas of Southeast
    Spain. We realize that optimal irrigation programming requires consistent investment
    in equipment, expenditure on operation and maintenance, and qualified technical
    and maintenance services. These technological approaches will be worthwhile in
    farms with low water availability, high profitability, and significant technical-economic
    capacity. Keywords: water profitability; water scarcity; sensors; big data; information
    and communication technologies; irrigation scheduling 1. Introduction A growing
    international population and rising living standards are increasing the demand
    for agricultural products. At the same time, globalization, markets liberalization,
    growing pressure on natural resources, and environmental concerns are heightening
    the need for improved agricultural productivity [1,2]. In the case of irrigated
    agriculture, meeting this requirement involves a paradigm shift. Maximizing net
    profits will demand a more economic approach than simply maximizing crop yields.
    This is significantly complex and challenging, requiring that water be applied
    in a wiser, more precise, and accurate fashion because the margin for error narrows
    [3]. From an engineering standpoint, achieving the above depends on having more
    information, using enhanced irrigation systems and making better irrigation scheduling
    decisions. Instant information is required for a thorough understanding of weather,
    soil, and plant conditions throughout the growing season. Enhanced irrigation
    systems are needed for a uniform application of water depths tailored to the spatiotemporal
    variability of the fields. Better decisions are necessary to convert these capacities
    into profits. The scientific community and industry work to meet these needs,
    taking advantage of geolocated and internet-enabled devices. As a result, a wide
    range of technologies has been developed. Multiple sensors for weather, soil and
    plant measurements can supply data continuously and automatically in fixed points
    located within the field. Weather conditions, soil moisture and temperature, plant
    sap flow, trunk diameter, and leaf turgor pressure are some of the variables monitored
    by these sensors [4,5]. Data can also be obtained for the whole field area. Remote
    and proximal sensing based on radar and spectral sensors onboard satellites, unmanned
    aerial vehicles, tractors and even centre-pivots and linear-moving irrigation
    systems allow high spatial and/or temporal resolution monitoring of soil moisture
    and plant water and nutrient status. Proximal electromagnetic induction sensors
    can also be used for mapping soil properties along with soil sampling and testing
    [6,7,8]. High quality equipment for water application has also been developed.
    If adequately selected and dimensioned modern irrigation systems can provide excellent
    performance under a wide range of environmental conditions. Furthermore, variable
    rate technology enables the application of site-specific water depths according
    to the spatial variability of the soil and plant conditions throughout the field
    [8]. Dealing with all these data and irrigation system capabilities involves great
    analytical complexity. Automated irrigation controllers have been designed for
    this purpose. These controllers include a module that computes an optimized irrigation
    scheduling (and a prescription map in the case of variable rate systems) according
    to a predefined irrigation strategy and goal. The optimization process is based
    on sensor data or/and output data from simulation models. Given the complexity
    of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and the uncertainty of the available data,
    artificial intelligence techniques are used to search for the optimal solution.
    These techniques are also applied in other related processes, such as model calibration
    and weather and water demand forecasting [4,8,9]. Despite the sophistication of
    this cutting-edge hardware and software, their prices have become affordable for
    commercial use. Recent advances in sensors and information and communication technologies
    have slashed the cost of generating, transmitting, storing and processing large
    amounts of data. Consequently, the implementation of these technologies in commercial
    farms is considered feasible, in practice, for improving their economic and environmental
    footprint. Likewise, its use could improve the adaptation to climate change and
    to changing water demand and supply patterns, enhancing food security [10,11,12,13].
    As a consequence, these technologies for irrigation and agriculture are generally
    being considered by governments and international organizations as promising tools
    to achieve a sustainable intensification of agricultural production [14,15,16].
    However, some studies carried out in industrialized countries conclude that their
    adoption is not widespread, and, on average, their economic profitability is low
    [17,18]. Farmers readily adopt technologies, such as auto-steer machinery and
    irrigation pivots, which require limited new training and skills. However, adoption
    of information-intensive technologies, such as soil or plant moisture sensors
    and related software, is often limited. These technologies require further investments
    in learning and/or hiring external services for data analysis. Changes in management
    practices are also often needed to accommodate data-driven decisions. Such requirements
    may even affect the profile of farmers, shifting from that of a land manager,
    who grows crops according to his/her practical experience, to farm technician,
    whose work should also be based on technical knowledge [18,19,20]. Farmers can
    adopt very different information technology levels to fine-tune their management
    practices. Each level encompasses the use of different layers of information.
    Assessing the value given by each information layer is essential for selecting
    the most suitable technological level for each farm [5,19,21]. The value of information
    is the increase in the expected value of the outcome arising from the introduction
    of an additional layer of information in the decision process [22]. It depends
    on the quality of the data (e.g., precision, trueness and timing), its total cost
    (e.g., investment, operation and maintenance) and the conditions of the farm (e.g.,
    environmental, agronomic, socio-economic, and technical). Therefore, a particular
    technology can provide different economic and environmental results depending
    on the region and farm where it is used [5,18,21]. Selecting and managing the
    most suitable technological level requires technical knowledge and skills, as
    well as unbiased information about the performance of the available technologies.
    Poor information and/or low knowledge and skills mean decisions are made in a
    context of uncertainty, which in turn, means cultural factors and cognitive biases
    may lead to the adoption of sub-optimal solutions or simply to no decisions being
    made. Thus, the early adopters of new technologies are usually younger farmers,
    with higher education levels and larger farms in terms of economic size [17,18,19,23,24].
    Farms located in the Mediterranean countries of the EU are usually smallholdings
    managed by aged farmers with a low level of technical education. These features
    hamper the uptake of new technologies [24]. An example of this situation is Spain,
    where 59% of the farmers are older than 55 years and only 18% have agricultural
    technical training for the implementation of information and communication technologies
    (ICTs) on their farms. The mean economic farm size is 37,284 € in terms of standard
    output, which is lower than two thirds of the EU15 average (member states of the
    EU on 30 April 2004), although the 1% largest farms (≥0.5 M€) accounts for 32%
    of the national standard output [25]. The Government is tackling this problem
    by promoting and subsidizing the modernization of irrigation infrastructures.
    As a result, water transport and distribution facilities, as well as on-farm irrigation
    systems have been modernized across 1.5 Mha since the beginning of this century
    [26]. However, a number of studies have suggested that irrigation management should
    be enhanced in order to capture the full economic and environmental value that
    modern infrastructure can potentially provide [27,28,29,30,31]. Much research
    has been specifically conducted to bridge this gap [32,33,34,35,36]. Nevertheless,
    there are very few analyses focused on identifying the farm conditions that make
    the techniques developed in these studies profitable. Such analyses, along with
    a strengthening of extension services, training programs, and regional trials
    among other measures, would enhance farmers’ capabilities to select and use technologies
    that help them to optimize the management of their irrigation infrastructures
    [18,21,24]. It is clear from the above overview that carrying out an optimal irrigation
    scheduling is essential for improving water and energy use in irrigated agriculture.
    Accordingly, methodologies focused on this issue and advances in new technologies
    and equipment to be implemented in this sector have been developed. However, in
    the majority of farms, these advances have not properly got off the ground due
    to the low technical training of farmers and the reduced profitability of agricultural
    products, making the investment of new technologies unaffordable. Hence, the aim
    of this study is to review the main factors influencing irrigation scheduling
    and document the impact of ICTs on these factors to identify the conditions that
    drive the return on investment of various irrigation scheduling methodologies.
    This review is supported by the analysis of several case studies located in semi-arid
    areas of Southeast Spain, a country with a 30% of irrigated cropland [37] and
    most of this area being under Mediterranean natural conditions. The review starts
    by describing the main factors that should be considered for optimal irrigation
    scheduling. Then, several case studies methodologies focused on optimal irrigation
    scheduling applied in both woody and field crops under semi-arid conditions are
    presented. In the final section, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these
    irrigation scheduling methodologies, based on the case studies evaluated. 2. Factors
    that Affect Optimal Irrigation Scheduling Irrigation management depends on several
    factors, most of which are interrelated, as shown in Figure 1. Different combinations
    of these factors enable optimal irrigation schedules to be achieved depending
    on the technological level of the farms (low, intermediate, or high) as regards
    the technological elements used, as described below. Figure 1. Interaction between
    irrigation scheduling factors. • Crop The crop is the main driver of irrigation
    scheduling as irrigation is intended to satisfy the fraction of crop water requirements
    (WR) that cannot be satisfied with rainwater during the crop season. WR are equivalent
    to the amount of water evapotranspirated by the crop, ETc, which can be linked
    to the agro-climatic variable, reference evapotranspiration, ETo, by the crop
    coefficient, Kc [38]. It depends on the crop characteristics, taking into account
    crop height, the crop-soil surface resistance, and albedo of the crop soil surface
    [39]. Recommended Kc values for different crops can be found in the literature
    [38]. However, there are no available Kc values for certain crops, or the recommended
    values are suited to different environmental conditions [40]. Thus, different
    works have focused on setting specific Kc values considering on-site environmental
    conditions by relating the ETc with ETo using lysimeters [41,42,43,44]. Alternatively,
    other authors have used crop simulation models to determine specific Kc values
    for non-stressed and well irrigated crops (e.g., bean and cabbage crops in Germany
    [45]). The use of specific crop coefficients can improve irrigation programming,
    generating both higher yields and water use efficiency [46]. • Weather data Local
    weather determines crop irrigation requirements (IR) and consequently irrigation
    programming. Rainfall and air temperature are the basic data required to calculate
    IR using values of effective precipitation (Pe) and ETo estimated by low-parameter
    procedures like the Hargreaves equation [47]. However, many weather stations can
    now also record data such as humidity, solar radiation and wind speed, among others
    (e.g., [48]). When this information is available, physically based ETo calculation
    methods, such as the Penman-Monteith model [38], can be used to provide accurate
    estimations of ETo [49,50]. Thus, in many cases, there is either a lack of data
    or their quality is not guaranteed, or the weather station is located too far
    from the area studied [51,52]. This leads to non-accurate ETo estimations [53]
    which means uncertainties in the irrigation programming. • Soil data Soil characteristics
    such as soil condition, slope, texture, structure, depth, organic matter content,
    bulk density, salinity, acidity drainage, fertility and chemical parameters affect
    soil water distribution and root water absorption [54]. Standard numerical soil
    properties at a spatial resolution of 250 m and at a global scale can be obtained
    from systems such as SoilGridsTM [55]. However, soil measurements are point measurements
    that show spatiotemporal variability in the same field during the irrigation season.
    Accordingly, these authors evaluated the time and spatial variability of soil
    hydraulic characteristics during the cropping season, showing that soil variations
    during the season are important and lead to inaccurate irrigation programming.
    Irrigation events also affect soil hydraulic characteristics, which highlights
    the importance of carrying out soil hydraulic parameter analysis during the cropping
    season to improve irrigation programming [56]. In sandy soils, with a low water
    retention capacity, spatiotemporal hydraulic characterization is crucial [57,58].
    As an example of watering difficulties in sandy soils, in a two-season study of
    irrigated potato cultivated in a sandy soil in USA, soil water storage and deep
    drainage at several zones across the farm were evaluated [57], detecting a significant
    spatiotemporal variability in soil water storage and temporal differences on deep
    drainage. To reduce deep drainage, soil water movement models like Hydrus 2-D
    were used to set the optimum duration of irrigation pulses in strawberries cultivated
    in extremely sandy soils in Spain, for each crop development stage [58]. • Irrigation
    scheduling criteria Irrigation scheduling consists of setting the timing and the
    amount of water to be applied to the crop [59] to either maximize the production
    or to maximize the benefit [59]. Over recent decades, these goals have also been
    linked to efficiency criteria in the use of both water and energy resources [60].
    To achieve them, several “irrigation criteria” have been used to establish the
    irrigation scheduling: (1) A farmer’s perception/ experience of crop irrigation
    needs, which usually results in less-than-optimal irrigation scheduling (lack
    of water during some crop stages and over-irrigation in others) and hence, lower
    production and profits [61]; (2) Rational estimation of daily crop irrigation
    requirements using historical climate data that are daily updated during the irrigation
    season [62]; (3) Rational estimation of daily crop irrigation requirements based
    on both climate information and on daily soil water balance [63,64]; (4) Estimation
    of daily irrigation needs using soil water data collected from soil moisture sensors
    [65,66]; (5) Irrigation needs estimated from plant water status monitoring using
    sap flow sensors [5,67], trunk growth rate sensors [68], leaf water potential
    [69], or leaf turgor pressure sensors [70], among others. The above criteria define
    the daily irrigation program once the irrigation strategy is established. Several
    factors condition the irrigation strategy: the water allocation for the whole
    season (from full irrigation to different levels of deficit irrigation [71]);
    the type of irrigation system and its hydraulic characteristics [62,63]; or water
    availability at field scale, according to the management of the irrigation district
    (on demand irrigation in which farmers can irrigate 24 h a day or by irrigation
    turns [72,73]), to name a few. • Water source, water rights, and water markets
    Water sources for irrigation include groundwater from wells, surface water, rain
    harvesting and treated water from municipal areas [74]. The kind and quality of
    water source affects water availability at field scale. For example, groundwater
    is a more reliable water source and less vulnerable to drought compared to surface
    water [75]. As for using rain harvesting pond or treated water for irrigation,
    water availability will be affected by climatic variables, the pond storage capacity,
    and the legislation on that issue [76,77]. Water rights are required to legally
    establish the available water at field scale. “A water right is a legal entitlement
    authorizing water to be diverted from a specified source and put to beneficial,
    non-wasteful use” [78]. Hence, water rights affect irrigation programming. To
    name a few examples, in England, a license is required to abstract water for irrigation
    and to obtain/ renew this license, farmers must demonstrate that water is used
    efficiently [79]. In areas of high competition for water, such as the Mediterranean
    basin, the water authorities usually impose restrictions on water use that do
    not always make the producer aware of the efficient use of irrigation water, implementing
    precision irrigation based on optimal irrigation schedules [80]. In Spain, water
    allocations are usually assigned per crop, causing occasional disputes between
    water authorities and farmers, who demand more water [81]. In other areas, water
    rights are characterized by elements such as priority date, whereby users who
    first acquired water rights take preference in accessing water resources over
    other users who obtained their rights later. Hence, during droughts periods, reductions
    in water allocations affect “new” farmers first [82]. Accordingly, in a study
    carried out in California’s Central Valley on the effects of water rights on agricultural
    production during drought periods, it was shown that watersheds whose farmers
    have more senior water rights have on average better agricultural productivity
    outcomes than watersheds with more junior rights [83]. In some semi-arid countries,
    particularly during droughts, economic instruments to deal with water allocations
    are available. Water markets are one such instrument, enabling voluntary water
    exchanges between users. Australia, and to a lesser extent, Spain and California,
    are three representative examples of water trade [84]. In a study on the effects
    of droughts on water markets in the three regions indicated above, the authors
    highlighted that drought periods are a triggering factor for water trade between
    users [84]. • Water distribution system and irrigation system. Open channel water
    distribution networks usually entail higher water losses than pressurized irrigation
    networks [85]. Therefore, these losses must be taken into account for irrigation
    programming [86]. Conversely, pressurized irrigation networks show higher water
    use efficiency but also increased energy requirements [87]. In these kinds of
    networks, the operating conditions should be considered in the design of such
    networks. This ensures that hydrant service conditions are adequate for the proper
    functioning of on-field irrigation systems, applying the expected water depth
    and avoiding inadequate irrigation schedules that lead to inefficient use of water
    [88]. The hydraulic features of the on-farm irrigation system must also be considered
    to establish the irrigation programming. These features depend on the type of
    system (surface, sprinkler, or trickle) and its design (layout) and hydrant operation
    (sectoring) [63,89]. • Energy source and its management Pressurized water distribution
    and application systems are generally more efficient in the use of water than
    open channel systems. For this reason, they have become common in recent decades
    [90]. However, the price to be paid for this improvement is the augmentation of
    energy costs, in many cases leading to increases of more than 50% in the cost
    of irrigation compared to previous gravity irrigation systems [85]. In recent
    years, numerous studies have aimed to optimize the use of water and energy in
    irrigation systems at irrigation district scale considering the operation of the
    network (sectoring, control of critical points or electric tariff selection, [91,92,93]).
    The operation of the main hydraulic networks designed to reduce energy costs may
    limit the available irrigation time for farmers conditioning the irrigation schedule
    of their fields. For example, some irrigation districts (ID) in Spain have reduced
    their energy costs by choosing the lowest electric tariff: farmers can irrigate
    during the night from Monday to Friday and for 24 h on Saturdays, Sundays, and
    bank holidays [73]. Their energy costs savings are about 25% for similar water
    use [94]. However, optimal management of irrigation networks does not avoid the
    dependence of irrigation agriculture on fluctuations in energy prices. Therefore,
    in recent years, the reduction of electricity production costs from renewable
    energy sources (wind, solar photovoltaic and micro hydropower) is facilitating
    their incorporation into the irrigation sector [64,95,96]. Since the generation
    of energy depends on suitable weather conditions (sufficient wind or solar radiation
    for pumping), irrigation must be scheduled around the availability of renewably
    sourced energy [64]. • Management and control technologies The technological development
    of the last decade has had enormous repercussions in irrigation management and
    control. Today’s commercial sensors and irrigation controllers, ICs, provide a
    good value for money in an affordable price range for most farmers. In addition,
    the constant improvement of information and communication technologies, ICTs,
    facilitates the interaction between sensors, IC, and users through web platforms
    and applications for mobile devices [62,97]. ICs open and close pipes remotely
    enabling or disabling the electro-valves associated with each irrigation sector
    according to the irrigation times programmed (input data). These are key devices
    to make irrigation easier for farmers as they can start and finish irrigation
    at any time, no matter day or night, during the daily period available for irrigation
    with daily, weekly or monthly frequency. Input data are introduced by the user,
    or a baseline irrigation schedule is updated periodically according to real time
    information on the variables that affect irrigation (e.g., soil moisture, pressure
    at the pumping station, irradiance) measured by sensors [64]. The IC’s operational
    rules may be simple (exceedance of threshold values) or optimal irrigation schedules
    based on soil-plant-water models and optimization procedures [34,98,99,100,101].
    Thus, the IC installed on a farm conditions the irrigation programming. There
    currently exists a wide range of commercial sensors to monitor and control crop,
    soil, climatic variables and the irrigation network. Their records are stored
    in data loggers that, in most cases, can be remotely accessed by ICs and/or web
    platforms/app for mobile terminals. Web platforms funded by either public institutions
    or private associations to support irrigation programming have become a common
    tool among technical staff and farmers, many of them accessible by apps for smartphones/tablets,
    thanks to the exponential development of ICTs in recent years [102]. Irrigation
    apps allow farmers to visualize the key variables of each event, and even act
    on the system from almost anywhere, as telecommunication coverage has improved
    in rural areas. Web platforms and apps are accessible for both individual farmers
    and irrigators’ associations, expanding the number of potential users compared
    to the supervisory control and acquisition data systems, SCADA, which monitored
    and controlled systems from a fixed location and were restricted to associations
    and large farms, but which have been a key factor in the digitization of irrigated
    agriculture [103]. The spatiotemporal variability of applied water depth should
    be considered to improve irrigation scheduling. Remote sensing techniques based
    on the use of satellite images and unmanned aerial vehicles, or geostatistical
    methods that require either detailed soil study and dense sampling or estimation
    of soil moisture content from alternative low-cost techniques (e.g., electromagnetic
    induction exploration techniques) are complementary tools for monitoring the real
    application of irrigation water. This permits the visualization of the spatial
    variability of soil water content, splitting the cropped area into irrigation
    sectors with ad hoc irrigation programs [30,104,105]. • Data analysis and artificial
    intelligence (AI) The modernization of many irrigation networks involved not only
    the change of hydraulic infrastructures, but also the installation of telemetry
    devices, initially aimed at automating billing, recording consumption at user
    level at certain intervals (big data collection) [103]. The robustness of the
    current telemetry systems, most of which are based on wireless communication,
    facilitates database feeding with large amounts of data. It is increasingly common
    today for farmers’ associations to record detailed information on their users’
    water consumption (hourly consumption) throughout the irrigation campaign. These
    massive data sets (weather, crop, soil, irrigation network operation and even
    markets data) require storage space (e.g., cloud storage) to be further processed
    by AI techniques. There are a wide variety of AI techniques, such as artificial
    neural networks, fuzzy logic, or decision trees, that can be applied separately
    or combined to improve the accuracy of irrigation programming [98,102]. Consumption
    data linked to water use features at hydrant level (soil, critical periods of
    crop development, water allocation, etc.), agroclimatic information provided by
    public and/or private web platforms and, when available, the knowledge of farmer’s
    behaviour (related, for example, to their perception of weather conditions, national
    holidays and vacation periods) allow accurate predictions of irrigation scheduling
    at farmer scale (when, how much and for how long he/she irrigates) [106,107,108].
    Accurate individual irrigation schedules aggregated at irrigation district level
    provide valuable information for managers to optimize the use of water and energy.
    • Economy and farmer’s behaviour The costs of current irrigation scheduling systems
    (e.g., ICs, sensors, apps, web platforms, etc.) are generally falling. However,
    for moderate- to low-profit crops, this technology may still be cost-prohibitive
    if it doesn’t significantly increase farmer income [61]. However, the production
    of high value crops in areas with low water availability, such as greenhouse crops
    in Southeast Spain, is highly technological, particularly in irrigation scheduling
    [109]. Market demands have a great influence on farmers, as the economic factor
    is the main driver for improving their irrigation management (including technology).
    Markets, especially for fresh products, demand products be obtained sustainably.
    Water plays a crucial role in the concept of sustainability applied to irrigated
    agricultural production. For growers, it is increasingly important that their
    products are identified as sustainable through the corresponding indicators and
    certifications, in order to maintain or even increase their market price. For
    example, the use of the Water Footprint indicator (volume of water used throughout
    the growing season divided by the production obtained) [110], which can be estimated
    by applying different methodologies (waterfootprint.org, ISO14046 standard [80,111]),
    encourages the use of optimal irrigation scheduling systems to make efficient
    use of water while maintaining production levels. 3. Actual Cases of Application
    of Optimal Irrigation Programming 3.1. Automatic Irrigation Scheduling in Woody
    Crops This study case focuses on the results obtained in the implementation of
    an automated irrigation protocol based on water uptake estimated from soil water
    content data, measured by multi-capacitance probes, on two early-maturing Prunus
    persica L. orchards growing in semi-arid conditions in Southeast Spain. This area
    is subject to Mediterranean climate where water resources are dwindling, and agriculture
    sector accounts for 80% of all water withdrawals. Under this scenario, most water
    user associations must deal with permanent water deficits through the irrigation
    season. The water application for high crop yield and quality must be carried
    out in such a way as to be efficient in relieving stress in the most sensitive
    phenological phases by applying deficit irrigation (DI) strategies [112]. DI requires
    the use of sensors for real time monitoring of the soil-plant-atmosphere system
    [113]. A controlled deficit irrigated peach tree experiment and a full-irrigated
    nectarine tree experiments are described in the following subsections. Both studies
    aim to compare irrigation scheduling based on soil water sensors with an ETc-based
    treatment. 3.1.1. Experimental Site and Plant Material The experiments were carried
    out at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental field station in Santomera, Murcia, Spain (38°06′31″
    N, 1°02′14″ W, 110 m altitude) in two adjacent early-maturing Prunus persica (L.)
    Batsch tree orchards: peach trees (cv. Flordastar) were spaced 5 × 5 m, and nectarine
    trees (cv. Flariba) 6.5 m × 3.5 m, both trained to an open-centre canopy. The
    soil in the 0–0.5 m layer was stony, highly calcareous (45% calcium carbonate),
    with a clay loam texture (clay fraction: 41% Illite, 17% Smectite, and 30% Paligorskita).
    The average bulk density was 1.43 g cm−3. The soil water content at field capacity
    and wilting permanent point were 0.29 and 0.14 m3 m−3, respectively. The average
    electrical conductivity (EC25ºC) of the irrigation water was close to 1.3 dS m−1.
    The irrigation system (97% uniformity coefficient) consisted of a single drip
    line per tree row with pressure-compensated emitters (8 × 2 Lh−1 and 4 × 4 Lh−1
    per tree for peach and nectarine trees, respectively) evenly distributed along
    the lateral. Harvesting took place in the first week of May. Other standard cultural
    practices such as winter pruning (during dormancy), thinning (March) and pest
    control were performed by experiment station personnel. More details on plant
    phenology can be found in [114]. Two treatments were considered: a control (conventional
    100% ETc as ET0 × Kc computations, [37], Kc from [115] and an automated irrigation
    scheduling based on soil water content values. These were distributed in a completely
    randomized design with four repetitions per irrigation treatment, each consisting
    of one row of 13 trees (peach) and six trees (nectarine). 3.1.2. Measurements
    Agrometeorological data, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed,
    global radiation, precipitation, and ET0 (FAO56-Penman Monteith, [37]) were recorded
    by an automated weather station located at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental field station
    and integrated in a web server (http://www.cebas.csic.es/general_spain/est_meteo.html).
    The climate conditions registered were those typical of Mediterranean areas, characterized
    by high seasonality summarized as hot and dry summers and cool and wet winters
    with high evaporative demand (ET0 ten-year average values of 1320 mm) and low
    rainfall, normally below 250 mm. The volumetric soil water content (VSWC) was
    monitored with multi-depth capacitance FDR (Frequency Domain Reflectometry) probes
    (EnviroSCAN) assembled with a PCB interface SDI-12. Four PVC access tubes were
    installed 0.1 m to the emitter located close to the tree trunk in four representative
    trees, one of each replication. Each capacitance probe had sensors fitted to 0.1,
    0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 (nectarine), 0.8 (peach) m depth, and were connected to a radio
    transmission unit, which read every 5 min and recorded the average value every
    15 min. The sensors were previously normalized on air and irrigation water and,
    subsequently, converted to VSWC using Sentek’s default calibration for a clay-loam
    soil. Average VSWC values in the 0–0.5 m soil profile were calculated, since they
    correspond to the maximum root density area [116]. Volumetric counters were installed
    for each treatment and drip gauges were placed below the emitter, in the same
    place location as the capacitance probe, to monitor real time irrigation amount.
    Probes were connected to a radio transmission unit network sending data to a gateway
    connected via TCP/IP to an AddVantage web server. In this server, a feedback condition
    was in charge of triggering and closing electrovalves depending on mean field
    values. Irrigation alarms were also defined to prevent water losses, and electrovalve
    failures. Tree water status was evaluated weekly from March to October in one
    mature leaf per tree and replications (n = 4), by measuring midday stem water
    potential (Ψstem, MPa) using a pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equip. Corp. Model
    3000). Net CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance were measured along
    the season with a portable gas exchange system (LI-COR, LI-6400) for validating
    irrigation practices. 3.1.3. Automated Irrigation Criteria The automated irrigation
    treatment was based on VSWC values in the 0–0.5 m depth, thus soil sensors become
    practical biosensors of the root water uptake. One deeper sensor would monitor
    the wetting front beyond the roots. Integration of average VSWC values and the
    threshold values acted on electro-valves by the telemetry system. As described
    by [117,118] in the peach orchard, the first approach consisted of monitoring
    the VSWC pattern in the peach orchard throughout the season using conventional
    ETc values for irrigation. This resulted in over- and under-irrigation, indicating
    that better scheduling was needed. In the second approach, irrigation was automatically
    managed by checking the VSWC at 22:00 h, and irrigation only started if the SWC
    in the top 0.5 m layer at this time was below 95% of field capacity (FC) and stopped
    when the sensor at 0.8 m depth showed an increase of 2% over its value recorded
    at 22:00 h. This procedure induced a “divergent pattern” on VSWC with a progressive
    decrease in VSWC at 0.8 m, with increasingly higher levels needed before reaching
    the target. In the third approach, real-time irrigation was managed according
    to different VSWC threshold values, as proposed by [119,120], based on the different
    sensitivities to water stress depending on the phenological stage of the tree
    [121], with two periods: during fruit growth, when irrigation started at 95% FC
    and ended at FC, and during post-harvest, when irrigation started at 90 and ended
    at 95% FC. Subsequently, the post-harvest period was divided into two: early (mid-May
    to mid-July, with 90 and 95% FC, for start and end of irrigation, respectively)
    and late (from mid-July onwards, with 85 and 90% FC, respectively). The fourth
    approach consisted of converting previous trigger/stopping criteria into the universal
    management allowed depletion (MAD) fraction, derived from the original water availability
    concept [122]. For stone fruit tress under drip irrigation, the values α = 0.1
    MAD during the critical period (fruit growth and early postharvest) and α = 0.3
    MAD during late-postharvest were applied (Figure 2). This approach was studied
    in a nectarine orchard (with a similar phenology calendar as in peach) with the
    aim of fulfilling plant water requirements [123]. Figure 2. Average volumetric
    soil water content (VSWC, θv) values in the 0-0.5 m soil profile (black line)
    and at 0.7 m depth (red line) during the 2015 irrigation season in the nectarine
    orchard. Blue horizontal line corresponds to field capacity (FC) and black lines
    correspond to the management allowed depletion (MAD, α) imposed threshold values.
    Vertical blue bars indicate daily rainfall. 3.1.4. Results The mean VSWC values
    recorded during the studied periods, in both peach and nectarine experiments,
    varied between the imposed threshold values, for automatically start and stop
    irrigation, demonstrating the suitability of the automated irrigation strategy.
    It should be noted that irrigation events could occur at any time of the day according
    to the rules defined above, and when precipitation events matched with irrigation,
    irrigation was automatically stopped as soon as VSWC reached the imposed values.
    It must be pointed out that only heavy precipitation events, such as those recorded
    during spring (46.6 mm in March and 87 mm early September) (Figure 2), induced
    significant increases in VSWC values at 0.7 m depth, possibly causing some water
    losses through the plant root influence. However, VSWC at a deeper soil profile
    remained constant most of the time. Therefore, drainage can be assumed to be negligible
    under these conditions. VSWC-based treatment induced moderate water deficits in
    peach trees as indicated the lower Ψstem values (up to −1.5 MPa) compared with
    the control trees (around −0.8 MPa) during the postharvest period [117,120]. Ψstem
    values for nectarine trees remained around −1 MPa in both treatments [123]. As
    many authors have proposed for deciduous fruit trees [117,121,124,125,126], the
    post-harvest period is suitable for applying regulated deficit irrigation strategies
    because this stage is less sensitive to soil water deficits than during fruiting.
    Interestingly, in the two studied early-maturing Prunus cultivars, post-harvest
    is the longest period of the growing season, accounting for 80% of the water requirements
    needed for the entire irrigation season [120], and is important because it is
    when carbohydrate reserves are accumulated and the floral differentiation process
    occurs [127]. Accordingly, water deficits should be managed carefully in order
    to avoid severe plant water deficits that would reduce bloom and fruit load in
    the next season’s harvest [117,120,121,125,126,128]. Other studies have indicated
    that monitoring the VSWC with capacitive FDR probes improved overall irrigation,
    providing good calibration, installation, and data acquisition and interpretation
    [113,114,120,129]. Ref. [130] suggested pulsed irrigations based on MAD (maintained
    between 50 and 15%) for automated irrigation of watermelons; when the given set
    point was detected, a 30 min irrigation cycle was initiated followed by a 1h wait
    period. Furthermore, [131] compared several irrigation scheduling algorithms including,
    among others, soil-based ones using granular matrix sensors and soil water balance.
    They concluded that the latter seemed to be economical, easy to implement and
    accurate for automatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated apple trees. Our
    findings indicated that irrigation scheduling based on precise VSWC threshold
    values is a useful tool for monitoring the soil water status, allowing automatic
    and efficient irrigation management. When probes are located at the maximum root
    exploration volume and the thresholds were precisely defined, an adequate plant
    water status was favoured, resulting in slight water deficits limiting only vegetative
    growth while maintaining high yields with prime quality. A peach yield of 18.2
    t ha−1 was obtained in the soil-based treatment, which was non-significantly different
    in comparison with 20.1 t ha−1 in the traditional scheduled trees, allowing a
    33% of water saving against an irrigation application of 7000–7300 m3 ha−1) [117,120].
    In addition, the real-time SWC values led to the automation of irrigation without
    inducing water stress in nectarine trees, deriving irrigation factors that in
    a practical, easy and precise manner, allowed precision irrigationto be managed
    [123]. Annual water requirements for early-maturing nectarine trees, in the agro-climatic
    area of Region de Murcia (Southeast Spain), figured ≈ 6600 m3 ha−1, with irrigation
    frequency varying from <1 to 7 days a week depending on the phenological period.
    However, in this experiment only 4500 m3 ha−1 were applied, with around 30% of
    water savings as compared to control trees irrigated following traditional FAO-56
    approach. 3.2. Irrigation Scheduling in Arable Crops Agriculture in Castilla-La
    Mancha (CLM) occupies an area of 3,773,029 ha, of which 557,851 ha are irrigated
    lands [132], mainly with sprinkler and drip irrigation systems. The use of irrigation
    in the area is the result of low average annual precipitation (around 400 mm year−1)
    and high reference evapotranspiration (>1100 mm year−1), characterizing the area
    as semi-arid [133]. The most common irrigated crops are grapes, cereals, garlic,
    onion, melon, watermelon, pepper, and others such as sunflower, potato, and alfalfa.
    Approximately 70% of the irrigable area in CLM is located close to groundwater
    sources (average electrical conductivity EC = 0.8 dS m−1, which is suitable for
    irrigation), given that most surface water resources are used in other bordering
    regions. In order to avoid the overexploitation of these aquifers, farmers are
    restricted in the use of water by the water authority in the area (“Confederación
    Hidrográfica del Júcar” in the case of the Eastern Mancha aquifer, and “Confederación
    Hidrográfica del Guadiana” in the case of the Western Mancha and Campo de Montiel
    aquifers). Every year, the water authority determines the amount of water that
    each farmer can use, depending on the progression of the piezometric levels of
    the aquifers. Consequently, the total area irrigated in the region varies each
    year, as does the crop pattern, which is conditioned by the evolution of the harvest
    prices. Moreover, the increasing cost of energy required for pumping groundwater
    and irrigating crops using pressurized irrigation systems is another factor conditioning
    the use of water and the profitability of the irrigated farms. Groundwater in
    the area is free, but farmers must pay for the energy and the amortization of
    the irrigation systems. Thus, the average water cost in the area is around 0.12
    € m−3 [134]. Large areas of rainfed land were transformed into irrigated land
    during the 1970s and 1980s, whereby the average size of the holdings (rainfed
    and irrigated) is about 33 ha, which is an appropriate size for farm profitability.
    However, only 8% of farmers are younger than 40 years, and many of them combine
    agriculture with other activities, fostering the adoption of innovative methodologies
    and the modernization of their exploitations [135]. As a way to maximize the production
    profitability of irrigated crops in water scare regions such as CLM, the Regional
    Centre of Water Research (CREA) of Castilla-La Mancha University (UCLM) has developed
    MOPECO (economic optimization model of irrigation water) [136,137,138]. The model
    is based on FAO-33 [139] and FAO-56 [38] methodologies, and has been calibrated
    for different annual extensive crops in several areas of the world [137,140,141,142,143,144,145].
    MOPECO is designed to provide farmers with a reliable and friendly on-line tool
    for the proper management of farms and crops based on water productivity (WP).
    3.2.1. Optimal Distribution of Crops and Optimized Irrigation Scheduling MOPECO’s
    main goal is to maximize the gross margin (GM) of irrigable lands dedicated to
    the cultivation of annual crops through the efficient use of irrigation water
    and available irrigable area. A set of data (Figure 3) is required for the simulation
    of the optimal “Yield vs. Total Net Water” (Y vs. TWN), function of each crop
    under the climatic conditions of a certain year being TWN = net irrigation (IN)
    + effective rainfall (Pe). To obtain Y vs. TWN, the model simulates a range of
    deficit irrigation schedules using the optimized regulated deficit irrigation
    (ORDI) methodology [137], considering the effects of irrigation uniformity [146]
    and electrical conductivity of water on yield [141]. Figure 3. MOPECO flowchart.
    The ORDI methodology maximizes crop yield for a certain actual evapotranspiration
    value (ETa) versus maximum evapotranspiration rate (ETm) objective for the whole
    crop growing period. The methodology determines the value of the ETa/ETm ratio
    for the main Ky (crop yield response factor by growing stage; [139]) stages defined
    for each crop (i.e., establishment and vegetative development, flowering, grain
    development and ripening in the case of cereals). This combination of ETa/ETm
    rates maximizes the crop yield according to the simulations carried out, using
    the equation proposed by [147]. Consequently, this methodology allows the Y vs.
    TWN function to be generated by simulating several irrigation schedules (the model
    determines 100 points of the function, but the user may vary this number). In
    order to decrease the number of simulations for determining the crop irrigation
    requirements under local climatic conditions, the typical meteorological year
    (TMY) [148] was adapted by [144] for irrigation scheduling. A TMY consists of
    12 months selected from individual years and concatenated to form a complete year
    with daily unmodified values (maximum and minimum temperature, ETo and rainfall)
    which show a perfect interrelationship. In order to consider several scenarios
    of irrigation water requirements, dry, intermediate, and wet TMYs were considered
    [145]. The Y vs. TWN function is translated into “Yield vs. Total Gross Water”
    (Y vs. TWG), where TWG = gross irrigation (IG) + Pe, to include the application
    efficiency of the irrigation system. The Gross Margin (GM) vs. TWG function is
    then calculated using crop economic data. Finally, the model calculates the optimal
    crop distribution and the amount of water assigned to each crop that fulfils the
    restrictions imposed by the user (selected crops, total irrigable area, and total
    available volume of irrigation water) for certain climatic conditions through
    the direct solution algorithm developed by [136]. This algorithm calculates the
    reference points where the tangent lines that connect each pair of GM vs. TWG
    functions show the maximum slope. These tangent lines define the “Pareto front”
    [149], which represents the maximum GM possible for each irrigation depth supplied
    to the crop. On this line, it is impossible to benefit one variable affecting
    the GM without damaging another. Therefore, MOPECO uses historic economic and
    climatic data to provide farmers the most likely crop distribution to maximize
    the profitability of their farms (Figure 3). In the optimal crop distribution,
    MOPECO usually assigns a volume of water to crops lower than their full irrigation
    requirements for the climatic conditions of the typical meteorological year (TMY)
    [144,148]. This is because maximum GM is generally reached by applying irrigation
    depths lower than that required for the maximum yield (Figure 3) due to the effect
    of irrigation uniformity, water cost, and water crop productivity (WP), which
    usually increases with deficit irrigation [150]. Moreover, under real conditions,
    future climatic data are unknown, and it is consequently impossible to determine
    the optimal irrigation schedule at the beginning of the irrigation season. To
    solve this question, [138] developed ORDI for limited volumes of irrigation water,
    which modifies the ETa/ETm objective of the different Ky stages in several consecutive
    optimizations, according to the progression of the real climatic conditions, the
    amount of irrigation water applied at the end of each stage, and the volume available
    for the following ones. In order to maximize yield, the methodology determines
    the deficit in terms of ETa/ETm to be applied to the crop at each Ky stage and
    estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit
    by using the TMY climatic data and the MOPECO simulation model (1st optimization).
    Thus, during the first Ky stage, the objective is to apply the irrigation schedule
    that reaches the ETa/ETm objective determined by the methodology for that stage
    under real management conditions. At the end of the first stage, the ETa/ETm reached
    by the crop (estimated by MOPECO) should be similar to the target (in the first
    stage there is sufficient irrigation water) or higher (if the climatic conditions
    and/or the soil water availability do not allow that level of deficit to be generated).
    However, the amount of irrigation water applied to the crop will likely be different
    to that forecast by the model. Consequently, after the first Ky stage, the methodology
    determines new ETa/ETm targets for the following Ky stages, taking into account
    the actual remaining irrigation water (2nd optimization). The same methodology
    is followed at the end of each Ky stage. During the optimizations, a certain amount
    of irrigation water is saved for the last stage (that determined in the 2nd optimization)
    in order to avoid the total depletion of irrigation water during previous Ky stage.
    This methodology has been successfully applied under real management conditions
    in barley and garlic, as explained below. 3.2.2. Applications In order to validate
    MOPECO and assess its applicability, the following experiments were conducted
    in commercial farms under different water availability scenarios [134,151,152,153,154].
    The time and volume of water supplied to each experiment were determined by MOPECO
    and checked by soil moisture sensors or gravimetric samples. Maize The effect
    of irrigation uniformity on maize (Zea Mays L.) yield and profitability was evaluated
    in 2016 in Albacete (Spain), in two adjacent sectors equipped with a solid set
    sprinkler irrigation system [153]. The field was managed according to FAO-56 methodology
    throughout the growing season to maximize grain yield without water stress (Sector
    S1, considering 50% adequacy) or irrigation scheduling determined by an experienced
    producer (Sector S2). Irrigation uniformity was evaluated using catch cans in
    both fields and grain yield was harvested within zones exhibiting 75% (Z1), 100%
    (Z2), and 125% (Z3) of area-averaged volume applications throughout the year.
    The average coefficient of uniformity (CU) in both sectors (S1 and S2) was 83.5%,
    and the net volume of applied irrigation water totalled 709 mm in S1 and 832 mm
    in S2. Irrigation Water productivity (WP) was higher in S1 (2.20 kg m−3) than
    in S2 (2.05 kg m−3), highlighting the benefits of an accurate irrigation schedule
    on the efficient use of water. Nevertheless, average grain yield in sector S2
    approached the maximum expected yield of 18.4 Mg ha−1 and exhibited no significant
    differences in yield among zones. In contrast, sector S1 exhibited significant
    yield differences (p < 0.05) across zones with a measured yield in Z3 of 18.5
    Mg ha−1 and a yield reduction of 1.6 Mg ha−1 and 4.0 Mg ha−1 in Z2 and Z1, respectively.
    Consequently, the area-averaged yield in S1 was 8% lower than in S2. This last
    treatment was positively influenced by a higher amount of irrigation water supplied
    to the crop (17%), which decreased the effect of low CU (83.5%). Because of these
    yield differences and the relatively low cost of irrigation water (0.07 € m−3),
    area averaged gross margin in S1 was 18% lower compared with S2, discouraging
    an efficient use of water by the farmer. On the other hand, the grain yields simulated
    by MOPECO for each monitoring zone within the sectors exhibited similar magnitude
    and trends. Simulations with MOPECO over a range of CU showed that improved irrigation
    uniformity increased area-averaged yields and gross margin when following the
    S1 instead of S2 strategy. In other words, efficient use of irrigation water through
    accurate irrigation scheduling and/or the use of regulated deficit irrigation
    techniques requires advanced management and maintenance of the irrigation systems.
    Purple garlic A two years (2015-2016) “Morado de Las Pedroñeras” purple garlic
    field experiment was conducted in Albacete (Spain) [151]. The evaluated volumes
    of irrigation water were: no deficit “ND”; and four volumes of available irrigation
    water: 100% “T100”, 90% “T90”, 80% “T80”, and 70% “T70” of the net irrigation
    requirements (In = 3400 m3 ha−1 = T100) for the climatic conditions of the intermediate
    TMY). ORDI treatments reached high yields (between 10,055 kg ha−1 of treatment
    ND and 8260 kg ha−1 of T70), also improving the productivity of the irrigation
    water (up to 7.7 kg m−3 with T70). Consequently, the blue water footprint (irrigation
    water) of purple garlic decreased from 0.287 m3 kg−1 of ND treatment to 0.173
    m3 kg−1 of T70. The ND treatment achieved the best combination between yield and
    bulb calibre with high commercial value in both seasons. In 2015, the deficit
    treatments reached a similar distribution of calibres than that of the ND. However,
    the unfavourable climatic conditions of 2016 affected the distribution of calibres
    of ORDI treatments, shifting to calibres with lower price. Thus, the average profitability
    of the ND treatment was around 9800 € ha−1 vs. 6000 € ha−1 of T70. Reaching the
    same total production of garlic in the productive area of purple garlic in CLM
    by using the T70 strategy instead of ND, it would be possible to reduce the irrigation
    requirements by around 37% with reductions in percolation due to better use of
    rainfall water. Nevertheless, the bulbs would be smaller, decreasing the price
    of the harvests and affecting the final profitability of the farms. This would
    be higher in wet years due to a larger area of the farm being cultivated with
    lower stressed garlic. In contrast, in dry years like 2016, profitability would
    decrease notably affecting the profitability of the farms. This may diminish the
    interest in this methodology in a highly profitable crop such as garlic, which
    requires high investment for its cultivation. Barley This experiment was similar
    to the previous one and was conducted during 2015, 2016 and 2017 seasons in Albacete
    (Spain) [154]. Five irrigation water volumes (one with no deficit “ND”, and four
    limited volumes of available irrigation water, corresponding to 100% “T100”, 90%
    “T90”, 80% “T80”, and 70% of IN = 2500 m3ha−1) were evaluated. As an average,
    ORDI achieved higher yields for the water received (between 9040 kg ha−1 of the
    ND treatment and 6339 kg ha−1 of the T70), enhancing irrigation water productivity
    (from 2.75 kg m−3 of the ND up to 3.64 kg m−3 of the T80). Accordingly, the barley
    blue water footprint was reduced, evolving from 0.360 m3 kg−1 of the ND to 0.275
    m3 kg−1 of the T80. All the treatments fulfilled the quality requirements demanded
    by the malt industry, which were not affected by the ORDI strategy. As expected,
    the average profitability of ND treatment in the area (average 281.84 € ha−1)
    was higher than the others (average 260.63 € ha−1 for T80). Nevertheless, the
    application of the T80 methodology in all the barley area cultivated in the Eastern
    CLM region instead of ND during the three experimental years would involve a 30.1%
    reduction in irrigation water and a 13.3% increase in water productivity. This
    water saving (38.3 hm3 in three years) could be used to replenish the Eastern
    CLM aquifer (at risk of over exploitation), reducing the pumping energy costs
    and improving the ecosystems depending on the aquifer, and/or to supply water
    to more profitable crops in the area improving the economy of the region. Barley,
    Maize and Onion This experiment was conducted in2014 and 2015 in Albacete (Spain)
    [134]. The objective was to compare the profitability of a 240 ha irrigated commercial
    farm considering two irrigation strategies. The traditional strategy (T) consisted
    of applying full irrigation (F treatments) to a distribution of crops (barley,
    maize and onion), considering several volumes of irrigation water (from 2000 up
    to 8000 m3 ha−1, varying the total area dedicated to each crop by using the direct
    solution algorithm obtained by MOPECO) and four market price scenarios considering
    a water cost of 0.12 € m−3. Depending on the availability of irrigation water,
    the MOPECO strategy (M) consisted of applying to the same crops full irrigation
    or the combinations of water deficit per growing stage determined by ORDI methodology
    (O treatments). The optimal global deficits were: 30% ETm for barley (ETa/ETm
    = 0.7), 10% ETm for maize (ETa/ETm = 0.9), and 10% ETm for onion (ETa/ETm = 0.9).
    For low availabilities of irrigation water (between 2000 and 5000 m3 ha−1), the
    M strategy achieved a profitability up to 8.2% higher than T in the most favourable
    scenario, but the average for all the scenarios was around 2.8%, which was much
    lower than expected (8.0%) according to the simulations carried out by MOPECO
    using historic climatic and economic data. Despite the lower increase in profitability,
    in all the cases, the WP of the ORDI treatments was higher (average 12.4% for
    barley; 3.6% for maize; and 1.4% for onion). The causes of these results were
    the drought conditions of the two experimental years during spring time that increased
    the amount of water required by barley, the unfavourable climatic conditions during
    2015 for onion and maize that decreased their yields and the price progression
    during both seasons (close to unprofitable values for onion in the first year).
    Thus, barley, a priori, the crop which could yield a water saving (because of
    its low profitability) required more water than forecast and decreased the availability
    of water for the other two crops. This work brought to light the necessity of
    modifying ORDI, resulting in the development of ORDI for limited volumes of water
    [138]. For higher availabilities of irrigation water (between 5000 and 8000 m3
    ha−1), the results of F and O scenarios were similar since there was sufficient
    water for avoiding deficit irrigation. 4. Discussion The above study cases described
    the response of a wide range of crops to two different irrigation scheduling approaches
    under semi-arid conditions: one based on real time SWC measurements and the other
    based on simulation models. The automatic irrigation system (AIS) efficiently
    processed and sent the user real-time field data (SWC, applied irrigation volume,
    and weather data). It also activated/deactivated the electrovalves that control
    the beginning and end of irrigation events. To this end, the AIS effectively combined
    the information collected by a wireless sensor (WS) network with climate information
    available through a web platform to actuate the electrovalves using ICT technologies.
    Likewise, all recorded data were stored in the cloud, being accessible anywhere/anytime
    for advisory services to farmers. AIS can be adapted to different crops. In this
    work, it was implemented in woody crops (peach and nectarine). A deficit irrigation
    strategy was applied, achieving savings of around 30% in water, energy and labour
    costs compared to the conventional irrigation system. It should be considered
    that the implementation of AIS in commercial farms involves the study of the spatial
    variability of the soil properties before the installation of the soil water sensors
    in order to select the monitoring point or points. A minimum of three probes is
    required to adequately represent the wet bulb. Hence, robust and cheap sensors
    for soil, plant, and atmosphere measurements are needed to promote the adoption
    of AIS in farms. Regarding weather variables, real time and forecasted weather
    information provided by public and private weather services could be integrated
    in the irrigation schedule (rainfall time, intensity, ETo) to improve its accuracy
    [155,156]. Sensor, hardware and software providers are currently involved in a
    process to enable the design of customized AIS based on SCADA or other middleware
    [155] to process inputs and operate irrigation networks in real time. Additionally,
    APPs implemented on hand-pocket smart devices will provide decision makers with
    an easy access to real-time data [62,156]. Likewise, the WS networks, as well
    as the other technological components of AIS, require supervision and maintenance
    and a minimum level of knowledge for their handling and interpretation of the
    data. If the user does not have such knowledge, he/she should use technical advisory
    services. The investment in the AIS (from 3000 €, investment + operation) and
    the need for knowledge are the main limiting factor for commercial application
    of AIS. These deterrents have also been highlighted in other studies carried out
    in Australia, USA or European countries, such as Italy and Portugal [61,157,158,159].
    In these analyses, authors state that farmers tend to maintain traditional agricultural
    practices and are usually reluctant to adopt new technologies [157]. In addition,
    the maintenance costs required is also a limiting factor for the incorporation
    of these new technologies [157]. Hence, knowledge exchange between researchers,
    farmers and other stakeholders is recommended to encourage the technological development
    and automation of irrigated agriculture [61].If this approach is properly transferred
    to the irrigation community, it will be a great step forward in the efficient
    use of water in irrigated agriculture. Thus, in regions with permanent water scarcity
    and high-value crops (e.g., Mediterranean environments), AIS can be worthwhile
    by underpinning highly profitable production with lower water endowments than
    traditional systems. Furthermore, models like MOPECO are the core of decision
    support systems (DSS) that strengthen farmers’ ability to preserve their profitability
    under low water availability conditions. MOPECO provides valuable information
    to improve crops distributions before planting and optimize irrigation scheduling
    in order to maximize water productivity. Additionally, at the level of water resource
    managers, it is also an adequate tool to analyse the effects of water policies
    on the agricultural sector. MOPECO highlights the importance of suitable management
    of irrigation water through proper maintenance and use of the irrigation system,
    as well as determining the most suitable irrigation scheduling. In addition, under
    limited water availability conditions, MOPECO reduces water allocation for lower
    profitable crops (i.e., barley) and reallocates them to more profitable crops.
    Farmers sometimes solve the lack of uniformity of their irrigation systems by
    supplying larger amounts of irrigation water than that required by crops. This
    strategy is evidently not justifiable from an environmental point of view, especially
    in areas where water is scarce. However, if water cost is low and/or the water
    authority does not offer any incentives to save water, farmers may use this strategy
    because it is easier than evaluating their irrigation system. In addition to the
    lack of uniformity, irrigation schedules must be overestimated considering evaporation
    and drift losses in order to provide farmers with realistic values but avoiding
    percolation at least in mostof the field. These questions are even more significant
    when proposing farmers apply regulated deficit irrigation methodologies in annual
    crops. MOPECO increases crop WP as a way to increase the profitability of farms
    by using the ORDI methodology. The drop in yield per unit of area is compensated
    for by a larger irrigated area with a higher WP, using the same amount of water
    within the farm. Consequently, ORDI does not decrease the amount of water used
    but increases the yield per unit of water volume supplied to the crop. This evidence
    has also been shown in previous works carried out in Australia, Spain, Morocco,
    and the Middle East. In these studies, adopting efficient irrigation systems has
    led to higher water use efficiencies but this water conservation has been used
    to expand the irrigated area or to change to more profitable crops [157,158,159,160,161].
    Nevertheless, the effect of ORDI on the quality parameters of certain crops, such
    as horticultural ones, must be analysed before advising farmers to use it. Thus,
    in crops such as garlic or onion, ORDI increased WP but the decrease in the size
    of bulbs reduced their profitability per unit of yield, questioning the suitability
    of this methodology in this type of crops. Moreover, the increase in the cultivated
    area generates higher costs that must also be considered, although the cost per
    unit of area is lower (lower amount of water, fertilizers, harvest costs, etc.).
    Consequently, an economic analysis validated under real cropping conditions is
    required in these cases. ORDI can be useful for farms where the amount of irrigation
    water is limited. The application of ORDI in garlic and barley under real management
    conditions showed an increase in WP, a reduced water footprint and a clear increase
    in the profitability of farms and barley cropping areas (and probably other cereals
    or low profitable crops). Transferring this methodology to the productive sector
    involves adapting these kinds of tools to the skills and necessities of farmers
    and technicians. Applying models such as MOPECO requires calibration and validation
    processes before use, as well as the availability of local climatic data (public
    or private) and the installation of irrigation control devices (flow meters and
    soil moisture sensors), the number of which may vary depending on the total field
    area and its soil uniformity, using at least one monitoring point at two depths
    in the most representative area of the field i.e., at the location of the major
    roots depth concentration and at maximum root depth for controlling percolation.
    All these aspects entail costs for both the public administration and farmers
    themselves (individuals or associations), which maybe unaffordable for certain
    farms. Thus, in addition to developingthe tools and training the farmers and technicians,
    the total cost of the system is around 4650 € + taxes + installation. Therefore,
    the positive results of the advanced technologies presented (AIS and DSS) are
    not without cost. They require investment in equipment, and expenditure on operation
    and maintenance, as well as qualified technical and maintenance services. Likewise,
    they need robust sensors, as well as the availability of advanced support services.
    In the case that such conditions are accomplished, these technologies will only
    be able to provide value to farms with low water availability, high profitability,
    and substantial technical-economic capacity. Both irrigation programming approaches
    (AIS and DSS) are adequate tools to use irrigation water efficiently only if they
    are properly implemented in high uniformity irrigation networks. In irrigation
    systems with no accurate hydraulic design and poor maintenance (e.g., emitter
    clogging) water will never be used efficiently no matter how good the available
    irrigation management tools are. 5. Conclusions This work reviews the main variables
    affecting optimal irrigation scheduling and their interrelationships. Two approaches
    to irrigation scheduling conducted in semi-arid areas of Southeast Spain are presented:
    one based on real time crop monitoring applied to woody crops at the farm scale
    and the other, for arable crops, applicable at the regional, irrigation district,
    and farm scales, based on water management models. The analysis of both evaluated
    case studies shows that computer support and ICTs, availability of meteorological
    information and crop data during the growing season, sensors, and irrigation programmers
    among other elements are required to provide optimal irrigation scheduling solutions
    and improved resource allocation under water scarcity conditions. Additionally,
    to succeed in the adoption of these new water management technologies, well designed
    and maintained hydraulic facilities are needed. This implies investment and maintenance
    costs, which could make them unsuitable for low profitability farms. In addition,
    adopting these approaches requires from the users technical training and willingness
    to accept irrigation schedules based not only on personal experience but also
    on data-driven decision-making processes. Hence, irrigation advisory services
    (public or private) can play a key role in driving this technology change in the
    irrigation sector. More robust and cheaper sensors would also contribute in this
    way. Therefore, to date, the return of these technologies is worth the investments
    and costs required to use them in the case of farms with low water availability,
    high profitability, and relevant technical-economic capacity. Society, as an end
    beneficiary, may also play a key role in this technological change. The demand
    for sustainable crops is closely linked to optimal irrigation scheduling, which
    could raise the price of agricultural products and thus tip the balance in favour
    of the implementation of ICTs in irrigated agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization:

    Notes Abstract Climate change, water scarcity and higher energy requirements and
    electric tariff compromises the continuity of the irrigated agriculture. Precision
    agriculture (PA) or renewable energy sources which are based on communication
    and information technologies and a large amount of data are key to ensuring this
    economic activity and guaranteeing food security at the global level. Several
    works which are based on the use of PA and renewable energy sources have been
    developed in order to optimize different variables of irrigated agriculture such
    as irrigation scheduling. However, the large amount of technologies and sensors
    that these models need to be implemented are still far from being easily accessible
    and usable by farmers. In this way, a middleware called Real time Smart Solar
    Irrigation Manager (RESSIM) has been developed in this work and implemented in
    MATLABTM with the aim to provide to farmers a user-friendly tool for the daily
    making decision process of irrigation scheduling using a smart photovoltaic irrigation
    management module. RESSIM middleware was successfully tested in a real field during
    a full irrigation season of olive trees using a real smart photovoltaic irrigation
    system. Keywords: irrigation scheduling; precision agriculture; sustainable irrigation;
    software; ICTs; hydraulic modelling 1. Introduction The increase in energy requirements
    and water scarcity, has led to a rise in the operating costs of irrigated agriculture
    [1], aggravated by higher electricity tariff and fuel prices. Likewise, pressurized
    irrigation systems have greater environmental impact than gravity irrigation systems
    due to the use of energy [2,3]. To minimise these adverse impacts, the use of
    precision agriculture [4] and renewable energy sources is being promoted to improve
    the sustainability of irrigation agriculture. Both precision agriculture and the
    use of renewable energy sources require the use of a large amount of data from
    highly heterogeneous sensors as well as the use of information and communication
    technologies (ICTs) for their communication. In this way, several works have been
    developed, such as Reference [5], in which solar energy was applied to small-scale
    irrigation, covering daily water needs. The hybrid use of several renewable energy
    sources (wind/solar) have also been developed to meet irrigation energy needs
    and to increase the crop profitability [6,7] developed a Smart Photovoltaic Irrigation
    Manager (SPIM), which provides a daily irrigation scheduling for crops at plot
    scale, using photovoltaic (PV) solar energy to pump water to the irrigation network
    to meet crop irrigation requirements according to the available solar energy.
    This model developed in MATLABTM synchronizes the photovoltaic solar energy to
    optimize the daily irrigation scheduling computing the daily irrigation requirements,
    the hydraulic behaviour of the irrigation network establishing the optimum irradiance
    threshold per irrigation sector, the instantaneous photovoltaic power production
    from pyranometer sensor and the daily soil water balance. Bhattacharjee et al.
    [8] developed a model to collect underground water using a submersible pump by
    a solar photovoltaic system in remote areas. The model included a solar charge
    controller connected to an inverter for the pump motor operation. Bouchakour et
    al. [9] developed an algorithm based on fuzzy logic to improve photovoltaic water
    pumping system performance. All these models are based on data from a wide range
    of sensors, various web platforms such as climatic web platforms and commercial
    irrigation controllers [7]. However, the volume and nature of the data used by
    these models introduces a significant challenge in the implementation of solar
    irrigation management tools in commercial fields which must operate in real time.
    In addition, a development trend in precision agriculture is standardisation [10],
    in order to achieve software sharing and interoperability of computer programs
    [11] and provide to farmers a robust, scalable and adaptable tool to help the
    daily making decision process. Peres et al. [12] worked in this context developing
    an autonomous intelligent gateway infrastructure for in-field processing in precision
    viticulture. However, this model implements only the hardware, communication capabilities
    and software architecture of an intelligent autonomous gateway, designed to provide
    the necessary middleware between locally deployed sensor networks and a remote
    location within the whole farm without considering the implementations of smart
    photovoltaic irrigation models developed by other researchers. In this work, a
    new middleware called Real time Smart Solar Irrigation Manager (RESSIM) has been
    developed to control the operation of a smart photovoltaic irrigation system in
    real time. The core of this middleware is a smart photovoltaic irrigation management
    module, developed in MATLABTM, that handles the information received from the
    irrigation controller and climate web platforms. RESSIM has been developed under
    a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) with MATLABTM GUIDE and was applied
    for irrigation management of a commercial olive grove in southern Spain. 2. RESSIM
    Design 2.1. Model Description RESSIM is a platform which connect software modules,
    graphical user interface (GUI), databases (building and management) and remote
    connections with different data sources (irrigation controller and its linked
    sensors and web platforms). RESSIM links six modules (Figure 1): smart PV irrigation
    management, database, irrigation control, field sensing, agroclimatic information
    and GUI to make RESSIM a user-friendly middleware. These modules are described
    next. Figure 1. Architecture of Real time Smart Solar Irrigation Manager (RESSIM).
    2.1.1. Smart PV Irrigation Management Module The core of RESSIM is the smart photovoltaic
    irrigation management module known as Smart Photovoltaic Irrigation Manager (SPIM)
    [7]. This model synchronizes the availability of photovoltaic energy with the
    energy demand of the different irrigation sectors to meet the daily crop irrigation
    needs. SPIM integrates several calculation modules to obtain the decision variables
    required for irrigation management. One of these variables is the daily crop irrigation
    needs, calculated from evapotranspiration and precipitation data and crop water
    requirements. The irrigation system is operated in sectors, thus hydraulic modelling
    techniques are used to estimate the power requirements of each one. The supplied
    electric power depends on the energy production of the photovoltaic plant, estimated
    according to Reference [13]. Additionally, in the SPIM model the soil is considered
    as a water storage tank, so the soil water balance is computed daily. Using this
    information and daily priority rules, the optimum operating sequence of the irrigation
    sectors can be established in real time. As only photovoltaic energy is used to
    power the system, the presence of clouds may prevent the system from operating
    long enough to meet the daily crop irrigation needs. When this is the case, soil
    water content is checked, and if the moisture content is enough to fill the irrigation
    deficit, soil water is assumed to satisfy the irrigation needs of that day. Otherwise,
    the irrigation time of the following day is increased to compensate for the irrigation
    deficit. Real-time information about climate type, soil moisture content, solar
    installation and the status of the system’s hydraulic devices (e.g., open valve,
    pressure head at the pumping station) is used to calculate all the elements described
    above. The information required by SPIM is obtained from the database module and
    the communication module with the climate web platform. A detailed description
    of the SPIM model can be found in [7]. 2.1.2. Irrigation Controller In most farms,
    commercial irrigation controllers are used to apply the crop water requirements
    according to a predefined irrigation scheduling plan. Most commercial irrigation
    controllers are built over a database, “commercial database”, which is used to
    operate them (reading sensor measurements and sending orders to actuators). Remote
    sensors are also included in the commercial irrigation controller as an external
    device and their measurements are recorded in the same database. Thus, commercial
    irrigation controllers are just an interpreter of its database through create,
    read, update and delete (CRUD) queries. These CRUD queries enable the irrigation
    controller to read the external sensors and give any orders to filters, electro
    valves, etc., which control the irrigation process. Likewise, the opening or closing
    process of all irrigation system elements (electro valves, filters…) are also
    managed by the irrigation controller through its database. Consequently, irrigation
    controller is just a listener of its database, where the status of each field
    sets its behaviour. Thus, managing the commercial database allows the irrigation
    controller and all their connected devices to be handled. Hence, in this work,
    the commercial irrigation controller was managed by RESSIM to target the commercial
    database through Structured Query Language (SQL) queries. 2.1.3. Field Sensing
    Module and Remote Agroclimatic Data Module Two different ways to get and save
    information from field sensors were implemented in RESSIM. Most of the commercial
    irrigation controllers enable the integration of multiple sensors regardless of
    the transmission protocol. Measures from these sensors can be saved in its commercial
    database. Thus, RESSIM could read and operate these sensors through its database.
    For example, RESSIM managed in real time a pyranometer which was installed in
    the studied field. By RESSIM and the real time processing of pyranometer data,
    the smart PV irrigation management module could compute the instantaneous power
    available for irrigation sectors. Alternatively, RESSIM could integrate other
    sensors, different from those initially included in the database. Thus, any other
    sensor, that can send information to a cloud repository, may be managed by the
    system. The remote agroclimatic data module allowed agro-climatic information
    required by the smart PV irrigation management module (SPIM, in this work) to
    be obtained. These data are collected from a public weather stations platform.
    This module, developed in MATLABTM, gets information from public websites by HTTP
    callbacks and sent it to RESSIM as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. Then,
    this information was managed by RESSIM and sent to the smart PV irrigation management
    module. 2.1.4. Database Module The database module was made up by two databases:
    commercial and open databases. The commercial one was a relational database which
    resides on a separate machine from the irrigation controller. This commercial
    database was accessible by TCP/IP connection and SQL server. Frequently, the irrigation
    controller database is private. Therefore, information about username, password,
    database name and port where the database was running was necessary for RESSIM.
    In this work, the commercial database was managed by CRUD functions from RESSIM.
    The open database was automatically created by RESSIM at the first-time execution.
    This database consisted of five relational tables and was developed in MATLABTM,
    using SQL server (Figure 2). The first table, “Farm’s Owner Table”, relates each
    user to their farm(s). Information about location and the number of sectors that
    make up the irrigation network is required by SPIM. Thus, farm description is
    recorded in “Farm Description Table”. Figure 2. Architecture of the open database
    of RESSIM. Several agroclimatic parameters, such as reference evapotranspiration,
    rainfall, temperature and solar radiation are required by SPIM. For each farm,
    these data are stored in “Agroclimatic Data Table”. On the other hand, the power
    demand of each sector of the irrigation network computed by SPIM is saved in “Farm
    PV Power Table”. Finally, “Operating Sector Table” stores the daily sequential
    operating sectors of each farm as a Boolean variable (open/close). 2.1.5. RESSIM
    Middleware and RESSIM GUI RESSIM software and RESSIM GUI was developed in MATLABTM
    and its flow chart is shown in Figure 3. Initially, RESSIM requires four connection
    parameters from the commercial database (IP, user name, password and port). Then,
    the open database is automatically created and saved as a local database. After
    connection with the commercial database, which controls the irrigation controller,
    and once the open database is built, information about farm description is demanded.
    Once the farm location is known, RESSIM automatically identifies the nearest agroclimatic
    stations, storing this information in the open database. Figure 3. Chart flow
    of RESSIM. After the initial setting, RESSIM determines the inputs/outputs, as
    well as SPIM’s variables, which are shown in the main screen of the GUI. At this
    point, RESSIM remains in a “listening mode” to both the GUI and SPIM model. When
    SPIM requires climatic information, it sends a request through RESSIM (Figure
    3, dotted line). Via HTTP callbacks, RESSIM obtains the climatic data from open
    websites and this information is sent back to SPIM. By the same token, the information
    received by field sensors, such as pressure head at pumping station or irradiance
    values, is obtained by RESSIM through SQL queries, by the connection between RESSIM
    software, the commercial database, RESSIM GUI and SPIM (Figure 3, dash line).
    Once the sequence of operating sectors (irrigation scheduling) is determined as
    described by [7], this information is sent to the database module by RESSIM and
    stored in the open database, parallelly modifying the commercial database. Thus,
    the irrigation controller, which is connected to the commercial database, receives
    the length of the irrigation event of each sector in real time (Figure 3, dot
    and dash line). Finally, a friendly GUI (Figure 4) was designed to visualize the
    values of the main decision variables in real time and to interact with SPIM and
    the irrigation controller. Any information shown or managed by RESSIM GUI follows
    the path shown in Figure 3 with the bold dash line. The GUI was divided into seven
    containers: experimental farm, pumping station-operating sector, photovoltaic
    plant, irrigation season, water volume records, soil water balance and irradiance
    threshold per sector. The experimental farm container shows the farm’s layout
    highlighting the operating sector and the spatial hydraulic simulation of this
    sector in real time (pressure and flow for each emitter of the irrigation sector
    as well as for hydrant). Pressure head, in m, and flow applied, in m3 h−1, by
    the pumping station is shown in the container labelled “Pumping station-operating
    sector”. Information related to the photovoltaic plant as irradiance, in W m−2,
    and photovoltaic power, in W, is shown in the “Photovoltaic plant” container.
    The “Irrigation season” container provides the beginning date of the irrigation
    season, the estimated flowering date and the real flowering date. When estimated
    and real flowering dates do not match, SPIM recomputes the irrigation scheduling.
    The “Water volume records” container provides the total amount of water applied
    to each irrigation sector, in m3, the irrigation target volume in this irrigation
    season per irrigation sector, in m3, the percentage of irrigation requirements
    which have been satisfied, in %, the date of the last irrigation event per irrigation
    sector and the estimated irrigation requirements for the following day. The real
    time value of the soil water content in each sector is displayed in the “Soil
    water balance container”. The range of irradiance in which each sector operates,
    determined by SPIM, is shown in the “Irradiance threshold per sector container”.
    Finally, the current date, and start/stop button were in the upper-right corner
    of the GUI. Figure 4. RESSIM graphical user interface (GUI). 3. Implementation
    of RESSIM in a Real Case Study RESSIM has been designed to be implemented to the
    most irrigation controllers which are based on a SQL database and most smart photovoltaic
    irrigation managers. The implementation of RESSIM just requires a PC with an internet
    connection to get the full potential of the tool. A test field of 13.4 ha located
    on the experimental farm of Cordoba University (Southern Spain) was selected to
    test the proposed RESSIM middleware (Figure 5). The irrigation system of the experimental
    farm is fitted with an irradiance sensor, a flow meter, a pressure meter and a
    soil moisture sensor, which are connected to a commercial irrigation controller,
    AGRONIC 4000 (https://www.progres.es/es/agronic4000). Figure 5. Experimental farm
    of Cordoba University. Historical climatic data (precipitation and evapotranspiration)
    were obtained from the open website of Andalusian weather stations (https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/agriculturaypesca/ifapa/ria/servlet/FrontController),
    while, forecasted and real time climatic data were obtained from a national open
    website (https://www.eltiempo.es/). RESSIM was applied for an entire irrigation
    season. Thus, Figure 6 shows the applied irrigation depth, the required irrigation
    depth and the irrigation correction by SPIM model during the irrigation season.
    Two days (16 April and 28 July, Julian days of the year 106 and 209, respectively)
    were selected and marked in Figure 6 by asterisk in order to discuss the results
    with RESSIM management. The irrigation scheduling for the two selected days is
    shown in Figure 7a,b respectively. Both figures show the synchronization of the
    operating sectors of the irrigation network and the photovoltaic power generation
    determined by SPIM and managed by RESSIM. Figure 7a (Julian day of the year 106)
    shows the synchronization of the operating sector in a typical cloudy day while
    RESSIM management for a sunny day is shown in Figure 7b. The hard task to manage
    in real time (manually operate) the synchronization of the irrigation operation
    with the photovoltaic power generation highlights the utility of RESSIM in daily
    irrigation scheduling. Figure 6. Irrigation scheduling with the smart photovoltaic
    irrigation manager (SPIM) and RESSIM management for a whole irrigation season.
    Figure 7. Photovoltaic power generation, power threshold and operation sequence
    of sectors of the irrigation network in the Julian day of the year 106 (a) and
    209 (b) of the irrigation seasons. Two different times of the day were selected
    in Figure 7a,b (red asterisk), 11 am and 12 am, respectively. For both selected
    time periods, RESSIM GUI is shown in Figure 8a,b respectively. S3 and S2 irrigation
    sectors were working in the selected instant, respectively. Figure 8a highlights
    the first day of the irrigation season in which S2 irrigation sector was working
    at 12:00 h. Thus, the total water volume applied until that day was 0.3%, 0.4%
    and 0.5% for the three irrigation sectors, respectively. The volume applied at
    the studied hour on that day (Julian day of the year 106) was 15.9 m3, 20.8 m3
    and 39.6 m3 for S1, S2 and S3, respectively, and the total water volume required
    on that day was 48.7 m3, 41.8 m3 and 60.7 m3, respectively. The estimated water
    volume for the following day (day of the year 107) was 52.3 m3, 44.9 m3 and 65.1
    m3, for the three irrigation sectors, respectively. Figure 8. Screenshots of the
    RESSIM model on the Julian day of the year 106 (a) and 209 (b). For the day of
    the year 209 (Figure 8b), the percentage of water applied until that day was 73.2%,
    73.3%, and 72.1% of the total water requirements of the irrigation season, for
    the three irrigation sectors, respectively. At that moment, the daily applied
    water volume for S1, S2 and S3 was 4479 m3, 3710 m3 and 5450 m3, respectively.
    According to SPIM model, the estimated water volume for the following day (Julian
    day of the year 210) was 28.3 m3, 24.9 m3 and 37.0 m3, for the three irrigation
    sectors, respectively. Both scenarios (Figure 8a,b) show the high synchronization
    determined by SPIM and carried out by RESSIM between the operation of the irrigation
    sectors and photovoltaic power generation linked to irrigation requirements. Although
    the SPIM model could be run manually, the daily synchronization and the daily
    irrigation scheduling based on solar irrigation would be impossible without RESSIM
    middleware. 4. Conclusions Due to the variability of power production during the
    day, the irrigation management with water pumped with PV energy is a complex task.
    As power production is variable, heterogeneous elements like sensors, countless
    web platforms and commercial irrigation controllers must be used co-ordinately.
    The integration of all these elements is essential to ensure the success of this
    technology, which is more complicated to manage than systems based on conventional
    energies where the availability of power is constant. Thus, RESSIM is a friendly
    tool that facilitates the management of PV irrigation systems, since it gathers
    information from different data sources and models and automatically apply the
    previously calculated irrigation depths to all the sectors depending on the instant
    power production of the solar panels. RESSIM was successfully tested in an experimental
    field for olive trees irrigation. The system managed automatically the solar irrigation
    system during one full irrigation season, without any major incident. The first
    version of the RESSIM model have allowed the optimum synchronization between the
    solar energy production and the irrigation requirements and the operation with
    the pumping station. By this optimal synchronization, the investment cost of the
    photovoltaic plant can also be reduced, optimizing the size and consequently reducing
    the greenhouse gases emissions. In future versions of the tool, dynamic models
    of crop growth, predictive models of daily water demand at farm level as well
    as the possibility of fitting the pumping station with variable speed drives will
    be implemented in order to improve the synchronization between the photovoltaic
    energy production and water demand both at farm and at water user association
    levels. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.G.P. and J.A.R.D; methodology,

  description: Advances in information and communication technologies facilitate the
    application of complex models for optimizing agricultural water management. This
    paper presents an easy-to-use tool for determining crop water demands using the
    dual crop coefficient approach and remote sensing imagery. The model was developed
    using Python as a programming language and integrated into an ArcGIS (geographic
    information system) toolbox. Inputs consist of images from satellites Landsat
    7 and 8, and Sentinel 2A, along with data for defining crop, weather, soil type,
    and irrigation system. The tool produces a spatial distribution map of the crop
    evapotranspiration estimates, assuming no water stress, which allows quantifying
    the water demand and its variability within an agricultural field with a spatial
    resolution of either 10 m (for Sentinel) or 30 m (for Landsat). The model was
    validated by comparing the estimated basal crop coefficients (Kcb) of lettuce
    and peach during an irrigation season with those tabulated as a reference for
    these crops. Good agreements between Kcb derived from both methods were obtained
    with a root mean squared error ranging from 0.01 to 0.02 for both crops, although
    certain underestimations were observed resulting from the uneven crop development
    in the field (percent bias of -4.74% and -1.80% for lettuce and peach, respectively).
    The developed tool can be incorporated into commercial decision support systems
    for irrigation scheduling and other applications that account for the water balance
    in agro-ecosystems. This tool is freely available upon request to the corresponding

    water balance 1. Introduction The important technological advances that have taken
    place in recent years allow for obtaining a greater predictive capacity and a
    more accurate assessment of different processes within agricultural systems [1].
    These advances have enabled the generation of models for the estimation of plant
    chemical and biophysical parameters for improving pest and disease management
    [2,3], nutrient assessment [4,5], irrigation scheduling [6,7], and yield predictions
    [8,9]. Nevertheless, they frequently result in models that are difficult to apply
    to generate real solutions for the agricultural sector, as a consequence of limitations
    in public access to data, privacy and confidentiality issues, lack of funding
    for long-term collection and curation of data, and technical difficulties in managing
    and sharing data [10]. For the specific case of crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    estimation, several models have been developed following different approaches;
    the most common among them are those based on surface energy balance (SEB) and
    soil water balance (SWB). Most of these models are too complex for non-specialized
    users, as in the case of many farmers, and even by more qualified users such as
    technicians from irrigation communities or agricultural cooperatives. This low
    level of practical applicability is caused by the fact that these models are usually
    composed of a large number of variables and parameters, requiring, in many cases,
    long execution times [11,12]. In addition, ETc is usually computed on a punctual
    location that may not be representative of the entire irrigated area. Using remote
    sensing technologies appears to be an efficient and economic approach to provide
    evapotranspiration (ET) estimations on large areas, allowing the assessment of
    the ET spatial variability [13]. The most common methodologies for ET estimation
    from remotely sensed imagery are those based on SEB and those based on vegetation
    indexes (VI). Models based on SEB take advantage of the relationship between surface
    reflectance data and energy balance components to derive ETc. Latent heat flux,
    and thus ET, is computed as the residual component of the SEB at the time of satellite
    overpass by subtracting the soil heat flux and sensible heat flux from the net
    radiation at the surface. In all SEB models, surface temperature data play a critical
    role in the estimation of crop water requirements. Nevertheless, spatial resolution
    improvements of satellites have occurred mainly in the visible and near infrared
    (VNIR) regions, whereas the thermal domain has remained at the same (or even lower)
    spatial resolution as that provided in the early 1980s [14]. Thus, the resulting
    pixel size limits the use of SEB models, especially for heterogeneous crops. In
    addition, SEB approaches need to extrapolate the instantaneous ET (ETinst) obtained
    at the time of the satellite pass to daily values, which can be usually done by
    assuming the conservation of the evaporative fraction or the ratio of ET to reference
    evapotranspiration, ETo [15,16]. A recent study in Mexico showed that using the
    MOD16 algorithm for ET estimation, through an SEB model, on wheat crops and shrub
    lands had an average underestimation of 0.32 mm·day−1 (up to 1.48 mm·day−1 in
    certain cases) with respect to ET measurements in the field using eddy covariance
    equipment [17]. An alternative to SEB models is using VI-based approaches, which
    compute ET from empirical, site-specific relationships between the fraction of
    ground covered by vegetation and VI (for example, the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) or the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)). However, VI reflect
    the vegetation cover conditions of a given date for estimating the actual basal
    crop coefficient (Kcb), but require an additional approach, normally a water balance
    model, to estimate the evaporation coefficient (Ke). In addition, most VI-based
    methods assume baseline conditions (e.g., no soil water limitations) as being
    unable to consider the impact of soil water shortage, salinity, or disease on
    the estimation of the crop coefficient (Kc) [7,18]. In this sense, previous reports
    indicated that, despite some drawbacks and an average error of 0.75 mm·day−1,
    combining VI with the dual crop coefficient approach for estimating ET was a valid
    method for monitoring the spatial distribution of crop water requirements in several
    species including garlic, cotton, olive, mandarin, and peach [18]. Among all these
    approaches, the methodology proposed in the Food and Agricultural Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (FAO-56) [19]
    acquires special relevance for estimating water consumption by irrigated crops
    because of its worldwide use, especially in scientific research [20,21,22]. This
    method has been criticized because of several sources of error that it may include,
    such as the consideration of a constant canopy resistance, the way in which some
    parameters are estimated, and the requirement of adapting the crop coefficient
    values to the local area in which the model is going to be applied, among others
    [23]. Despite these drawbacks, in general, ET estimated using this procedure agrees
    relatively well with that measured with lysimeters for periods of bare soil and
    partial and full vegetation cover [24], as well as with ET measurements obtained
    through Bowen ratio procedures (a disagreement of 1.1% on average) [25]. Under
    this scenario, decision support systems (DSS) arise as tools intended for bridging
    the gap between an accurate ET estimation and its final application by farmers
    and technicians. Therefore, DSS facilitate using crop models to help decision-makers
    by reducing the time and human resources required for analyzing complex alternative
    decisions [26]. Proof of the increasing importance of DSS is the number of them
    developed in the last decade, although most of them provide numerical results,
    neglecting the spatial variability of the considered variable [27,28,29]. In order
    to solve the above-mentioned limitations, the objective of this work was to develop
    a simple tool for assessing crop water demands and for providing advice in irrigation
    scheduling, thus generating a real solution for the agricultural sector. The tool
    was based on the joint application of the dual crop coefficient approach proposed
    in the FAO-56 document [19] and multi-satellite images that permit incorporating
    the spatial component into the estimations using a geographic information system
    (GIS) tool. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Model Theorical Framework The dual Kc
    approach estimates the evapotranspiration of a given crop (ETc) using the basal
    coefficient (Kcb), the evaporation coefficient (Ke), and the evapotranspiration
    of a reference surface (ETo), defined as the water consumed by an extensive surface
    of green, well-watered grass of uniform height, actively growing and completely
    shading the ground [19]. ETc = (Kcb + Ke) × ETo (1) In this framework, Kcb is
    the ratio of ETc over ETo when the soil surface is dry but transpiration is occurring
    at a potential rate, that is, water is not limiting transpiration; whereas Ke
    refers to the soil evaporative component. The sum of both coefficients is known
    as the crop coefficient (Kc). General Kcb values for the different seasonal stages
    of the main crops are tabulated [19], but refer to sub-humid climates with moderate
    wind speeds (e.g., minimum relative humidity of 45% and wind speeds of 2 m·s−1,
    approximately). For those regions that do not meet these conditions, tabulated
    Kcb must be adjusted using the meteorological variables observed at those locations
    for correctly representing the local conditions [19]. In order to incorporate
    the spatial component into the estimation of Kc, the approach proposed in this
    study includes data derived from remote sensing imagery. More specifically, the
    model calculates two VI from bottom of atmosphere reflectivity values derived
    from satellite images: NDVI and SAVI. The first index, NDVI, allows for estimating
    the soil fraction covered by vegetation (Fc) through the linear, or approximately
    linear, relation between some VI and Fc in the range from bare soil to near full
    ground cover [30,31]. In addition, Fc in combination with SAVI, allows for correcting
    Kcb when non-homogeneous crops are considered [32]. Kcb = Kcb,max/Fc,max × ((SAVI
    − SAVImin)/(SAVImax − SAVImin)) (2) where the max and min subscripts refer to
    a high leaf area index (LAI) and a bare surface, respectively; and Fc,max is the
    vegetated covered fraction for which Kcb reaches its maximum value (Kcb,max).
    In this study, Kcb,max values were the FAO-56 tabulated values adjusted (Kcb,corr)
    for the local relative humidity and wind speed conditions (Kcb,corr in Figure
    1) [19]. Figure 1. Flowchart of the dual Kc model implemented into ArcPy, showing
    the inputs, intermediate results, and outputs. ρNIR and ρRED are the reflectances
    corresponding to the infrared and red bands, respectively; fw is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted by irrigation; and I is the irrigation depth on each day
    that infiltrates the soil (mm). For definitions of the rest of abbreviations used
    in the figure, readers are referred to the main text. For the estimation of Kcb,
    the days when satellite images are not available (e.g., cloudy conditions or days
    without scheduled pass), the model extrapolates from the last available satellite
    image. Thus, for initial and mid stages, Kcb is assumed constant and, therefore,
    Kcb of a given day is considered equal to the Kcb value of the last available
    image. For development and final stages, the slope between the Kcb of the last
    available image and Kcb tabulated for mid and final stages, respectively, was
    determined. In addition, Ke depends on the water available in the soil surface
    layer, which is computed as Ke = Kr × (Kc,max − Kcb) (3) where Kc,max represents
    the maximum Kc value after an irrigation or precipitation event, and is calculated
    using the wind speed (u2, m·s−1), minimum relative humidity (RHmin, %), and crop
    height (h, m), as follows: Kc,max = 1.2 + (0.04 × (u2 − 2) − 0.004 × (RHmin −
    45)) × (h/3)0.3 (4) Kr = (TEW − De)/(TEW − REW) (5) where TEW and REW are the
    total and the readily evaporable water, respectively (mm); and De represents the
    cumulative depletion from the soil surface layer (mm) estimated from a daily soil
    water balance. 2.2. Model Implementation The dual Kc model was implemented using
    ArcPy [33] because of its capacity for geographical data analysis, conversion
    and management, and map automation. This environment utilizes Python as a programming
    language. The model was split into two sub-models. The first one is intended for
    VIs, Fc, and Kcb computation, whereas the second one is focused on Ke, Kc, and
    ETc estimation (Figure 1). Finally, the sub-model formulations were incorporated
    into an ArcGIS (v10.2; Esri, Redlands, CA, USA [33]) toolbox, which provides a
    friendly interface to execute the model, where the user only needs to select the
    values for the required inputs. The created tool was programmed for using images
    acquired from multiple satellites, identifying the source by the file name. This
    tool can be freely distributed to interested users by contacting the corresponding
    author. 2.3. Model Validation The described model was validated in two sites:
    (i) a 1.32 ha lettuce orchard (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Little gem) located in Los
    Alcáceres, Murcia, southeast Spain (37°46′7′′ N, 0°50′13′′ W) during 2016; and
    (ii) a 3.56 ha peach orchard (Prunus persica L. Bastch cv. Amandina) located in
    Molina de Segura, Murcia, Southeast Spain (38°06′52′′ N, 1°12′46′′ W) during 2017.
    The lettuce planting date was 24 September and harvest took place on 11 November;
    therefore, the length of the crop growing cycle was 48 days. On the other hand,
    the peach orchard was planted in 2013 and the fruit harvest for 2017 occurred
    in May, followed by a long post-harvest period (namely, the peach cultivar is
    early maturing). Cloudless images from satellites Sentinel 2A, Landsat 7 and Landsat
    8 collected during the studied growing seasons were considered as inputs. The
    spatial resolution of the images in the VNIR region was 10 m for Sentinel 2 and
    30 m for Landsat 7 and 8, whereas the temporal resolution was 10 days for Sentinel
    2A and 16 days for Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. Details about the different images
    used in this study are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. A total of 8 and 23 cloudless
    satellite images were used for characterizing the lettuce and peach Kcb curves,
    respectively. They corresponded with the 73% (lettuce) and 45% (peach) of all
    satellite images acquired during the considered period. Only pure pixels, namely,
    those totally included in the plots, were considered for determining crop water
    demands in order to avoid edge-pixel contamination. In this sense, for the lettuce
    plot, the number of pure pixels was 6 and 99 for Landsat and Sentinel, respectively;
    whereas the number of pure pixels for the peach field was 23 and 291 for Landsat
    and Sentinel, respectively. Table 1. Satellite imagery used for model validation
    during the lettuce growing season. Table 2. Satellite imagery used for model validation
    during the peach growing season. During the growing seasons, the plants were cultivated
    using standard practices in the area with a cumulative irrigation application
    of 120 mm and 293 mm for lettuce and peach, respectively. The total amounts of
    N, P2O5, and K2O applied to fulfill the estimated crop nutrient demand were 56,
    30, and 76 kg·ha−1, respectively, for lettuce and 105, 85 and 192kg·ha−1, respectively,
    for peach. Lettuce crop height was measured weekly in 60 plants randomly distributed
    within the plot (Table 3), whereas the average peach height measured in the field
    was 2.40 m at the beginning of the year and was considered to be constant during
    the season. This information, as well as tabulated Kcb values [19], was incorporated
    into the model (h and Kcb (Tab) in Figure 1). The tabulated Kcb values for initial,
    mid, and end stages were 0.15, 0.90, and 0.90, respectively, for lettuce and 0.45,
    0.85, and 0.60, respectively, for peach. Daily and hourly weather data, including
    air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, reference evapotranspiration
    (calculated using the Penman–Monteith equation [19]), and solar radiation (Figure
    2 and Figure 3), were obtained from the nearest weather stations. The main utility
    of using hourly data is that this allows for a precise weather characterization
    at the satellite acquisition time. For the lettuce study site, the weather station
    considered was located 3 km from the experimental site at San Javier, Murcia (code
    TP22; http://siam.imida.es), whereas that for the peach site was located 1.5 km
    from the study site at Molina de Segura, Murcia (code MO22; http://siam.imida.es).
    Mean air temperature and relative humidity for the study period were 20.7 °C and
    76.2%, and 18.57 °C and 54.23% for lettuce and peach, respectively; with a cumulative
    precipitation and ETo of 30.2 and 120.9 mm, respectively, for lettuce, and 140.9
    and 1002.2 mm, respectively, for peach (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Noticeably, only
    a few rainfall events greater than 5 mm occurred over both growing seasons and
    accounted for more than 80% of the total rainfall within the studied periods (Figure
    2 and Figure 3). The values of TEW and REW were selected according to those defined
    in the FAO-56 document [19] for the different soils in both sites. More specifically,
    lettuce was grown on a loamy soil (sand 42%, silt 37; clay 21%), whereas the peach
    orchard was planted on a soil that was clay-loamy (sand 40%, silt 17%, clay 43%);
    corresponding with REW and TEW values of 9.0 and 19.0 mm, respectively, for lettuce
    and 9.5 and 24.5 mm, respectively, for peach. In addition, soil water balance
    was initialized at 15 September (day of year, DOY, 259) for lettuce and 15 January
    (DOY 15) for peach, because no significant precipitation events occurred during
    the previous weeks, allowing the assumption that all evaporable water had been
    depleted from the soil surface layer at the beginning of calculations, that is,
    De, 0 = TEW. Figure 2. Daily weather data obtained from the weather station located

    site (average from 60 measurements per date and standard error, SE). 2.4. Statistical
    Analyses The comparison between Kcb values derived from the ArcGIS approach proposed
    in this study and those values tabulated in FAO-56 [19] was performed over the
    validation sites using the root mean square error (RMSE). RMSE= ∑ L l=1 ( K cb,FAO56
    − K cb,estimated ) 2 L − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (6)
    where Kcb, FAO56 is the Kcb value derived from FAO-56; Kcb, estimated is the Kcb
    value estimated with the created tool, and L is the length of the crop season.
    Considering that no other direct ETc determination was available in the field
    sites, the tabulated FAO-56 values can be considered as a reasonable proxy for
    ET determinations because of their widespread use, particularly in herbaceous
    crops. The spatial variability within each plot was quantified by means of the
    coefficient of variation (CV) among the values of all pixels included in the studied
    fields: CV= SD×100 K cb, mean (7) where SD is the standard deviation within the
    plot and Kcb, mean is the average Kcb of all pixels included in the plot. Additionally,
    the percent bias, PBIAS, was calculated to measure the average trend of the simulated
    data to be larger or smaller than the FAO-56 derived Kcb values. PBIAS=100× ∑
    L l=1 ( K cb,estimated − K cb,FAO56 ) ∑ L l=1 K cb,FAO56 (8) The optimal value
    of PBIAS is 0.0, with low-magnitude values indicating accurate model simulations.
    Positive values indicate overestimation, whereas negative values indicate model
    underestimation. 3. Results 3.1. Model Interface Figure 4 shows the final interfaces
    for the different sub-models developed. On the left-hand side of each interface,
    the inputs required for running the model are listed. Thus, the required inputs
    for sub-model 1 and sub-model 2 are shown in Table 4. To help the user, a detailed
    description for each input is provided on the right-hand side of the interface
    when the mousepad icon is placed on each input box. Figure 4. Toolbox interfaces

    model validation, Figure 5 shows the temporal evolution of the Kcb values derived
    from the ArcGIS approach proposed in this study, as well as those values tabulated
    in FAO-56 [19], over the lettuce (Figure 5A) and peach growing seasons (Figure
    5B). A good agreement between both Kcb values was obtained, as the RMSE (0.01–0.02)
    was low for both crops. The Kcb values estimated for lettuce were 0.15 and 0.85
    for the initial and the mid-season stage, respectively, and values intermediate
    between these two for the crop-development stage. However, a slight underestimation
    (2.8% on average for the entire growing season) was observed in lettuce for the
    Kcb values obtained from the ArcGIS approach when compared with those derived
    from FAO-56, especially during the crop development stage (5.7% on average for
    the development stage; Figure 5A). For the peach orchard, Kcb values estimated
    were 0.43 and 0.84 for the initial and the mid-season stage, respectively, and
    values intermediate between these two for the crop-development stage. A slight
    underestimation was observed in peach for the Kcb values obtained from the ArcGIS
    approach when compared with those derived from FAO-56, with this being more evident
    during the initial and mid-season crop development stages (2.6% on average; Figure
    5B). The reason for the lower underestimation observed in peach when compared
    with lettuce could be the higher frequency of available images used to build the
    Kcb curve (Figure 5). The PBIAS values obtained for lettuce and peach were −4.74%
    and −1.80%, respectively, confirming the underestimation pattern observed in Figure
    5. Figure 5. Temporal evolution of the Kcb values obtained from the developed
    ArcGIS tool and those derived from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the
    United Nations (FAO)-56 document for lettuce ((A): Coordinates 37°46′7′′ N, 0°50′13′′
    W) and peach (B): Coordinates 38°06′52′′ N, 1°12′46′′ W); and examples of the
    resultant Kcb images for different crop stages. Error bars represent the standard
    error (SE) within the field.) The Kcb variability within the lettuce field, assessed
    through CV, was low at the beginning of the growing season (CV ≈ 7.4%), increased
    during crop-development (CV ≈ 12.2%), and decreased again at the mid-season (CV
    ≈ 7.7%). For the peach orchard, CV was relatively high at the initial stage (CV
    ≈ 11.0%), and decreased during crop-development and mid-season stages (CV ≈ 4.7%).
    This variability could have been induced by the fact that our approach takes into
    account the actual soil surface covered by the crop (as determined by satellite
    images) for calculating Kcb, reflecting the uneven distribution of plant size
    for lettuce and the initial bud break for peach within the studied plots at the
    crop development and mid-season stages. Examples of the spatially distributed
    Kcb output resulting from the application of the model for lettuce and peach at
    the development stage and at the end of the growing cycle (day of year (DOY) 282
    and 312, respectively, for lettuce; and 56 and 156, respectively, for peach) are
    shown in Figure 5. The mean Kcb values on the lettuce plot were around 0.20 and
    0.85 for DOY 282 and 312, respectively; whereas the mean Kcb values on the peach
    orchard were 0.50 and 0.84 for DOY 56 and 156, respectively. The reductions of
    Kcb near the field edges in both crops are the result of the pixel contamination
    due to the surrounding bare soil. This suggests that a larger pixel cut off could
    have reduced the errors. 4. Discussion One main advantage of the tool developed
    here is that it does not require many inputs, and those compulsory for running
    the model are readily available, making its use easier. This solves the over-parameterization
    issue, which is one of the main limitations for using models for practical applications
    in agriculture [36,37]. In fact, after a certain level, an increase in model structure
    complexity does not necessarily lead to better estimations [38,39]. In this sense,
    the tool proposed here was able to provide reliable estimations of crop water
    demands using a set of easily available parameters; this capability, along with
    its friendly interface, might favor the use of the tool by farmers and technicians.
    In its present form, the toolbox is implemented using ArcGIS because of the flexibility
    offered by this commercial software. In the future, other software developers
    might take advantage of the algorithm details described here to migrate the toolbox
    into other open-software systems such as Quantum Geographical Information System
    (QGIS), expanding the operational possibilities of the tool developed here. In
    addition, the integration of remote sensing technology into the tool permits obtaining
    a spatial representation of the crop water demand variability over a given plot
    or orchard and, therefore, it will be possible to apply a different irrigation
    scheduling to a given sector within the field [40,41,42,43]. This is the main
    improvement of our tool when compared with other approaches. Indeed, remote sensing
    technology has been incorporated into some DSS platforms (System of Participatory
    Information, Decision-support, and Expert knowledge for River-basin management,
    SPIDER [27]; Automated Radiative Transfer Models Operator, ARTMO [44]; AquaGIS
    [45]; Online Professional Irrigation Scheduling; Flexible and PrecIse IrriGation
    PlAtform to Improve FaRm Scale Water PrOductivity, FIGARO [46]). Some of these
    platforms are still ongoing developments, while some others provide information
    about other aspects of plant physiology and not directly on crop water requirements.
    To date, AquaGIS has been employed for simulating multi-year wheat yields under
    several irrigation strategies [45], proving the applicability of this approach
    for managing irrigation in large areas. However, AquaGIS is based on AquaCrop,
    a model that requires a higher number of inputs and parameters than the one implemented
    in the toolbox described in the current study. Therefore, our approach reduced
    model complexity when compared with AquaGIS. Other DSS, such as ARTMO [44], simulate
    and estimate vegetation structure or radiative transfer from vegetal canopies,
    with no regards to irrigation scheduling and, therefore, they have to be used
    by experts in order to gather the information provided by these platforms and
    translate it into irrigation strategies to be applied in the field. Another example
    of DSS with a module for irrigation scheduling is FIGARO [46], which also uses
    AquaCrop for determining crop water requirements, and has been applied only to
    field crops such as cotton [47]. In summary, our approach is easier to use than
    current platforms because it is more intuitive and requires a lower number of
    parameters and inputs; moreover, it is easily adapted to a great number of crop
    species, as long as their crop coefficients are available, as exemplified for
    lettuce (herbaceous plant) and peach (woody perennial species) in the current
    manuscript. Furthermore, most of the available applications intended for crop
    management do not consider the spatial component, providing only numerical outputs
    and neglecting the spatial variability within the field [8,28,29,48,49,50]. Additionally,
    the tool proposed in this study allows for integrating information obtained from
    different satellites; improving the reliability and consistency of vegetation
    state variables; and, consequently, enhancing the estimations of crop water requirements
    [51,52,53,54]. Furthermore, the inclusion of the tool into a geographic information
    system (GIS) allows for task automation, which reduces computational time and
    permits modelling large areas at once, which is an important limitation in other
    models [11,12]. The validation with data for growing seasons of lettuce and peach
    in southeast Spain indicates that the proposed tool provides accurate crop water
    demand estimates when the FAO-56 methodology is taken as reference [19]. In this
    context, Kcb for lettuce is estimated at the crop development and mid-season stages
    in the current study as being from 0.6 to 0.85, which leads to Kc values similar
    to those measured in southeast Spain using Bowen ratio procedures, although slightly
    lower at the initial stage of crop development [25,55]. Regarding the peach orchard,
    Kcb values ranged from 0.45 (at the initial stage) to 0.85 (at the mid-season).
    The values at the initial stage were considerably higher than those proposed by
    other authors [56,57], whereas estimated Kcb values for mid stage were intermediate
    when compared with those previously reported [56,57]. This highlights the importance
    of the Kcb database used as input, which can clearly affect the model efficiency
    in estimating the actual ETc. The period considered here covered the initial and
    mid stages, being necessary to enlarge the study until the leaf fall period to
    reach the Kcb value of the end season stage. It is necessary to develop and implement
    further new model routines, other than semi-empiric models, for computing ET,
    to be able to compute plant transpiration more specifically based on specific
    canopy resistance models. Additionally, the application of the proposed methodology
    allows the detection of the timing for bud break, complete canopy growth, and
    leaf senescence and fall. Nevertheless, a limitation with this type of crop is
    given by the spatial resolution of the satellite images, which does not allow
    distinguishing among orchard floor management practices. Moreover, outputs generated
    from the proposed tool collect Kcb spatial variations within the field, and this
    information can allow for precise irrigation management [58,59,60]; for instance,
    if the field has several irrigation sectors, they can be differently managed according
    to a possible uneven distribution of crop water requirements. In this sense, the
    uneven development of the crops within the field was reflected by the slight underestimation
    observed in the Kcb values derived from the tool, mainly during the crop development
    stage, which could have modified the SAVI and, therefore, the Kcb value. In contrast,
    the FAO-56 method employs a fixed value for fraction cover at a given developmental
    stage of the crop, irrespective of the SAVI, likely causing the underestimation
    of our approach when compared with the FAO-56 as a reference. Moreover, the FAO-56
    Kcb values used compute crop water requirements under conditions of complete absence
    of biotic or abiotic stress and we cannot rule out the possibility that the experimental
    plants had temporarily suffered some slight limitations in their growth and development.
    In order to consider this issue, the next version of the developed tool will include
    the water stress coefficient, Ks [19]. Additionally, the temporal evolution of
    CV and RMSE showed that the variation observed was probably caused by the uneven
    distribution of plant sizes that left a variable surface of bare soil within the
    field. Once the crop started to develop, CV and RMSE increased, reflecting different
    growing rates of lettuce and peach canopies throughout the field. Finally, at
    mid-season, the variability decreased, probably because the crops reached a high-vegetated
    fraction cover and a more homogeneous distribution (for the case of lettuce) over
    the entire field. Furthermore, the selection of the pixels within the study area
    and the way the satellite images are cut off may cause additional errors for the
    estimation of crop water requirements at the edges of the field. The implemented
    tool could be incorporated into a cloud-based DSS that allows for integrating
    data from various sources and, therefore, for assessing different scales ranging
    from small, single farms to large catchments; for centralizing the control of
    field devices; and for transforming the data into useful knowledge for decision
    making [61,62]. In this sense, potential applications might consider the estimation
    of the soil water content, which could be, for instance, of interest in humid
    areas where high soil moisture levels often hamper soil management using heavy
    tractors and machinery. The tool created can be also used in combination with
    weather forecasts as inputs instead of past weather data, which may allow for
    estimating future irrigation requirements and predicting the occurrence of extreme
    events [63,64,65]. Additionally, the satellite image download, pre-processing
    (e.g., radiometric, geometric, and atmospheric image corrections; cloud detection),
    and post-processing tasks are susceptible to being automatized, so that the results
    could be delivered to end-users (farmers, stakeholders, and policy makers) at
    near-real time, which facilitates the adoption of quick responses to agricultural
    issues [66]. Indeed, the proposed tool provides a user-friendly approach for the
    spatial estimation of crop water demands that can be incorporated into a DSS to
    generate real solutions for the agricultural sector in terms of irrigation scheduling
    and other applications related to the agro-ecosystem water balance. Author Contributions

  description: A closed loop irrigation system is demonstrated that fully automates
    the delivery of irrigation and calculates the water requirement from satellite
    images. The system optimizes water delivery for 140 cells located across four
    hectares of land based on two independent objectives (e.g., maximizing yield and
    increasing water efficiency) and is continuously adapting irrigation scheduling
    to the local spatial-temporal variability of the vegetation across the growing
    season. Irrigation is controlled by a central computer that issues commands to
    693 control nodes to start irrigation based on the analysis of satellite images.
    The control nodes are laid out to create 15 m \times15 m cells and each cell can
    be addressed independently and can irrigate differentially. After two years of
    operation, this variable rate drip irrigation approach resulted in a 26% yield
    increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water use efficiency.
    This paper demonstrates that combining closed loop automation and advanced irrigation
    analytics can improve the water use efficiency and increase the yield on existing
    agricultural lands.

    for 140 cells located across four hectares of land based on two independent objectives
    (e.g., maximizing yield and increasing water efficiency) and is continuously adapting
    irrigation scheduling to the local spatial–temporal variability of the vegetation
    across the growing season. Irrigation is controlled by a central computer that
    issues commands to 693 control nodes to start irrigation based on the analysis
    of satellite images. The control nodes are laid out to create 15 m ×15 m cells
    and each cell can be addressed independently and can irrigate differentially.
    After two years of operation, this variable rate drip irrigation approach resulted
    in a 26% yield increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water
    use efficiency. This paper demonstrates that combining closed loop automation
    and advanced irrigation analytics can improve the water use efficiency and increase
    the yield on existing agricultural lands. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Digitization of the physical world is
    fundamentally changing the industries fueled by sensor networks, automation, and
    robotization [1]. Sensor-based decision support or automated infrastructure control
    can minimize manual intervention. In agriculture, data driven decisions can enable
    a sustainable use of water, land utilization, and chemicals control through optimized
    analytics [2]. Platforms that fuse sensor network data with automatic control
    can lead to dynamic operation that adapts to the environment in real-time as new
    data becomes available to the system. One important application in agriculture
    is irrigation, which can be controlled by sensor networks and automate the operation
    of the water delivery systems. Despite continuous advancement in control systems,
    irrigation is mostly a manual process using traditional practices. Many of the
    high value crops in California, such as grapes, are drip irrigated with water
    usually applied uniformly across larger parcels or blocks of land. This often
    results in nonoptimized delivery of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. For example,
    intrafield soil water holding capacity can fluctuate significantly, often translating
    into as much as fivefold yield differences across less than a few meter distance
    [3]. To overcome such variability, management zones can be defined, where each
    zone may have similar yield or vigor characteristics (for grapes) and can be managed
    accordingly. Minimizing yield variability [4] through differential management
    [5] has been proposed in the past. Variable rate management in vineyards has been
    proposed both in USA [6] and in Australia [7] but only relying on post-harvest
    analysis. Management zones have been delineated based on soil [8], vegetation
    index [9], or using fuzzy logic clustering techniques [10]. While defining management
    zones is a well-established technique, active control of variable rate management
    is still not fully developed. In the past, sensor networks have been deployed
    in vineyard settings [11] at various levels of sophistication. Most of the application
    attempted a better monitoring of the micro environmental conditions in the vineyards
    thereby providing a more granular feedback to vineyard workers [12]. Here, we
    present a large-scale demonstration of a variable rate drip irrigation system
    that takes advantage of a close loop control system to deliver the right amount
    of water through an automated system. Using this new variable drip irrigation
    technology, the applied water amount can be optimized dynamically. Ultimately,
    it is envisioned that such a system can be designed to deliver the optimum amount
    of water to each plant. Delivery of water to each management zone requires timely
    analytics to determine irrigation requirements, to transmit the irrigation schedule
    to a control computer, and to automate control of the drip irrigation infrastructure
    to dispense the optimum amount of water. In this paper, we show that a variable
    rate automatic irrigation system coupled with satellite derived irrigation scheduling
    analytics can result in: 1) increased yield uniformity and 2) reversal of the
    yield trends by increasing the yield on the originally low yield areas and limiting
    the yield on the originally high yield areas. The advantage of a variable rate
    irrigation system is the increased yield on existing farm land without the need
    to convert additional land to agricultural use. The efficient use of technology
    not only can increase the yield on existing farm land but also promises to manage
    more efficiently resources like water and fertilizer. To the best of our knowledge,
    this paper constitutes the first and largest closed loop drip irrigation system
    that directly couples remote observations with an automated dense sensor network
    that is operated from the cloud. Not only the drip irrigation in our approach
    is fully automated but at the same time this system results in significant water
    savings while improving yield. SECTION II. Sensor Network A. System Architecture
    The experiment is conducted on a 20-year-old, 12.4 hectare, drip irrigated Cabernet
    Sauvignon vineyard near Galt, CA, USA. A four hectare section of the vineyard
    containing the full range of yields, as reported by the 2012 yield map, is selected
    for the closed loop irrigation system. The irrigation system is changed from a
    single drip line to a double drip-line variable irrigation system with centrally
    controlled irrigation sensor network. The control system allows differential irrigation
    along segments of 15 m. A 15 m ×15 m area defined as “the irrigation control cell”
    is the basic unit of control where the water delivery within that area can be
    independently controlled (Fig. 1). The experimental area, called “Precision,”
    is composed of 140 of such independent cells where cells are grouped in two sections
    “Yield maximizing section” and “Water efficiency section.” These two differently
    managed sections have different objective functions: 1) maximize the yield and
    2) increase water use efficiency. The area is monitored using satellite imagery
    that constitutes the input for irrigation requirement analytics. Besides monitoring
    the area, the closed loop system runs the analytics to determine the irrigation
    water requirement and controls the irrigation infrastructure to dispense the water.
    The analytics output is transmitted to a sensor network that dispense the water
    accordingly. The irrigation schedule is sent weekly to the irrigation system,
    where the computer splits the schedule for 6 or 7 days irrigation and issues commands
    to the management zones. The outcome of the differential irrigation is monitored
    by the next satellite imagery that will indicate if expected change occurred and
    the irrigation water schedule is readjusted based on the new satellite images.
    An adjacent area, called “Conventional” area, having similar yield characteristics
    and soil composition as the Precision area in 2012, is uniformly irrigated to
    serve as a reference area. The closed loop irrigation system is automatically
    operated with minimal human input. We note that domain expertise related to adjustment
    in grape sugar content is required to be added to the irrigation schedule calculations.
    Additional data layers like high resolution drone or thermal images of the vineyard
    can be added to the analytics for monitoring canopy stresses that may not be detectable
    from satellite images. Fig. 1. (a) Schematic architecture of the closed control
    loop irrigation system driven by satellite imagery. (b) Precision irrigation area
    composed of water efficiency and yield maximizing sections. Show All B. Variable
    Rate Irrigation Infrastructure For the variable rate infrastructure, the original
    single drip irrigation line is divided into a double drip line system consisting
    of a water supply line and an irrigation line and segmented into 15 m sections
    [Fig. 2(a)]. The supply line is always filled with water and is connected to the
    main water supply. The irrigation line can be filled once the solenoid valve is
    opened and the water is allowed to flow into that segment. The irrigation line
    has emitters installed that will let water drip and irrigate the soil. The supply
    and irrigation line are connected at each 15 m through a control node that allows
    water to be diverted from the supply line to the irrigation line. The control
    nodes consist of a solenoid valve, a controller, and a check valve. The controller
    issues the command to open/close the solenoid valve and allows water to flow into
    the segment, while the check valve impedes water to fill the previous management
    segment. There is a power and communication line that runs along the supply line
    and connects each control node to a central control point. The controller nodes
    are installed at the edge of an area that establishes a one-to-one correspondence
    between the information extracted from a parcel of land (via satellite imagery
    and/or ground-based sensors) and a management area. We chose a 15 m ×15 m control
    cell dimension, higher than the original Landsat [13] pixel resolution (30 m ×30
    m), which was used in this paper. The original 30 m ×30 m Landsat pixels are interpolated
    to 15 m ×15 m pixel size using pan sharpening and aligned exactly with the experimental
    15 m ×15 m cells [Fig. 2(b)]. We note that managing vineyard at higher resolution
    than the satellite images did not provide any benefit as discussed in Section
    IV, as there is an optimal size for the control cells. Fig. 2. (a) Double drip
    line composed of supply and irrigation lines connected through the control nodes
    that operate the solenoid valve. (b) Details of an irrigation control cell that
    groups 5 double drip lines and its spatial alignment with a Landsat satellite
    image pixel. Show All The control nodes are 15 m apart along each irrigation line
    segment (covering 10 vines) and the irrigation lines (and vine rows) are 3.3 m
    apart. Alternating, 4 or 5 control nodes are therefore lumped together to define
    each “irrigation control cell,” which covers on average an area of 15 m ×15 m
    [Fig. 2(a)]. Since the vine rows could not be perfectly aligned with satellite
    pixel resolution, the number of rows entering in a cell is varied between 4 and
    5 to create the digital footprint of satellite images on the irrigation system
    [Fig. 2(b)]. There are a total of 140 independent control cells, with 40 or 50
    vines in each of the cells distributed across the four hectare area with a total
    of 693 control nodes (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Photograph of the interior and controller
    box that operated the solenoid valve and the installed sensor network in the vineyard.
    Show All The irrigation schedule is managed by a central computer that issues
    the command to the local microcontroller that operates the solenoid valves to
    keep it open for the required amount of time. The amount of irrigation water dispensed
    is controlled by the time interval the solenoid valve is kept open and water drips
    through the drip emitters mounted on the irrigation line. Time synchronization
    between the local microcontroller and the central computer is carried out once
    per day. In addition to actuating (open/close) the solenoid valve, each node keeps
    track of the time the valve is open and reports back to the control computer which
    aggregates the data and runs background calculations to verify that the system
    operates as expected. C. Sensor Communication The experimental area is divided
    in 14 subnets where each subnet contains 4 or 5 rows of grape rows. Along each
    subnet there are ten irrigation control cells. Each subnet is controlled by a
    gateway that receives and transmits the data from the central computer to the
    40 or 50 control nodes [Fig. 4(a)] within that subnet. The central computer is
    distributing the irrigation schedule to the gateways and each gateway sends commands
    to individual control nodes under its command. The schematic of the message stack
    protocol for communicating is shown in Fig. 4(b). A command message is encapsulated
    in a queue stack. Each header contained a destination node address and a function
    code; the address field is 8 bits, the function code is 8 bits, and the check-sum
    is a 16 bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) (see Fig. 4(b)-A). A specific example
    is shown in Fig. 4(b)-B, where the central computer communicates with a selected
    control node via a selected gateway. There are three required steps to get the
    message from the central computer to a selected control node and an additional
    three steps to send back an acknowledgment from the control node to the central
    computer. First, the central computer sends the message to a selected gateway.
    Second, the gateway, based on a “forwarding” function code, moves the first fixed
    length header to the trailer space in the message and transmits the new message
    (Fig. 4(b)-C) simultaneously to all nodes in the subnet. The node for which the
    message is intended will recognize its unique address in the message. Once the
    control node performs the requested operation (e.g., open valve), it rewrites
    the data section leaving the header and trailer intact. As the central computer
    expects a response, the control node prepares the stack to be sent back. The control
    node transmits the response message to the gateway. The gateway processes the
    message by moving the first trailer (before the CRC) to the header and transmits
    the new message to the central computer. The central computer, expecting a response,
    processes the result and acknowledges that the message is successfully delivered
    to the control node. The transmitted command can be the irrigation requirements
    (number of minutes that the irrigation line needs to be filled with water) or
    just open/close commands at the beginning and end of the day to bring all control
    nodes into the same state. Each subnet includes a flow meter that measures the
    water consumption for the whole subnet. In each subnet there are 40 or 50 control
    boxes that are connected by serial bus communication wires to each gateway. At
    the end of the rows, wires that crossed rows, are buried underground. The communication
    line did not exceeds 1500 m as this value is tested to constitute the upper limit
    for signal integrity using RS485 communications. Irrigation of the 140 control
    cells is enabled by daily continuous communication with all 693 control nodes,
    where each node is uniquely identified (addressed) by a source routing technique
    that specifies a specific gateway-node pair. Fig. 4. (a) Schematics of the communication
    network between the central computer and control nodes composed of 14 subnets
    and 140 irrigation control cells. (b) Data communication stack and communication
    protocols between the central computer and control nodes. Show All A cellular
    link connects the central computer to the cloud-based analytics, allowing downloading
    irrigation schedules and remote diagnostics. A message notification system is
    implemented that alerts valve’s malfunctioning or nonintended water usage. The
    power lines extend to all control nodes and is fanned out at the start of each
    row. The power distribution system is optimized to maintain 12 V along each line
    such that controllers located farthest from the gateway can open/close the solenoid
    valves under normal operating conditions. While the current implementation is
    based on wired control, a wireless communication method had been prototyped and
    tested as a next generation system. For the wireless option, the power harvesting
    from solar panels required for operation could not be achieved due to the dense
    canopy and panel placement limitations dictated by daily maintenance work on the
    farm. D. Irrigation Requirement Analytics Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery obtained
    from the U.S. Geological Survey [14] provides reflectance data in eight different
    spectral bands every 16 days (alternating by 8 days for each satellite). The vineyard
    investigated in this paper is on the overlapping section of path 43 row 34 and
    path 44 row 33 for Landsat 7 and 8, respectively, which provides a satellite observation
    every eight days. Two of these spectral bands, the red (0.64–0.67 micrometer)
    and the near infrared (0.77–0.90 micrometer) are sensitive to vineyard canopy
    development [15] and are used to determine the NDVI [16] NDVI= NIR−RED NIR+RED
    (1) View Source where RED and NIR are the red and near infrared intensity values
    for each pixel in the image. The NDVI value varies between 0 and 1. Its value
    changes as the canopy develops through the growing season and its spatial distribution
    across a vineyard reflects the variability in vigor and ultimately the water holding
    capacity of the soil. All satellite images are corrected for atmosphere induced
    scattering [17]. The amount of water delivered to each cell is then calculated
    from the NDVI and the water loss due to evapo-transpiration (ET0) using the Penman–Monteith
    equation [18]. The daily weather inputs (insolation, wind, temperature, and relative
    humidity) are obtained from the nearest California Irrigation Management Information
    System weather station (Fair Oaks, CA, USA) [19] to calculate the reference evapo-transpiration
    (ET0). The amount of water that is scheduled for irrigation ET cb (in mm day−1)
    is then calculated from the reference evapo-transpiration (ET0) [20] and adjusted
    for grapes using the basal crop coefficient ( k cb ) which serves as an aggregated
    coefficient of the physical and physiological characteristics of the plant [20].
    A management factor, f , is included that can adjust the water delivered to each
    of the irrigation control cell ET cb =f⋅ k cb ⋅ ET 0 . (2) View Source The basal
    crop coefficient, k cb , is calculated from the Mapping Evapo-Transpiration at
    High Resolution with Internalized Calibration model [21], [22] using the NDVI
    value for each cell. The basal crop coefficient can be obtained by subtracting
    the soil heat flux and sensible heat flux from the net radiation at the surface
    [22]. In case the Landsat data is obscured by clouds, the NDVI values are extrapolated
    using historical reflectance data from the same plot of the vineyard. The irrigation
    schedule for each cell is based on (2), with the value of management factor, f
    , varied from 0.5 for the first eight weeks of irrigation up to 0.75 during the
    rest of the season in 2013. In 2014, the management factor, f , is 0.5 for the
    first five weeks and then increased to 0.7 for the rest of the season. The management
    factor, f , is used to apply moderate water stress to the vines and improve fruit
    quality and to increase yield in low vigor area. The management factor is a parameter
    that can be changed and it can incorporate domain knowledge or management practices
    on the farm. The evapo-transpiration is calculated for the following week based
    on real-time weather data. The irrigation schedule for individual control cells
    is calculated using the NDVI value and ET cb taking into account the number of
    drippers for each zone and dripper specifications (i.e., 1.89 l h−1). Irrigation
    schedules are generated on a weekly basis for each zone and transmitted to the
    central control computer. Once a schedule is uploaded to the computer, it reads
    the zone number and number of hours per day that needs to enable the irrigation
    and issue a command to the control node containing the solenoid valve to open
    and allow water in the irrigation line for the required time interval. Once the
    required irrigation time passes, the central computer issue a command to close
    the solenoid valve. E. Variable Rate Management Zone Delineation Based on the
    2012 yield map, irrigation control cells that had a yield value below 20 tonnes
    hectare−1 and low NDVI value are grouped in two management zones: 1) the yield
    maximizing zones and 2) the water efficiency zones. The yield maximizing zones
    has low yield in 2012 and water is used to increase in that zone. The water efficiency
    area is targeted to minimize the water consumption. We note that there could be
    other objectives that can be implemented; e.g., reduce NDVI variability, reduce
    variability in grape quality, or minimize fertilizer use. Many objectives can
    be tied to delineate zones based on spectral indices like NDVI that is readily
    available even for farm where historical yield or soil data may not exist. F.
    Yield Analysis Methods Crop yield maps are used to establish grape production
    variability [23], [24]. Crop yield maps are measured in 2012, 2013, and 2014 using
    the Advanced Technology Viticulture (ATV, Joslin, SA, Australia) yield monitor
    systems installed on three self-propelled, over-the-row, trunk-shaking mechanical
    GH9000 AIM harvesters (Ag Industrial Manufacturing, Lodi, CA, USA). The yield
    monitors included a differential global positioning system, a grape weighing unit
    and a data recording system. The grape weighing unit contains a load cell weight
    bridge and a belt speed sensor. Geo-referencing is realized by simultaneously
    logging the coordinates and synchronizing them with the weight measurements. The
    data is transferred to a computer and accessed using proprietary software from
    ATV. Belt scales are zeroed before each harvest and the system is calibrated against
    actual truck weights at the beginning of the harvest season and weekly thereafter.
    Calibration is validated by ensuring that weight error ranges are within 8% of
    the weight at the winery, but actual measurements are consistently within 3%–4%.
    Harvest data is transferred into a data processing module developed in R Studio
    (RStudio Inc., Boston, MA, USA) to convert mass flow units into tonnes hectare−1,
    to eliminate measurement points that are outliers, and to normalize measurements
    from different harvesters. Yield data with values larger than three standard deviations
    from the mean are removed. The data cleaning steps eliminates only 5% of the original
    data. After yield data cleaning, the data is further processed by a software package
    (VESPER Version 1.62) [25] for interpolation and kriging to 3 ×3 m resolution.
    The raster data sets are then transferred into a program (Manifold System, Manifold
    Net Ltd., Carson City, NV, USA), where a 3 m ×3 m geo-referenced grid is created.
    For this paper, the yield data is further aggregated to 15 m ×15 m geo-referenced
    cells that are within the study area by summing up all yield values within that
    cells. If yield data points are at the boundary of two adjacent cells, the weight
    is distributed equally between the cells. Spatial statistics are quantified using
    the Cambardella index (CI) [26] and the Mean Correlation Distance (MCD) [27] using
    variogram parameters extracted from VESPER software [25]. The utility of such
    studies has been demonstrated in the past [28]. Using an exponential variogram
    model, the nugget ( C 0 ) and sill ( C 0 +C ) of the yield data are calculated
    across data points spaced up to 100 m. The CI is defined as [26] CI= C 0 ( C 0
    +C) ∗100 (3) View Source and quantifies the extent across which correlation is
    preserved. A CI value below 25 means strong spatial dependence, CI between 25
    and 75 means a moderate spatial dependence, and CI above 75 means a weak spatial
    dependence. MCD represents the distance along which correlation is preserved.
    The MCV is defined as [27] MCD= 3 8 ( C C+ C 0 )a (4) View Source where a is the
    range for the variogram or the distance above which value no correlation is detected.
    The three variogram parameters are estimated for the 2012–2014 yield data acquired
    across the whole variable rate irrigation area, as well as yield increasing and
    water efficiency sections. For comparison, the same calculations are carried out
    for the reference area where year to year variations are small. SECTION III. Results
    Differential irrigation is implemented for each irrigation control cell. As an
    example, in 2013 the yield maximizing section had an overall lower NDVI value
    compared with the water efficiency section (consistent with the 2012 yield data).
    Irrigating only the yield maximizing section for the first five weeks (irrigation
    started on April 28, 2013) the NDVI quickly increased above the water efficiency
    area’s NDVI value. Once the NDVI reverses the trends it can be maintained across
    the whole growing season by providing more water to the yield maximizing zone.
    After the first five weeks, all irrigation control cells are irrigated based on
    the corresponding NDVI values acquired across the growing season. In 2014, the
    yield maximizing section were irrigated the first four weeks and then all cells
    were irrigated based on their corresponding NDVI value. The yield data for each
    individual irrigation control cell is shown in Fig. 5. The key results of the
    experiment are summarized in Table I, with the mean values and the coefficient
    of variation (CoV) (relative standard deviation) for each section and year. The
    mean yields in the reference and trial areas are similar, at 20.0 and 20.1 tonnes
    hectare−1 for 2012 when the entire vineyard is uniformly irrigated. Lower fruitfulness
    in 2013 resulted in lower yields compared to 2012. There is no significant improvement
    in yield in the trial area in 2013, i.e., the yield maximizing and water efficiency
    sections, which is expected given the growth cycle of grapes. However, a substantial
    improvement in water efficiency is observed in 2014: 22% for the water efficiency
    section and 5% for the yield maximizing section. In 2014, yield increased 26%
    and 5% in the yield and water maximizing sections, respectively. Also, water use
    efficiency increased by 10% for the water efficiency section, with the water efficiency
    for the yield maximizing section remaining the same as the reference section.
    TABLE I Yield, Irrigation Water, and Water Efficiency Analysis for the Yield Maximizing,
    Water Efficiency, and Reference Section of the Vineyard Fig. 5. Top: Yield data
    for a uniformly irrigated test area in 2012 and a variable rate irrigated test
    area in 2013 and 2014. For 2013 and 2014, the yield maximizing section is outlined
    on the top images. Bottom: The yield for the control adjacent area. Show All The
    CoV for 2013 (Table I) decreased significantly indicating that uniformity of yield
    distribution is improved more than 50% after the first year (as change in CoV
    coefficient). After increasing the uniformity, the second year experiment demonstrated
    that yield trends can be reversed compared to 2012 yield map. In the yield maximizing
    section where yield is lower in 2012 became high yield areas in 2014 and the high
    yield area (water efficiency section) in 2012 became low yield in 2014 compared
    with plot average values. This reversal in yield is possible after only two years
    using the water as the only parameter that is varied across the trial area. The
    change in yield trends in 2014 resulted also in an increase of the CoV that is
    expected considering yield trend reversal. Table II summarizes the CI and MCD
    values across the three years of yield data. The CI indicates that there is a
    strong spatial dependence of yield across the variable rate irrigated area and
    the correlation is preserved for all three years even if the yield has significant
    spatial changes. The same conclusion is also supported by the MCD that shows a
    long range correlation with a significant increased value in 2014. Both the Cambardella
    and MCD values remain very similar for the reference area across the three years
    of this paper. Variable rate irrigation can change the spatial coherence of yield
    data on the small scale. TABLE II Spatial Statistics for the Yield and Water Efficiency
    Section The two-year study on yield and water use efficiency raises two questions.
    First, why are the yield enhancements small in the first year and significantly
    larger in the second year? The answer is that grape vines undergo an 18 months
    growing cycle between bud initiation and harvest [29]. Inflorescence induction
    and differentiation occurring 18 months prior to harvest are the key factors that
    govern grape yield potential. Thus, temperature and sunshine as well as stress
    conditions 18 months prior greatly affect the number of clusters per vine as well
    as the number of berries per cluster and thus yield [30]. Proper irrigation during
    bud formation minimizes water stress and its impact is expected to appear at harvest
    of the second year; which indeed resulted in a 26% increase in the yield in our
    experiment. The yield increase of 2% in the first year can be attributed to larger
    berry sizes. The second question is why the water efficiency dropped in the second
    year from 22% to 10%. Due to water availability constraints in the second year,
    the start of the irrigation in the reference area is delayed by one month compared
    to the trial area. SECTION IV. Economic Analysis Adoption of the variable rate
    irrigation technology required new irrigation infrastructure and irrigation analytics
    calculation. The first aspect is the change of existing uniform drip irrigation
    system with a variable rate irrigation system. The practicality of adopting the
    variable rate technology is influenced by two factors: 1) investment cost and
    2) the time for return on investment (ROI). With regards to ROI, the variable
    rate drip line system is best suited for high variability areas where differential
    management can improve low yield cells while managing water efficiently. The cost
    of a variable rate drip line irrigation system as presented herein depends on
    the spatial extent of the irrigation control cells. The smaller the control cells,
    the higher the infrastructure costs will be. Clearly, the size of the irrigation
    control cell should address yield or soil variability and this will drive the
    number of control nodes, solenoid valves, etc. Current estimates for implementing
    the variable rate drip line system at 30 m resolution can approach approximately
    a one-time cost of $5000 per hectare (assuming large scale fabrication of the
    components). If the system is fully packaged, installation costs should be similar
    to today’s system. In Fig. 6, the expected yield improvements are calculated as
    a function of control cell size (i.e., for the yield variability of the vineyard
    as shown in Fig. 5). Two assumptions are made in this calculation: 1) in regions
    with lower than average yield, the yield can be increased to the average yield
    of the field using variable rate irrigation and 2) the maximum yield improvement
    for the entire field (in the limit of very small control cell sizes) is 20%. We
    note that 20% is a realistic but potentially conservative assumption given that
    we have already shown 26% yield improvements. Fig. 6(a) shows that for very small
    control cells, the benefit of the technology saturates (approaching the assumed
    20% maximum yield improvement). For very large control cells, variable rate irrigation
    becomes ineffective compared to uniform irrigation, which shows that the spatial
    resolution of the management zone is just too coarse to successfully mitigate
    the variability. In terms of the cost benefits, an average price of 500pertonofgrapesisassumed,withapotential
    1200 profit per acre due to 20% increase in yield. The profit obtained should
    cover the cost of required new equipment (conversion of single drip line to a
    double drip line system) and the cost of required electronic components. Fig.
    6. Expected yield increase and ROI as a function of the control cell’s size. The
    optimum cell size is ~30m where the maximum benefits are expected. Show All Estimates
    of the ROI at larger manufacturing volumes as a function of the control zone size
    are shown in Fig. 6(b) with an optimum control cell size of around 30 m ×30 m
    where the ROI is approximately two years for grapes. Table III quantifies the
    cost of control electronics as a function of the number of fabricated units where
    larger volume decreases the unit price for the control nodes. Cost analysis for
    four distinctive crops indicates the number of years required to recover the investment
    (Table III-B). We note that all the calculations are made for crops that command
    high market prices. The ROI for deploying such a variable rate drip line system
    for strawberries, tomatoes, almonds, and grapes is 0.5, 0.8, 1.6, and 2.5 years,
    respectively, where the control zone is set at 30 m (the spatial resolution of
    Landsat imagery). These calculations may change if private satellite imagery needs
    to be purchased or if the deployed infrastructure will not remain in place for
    at least five years. Adoption of variable rate irrigation technology can have
    significant impact in regions such as the Indian subcontinent, most of Africa,
    Australia, and Western USA where water extraction often exceeds groundwater recharging
    rates [31]. TABLE III (a) Economic Analysis of Variable Rate Technology Cost as
    Function of Number of Controlled Units Fabricated. (b) Return of Investment for
    Different Crops as Function of Number of Control Units Used for Variable Rate
    Irrigation The second important aspect that needs to be implemented to scale-up
    variable rate irrigation is the data analytics platform that can ingest large
    scale geospatial data [32] and create real-time irrigation requirement. Such platforms
    should automatically combine real-time weather with remotely sensed data and automate
    and parallelize the analytics that determine the irrigation requirement. Only
    considered for the continental U.S., the required data sets can be several Terabytes
    of data each week. Near real-time irrigation prescriptions are virtually impossible
    using conventional (sequential) data processing techniques due to computational
    constraints. By way of comparison, a “big” data platform such as a highly distributed
    file system and processing environment leveraging the MapReduce framework [33]
    splits these large data files into small manageable 64 kB units, which can then
    be processed in parallel, thereby enabling computation “in the” data. For example,
    to scale the irrigation forecasting solution on a global scale we are using more
    than 32 servers, each with its own multicore processing unit and several local
    hard discs, where the irrigation analytics can be readily accelerated by a factor
    of 600 or more. With this system, irrigation requirements can be calculated in
    near real-time and scaled world-wide and adjusted for unexpected events like excessive
    precipitation, abrupt changes in daily temperature, and air moisture levels. Current
    development in big data technology can enable large scale irrigation forecasting
    using geospatial data [34]. The incremental cost to analyze new satellite data
    or weather data, in a big data framework, is minimal compared with manual analysis
    where data download, spatial alignment of data, and running analytics require
    significant manpower. Automation and machine to machine communication, as demonstrated
    in this paper, facilitate variable rate irrigation and provide consistency across
    growing season. SECTION V. Discussion The above results highlight the benefit
    of the closed loop variable rate irrigation approach where irrigation is fully
    automated. The variable rate drip line system presented here has the advantage
    of being flexible to deliver water differentially across a spatial area with high
    temporal resolution. For example, multiple irrigation periods during each day
    (to maintain constant soil moisture and avoid water pooling) can be readily implemented
    to maintain constant soil moisture or minimize water usage by applying the right
    amount of water at the right time. With proper management zone selection, yield
    can be significantly improved or water can be saved. The yield maximizing area
    responded directly to the targeted irrigation and it can be safely assumed that
    this is the main reason for the improved yield values. The improvements in water
    efficiency between 10%–20%, demonstrate that similar yields can be obtained using
    significantly less water. This can be a substantial benefit if the technology
    is adopted across a large geographical region. If applied to all grape producing
    region in California, which used 2 billion m3 irrigation water in 2010 (DWR 2014,
    USDA 2010), 15% improvements amounts to 300 million m3 reduction in water usage.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper validates that: 1) variability can be minimized
    across a vineyard and 2) low yield areas can be turned into high yield areas using
    only differential irrigation. Two different objectives, increased yield and preserved
    water, can be achieved simultaneously in a vineyard by controlling water delivery
    on a spatial checkboard pattern. We demonstrated that management zone delineation
    can be defined based on NDVI and yield data and those management zones are a good
    representation of the variability. This paper demonstrates that with real-time
    control on the irrigation, the vigor of the canopy can be improved in a few weeks
    at the beginning of the season and reverse yield patterns after only 2 years of
    variable rate irrigation. These changes can be achieved on irrigation control
    cells as low as 15 m × 15m. The double drip line system developed for this paper
    can be easily reconfigured to adjust to any management zones that may affect variability
    in the field. In locations where soil and management practices vary across the
    vineyard, dynamic management zones can be defined by clustering the irrigation
    control cell to reflect the new management zones. Management zone boundaries can
    be changed dynamically during the growing season by just logically clustering
    irrigation control cells differently, without changing physical infrastructure.
    This proof of concept experiment carried out in a vineyard demonstrates the advantage
    to automate and customize irrigation for control zones of as little as 40 vines
    that can result in a 26% improvement in yield and an average 16% increase in water
    use efficiency. Large scale deployment of variable rate irrigation driven by digital
    data can enable efficient water use in regions where water is scarce and expensive,
    as well as during drought, while maintaining and improving currently achievable
    crop yields. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    automating the data transfer from WiSA to IrrigWeb will greatly improve the potential
    for uptake and use of technologies like IrrigWeb. On the other hand, the downlink

    from IrrigWeb to WiSA. Combining the uplink and downlink programs, a smarter irrigation
    management system can automatically control sugarcane irrigation, and ultimately

    farms is challenging due to imprecise crop coefficients, time consuming computations,
    and the need to simultaneously manage many fields. Meanwhile, the adoption of
    soil moisture monitoring in vegetables has historically been limited by sensor

    have been developed that automate many of the calculations involved in ET-based
    irrigation scheduling. Soil moisture sensor data can be collected through wireless

    of crop ET estimation, such as eddy covariance and Bowen ratio, provide research
    options for further developing and evaluating crop coefficient guidelines of vegetables,
    while recent advancements in surface renewal instrumentation have led to a relatively
    low-cost tool for monitoring crop water requirement in commercial farms. Remote
    sensing of crops using satellite, manned aircraft, and UAV platforms may also
    provide useful tools for vegetable growers to evaluate crop development, plant

    Water Scarcity and Commercial Vegetable Production Most economically important
    vegetable production regions of the world have Mediterranean, semi-arid, or desert
    climates in which supplemental irrigation is required to maximize yield and quality.
    Efficient irrigation management has become a major concern for vegetable farmers
    in these areas as water supplies have become more restricted and environmental
    impairments to ground and surface water from agricultural run-off and drainage
    has received more attention from regulatory agencies. Agricultural water resources
    have become increasingly stressed in the vegetable producing regions of Australia,
    Southern Europe, Chile, the Middle East, North Africa, China, and the western
    United States. California has been under severe drought conditions for four years
    since 2012 [1,2], and ground water supplies have been depleted to historically
    low levels on the central coast, where most of the salad vegetables are grown
    for the US and export markets. Lowering of the ground water table below sea-level
    through agricultural pumping has caused salt water to intrude into coastal aquifers
    and threatened the sustainability of thousands of hectares of prime farmland used
    for vegetable production [3]. Australia also experienced a severe decade-long
    drought during the early 2000’s that impacted vegetable farmers in the Murray-Darling
    Basin in New South Wales and Queensland [4]. The vegetable production regions
    of Chile [5] and Spain [6] have also experienced recurring multiyear droughts.
    Since many vegetables require high rates of nitrogen fertilizer and have shallow
    root systems, leaching of nitrate during the irrigation season and during periods
    of heavy precipitation has resulted in nitrate contamination of aquifers in many
    key vegetable production regions [7,8,9]. Irrigation run-off from vegetable fields
    also contaminates surface water bodies such as rivers, creeks, estuaries, and
    lakes with nutrients and pesticides [10,11,12]. Growers in California and Europe
    must report on the amount of fertilizer nitrogen that they apply to their crops
    to comply with environmental regulations [13,14]. They are also required to implement
    best practices to minimize nitrate losses, which will require improving irrigation
    management. 1.2. Challenges for Irrigation Scheduling in Modern Vegetable Operations
    Vegetable production poses several unique challenges in managing irrigation water
    efficiently. One of the major challenges for growers is the number of fields that
    must be concurrently managed in a medium to large size vegetable operation. Fields
    sizes for vegetable crops tend to be small (<5 ha) relative to agronomic crops,
    especially fields planted with leafy green, crucifer, and other salad vegetables.
    Large vegetable growing operations in the Salinas valley of California manage
    1–2 thousand ha of vegetables, with an average field size of just 4 ha. Small
    fields permit intensive management, allowing plantings to be staggered so that
    a steady supply of vegetables can be delivered to buyers and shippers. However,
    smaller field sizes means that farming decisions must be coordinated for many
    fields that may vary with respect to maturity, soil texture, cultural practices,
    microclimate, or other site-specific conditions. In addition to field size, the
    diversity of vegetables and number of crop rotations per season increases management
    complexity. Most diversified operations will produce more than 30 types of vegetables,
    each with unique nutrient and water requirements. Many vegetables are grown over
    short cropping cycles. Leafy green salad mixes like leaf and crisphead lettuce,
    for instance, reach maturity over just 30–65 day intervals during the summer.
    As a result, farmers in Mediterranean climates often grow two to three rotations
    of vegetable crops per year. Fields often are intensively tilled between crops
    to remove compacted zones caused by traffic from harvest machinery and to prepare
    raised beds for seeding or transplanting the next crop. These activities require
    that crews retrieve drip tape or sprinkler pipe after each crop is harvested.
    Another irrigation scheduling challenge is the number of field operations that
    must be coordinated during a crop cycle. Fields are typically sprayed to protect
    against insect and disease pests several times per crop cycle, and must be periodically
    cultivated to control weeds. Fertilizer applications are made several times during
    the growth cycle to satisfy the nutrient requirements of vegetables. Irrigations
    must be timed to accommodate access for tractor and hoeing crews so that activities
    can be completed on schedule. There may be several extended periods when a vegetable
    crop cannot be irrigated to permit the soil to dry sufficiently to allow tractor
    access. Irrigation equipment, such as sprinkler and mainline pipes, may need to
    be moved before each pass of a tractor through a field. Irrigation scheduling
    is also complicated by the numerous methods that vegetable growers use to supply
    water to their crops. Depending on the crop type, plant density, development stage,
    water source, and field and soil characteristics, growers may choose to irrigate
    using overhead sprinklers, drip, furrow, or a combination of methods. In California,
    leafy green vegetables harvested for salad mixes are seeded at high densities
    (8.5 million plants per hectare) [15] on 2 m wide raised beds and are irrigated
    almost exclusively with sprinklers. Small seeded vegetables such as crisphead
    and romaine lettuce are typically germinated with sprinklers, and after several
    weeks, irrigated with surface drip until harvest. Celery transplants may be established
    using overhead sprinklers, then drip irrigated, and occasionally flood irrigated
    to rewet the shoulders of raised beds. Since vegetable production is frequently
    characterized by short crop cycles, intensive crop rotations, and numerous small
    fields at different stages of maturity, farm managers are challenged to schedule
    and coordinate all the field activities while taking time to carefully schedule
    irrigations to optimize water use. Consequently, many farm managers may follow
    predetermined irrigation schedules to simplify water management and make small
    adjustments during the cropping season depending on their observations of the
    crop, soil, and weather conditions. Usually the amount of water applied to high
    value vegetables exceeds crop evapotranspiration (ET) to avoid water stress. In
    the Salinas Valley of California, for example, applied water amounts on broccoli,
    cauliflower, and cabbage averaged >200% of the estimated crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) requirement [16]. While these applications rates may avoid water stress
    so that yield and quality are maximized, over-irrigating may strain water supplies
    and result in the leaching of nitrate and/or generate run-off that degrades the
    quality of receiving surface water bodies. Considering the numerous challenges
    and limitations of managing vegetables, growers, farm managers, and irrigators
    need convenient methods to schedule irrigations so that they can better determine
    how much water to apply to match the requirements of their crops. During the past
    few decades, significant improvements and lower costs for wireless communications,
    computing power, sensor technology, and aerial and satellite imagery have increased
    the potential to develop accurate and intuitive approaches for scheduling irrigations
    in vegetables. 2. Advances in Soil Moisture Sensor Technology 2.1. Recent Developments
    in Soil Moisture Sensing The monitoring of soil moisture has long been a standard
    way to determine when crops need to be irrigated. Growers and farm managers typically
    evaluate soil moisture by probing with a shovel or auger or monitoring with sensors.
    Sensors for volumetric moisture content and soil water tension have been commercially
    available for more than 40 years but were originally used more in research than
    for commercial crop production. Volumetric soil moisture sensors provide readings
    in units of m3·m−3, and tension-based sensors readings are typically in units
    of kPa, where a greater absolute value corresponds to drier soil conditions [17].
    In the past, the primary barriers to more widespread use of soil moisture sensors
    in irrigation management have included both cost as well as labor required for
    the installation, removal, and collection of readings [18]. In recent years, there
    has been a proliferation of commercially available soil moisture monitoring systems
    for agriculture. Many sensors interface with dataloggers and wireless communication
    systems to provide near real-time status of soil moisture from several depths
    and locations within a field. Data are automatically uploaded by radio or cell
    phone communications to cloud-based computer servers and are accessible through
    apps on smartphones and tablet computers. These communication advancements greatly
    improve the convenience of accessing data and can be configured to provide timely
    alerts when crops require irrigation. Many of these wireless communication systems
    for soil moisture sensors also support on-farm weather stations, digital flow
    meters, and control valves, which facilitates the monitoring of irrigation system
    operations. Soil moisture sensors have also evolved during the last few decades
    in terms of size, cost, and accuracy. Electromagnetic (EM) soil moisture sensors,
    used to determine volumetric soil moisture content, include time domain reflectometry
    (TDR) and capacitance sensors. These were once bulky and expensive instruments.
    With improvements in electronic manufacturing and better designs, current EM sensors
    (Figure 1A,B) are generally much smaller, cheaper, and more accurate than earlier
    models. Some versions are integrated with soil temperature and salinity sensors
    (e.g., Model 5TE, Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA). Others are integrated
    with dataloggers and radio communications (e.g., Model gStake, gThrive Inc., Santa
    Clara, CA, USA) to facilitate field installation and removal. Figure 1. Examples
    of various soil moisture sensors: (A,B) capacitance sensors; (C) tensiometer with
    an electronic gauge; (D) tensiometers with electronic gauges installed in a lettuce
    field and interfaced with a datalogger and radio communications; (E) tensiometer
    integrated with pressure transducer, datalogger, and radio communications; (F)
    granular matrix sensor and reader. Tension-based soil moisture sensors have been
    considered the best method to determine if a crop needs water since most vegetables
    experience reductions in yield and quality under prolonged periods of high soil
    water tensions. Tension thresholds that optimize production have been determined
    for many vegetable species [17,19], including broccoli [20], cabbage [21], cauliflower
    [22], lettuce [23,24], potato [25], and tomato [26]. An advantage of tension thresholds
    is that they are less influenced by soil texture than volumetric moisture thresholds.
    Tensiometers can accurately measure soil water tension in a range of 0–85 kPa
    using a mechanical vacuum gauge attached to a water filled tube with a porous
    ceramic cup [17] (Figure 1C). Tensiometers must be installed without air gaps
    between the ceramic cup and soil to function properly. To reduce labor for collecting
    readings, several recent models have sensitive electronic pressure transducers
    that measure vacuum pressure and can be interfaced to dataloggers and wireless
    communication services (Figure 1D,E) so that data may be monitored remotely (Figure
    2) (e.g., Hortau Inc., Lévis, QC, Canada). Though tensiometers do not need calibration,
    they usually require periodic maintenance to assure that they are functioning
    properly. Entrapped air that develops at high tensions must be replaced with de-aired
    water. Adding a weak solution of algaecide or bleach can prevent biological growth
    inside the tensiometer tube, which may potentially clog the ceramic cup [26].
    Figure 2. Fifteen minute readings (kPa) from tensiometers installed in a lettuce
    field at 8 (20 cm) and 18 inch (46 cm) depths are displayed in an online irrigation
    scheduling application. Granular matrix sensors (GMS) (Figure 1F) indirectly measure
    soil water tension using electrical resistance and are often used as an alternative
    to tensiometers (e.g., Model watermark 200SS, Irrometer Company Inc., Riverside,
    CA, USA). Most GMS can be interfaced to dataloggers and wireless communications
    [26]. An advantage of GMS compared to tensiometers is that they do not require
    regular servicing. These sensors retain sensitivity at higher soil moisture tensions
    (up to 200 kPa) but are less accurate at low soil moisture tensions (0–15 kPa)
    than tensiometers [17,26]. GMS readings are also affected by fluctuations in soil
    temperature [17]. Another limitation of GMS is that the response time to wetting
    and drying cycles is slower compared to tensiometers [26,27]. A number of studies
    have evaluated automated irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture readings
    for improving the water use efficiency of vegetables irrigated with drip tape.
    Automatic controllers used in these studies irrigated crops for short durations
    several times per day when soils dried below a predetermined threshold [28,29].
    Some control systems have relied on tension based sensors [26,28], while others
    have used volumetric soil moisture sensors [28,30,31,32,33,34] to determine when
    to irrigate. The use of TDR soil moisture sensors for triggering irrigations in
    sub-surface drip irrigated sweet corn resulted in an 11% savings in water use
    with similar yields compared to a standard sprinkler irrigated treatment [30].
    Small plot trials have demonstrated water savings, reduced nitrate leaching, and
    improvements in yield in drip irrigated fresh market tomatoes, bell peppers, and
    zucchini squash using capacitance soil moisture sensors to trigger irrigations
    [31,32,33,34,35]. Using tensiometers, Mũnoz-Carpena et al. [26] were able to reduce
    water use in fresh market tomato by 67% compared to the grower standard practice
    without significant reductions in marketable yield. Most of the water savings
    were during the early crop stages when evapotranspiration rates were low. Capacitance
    soil moisture sensors were generally found to be more reliable for automated irrigation
    scheduling than tensiometers and GMS. As discussed earlier, tensiometers require
    regular maintenance, and the GMS response to changes in soil moisture was too
    slow to use these sensors for triggering irrigations. While these studies have
    demonstrated the potential for water savings in small plots, automated irrigation
    scheduling may have several limitations in commercial vegetable fields. The optimal
    volumetric soil moisture threshold for triggering an irrigation would need to
    be empirically determined for different soil types. Pressurized water would need
    to be continuously available to accommodate frequent short irrigations. In large
    fields, short irrigation cycles could lead to significant drainage at the lower
    end of a field when drip lines depressurize. 2.2. Limitations of Soil Moisture
    Sensors for Irrigation Scheduling in Vegetables While much progress has been made
    in improving the accuracy and utility of soil moisture sensors, several factors
    still limit their use for irrigation scheduling of vegetables. Though costs for
    individual sensors may be less than in the past, the addition of dataloggers,
    cell phone modems, and radio communications, which facilitate real-time monitoring,
    has added to the total costs. Labor for installation and removal of sensors remains
    a significant cost, especially in vegetable crops with short production cycles.
    Considering labor and capital costs, many growers elect to use soil moisture monitoring
    equipment in a small percentage of their vegetable fields. Though soil moisture
    sensors are useful for determining when to irrigate vegetables, they are less
    useful for estimating how much water to apply. Soil moisture tension readings
    must be converted to volumetric moisture to estimate soil water depletion since
    a previous irrigation or rain event. Volumetric soil moisture sensors may also
    need calibration. Most capacitance sensors use the manufacturer’s calibration
    equations to convert readings to volumetric water content. Clay content, organic
    matter, salinity, bulk density, and temperature can affect the accuracy of capacitance
    sensors [36,37,38,39,40]. The effect of these factors on water content readings
    can vary in different soil types. For example, Kargas and Soulis [38] evaluated
    the accuracy of the 10HS capacitance sensor, and found that temperature had a
    larger effect on soil water content readings in clay than course textured soils.
    They concluded that calibration for specific soil types was needed to achieve
    accurate readings. Even with accurate sensors, spatial variability can limit the
    reliability of soil moisture estimates if readings are collected from only a few
    locations, especially if soil hydraulic properties vary within a field or the
    irrigation system applies water unevenly. Soil maps can be useful for guiding
    the placement of soil moisture sensors in locations that represent the dominant
    soil properties of fields. In drip-irrigated fields, determining the optimal location
    to accurately monitor soil moisture depletion can be particularly challenging.
    Soil moisture is typically higher under drip tape than adjacent to the plants,
    where root activity is concentrated. Placing sensors too close to a drip line
    may lead to under-irrigating a crop, and placing sensors too far away may result
    in over-irrigating [41]. Through computer modeling experiments, Soulis et al.
    [42] concluded that the optimal positioning of soil moisture sensors in drip-irrigated
    crops was influenced by soil hydraulic properties, crop evapotranspiration rate,
    and the configuration of the irrigation system. An additional consideration is
    the ideal depth at which to place sensors relative to the crop root zone. Broccoli
    roots can reach depths greater than 1.2 m at maturity [16], while roots of many
    leafy greens such as spinach may reach less than 0.5 m by harvest [43]. 3. ET-Based
    Approaches to Scheduling Irrigations in Vegetables Water requirements of vegetable
    crops can also be determined from estimates of crop evapotranspiration (ETc).
    Using Penman-Monteith [44,45], or similar equations [46], evapotranspiration (ET0)
    of a well-watered reference crop, such as grass, or alfalfa, is commonly estimated
    from measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar
    radiation [47]. The evapotranspiration of a well-watered vegetable crop can be
    estimated relative to a reference crop by multiplying ET0 by a crop coefficient
    (Kc). Crop coefficients for most major vegetable crops were summarized by Allen
    et al. [48], Guerra et al. [49], and Grattan et al. [50]. Networks of public weather
    stations to monitor reference ET have been established in many vegetable production
    regions of the world where irrigation is commonly used. The California Irrigation
    and Information System (CIMIS) is operated by the Department of Water Resources
    in California and consists of more than 145 weather stations sited on reference
    crops throughout the state. ET0 and other meteorological data, including precipitation,
    air and soil temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, and relative humidity,
    are available for users to download from the state operated website. Similar networks
    have been developed for other states including Arizona (AZMET), Colorado (CoAgMet),
    Florida (FAWN), Nevada (NICENET), Oklahoma (MesoNet), Oregon (AgriMet), and Washington
    (AgWeatherNet). Most European countries also have weather station networks that
    provide daily ET0 data through public websites (e.g., Spain [51], Italy [52]).
    In addition, CIMIS offers a satellite based product that estimates ET0 at a 2
    km resolution based on data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
    [53]. Many commercial companies also offer affordable weather stations (e.g.,
    ET107, Campbell Sci. Inc., Logan, UT, USA; WatchDog 2900ET Weather Station, Spectrum
    Technologies, Aurora, IL, USA; HOBO U30-NRC Weather Station, Onset Computer Corp.
    Bourne, MA, USA) that can be used to estimate ET0 on a farm. These systems offer
    a way to monitor ET0 in regions not covered by a public network, or for farms
    that are not located reasonably near an established station. However, in practice,
    few growers site or maintain stations in accordance with World Meteorological
    Organization standards for reference evapotranspiration measurements. Many growers
    site weather stations near trees, buildings, or parking lots, which limits the
    fetch and can influence the micro-climate, and potentially bias estimates of ET0.
    Stations are infrequently sited on a suitable well-watered reference crop. Most
    farmers do not allocate time to regularly maintain and calibrate meteorological
    instrumentation on their stations. Commercially available atmometers (ETgage Co.,
    Loveland, CO, USA) can be used to monitor ET0 but must also be sited over a reference
    crop. Although ET0 data have been useful for water agencies to estimate the seasonal
    water use of crops at a regional scale, growers have generally considered this
    approach to be impractical for scheduling irrigations in vegetable systems. A
    major difficulty is that the Kc value can change daily as vegetables grow and
    leaf area increases. During the establishment phase, when crop foliage covers
    a small percentage of the soil surface, ET is mostly from soil evaporation rather
    than from crop transpiration. For many vegetable crops, such as leafy greens and
    brassicas, the canopy cover is less than 10% until halfway through the crop cycle.
    The Kc during this early stage will depend on factors influencing evaporative
    losses from the soil, such as method and frequency of irrigations, and soil physical
    properties [48]. Later, in the rapid growth phase, Kc values increase daily as
    the canopy cover develops and covers the soil. Solutions for calculating a daily
    Kc for lettuce were proposed by Gallardo et al. [54] in which soil evaporation
    from unshaded soil (E) is estimated separately from the water lost by transpiration
    and soil evaporation under the crop canopy (T). Using this approach, Kc is proportional
    to the fractional cover (Fc) of the leaf canopy shading the soil, and E is related
    to the hydraulic properties of the soil and the time since the crop was irrigated.
    The general approach is consistent with Allen et al. [48,55], who also proposed
    separating the Kc of crops that have a significant period of minimal canopy cover
    into dual components consisting of a basal crop coefficient (Kcb) that represents
    water loss by transpiration and an evaporation coefficient (Ke), representing
    loss from soil evaporation. Direct relationships between Fc and Kcb have been
    reported for several crops such as broccoli [56], wheat [57], cotton [58], sugar
    beets [58], and grapes [59]. Both Gallardo et al. [54] and Allen et al. [48] describe
    calculations for estimating soil evaporation, which divide Ke into stage 1 and
    stage 2 periods. Stage 1 occurs immediately following an irrigation or rain event
    that saturates the soil to field capacity. During stage 1, water loss is limited
    by the energy available for evaporation. Stage 2 occurs after the soil is visibly
    dry and water loss is limited by soil hydraulic properties. The Stage 2 rate of
    evaporation diminishes with time as the soil water content declines. 4. Software
    for ET Based Scheduling of Vegetables 4.1. Overview of Sofware Tools Even with
    publicly available ET0 data and accurate Kc models, the implementation of ET-based
    irrigation scheduling at the scale of a commercial vegetable farm may be difficult
    for growers. Daily ET0 values need to be retrieved from a location representative
    of the field of interest. An estimate of canopy cover is needed to determine the
    average Kc for each irrigation event. Soil evaporation calculations require knowledge
    of the soil properties of the field, irrigation method, and interval between irrigations
    or rainfall events. To convert crop ET into an irrigation recommendation, the
    application rate and distribution uniformity of the irrigation system, and in
    some cases the leaching fraction, also needs to be integrated into the calculations.
    Recognizing that most growers have limited time to dedicate to making decisions
    on water management, several universities and public institutions have developed
    computer programs to facilitate ET based scheduling. Spreadsheet and Windows-based
    irrigation scheduling programs, such as CROPWAT [60], KanSched 2.0, Basic Irrigation
    Scheduling (BIS) [61], and consumptive use program (CUP) [62] automate the irrigation
    scheduling calculations but require users to retrieve and enter daily ET0 values.
    Since separate spreadsheet files maybe needed for each crop, these programs may
    be difficult to implement in large growing operations that manage many fields.
    Washington Irrigation Scheduling Expert (WISE) [63,64] is a downloadable JavaScript
    application that runs on personal computers. More recently developed web-based
    applications such as Irrigation Scheduler mobile (Washington State University)
    [65], Irrigation Management Online (Oregon State University) [66], Wateright (Fresno
    State University) [67,68], and CropManage (University of California, Division
    of Agriculture and Natural Resources) [69,70] were developed to automatically
    retrieve ET0 data from weather station networks such as AgWeatherNet and CIMIS
    and support irrigation scheduling of multiple fields. These applications are accessed
    through web browsers, some of which automatically resize the user interface to
    smartphone screens. Colorado State University WISE Irrigation Scheduler [71] and
    SmartIrrigation (University of Florida, University of Georgia) [72,73,74] have
    similar capabilities but can operate exclusively on smartphones through downloadable
    applications. Outside of the United States, several public agencies have developed
    online irrigation scheduling services including IRRINET in Italy [75], ISS-ITAP
    in Spain [76], IRRISA in France [77], and IrriSatSMS [78] in Australia. In addition,
    a growing number of ET-based software tools are commercially available. Two examples
    are Probe Schedule (IRRinet LLC, Dalles, OR, USA) and Irrigation Advisor (PowWow
    Energy Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA). Further details of these commercial products
    are not provided here since they are proprietary and usually not documented in
    the scientific literature. Most online irrigation scheduling tools have cloud-based
    databases that retain information associated with each planting, such as soil
    type, planting and harvest dates, weather station name, and irrigation system
    application rate, so that the user does not need to reenter critical information
    for each irrigation event. After entering the information required to initiate
    a new planting, users can quickly look up how long to irrigate their crops. Some
    scheduling software provides weekly or daily summaries of how much water to apply
    (e.g., IrrigationScheduler, Wateright, SmartIrrigation, etc.), while others such
    as CropManage enable the user to input specific dates for each irrigation [70].
    The online format facilitates automated retrieval of current and forecasted weather
    data in advance of planned irrigation events, so that growers can be alerted when
    a field will need water. In addition to linking with weather station networks,
    decision support tools can also incorporate other online services such as UC Davis
    SoilWeb for identifying the soil physical properties of a field using the United
    States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database
    [79] or Google Maps, which can be customized for determining the longitude and
    latitude of a field or viewing locations of nearby weather stations. CropManage
    can also be customized to automatically retrieve flowmeter and soil moisture data
    from internet-accessible dataloggers. While many of these irrigation-scheduling
    programs will provide recommendations for multiple commodities, few have been
    developed or tested specifically for vegetables. Most irrigation scheduling applications
    use single Kc values for the four crop growth stages described by Doorenbos and
    Pruitt [80] to simplify calculations of ETc. CropManage was initially developed
    for vegetable irrigation and employs a dual crop coefficient approach for estimating
    crop ET similar to Gallardo et al. (1996), as described in Johnson et al. [81]
    and Smith et al. [16]. The vegetable crops currently supported include broccoli,
    cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, and spinach. Since the user enters the date of
    each irrigation event, CropManage adjusts watering recommendations for the frequency
    and method of irrigation. Empirical models of fractional cover are included for
    each supported vegetable crop so that the user can customize the Kcb curves for
    a specific season, bed width, and planting configuration. Replicated field trials
    demonstrated that the CropManage irrigation recommendations using the ET based
    algorithm with a dual crop coefficient optimized water use and yield in crisp
    head lettuce and broccoli [81]. 4.2. Achieving Widescale Adoption of Irrigation
    Software Despite significant progress in developing ET-based irrigation scheduling
    software for commercial vegetable farms, many challenges exist that will need
    to be addressed to achieve large-scale adoption by growers. Although public ET
    weather station networks have been established in many vegetable producing regions
    of the US and Europe, they are less common in other regions such as India, China,
    and Latin America. In areas where ET0 data are available, the density or siting
    of weather stations may not provide sufficient resolution to fully capture regional
    variation in microclimates. In these instances, growers may choose to install
    and operate their own weather stations, as described above. Another challenge
    is to deliver accurate irrigation recommendations without requiring users to provide
    excessive details about their crop, irrigation system, and field conditions. Morrison
    [82] found that time constraints and concerns about data entry errors were factors
    that deterred grower adoption of the irrigation scheduling software. Irrigation
    scheduling apps also need to be intuitive for irrigators and farm managers to
    use in the field. The user-interface displayed on smartphones and tablet computers
    must be easy to read and to understand, while providing sufficient detail for
    the user to verify that the values for ET0, Kc, and other variables used in the
    scheduling calculations are accurate. Also, since the principal language of many
    irrigators in the western US is Spanish, irrigation scheduling applications need
    to support multiple languages. The cost of computer programming services is also
    a major barrier to developing and maintaining irrigation scheduling software.
    As software has become more sophisticated, and needs to be compatible with personal
    and tablet computers and smartphones, the complexity and consequently costs of
    development have increased. Software products will incur annual costs associated
    with updating to new technology, introducing new features, and troubleshooting
    identified errors. Most publicly available irrigation scheduling applications
    were initially developed under research grants, and need either continued grant
    funding or income generated from user subscriptions to support updating and maintenance
    costs. Several online irrigation scheduling services that were initially funded
    by the European Union became inactive after grants ended [83]. It may be cost-effective
    for institutions to collaborate on the development of software products that are
    sufficiently flexible to be customized for different growing regions and commodities.
    SmartIrrigation is an example of such collaboration between the University of
    Florida and University of Georgia. There also may be opportunities for public
    agencies, commodity boards, and commercial companies to partner on the development
    of commercial irrigation scheduling software. For instance, SureHarvest Inc. (Santa
    Cruz, CA, USA) recently developed an online irrigation-scheduling tool for almonds
    in collaboration with the University of California and the Almond Board of California.
    5. Field Measurements of Crop ET Field measurements of crop ET are needed to develop
    and verify crop coefficients as well as to investigate the interaction of water
    stress on crop yield and quality. Several reviews detail the advantages and disadvantages
    of various methods of measuring crop ET [84,85]. Weighing lysimeters have often
    been used to measure crop water use [85,86]. While considered the most accurate
    ET measurement method, the expense of these instruments limits their use to research
    stations and constrains the range of sites, crops, and management practices that
    can reasonably be evaluated. Energy balance methods such as Bowen ratio [85],
    eddy covariance [85], and surface renewal [87] are more affordable alternatives
    to lysimetry for evaluating crop ET and can be deployed in commercial fields for
    evaluating crop water use under a wide range of growing conditions. Instrumentation
    costs for these methods can exceed $10,000 USD per station, which has limited
    their use primarily to research studies. Energy balance methods involve monitoring
    of net radiation, soil heat flux, and sensible heat flux to estimate the latent
    heat flux (Wm−2), which can be converted to water flux or evapotranspiration rate
    through the latent heat of vaporization. Generally, the sensors used for energy
    balance measurements have become more reliable, cheaper, and more accurate in
    recent years. The capabilities of dataloggers used for operating the instrumentation
    have also improved, with more memory and faster computation speeds, while post-processing
    software modules have become more accessible. Energy balance methods have been
    used for evaluating the water use of vegetable crops in commercial fields, including
    artichokes, broccoli, beans, lettuce, onions, and processing tomatoes [50,88,89,90,91,92].
    These methods have been useful for reevaluating existing crop coefficients, as
    production practices and varieties have improved during recent years [93]. However,
    considering the diversity of vegetables and production methods, relatively few
    ET studies have been published using these techniques during the last decade.
    Surface renewal, which uses thermocouples to measure rapid changes in air temperature,
    has greatly reduced the costs of estimating sensible heat flux and may be well
    suited to vegetable fields due to a smaller fetch requirement compared to eddy
    covariance. Advances in surface renewal methodology [94] have culminated in a
    commercial service that provides growers with ET estimates and irrigation recommendations
    via a web application (Tule Technology Inc., Oakland, CA, USA). However, this
    tool has primarily been used in perennial crops such as trees, grapes, and strawberries.
    6. Satellite-Based Crop ET Determination 6.1. Energy Balance Researchers have
    developed satellite-based energy balance models to estimate ET at various spatial
    and temporal scales (e.g., reviews of Courault et al. [95]; Kalma et al. [96];
    Gonzalez-Dugo et al. [97]). The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL)
    and the Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration
    (METRIC) are two widely used approaches [98,99]. Optical and thermal band data
    from Landsat or other satellites is used to help parameterize the energy balance
    equation [100]. At the moment of satellite overpass, latent heat flux (LE) is
    retrieved through the calculation of surface energy balance that is based on radiative,
    aerodynamic, and energy balance physics. LE is converted to ET for the corresponding
    hour and subsequently to reference ET fraction (ETrF) by comparison with the measured
    reference ET for the hour. Finally, daily (2) ET is derived as the product of
    ETrF and reference ET for the day, under the assumption that ETrF approximates
    the average daylight evaporative fraction. The energy balance approach accounts
    for the effects of ET reduction in water-stressed crops, due to stomatal regulation
    and increased ET due to bare-soil evaporation. Linear or spline interpolation
    can be used to estimate ETrF (hence daily ET) between satellite overpasses, which
    occur every eight days in the case of Landsat, assuming clear-sky conditions.
    Manual intervention is used to calibrate the sensible heat flux computation by
    identifying portions of the image (hot and cold ‘anchor’ pixels) that represent
    extreme ET conditions, where ET can be estimated and assigned a priori. In a typical
    agricultural situation, cold pixels are associated with well-irrigated agricultural
    fields with high Fc and hot pixels with bare dry fields. Overall the ET retrieval
    error for the satellite-based energy balance is typically 5–15%, when estimates
    are produced by an experienced operator, and rises to 30–40% when operated by
    non-specialists or novices to the fields of hydrologic science, environmental
    physics, remote sensing, or agricultural systems [85]. An automated calibration
    method has been recently developed to facilitate and improve operation by non-specialists
    [101]. 6.2. Vegetation Index Hybrid approaches estimate fractional cover (Fc)
    from remote sensing and use ground-based ET0 data. Fc is a good indicator of light
    interception, which is a strong driver of ETc [48]. Weighing lysimeter observations
    by Bryla et al. [102] revealed a strong relationship between Fc and ETc for vegetable
    crops in California’s San Joaquin Valley, and the potential for using satellite-based
    Fc to estimate ETc in vegetable crops was demonstrated by Johnson and Trout [103].
    Fc can be estimated from various spectral visible-region bands, where chlorophyll
    absorption dominates, combined with near-infrared (NIR), where vegetation is highly
    reflective. A common formulation is the normalized difference vegetation index,
    or NDVI, which is derived as (NIR − red)/(NIR + red) [104]. Trout et al. [105]
    and Johnson and Trout [103] found a strong relationship between NDVI and Fc for
    vegetables and other crop types in California’s San Joaquin Valley. NDVI began
    to lose sensitivity above 80 percent cover, a point generally regarded as effective
    full cover for water management applications [106]. As above, interpolation can
    be applied to estimate NDVI, and hence ETc, for days between satellite overpasses
    as needed. 7. Satellite Based Irrigation Management Services 7.1. Prototype Systems
    By furnishing field scale estimates of Fc, a key factor for estimating Kcb and
    basal ETc (ETcb), optical remote sensing may potentially improve the accuracy
    of ET estimates in vegetables. Several satellite-based models have been developed
    for irrigation management. An early proof-of-capability satellite demonstration
    on wheat and corn was undertaken by the DEMETER project in Europe, which involved
    timely delivery of Landsat-based crop coefficients to agricultural end-users,
    with available online visualization and analysis capabilities [107]. More recently,
    the fully-automated Satellite Irrigation Management Support (SIMS) [108] uses
    atmospherically corrected Landsat data to map NDVI, Fc, and Kcb for multiple crop
    types, including vegetables across about eight million acres of California irrigated
    farmland [109]. These variables are updated every eight days at 30 m spatial resolution
    (cloud cover and data availability permitting) from 2010 to the present. The SIMS
    uses daily 2 km ET0 statewide grids produced by the California Irrigation Management
    Information System [53] to generate basal crop ET. Web data services allow users
    to display annual time-series graphs and download data for any given location
    (Figure 3). An application programming interface (API) enables on-demand transfer
    of SIMS data products to support external irrigation advisory services such as
    CropManage and also allows the user and other software tools to specify the crop
    type via the API and retrieve crop-specific Kcb data from SIMS. Where information
    is available on applied water, an FAO56 based soil water balance model can be
    used to adjust for soil evaporation and crop stress and to retrospectively derive
    agricultural water use fractions at the field scale for the evaluation of irrigation
    management and system performance [110]. Figure 3. SIMS map of fractional cover
    of vegetable crops near Salinas, California as of mid-July 2016. IrriSAT [111]
    is a weather based irrigation management and benchmarking technology that uses
    satellite remote sensing to generate crop water management information in Australia,
    primarily for grape and cotton growers at present [112,113]. As with SIMS, Landsat
    is used to estimate Kc at a 30 m resolution. Unlike SIMS, Kc is derived directly
    from a single linear relationship with satellite NDVI. Daily crop water use is
    determined as the product of Kc and ET0 observations from nearby weather stations,
    and a seven-day ET0 forecast is also produced. The delivery platform, which is
    built on the Google App Engine helps irrigators track soil moisture and better
    manage irrigation schedules. In addition, IrriSAT facilitates the calculation
    of seasonal agronomic performance metrics, including the irrigation water use
    index and gross production water use index. Additional satellite-based services
    have been implemented Europe and Australia [114]. These include IRRISAT-Italy
    (as distinct from IrriSAT-Australia described above), EO4Water (Austria), and
    IrriEye (southern Australia). These services generally involve the use of optical
    DEIMOS 20 m satellite imagery to generate and deliver leaf area index with derived
    Kc and related map overlays within a browsing and querying toolbox [115]. Personalized
    irrigation guidance regarding crop water requirement is dispensed through a secure
    website, SMS, and email. End-users are able to provide evaluative feedback. A
    variety of crops are being tested, including vegetables, sugar beet, corn, alfalfa,
    and orchards. Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux) [116] is a METRIC
    implementation on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform [117]. Landsat
    scenes from 1984 to the present are combined with gridded weather data to allow
    the analysis of most land areas worldwide. The products include maps of ET, associated
    energy balance flux components, and land cover. A time-series can be constructed
    by processing several scenes and interpolating between image dates. Automated
    image calibration for anchor pixels is offered in a Level 1 version to accommodate
    operation by non-experts, with some sacrifice in accuracy. A Level 2 version,
    which allows custom calibration by the operator, requires an annual license fee.
    EEFlux is a general tool that operates on both agricultural and non-agricultural
    land cover types. 7.2. Satellite Remote Sensing Considerations for Irrigation
    Scheduling Satellite observation is recognized as a useful tool that will continue
    to support crop coefficient development and ET monitoring for new types and varieties
    of crops, as facilitated by the wider availability of gridded weather data and
    continued advancement in convenient and user-friendly mapping technologies [118].
    The use of public domain satellites with open-data policies, i.e., the data source
    is available at no charge, is an advantage of this approach, as is the capability
    to collect data for many fields simultaneously. Vegetable crops, however, do present
    some unique challenges for satellite-based evaluation. The frequency of satellite
    overpasses, presence of cloud cover, and added time needed to perform custom atmospheric
    correction (e.g., Vermote and Saleous [119]) may limit the use of remote sensing
    for real time irrigation scheduling of fast-growing vegetable crops. As more satellite
    platforms become available, such as the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 system,
    the observation interval between images may soon decrease to four to five days
    for NDVI-based ET models. Also, upon further testing, it may be shown that use
    of a simplified atmospheric correction approach (e.g., Tasumi et al. [120]) may
    be adequate for application in some or most regions. Where real-time irrigation
    scheduling operations are unsupported, remote sensing may still prove useful for
    the retrospective evaluation of irrigation system performance or compilation of
    water use metrics. Another challenge is the typically small field size for vegetables
    as noted above (4–5 ha), which is near the minimum land area recommended for evaluation
    by Landsat or other public Earth observation satellites. An additional challenge
    is posed by leaf color, especially for crops such as red lettuce that depart widely
    from the green-leaf norm. A recent study has also shown that while NDVI was strongly
    related to Fc in both leafy greens (r2 = 0.88) and cole crops (r2 = 0.93), the
    relationships were different [121]. Thus, the development of customized relationships
    between NDVI and Fc by crop category is recommended to increase the accuracy of
    Fc estimates. 8. Remote Sensing Using Manned Aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAV) The use of manned aircraft and UAVs for monitoring vegetables has become
    a viable alternative or complement to satellite observation. Image resolution
    is generally much finer than that of Landsat or other open-data satellites, and
    passes over fields can be scheduled on a more frequent and flexible basis. However,
    data calibration to assure image consistency in support of time-series observations
    may be lacking. Several commercial companies offer NDVI and thermal spectrum images
    at <1 m resolution taken at weekly intervals using small planes in California
    and elsewhere (e.g., CERESimaging Inc., Oakland, CA, USA; TerrAvion Inc., San
    Leandro, CA, USA). Images can be accessed from the web generally within 24 h of
    collection. The high resolution of these scenes can provide enhanced information
    about within-field spatial variability in crop growth and water stress and for
    determining Fc used to parameterize ET equations. Patterns can show when a crop
    is under-irrigated such as in Figure 4, where the NDVI values for a romaine lettuce
    crop are lowest midway between sprinkler lines, presumably caused by poor irrigation
    distribution uniformity. Figure 4. NDVI image of a romaine lettuce field irrigated
    with sprinklers on lateral pipes (A) spaced 12.2 m apart; Plants were frequently
    smaller in areas midway between pipes (B) where the NDVI values were low. Photo
    credit: CERESimaging Inc., Oakland, CA, USA. The acquisition costs of UAVs and
    the training needed for mission planning, flight operation, and image processing
    have diminished significantly during recent years. A number of studies describe
    the use of UAVs for monitoring water stress [122,123] and vegetative cover [124,125]
    of crops, though few have specifically focused on vegetables. Due to the ease
    of operation, arranging flights at specific times and locations with UAVs may
    be simpler than with manned aircraft, which usually need to image a minimal number
    of fields to justify flight costs. This flexibility may be useful in vegetables
    when timely field scouting is needed to make decisions or diagnose a problem with
    a fast-growing crop. UAVs can fly at very low altitudes and carry sensor packages
    that can provide high-resolution imagery in the order of a few centimeters. A
    disadvantage of UAV operation, in the case of an owned system, would be a higher
    up-front cost than the engagement of a manned aircraft provider and additional
    time required for data retrieval and image processing. 9. Conclusions Water scarcity
    will most likely continue to be a significant problem in many of the important
    vegetable production regions of the world [126]. Improving water use efficiency
    through more accurate scheduling of irrigation can conserve water and address
    water quality impacts associated with commercial vegetable operations. However,
    irrigation scheduling in vegetables presents some unique challenges due to the
    diversity of crop types, intensive rotations, and number of fields that must be
    managed, as well as competing cultural operations that are involved in growing
    marketable crops. Advances in soil moisture sensors, wireless communications,
    ET measurements, remote sensing, computer technology, and cloud computing offer
    many potential opportunities to develop robust irrigation advisory tools to help
    farmers accurately determine and meet crop water needs. While much progress has
    already been made in soil moisture sensing and ET-based irrigation scheduling,
    achieving wide-scale adoption in the vegetable industry will require continued
    innovation. Continued collaboration between public research institutions, universities,
    commodity boards, and commercial firms will likely be needed to develop simple-to-use
    tools that will be broadly accepted by vegetable growers. Acknowledgments The

    technologies (ICT) 1. Introduction Strawberries are one of the most profitable
    crops produced in the south of Spain, specifically in the vicinity of Doñana National
    Park, with an annual yield of 300,000 tons of which 90% is for export. In this
    highly environmentally sensitive region the largest concentration of strawberry
    farms in Europe is found, and the second in the world. The high water demanding
    nature of this crop affects the park’s natural eco-system which has been damaged
    over many years by the draining of the marshes, water abstractions for agriculture,
    water pollution by upriver mining, and the expansion of tourist facilities. Thus,
    the increasing environmental concerns of destination countries has made water
    efficiency a critical requirement for sustainability of the strawberry farming
    sector. Water authorities have developed several regulations that affect the park
    and its surrounding areas (CHG, 2016a, CHG, 2016b, Regional Government of Andalusia,
    2016). One of the purposes of these regulations is to minimize the impact of both
    water abstraction and groundwater pollution by setting the water allowance for
    berries at 4500 m3/ha. The strawberry sector considers this value clearly insufficient.
    On the contrary, the water authorities argue that the maximum yield can be achieved
    with this water allowance, although admitting that local studies are required
    to improve farmers'' irrigation practices and to disseminate new water efficient
    technologies to reduce the volume of both freshwater withdrawal and polluted returns.
    The scheduling and management of irrigation it is not a simple task in strawberries.
    The crop is cultivated in sandy soils where water dynamics are complex. To exacerbate
    the drawbacks of the irrigation process carried out by farmers, the management
    of the irrigation systems is, in most cases, based on the farmer’s experience
    instead of rational basis (use of agro-climatic and soil data). The farmer’s general
    rule is to use inputs as much as possible (e.g. water, fertilizers, pesticides)
    to avoid yield losses, when there are not financial restrictions. Strawberry is
    a very profitable crop despite of its high costs. The inefficiencies detected
    in the irrigation process(García Morillo et al., 2015), have driven the development
    of tools to facilitate farmers the irrigation scheduling. Nowadays the pressure
    exerted on the agricultural sector by public administrations and clients to shift
    production from a focus on quantity to a focus on sustainability and quality is
    increasing. This circumstance is making more difficult the managerial tasks at
    farm scale as well as the demand of reliable information about the whole process
    involved in crop production (Sorensen et al., 2010). For these reasons farmers
    face with a difficult challenge: to carry out a verifiable efficient use of resources
    reducing environmental impacts while maintaining or even increasing their profit.
    To cope with the burden of information fluxes (e.g. monitoring systems, specific
    production guidelines, provisions for environmental compliance), farmers need
    support to handle it. Information and communication technologies, ICT, are the
    base to develop tools to help farmers with their managerial tasks. In the last
    decade a huge amount of works about ICT applications in agriculture and in particular
    in irrigation have been developed at farmer or irrigation district scales (Bartlett
    et al., 2015, Molina-Martínez and Ruiz-Canales, 2009, Sesma et al., 2015). They
    include most of the available technology from local monitoring, remote sensing,
    crop modelling or remote control of the irrigation process (Pulido-Calvo et al.,
    2007). Nonetheless most of these applications are not user friendly, or the variable
    provided (e.g. daily crop water requirements) require additional calculations
    to transform it into useful data, namely management variables (e.g. daily irrigation
    time). In this work we present an ICT based tool, called IrriFresa, to schedule
    and manage irrigation at strawberry farm level using the precision irrigation
    principles. The current version was developed to guide strawberry growers during
    the crop season to apply the required amount of water at and during the right
    time. IrriFresa includes some of the main features of the available irrigation
    ICT’s tools but customized for strawberry (e.g. crop water requirement estimation
    based on agro-climatic information and soil characteristics). Although it has
    several specific features. Thus, the main output variable is the updated daily
    irrigation time during the crop season. This is the key operation variable that
    can be used directly without additional transformation. It is the irrigation controller
    input that can be entered manually or remotely by the farmer. IrriFresa’s main
    innovation is the inclusion of the hydraulic performance of the irrigation system
    in the irrigation time calculation process. The hydraulic performance of an irrigation
    system depends on its layout (pipe distribution, sectoring and sector size), pipe
    diameters, lengths, the working pressure and flow of the emitters (Martín et al.,
    2013). IrriFresa is composed of two software modules: the desktop module where
    the tool is customized for every farm and the main calculations are carried out
    and the mobile module where the updated irrigation times are available for farmers.
    In the following sections a full description of the software is given as well
    as the results of its application in Spanish commercial farms during the 2014/2015
    irrigation season. 2. Methodology IrriFresa is an application designed to support
    irrigation management of strawberries grown in the Southwest of Spain at farm
    scale. In this region, strawberries are cropped in beds covered by a black plastic
    sheet. Initially the crop grows outdoors (from plantation in October to November)
    and later underneath polyethylene tunnels (from December to May). According the
    strawberry variety, the harvest period may be extended from January to May. The
    intensive cultivation of strawberries involves a high water demand to satisfy
    crop water needs (80% of total water demand) as well as for some agronomic practices
    such as soil preparation and plantation. IrriFresa is a multiplataform application
    to calculate application irrigation time during the crop development period based
    on the two software modules shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 3. It combines several methodologies,
    some of them are well described in the scientific literature. Thus, theoretical
    water crop requirements (ETc) are estimated taking into account crop and historical
    climatic data according to Allen et al. (1998). Historical climatic data are obtained
    from public weather stations in the crop production area and they are stored in
    the database ETDB. The ETc calculation procedure has been adapted for crops grown
    outdoor (initial stages of the strawberry cultivation) and indoor (when strawberries
    are covered by plastic tunnels two months after plantation) following the procedure
    suggested by (García Morillo et al., 2015). Additionally, as soil is an important
    factor in the calculation of irrigation times, a selection of the most representative
    soils in the strawberry production area were modelled in Hydrus 2D (Simunek et
    al., 1999) to determine the duration of the irrigation event which minimizes deep
    percolation losses (García Morillo, 2015). Strawberries are usually cultivated
    in beds in sandy soils (typically over 90% of sand), although the variability
    of sand, loam and clay fractions of the soil affects considerably the daily irrigation
    times that may even vary throughout the irrigation sectors within a farm according
    to the soil type. Hence, based on the simulations carried out in Hydrus 2D, IrriFresa
    provides both the duration and the daily number of irrigation events throughout
    the crop season to avoid deep percolation. Download : Download high-res image

    software module. 2.1. Hydraulic analysis at irrigation sector level The hydraulic
    performance of each irrigation sector is considered in the irrigation time calculation
    by the irrigation efficiency index, IE. The hydraulic analysis at irrigation sector
    level, considered as the hydraulic unit that is controlled by one single electrovalve,
    is IrriFresa’s main distinctive feature. The hydraulic simulations are carried
    out at sector level for the common drip irrigation system. In the Spanish production
    area of strawberries the common irrigation emitters are one-year low density polyethylene
    tapes (cheap and easy to setup), although they are not pressure compensating emitters.
    For this reason, plastic tapes are very sensitive to pressure variations that
    provoke flows out of the manufacturer’s design range (García Morillo et al., 2012,
    González Perea et al., 2014). In cases of pressure excess in emitters, the flow
    rates are significantly higher than the nominal flow. On the contrary, in beds
    longer than 50 m, pressure drops dramatically in the end on the plastic tapes
    causing low flow rates. Thus, the information required for the hydraulic analysis
    is: the type of emitter (flow rate and working pressure), distances between emitters,
    sector area and layout of the irrigation system (number and length of the lateral
    pipes). All of these parameters affect the irrigation distribution uniformity
    and consequently IE. Thus, a set of combinations of type of emitters, area of
    the sector (determined by the length and the number of tunnels) and layout of
    the irrigation sector were hydraulically modelled by EPANET (Rossman, 2000), obtaining
    the pressure and flow rate distribution of all the emitters in the typical sectors
    depending on their area and layout of the irrigation system. Then, mean and standard
    deviation (σe) of the flow rate distribution according to each modelled sector
    were calculated. From these values IE (Losada, 1996) was determined by the following
    equation (González Perea et al., 2014): (1) where Hr is the theoretical irrigation
    requirements (mm) and f is the fraction of the irrigation sector without water
    deficit (Eq. (2)): (2) From IE values obtained for each modelled sector, an IE
    database (IEDB) was built. IEDB determines the IE according to emitter type, sector
    area and layout of the irrigation sector. The IEDB size is defined by the number
    of different emitter types and the area of the different modelled irrigation sectors.
    Thus, the multiplatform application can provide customized irrigation scheduling
    for each irrigation sector in a farm by interpolation within IEDB. Irrigation
    time (min day−1) is affected by IE according to the following equation: (3) where
    t is the irrigation time (min); As is the sector area (ha); Fi is the emitter
    flow (l h−1) and e is the total number of emitters in the sector. 2.2. Software
    development The Java programming language has been selected for the development
    of this multiplatform application due to its versatile architecture. It is object-oriented,
    robust, portable multithreaded, secure and with high performance. In the codification
    stage, the Java Standard Development Kit (JDK) 7.0 version has been used due to
    its efficient operation with dynamic data structures. The Mobile Application was
    developed using the Eclipse interface development environment (IDE) and the Android
    software development kit (SDK). The system database (IrriFresa DataBase, IFDB)
    has been developed by SQL programming language. IFDB gets queries from desktop
    software and mobile application via stored procedures (group of transact-SQL statements
    compiled into a single execution plan) and PHP functions, respectively. PHP 5.0
    version was used because of its high safety when a mobile application queries
    an external database. The multiplatform application described in this paper has
    been designed with the aim of providing a functional and easy-to-use tool for
    farmers. It calculates the daily irrigation scheduling per week that maximizes
    the efficiency of water resources taking into account the crop, hydraulic, weather
    and soil conditions of each irrigation sector. IrriFresa consists of two modules:
    desktop software where famers can get a pre-season irrigation scheduling based
    on average climatic data and a mobile application where the initial irrigation
    scheduling is updated according to weather conditions in real-time. Both modules
    are connected by the cloud-database (IFDB). 2.2.1. Desktop software The desktop
    software estimates the daily seasonal irrigation scheduling on the basis of historical
    data recorded in the closest weather station, the crop development stages, the
    hydraulic behaviour of the irrigation network and the soil characteristics. The
    flow chart of the calculation process is given in Fig. 1. Solid dark lines represent
    the input data, solid clear lines identify the computation processes, striped
    clear lines pinpoint the outputs and striped dark lines represent the internal
    databases (ETDB and IEDB). After login into IrriFresa, users have to enter data
    in the sequential order, which is described next: Farm name, farm location (by
    choosing the nearest public weather station) and sector name are entered in the
    first Table Farm location and ETDB database are used to determine the average
    daily ET0 values from the recorded data and compute the theoretical water crop
    requirement, ETc (in l day−1). In the second tab, the user enters the layout of
    irrigation network. Thus, Fig. 2A shows the tab with the general data of the irrigation
    sectors (number of tunnels per irrigation sector (N) and number of different tunnels
    per irrigation sector (M)). The soil type is also introduced in this Table Then,
    as it is shown in Fig. 2B, the hydraulic characteristics of each irrigation tunnel
    are required: bed length (in m), number of beds, bed spacing (in m) and emitter
    flow (in l h−1 m−1) and number of tunnels with the same hydraulic setting. Download

    Graphical interface of desktop software: tabs describing the general data of the
    irrigation sector (a) and the hydraulic setting of each tunnel (b). Using the
    irrigation sector information as well as the hydraulic characteristics of each
    tunnel IrriFresa computes the area (in ha). The IEDB database is used to determine
    the IE of the sector according to the methodology described in Section 2.1. (1)
    The user must introduce crop management data, like crop plantation and plastic
    coverage dates that affect irrigation requirements. Finally, the user has four
    different irrigation scheduling options: a) defined by the user; b) weekly; c)
    monthly and d) automatic scheduling. These irrigation scheduling options are based
    on irrigation periods and working days. Once all required data are entered, the
    desktop software computes the daily irrigation times required to apply the gross
    irrigation requirements throughout the crop growing season. The output of the
    desktop software is the irrigation scheduling of the average irrigation season
    (irrigation min per day and per period defined by the user), stored in the IFDB
    database. Finally, the desktop software provides several download options for
    the irrigation scheduling (xls, xlsx and pdf files). 2.2.2. Mobile application
    The Mobile Application has been developed for mobile devices (smart-phones and
    tablets) that work on the Android operating system (API Level 8 required), although
    it can be extended to other operative systems, such as iOS or Windows Phone. This
    application was developed with the aim to update the irrigation scheduling in
    real time as well as to make easier the access to the daily irrigation times for
    farmers. Fig. 3 shows the flow chart of the Mobile Application. As in Fig. 1,
    solid clear lines identify the computation processes and striped clear lines pinpoint
    the outputs. When the user wants to display the irrigation scheduling, the mobile
    application is connected with the nearest weather station to his/her farm. Then,
    ET0 values are downloaded from this weather station to update the initial irrigation
    scheduling according to the deviations between the real time ET0 values and the
    historical average of the ET0 time series in the period considered (from ETDB).

    for every irrigation sector previously created with IrriFresa desktop software.
    Irrigation scheduling is updated in real time with the actual climatic information
    of the weather station associated with the farm. This tab allows to re-compute
    the irrigation scheduling when the plastic cover is either laid or removed. With
    the aim to avoid deep percolation, the mobile application provides a warning when
    the irrigation time exceeds a certain value. In this case, IrriFresa suggests
    the application of this water by two or more irrigation events. 2.2.3. Database
    architecture The IFDB includes all the necessary information to run the multiplatform
    application and calculate the seasonal irrigation scheduling. IFDB is a relational
    database which consisted of five tables: Tusers, Tfarms, Tsectors, Taprograming,
    Trprograming. Table 1 shows the information stored in each table. Table 1. Stored
    information in IFDB. Table name Stored Information Tusers User name and password

    of IrriFresa in the strawberry area The implementation of a multiplatform application
    for aided irrigation management was considered a suitable mean to support efficient
    water use and strengthen farmers’ engagement with sustainability concerns. The
    IrriFresa beta version was tested by strawberry growers (22% of the strawberry
    production area) during 2014/2015 season. This version was applied as an irrigation
    programming tool to generate customized irrigation scheduling for the commercial
    farms involved in the Coca Cola Foundation’s project, CCFP. Information about
    soil type was not included in the beta version so corrections of irrigation times
    due to the soil type were carried out externally. Irrifresa provides a different
    irrigation scheduling strategy compared to the typical farmer’s behaviour who
    usually apply higher irrigation depths and in longer irrigation pulses (Fig. 5).
    By using IrriFresa farmers changed the irrigation scheduling, which entailed different
    soil moisture distribution, according to the values collected from soil sensors
    installed in the commercial farms. Without IrriFresa management, farmers applied
    longer irrigation events, which meant higher water content at 12, 25 and 40 cm
    after irrigating (Fig. 5a) compared to irrigation scheduling provided by IrriFresa
    (Fig. 5b). Hence, irrigation management with IrriFresa implied significant water
    savings in the commercial farms (Table 2). The water saving ranged from 468.7
    m3 ha−1 (11%) to 1982.6 m3 ha−1 (33%) providing 1.73 Mm3 of water use reduction
    when it was compared with water use recorded in the previous irrigation season
    (Martin-Arroyo et al., 2015a, Martin-Arroyo et al., 2015b). Several strawberry
    samples were collected and analyzed both the management with IrriFresa and management
    by farmers. Thus, it was possible to conclude that yields were not affected and
    no significant differences were found between both irrigation strategies. Download

    5 34 1753.4 27  Total 1223 1416.6 18 The current version of the software, IrriFresa
    1.0 includes the soil permeability class as a key parameter in the irrigation
    sector characterization, so the corrections of the irrigation times related to
    the soil type can be carried out internally. IrriFresa 1.0 is currently applied
    to 4,041 ha (68% of the total production area) (http://proyectoinnocent.blogspot.com.es/).
    Following the water saving trend recorded in 2014/2015 season, for this year additional
    water savings of 1.30 Mm3 are expected in those farms in which IrriFresa 1.0 is
    being used. Several training courses were given during 2014/2015 and 2015/2016
    seasons and farmers were encouraged to use it. The results of the surveys realized
    at the final of each season showed, by one side, the usability of IrriFresa and
    by other side the increase in sensibility of farmers to water use problem in the
    region. In addition, a direct advice during the 2014/2015 and 2015/2016 season
    was carried out.” 4. Conclusions Strawberry cultivation is one of the factors
    that affect the balance of eco-system of Doñana National Park. Although the water
    authorities have developed several regulations to minimize the impact of both
    water abstraction and groundwater pollution, their effective application requires
    support to facilitate farmers the implementation of new water efficient technologies.
    For this reason, a user-friendly application for irrigation scheduling was developed.
    The software IrriFresa 1.0 provides daily customized irrigation scheduling for
    each farm at irrigation sector scale using local meteorological data on real time
    basis, the hydraulic performance of the irrigation network, and the type of soil.
    During 2014/2015 season IrriFresa was used as irrigation scheduling tool in five
    commercial farms that covered 22% of the strawberry production area providing
    1.73 Mm3 of water savings. During the current season IrriFresa is being applied
    in 4041 farms (68% of total production area) with expected savings of 1.30 Mm3.
    In the 2015/2016 season 34 farms received direct advice to IrriFresa (17% of total
    production area). IrriFresa was applied in the 69% of the total production area
    and 3.4% of water savings were achieved over the water savings of the 2014/2015
    season. There is an increasing demand for friendly-use platforms in the agricultural
    sector, like IrriFresa, that should be able to provide relevant information for
    farmers by means of various types of sensors (local and remote). Additionally,
    these applications could be used as reliable traceability records of farm activities,
    what is increasingly demanded by the market. Finally, although IrriFresa is a
    multiplatform application focused on a specific crop, its structure allows to
    be easily adapted to other crops or production conditions. Acknowledgments This

    timing and amount of irrigation water by maximizing the production or benefit
    with different irrigation criteria such as (Broner, 2005; SRINIVASAN, 2006): (1)
    Farmer’s estimates of crop water needs, which results in non-optimal irrigation
    scheduling (irrigating less or more than crop needs during some crop stages) or,
    in other words, lower production or benefit (Levidow et al., 2014), (2) Estimates
    of crop water needs using historical climate data (Perea et al., 2017), (3) Estimates

    or functional (Allen et al., 1998; Doorenbos et al., 1979; Doorenbos and Agriculture
    organization. Rome, 1975) to mechanistic approaches (Van Aelst et al., 1988).

  description: Irrigation consumes between 80 to 90% of total water resources in arid
    regions. Hence, on one hand it plays a vital role in food security in these regions,
    but on the other hand it is depleting their scarce natural water resources. Therefore,
    it is crucial to adopt a mechanism that can preserve the role of irrigation on
    food security, yet with minimal consumption of the already scarce water so that
    it can increase water productivity and conservation. This can be achieved not
    only by adopting proper modern irrigation systems but also by integrating new
    technologies into the effective planning of irrigation schedules so that plants
    can be supplied with efficient water and minimum loss. This vital approach is
    the main aim of this study. This study tests the idea of combining a sensors-based
    method with a simulation and adaptive controller. This idea is introduced on three
    farms using three different types of irrigation systems. One farm is planted by
    date palm and lime tress and irrigated by traditional "Aflaj" irrigation system.
    The second farm is also planted with date palm and lime trees but irrigated by
    modern "drip" irrigation system. The third farm is a fan and pad greenhouse planted
    with tomato and cucumber and irrigated by modern "drip" irrigation system. The
    electronic sensors used includes weather station sensors, crop water requirement
    sensors such as sap flow and leaf water potential meters, and soil properties
    sensors such as soil water content and potential, soil temperature, and electrical
    conductivity. These are used to assess water status and flow through the entire
    continuum of soil, plant and atmosphere. Those were connected to data loggers
    and remote communication via cellular network which added a new dimension to irrigation
    management by enabling near-continuous and near-real-Time remote monitoring that
    contributed substantially in improving irrigation water use.

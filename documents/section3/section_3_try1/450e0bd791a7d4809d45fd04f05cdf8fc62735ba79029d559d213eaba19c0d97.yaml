  description: The development of site-specific water management systems for sprinkler
    irrigation will be a major factor in future efforts to improve the various efficiencies
    of water-use and to support a sustainable irrigated environment. The challenge
    is to develop fully integrated management systems with supporting elements that
    accurately and inexpensively sense within-field variability and then optimally
    control variable-rate water application systems in ways that account for the spatial
    variability affecting water use. Recent advances in sensor and wireless radio
    frequency (RF) technologies have enabled the development of distributed in-field
    sensor-based irrigation systems to support site-specific irrigation management.
    Thus, integration of a decision-making process with a distributed wireless sensor
    network (WSN) and providing real-time input to site-specific controls is a viable
    option. This presentation reviews research on the implementation of in-field micrometeorological
    information that was fed from a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) and
    displayed on a geo-referenced field map in a computer base station. Low-cost Bluetooth
    wireless RF communications from both a distributed WSN and the machine controls
    monitoring of sprinkler status and global positioning system (GPS) location were
    interfaced with a computer base station for processing by a decision support program,
    which updated the instructions to the variable rate irrigation controller for
    real-time site-specific control. The decision support was optimized to adapt changes
    of crop type, irrigation pattern, and field location for instructions for individual
    sprinkler heads on how much water to apply and where. A graphical user interface
    (GUI) with a simple click-and-play menu was used, which allowed growers to remotely
    access field conditions and irrigation status at the home or office via wireless
    RF communications. Â© 2012 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.

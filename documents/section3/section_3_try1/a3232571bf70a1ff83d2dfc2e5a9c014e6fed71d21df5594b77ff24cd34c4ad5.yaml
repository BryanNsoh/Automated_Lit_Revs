    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In Precision farming,
    sensors can be installed in the fields to capture environmental data such as climatic
    data, moisture levels, and information on soil water requirements [1], [2]. Sensor
    data must be transported to a center that processes data for field intervention
    decisions [1], [3]. Sensors actively forward data from other nodes in the routing
    process to the center, which may quickly drain the battery of nodes that relay
    a lot of data [4]. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can assist the data collecting
    process because of the need to cover a large area in precision agriculture [2],
    [5]. Note that the application of UAVs could provide a solution to prolong the
    network lifetime. Since UAVs usually have a limited endurance due to the physical
    constraint of batteries, UAV-assisted data gathering schemes should consider the
    energy consumption of sensors and the maximum flight distance of UAVs as well.
    Practically, UAV-assisted data gathering consists of two main tasks: 1) designing
    clusters wherein the cluster heads (CHs) work as rendezvous nodes to gather data
    from each cluster, 2) determining UAV trajectories for collecting the data at
    the CHs and returning to the base, where the battery of UAVs can be recharged
    or swapped. A good UAV-assisted data-gathering scheme should achieve a trade-off
    between the flying distance of UAVs and the total energy consumption of sensor
    nodes. In this article, we are motivated by the quest for an efficient solution
    for minimizing the sensor-to-sensor energy expense while satisfying an upper limit
    on the travelling distance of each UAV per data collection round. The contributions
    of the article are summarized as follows. We derive a theoretical lower bound
    for the energy consumption of sensors to transport data to cluster heads in uniform
    and plain deployments and prove that the energy consumption of sensors is close
    to the theoretical bound if clusters are balanced regarding energy consumption.
    Therefore, an essential step in proposed heuristic multi-UAV schemes, called Gathering
    data Assisted by Multi-UAV with a BAlanced Clustering (GAMBAC), is to find balanced
    or near-balanced clusters concerning energy consumption. To evaluate the efficiency
    of GAMBAC, we compare the results of GAMBAC and the mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) formulation. For sensor networks with a small number of nodes our heuristic
    algorithms give results close to the MILP formulation. We perform extensive numerical
    investigations and show that the GAMBAC schemes extend network lifetime and requires
    less energy to support a specific number of collection rounds than the best existing
    approach. The rest of this article is organized as follows. We provide a short
    summary of related works in Section II. We describe the operation of a practical
    system with sensor nodes in Section III. We present our theoretical result about
    the lower bound for the energy consumption of a sensor network in Section IV.
    We describe arguments behind the proposed GAMBAC schemes in Section V. We present
    simulation results in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes this article.
    SECTION II. Related Works Data gathering schemes and rendezvous-based protocols
    for wireless sensor networks have drawn a lot of attention for almost two decades.
    Recently, UAVs have been proposed for data collection in large-scale wireless
    sensor networks [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].
    Xing et al. [6] considered a data gathering problem with low-speed mobile elements
    on the ground and proposed the application of rendezvous points so mobile elements
    could collect data from rendezvous points. The authors investigated the minimum-energy
    rendezvous point and considered the constraint of mobile element paths (e.g.,
    mobile elements could only move along the routing tree). Several essential aspects
    (energy consumption, data collection deadline, UAVs'' limited endurance, etc.)
    are related to the application of UAVs in wireless sensor networks. Since UAVs
    usually have a limited endurance due to the physical constraint of batteries,
    the UAV completion time for data gathering and flying should be considered as
    in [9]. Zhan and Zeng [10] investigated a trade-off between the aerial cost, which
    is defined by the propulsion energy consumption and the operation cost of UAVs,
    and the ground cost. Wu et al. [11] also considered a data collection with multiple
    collectors, where a genetic algorithm was proposed to design ME paths so the delay
    constraint could be met. Ebrahimi et al. [12] studied the data collection problem
    with one UAV as a data collector and proposed a heuristic algorithm for clustering,
    selection of head nodes, and construction of routing trees. Alfattani et al. [13]
    investigated using multiple UAVs to collect data from clusters and applied genetic
    algorithms to solve optimization problems. According to Ghdiri et al. [14] there
    exist 1) offline scenarios where the network and the coverage area are fixed and
    known ahead, and hence the UAV trajectories can be preplanned ahead, and 2) online
    scenarios where IoT sensors are mobile and so offline path planning becomes unpractical
    (applications such as wildlife monitoring and intelligent transportation systems).
    For UAVs deployment, energy-efficient trajectory design is required, either in
    the offline scenarios where the system''s status is available beforehand or in
    the online scenarios where no or limited information is available for the UAV''s
    mission. The offline scenarios correspond to applications for dedicated or private
    IoT networks, where the IoT system architecture is static and changes occasionally.
    A comprehensive survey on trajectory schemes is provided in [15]. To our best
    knowledge, Konstantopoulos et al. [16] have proposed the best method (Convex-Hull
    based Protocol—CHP) to design ME tours until now. The CHP starts with choosing
    initial UAV paths based on convex hulls, which can cover the nodes at the furthest
    distance from the center. Then, it improves the initial paths using a simulated-annealing
    approach. This article also considers a data-gathering problem with mobile elements.
    We derive the lower-bound limit on the energy consumption of sensors and establish
    that the energy consumption approaches the lower bound if clusters have the same
    energy consumption, which has not been found in the literature to our best knowledge.
    We design GAMBAC schemes to establish either energy-consumption-balanced or near-balanced
    clusters to satisfy the flying constraint. In addition, we show that our algorithms
    outperform the CHP method. SECTION III. Cooperation of Wireless Sensor Nodes and
    the Operation Centre We deal with a precision agriculture scenario, where farmers
    deploy N sensors to collect the soil moisture levels of specific points in a large
    area for growing crops. Cloud computing is applied in an operation center to host
    an agricultural decision-making support system [1], [3]. Information about the
    position of each sensor node is available for decision-making. The operation center
    and sensor nodes cooperatively control a topology creation [17], [18] (i.e., determine
    directional links between sensor nodes) during the operation to form an ad hoc
    network. The moisture levels of N points should be transported to the operation
    center periodically by the end of each period of T max seconds. The operation
    center processes data to control water pumps and sprays in the crop production
    area. There are several alternatives for transmitting and transporting data to
    the processing center: a) sensors directly send data to the center, b) sensor
    nodes cooperate in an ad hoc sensor network to transport data to the center, c)
    UAVs are used along with an ad hoc sensor network to convey data to the center.
    Alternatives a) and b) may quickly drain the battery of nodes that relay a lot
    of data [4]. Consequently, those monitoring nodes die, and there will be no monitoring
    data, which may prevent the correct determination of decisions for efficient irrigation
    control. In this article, we deal with alternative c), which is motivated by a
    need to cover a large area in precision agriculture because the application of
    UAVs could provide a solution to prolong the working time of deployed sensors
    [9], [19], [20]. We focus on the application M UAV, each UAV could fly with a
    constant speed v 0 (m/s) at an altitude of H meters and the maximum flight distance
    of ℓ max . The deployment illustration is presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. Sensor
    network with the clusters, CH nodes, and the flight paths of four UAVs that are
    determined at the beginning of each round by the operation center. Show All The
    data collection process is performed as follows in each round. Fig. 2. Planar
    Voronoi diagram with the seed elements consisting of the set of points S P ={
    O 0 , O 1 ,…, O q } and the set of open line segments S L ={ O 0 O 1 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ , O 1 O 2 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ,…, O q O 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ } . Show All The operation center selects cluster head (CH) nodes, plans
    the assignment of sensors to CH nodes, and determines the data forwarding tree
    (DFT) of each CH node and computes the ℓ max -constrained UAV trajectories (see
    Fig. 1). The operation center broadcasts information to sensor nodes about the
    selection of CH nodes and the routing information (e.g., DFTs). The operation
    center sends the UAVs to flight along the planned trajectory. Each UAV trajectory
    is represented by a closed polyline O 0 O 1 … O q O 0 , where O 0 is the sink
    location and O i,1≤i≤q is the intermediate turning points (cluster heads) in Fig.
    2. Sensor nodes transmit measured data and energy consumption information to the
    assigned CH following the routing path in an ad hoc wireless sensor network during
    each data collection period. CH waits for an associated UAV to hover above its
    position and transmits the aggregated data to the UAV. The operation center makes
    decisions based on information about the location of sensors, and the energy consumption
    of each node due to the transmitting activity and the actual energy level of a
    battery in sensor nodes. The information about the energy consumption is encoded
    and sent with monitoring data to the processing center. If packet loss happens,
    the energy consumption information is estimated from the past data. SECTION IV.
    Lower-Bound of the Energy Consumption In this section, we introduce some notations
    for the formalized problem description, then we present a proposition on the lower
    bound of the energy consumption of nodes. Let G=(V,Ξ) denote the network graph,
    where V={ s 1 ,…, s N } is the set of sensor nodes and Ξ denotes the set of direct
    wireless links that can be feasibly established between sensor node-pairs. That
    is, the distance between u and v , ( u,v∈V ), is smaller than the sensor maximum
    radio transmission range ( R ). Definition 1 (Clusters): For graph G=(V,Ξ) , Clustering
    C(G,K)={ V 1 ,…, V K ,H} describes the partition of sensor nodes into K separate
    sets V k ⊂V of nodes and the selection of a cluster head node ( c h k ) for each
    set (cluster), k=1…K , where H={c h 1 ,…,c h K } is the set of cluster head nodes
    and ∪ K l=1 C l =V . Definition 2 (Data Forwarding Tree): Nodes in cluster k send
    and forward data along Data Forwarding Tree (DFT) T k ( C k , Ξ k ) to c h k ,
    ( k=1…K ), where Ξ k ( Ξ k ⊂Ξ ) is the set of edges in cluster k . Let T={ T 1
    ,…, T K } denote the set of DFTs for clustering C(G,K) . Let E 0 i denote the
    initial energy, and E r i be the energy at the start of the rth round of sensor
    node s i . Let E Rx = E RX0 and E Tx i,j = E TX0 +ϑ d 2 ij be the energies for
    receiving and transmitting one bit from s i to s j , ( i,j=1,…,N ), where d i,j
    is the Euclidean distance between s i and s j , ϑ is a parameter depending on
    the circuit and the antenna of a sensor. Let ι(i,C(G,K)) be the index of the next
    node in the data forwarding path of sensor node s i toward its cluster head. We
    denote E Tx i0 = E TX0 +ϑ H 2 as the per-bit transmission energy from SN s i to
    a UAV. Hence, if s i has to forward its own b i bits and relay B i,C(G,K) bits
    from its child nodes to the next node s ι(i,C(G,K)) in its data forwarding tree,
    then the amount of energy consumed in s i is e i,C(G,K) = E Rx B i,C(G,K) + E
    Tx i,ι(i,C(G,K)) ( B i,C(G,K) + b i ) (1) View Source and the residual energy
    of s i after the rth round is E (r+1),i = E (r),i − e i,C,H . (2) View Source
    Definition 3: A uniform deployment evenly distributes identical sensors in a specific
    area. Definition 4: A plain deployment divides an area into multiple subareas.
    In each subarea, an uniform deployment is carried out with homogeneous sensors.
    That is, a network in the plain setting consists of multiple regions and each
    node collects the same amount of data during one round. Proposition 1: (Lower
    bound of the energy consumption of sensors to transport data to CHs) In each round,
    the energy consumption of sensors E S2S = ∑ N i=1 e i,C(G,K) for the transportation
    of data to CHs satisfies the following in-equations: E S2S >B= c S 2 total ℓ max
    if a sensor network is with the uniform deployment and S total is the area covered
    by the sensor network, where E R = E RX (1)+ E TX (1,R) is the total energy consumption
    of receiving and transmitting a unit of data over the maximum radio range R ,
    ϱ is the density of a sensor deployment, and c= ϱ E R R , ℓ max is the maximum
    length of UAV trajectories. E S2S >B= c( ∑ K i=1 ς i √ S i ) 2 ℓ max if a sensor
    network consists of separate convex regions A i ,i=1,…,K , each region has area
    of S i . Each sensor node located inside A i collects the same amount of data
    ς i during one round. The total energy consumption approaches the lower bound
    if clusters are energy-consumption-balanced. The proof is provided in the Appendix.
    SECTION V. Proposed Algorithms Based on the theoretical result, we propose heuristic
    algorithms for the operation center to select cluster heads and a clustering,
    and plan the path for UAVs in each data collecting period. A. GAMBAC- α —Toward

    max. number of random searches for clusters whose number is larger than K 17:
    nretr++ 18: go to 5 19: end if 20: end if 21: return H Intuitively, the larger
    the number ( K ) of clusters is, the smaller the energy is consumed to transport
    data to cluster heads. Note that the number of clusters is upper bounded by a
    threshold depending on ℓ max . According to Proposition 1, the total energy consumption
    approaches the lower bound if clusters are energy-consumption-balanced. Therefore,
    algorithm GAMBAC- α tries to reach this goal through obtaining the largest number
    of clusters so the data volume of each cluster is almost the same and UAVs could
    fly without violating the endurance limit. Procedure GAMBAC- α through the execution
    of GAMBAC( G,M, ℓ max ,0,N , Select_CHs- α ) repeatedly divides interval (low,high)=(0,N)
    to search for the largest possible value of K . In the loop, procedure SelectCHs-
    α ( G,K ) (Algorithm 2) chooses set H with K cluster heads so the largest cluster
    still has a total data volume that does not exceed 1+ϵ times the average data
    amount. During the selection, the probability of a SN being chosen as CH is proportional
    to its residual energy, i.e., the nodes with higher energy are given more priority
    to become a CH, which prolongs the network lifetime. Procedure SelectCHs- α (
    G,K ) (Algorithm 2) consists of two tasks: 1) add new CHs; and 2) adjust the current
    H by growing data forwarding trees (i.e., clusters) and then removing the smallest
    ones (as inefficient). The first task gradually selects a new CH from the set
    of available nodes V G ∖ V T that contains all SNs outside the current DFT forest.
    The second task rebuilds the DFT tree, and this is done by utilizing Grow ( G,H
    ). The Grow operation (Algorithm 3) returns subgraph ( V T , E T ) representing
    a DFT forest, where the volume of data in each DFT (or respective cluster) does
    not exceed W=(1+ε) totalVolume K . If the number of DFTs/clusters is larger than
    K (for example, when there is a few insufficient, small clusters), the cluster
    heads of these small clusters are removed from H (line 14 of Algorithm 2) and
    SelectCHs- α ( G,K ) keeps searching for better positioned CHs (based on random
    selection). Note that the maximum number of searches is limited. Otherwise, SelectCHs-
    α ( G,K ) returns H . Algorithm 3: Grow ( G,H ). Input: Graph G=(V,E) ; H the
    set of CHs Output: V T : the set of sensor nodes could participate in clusters

    19: v.CH←u.CH 20: end if 21: while E C ≠∅ 22: return V T , E T Procedure Grow
    ( G,H ) (Algorithm 3) computes K data forwarding trees for K CH nodes by using
    an algorithm similar to the parallel Dijkstra algorithm [21] for constructing
    graph Voronoi diagrams. For each node c h i , a DFT rooted at c h i is gradually
    grown by adding the closest available nodes. Node u is added if it is the node
    closest to the current “forest” (union of all the current DFTs) and, of course,
    is added to c h i ’s DFT for being the DFT nearest to it. The growth of each DFT
    must stop before exceeding the predetermined threshold (set at c h i .dataVolume
    ). Procedure Grow ( G,H ) produces complete Voronoi sets which are ϵ -balanced.
    Procedure MultipleTSP ( s 0 ,H,M ) based on an travel-salesmen algorithm [22]
    to find the the appropriate set S Π of trajectories (of M available UAVs). At
    the end of the main loop of GAMBAC, if the length of trajectories is below the
    limit ℓ max , then it searches for a larger K (further reduce the total energy
    consumption). Otherwise, the search range set by letting high be mid. Algorithm

    Residual Energy Among All Sensor Nodes Inspired by Proposition 1, our GAMBAC-
    α has been designed to keep balancing the size of the clusters (and, consequently,
    the communication workloads per cluster). However, GAMBAC- α may perform poorly
    in deployments with different amounts of monitoring data. In this section, we
    improve our solution with a subtle strategy. An improved version called GAMBAC-
    β has the same code base as GAMBAC- α (i.e., through the execution of GAMBAC (
    G,M, ℓ max ,0,100 , Select_CHs- β )). Here the idea is to keep balancing the ratio
    between the required workload and the residual energy of the CH. Instead of balancing
    “data volume,” we switch to “energy expense in fraction” (denoted by p in Algorithm
    4). For a predetermined fraction value p , clusters are formed so that the energy
    expenditure per each cluster is, at most, a fraction p of the current capacity
    (procedure Select_CHs- β in Algorithm 4). The tune-up phase seeks to find the
    minimum value of p so that the density of CHs is still low enough for M UAVs to
    sufficiently travel, picking up harvested data (each spans a distance no longer
    than ℓ max ). In each step, Select_CHs- β recruits the node with the largest residual
    energy outside the current DFT forest to set H . To restrict the percentage of
    energy expenditure per CH below fraction p , the max data volume of CH u is set
    to be p 100 × u.residualEnergy E RX (1)+ E TX (1) , where E RX (1)+ E TX (1) is
    the total energy spent for receiving and transmitting a unit of data to a UAV.
    Other than that, the remaining details are similar to in SelectCHs- α , where
    notably Grow ( G,H ) is repeatedly performed to extend the DFT forest upon a new
    CH recruit. C. GAMBAC- γ Through the execution of GAMBAC ( G,M, ℓ max ,0,100 ,
    Select_CHs- γ ) we get GAMBAC- γ . The only difference between GAMBAC- β and GAMBAC-
    γ is the setting of the probability of selecting a node to be a cluster head.
    Function Select_CHs- γ picks up a random node from V G ∖ V T with probability
    proportional to its residual energy (as in GAMBAC- α ) and inserts it to the set
    of CHs. SECTION VI. Numerical Results A. GAMBAC Versus Reference Results We have
    performed a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the problem
    as well. Then, we use CPLEX to get optimal (reference) results for scenarios with
    parameters listed in Table I. Note that the computational complexity of MILP is
    O( N 3 ) (proportionally to the number of nodes), so we can only get reference
    results with CPLEX for networks with a maximum of 50 nodes. TABLE I Parameter
    Settings Two scenarios with four UAVs were investigated. Sensor nodes are randomly
    deployed in the scenarios. Each UAV has a flying limit of 200 m, and each sensor
    node has the initial energy of 50 J and generates the same amount of 64 Kb of
    data per round. In the comparison, ϑ is computed using an energy consumption presented
    in [23]. From Table II, we can observe that after 50 rounds the node with minimum
    remaining energy still has 78.35% and 69.65% of its capacity with the MILP-based
    solution and GAMBAC- α , respectively. The MILP-based solution took 30 min for
    computations per round, while GAMBAC- α needed 0.35 s. TABLE II Comparison Between
    the MILP-Based Solution and GAMBAC- α B. Performance of Heuristic Algorithms In
    this section, we compare the Convex-Hull based Protocol (CHP) [16] (which has
    been the best existing approach so far) with three proposed schemes: GAMBAC- α
    ”, GAMBAC- β and GAMBAC- γ . Note that CHP also carries out the cluster configuration
    and the computation of UAV trajectories at the sink node. Assume that farmers
    deploy sensors (like [24]) in an area of 3000m×3000m to collect soil moisture
    measurements for irrigation management. Two scenarios are investigated: Scenario
    1 represents a case where there is no hole in the area, and the sensor data rate
    fluctuates between 8 and 64 kbits/s. Scenario 2 is an example where the area has
    a big hole but is plain elsewhere, and the data rate (DR) is not fixed over time
    (can fluctuate from 8 to 64 Kb/SN). The DR is relatively high on the far away
    side of the hole, near the border, where the rate is 52 Kb/SN (emergency rate),
    but is the same pattern anywhere else (8-64 Kb/SN). Assume the sensor network
    should support the specific number of rounds (e.g., depending on the length of
    a planting season and the need for collecting data), we plot a battery energy
    level required in each sensor in Figs. 4 and 6. Note that the battery level depicted
    in the y-axis of Figs. 4 and 6. We observe that GAMBAC β is the best scheme for
    saving energy consumption. For example, to support 200 rounds, the GAMBAC- β scheme
    needs the batter of only 32 J for each sensor node, while GAMBAC- γ , CHP and
    GAMBAC- α require the battery of 40, 41, and 50 J, respectively. The phenomenon
    is understandable from the histogram of the residual energy of nodes at a specific
    round (e.g., 464) plotted in Fig. 5. Compared to other schemes, GAMBAC- β utilizes
    energy most efficiently. Sensor nodes have the highest level of residual energy
    and the status of the smallest energy after each round is highest. Similar observations
    are obtained in Scenario 2 as well (see Fig. 7). Note that GAMBAC- β outperforms
    other schemes in all the scenarios with different deployments of sensor nodes
    in a geographic area. Fig. 3. Deployment of sensors in two scenarios. (a) Scenario
    1. (b) Scenario 2. Show All Fig. 4. Number of rounds versus required battery energy

    algorithms (Scenario 2). Show All Fig. 7. Histogram and the standard deviation
    σ of SN residual energy at round 211 (Scenario 2). Show All The CHP solution is
    a geometric approach, where the sink is at the center of the area with multiple
    sectors of similar weights. The geometric approach works well when the network
    area has a simple shape (continuous without any void), and the observed data volume
    distributes evenly over the network. However, if the network has a complicated
    shape (with void regions) and the data volume observed at the sensors varies,
    this geometric approach could not produce good results. From our experiments,
    CHP performs well in the first scenario (simple shape network), but poorly in
    the second (with a void and unequal distribution of observed data). SECTION VII.
    Conclusion We have proposed joint clustering & multi-UAV gathering schemes to
    extend network lifetime. Our heuristic (GAMBAC) algorithms give a result close
    to the MILP approach and are efficiently applied for a network of large sizes.
    Numerical results showed that our algorithms outperform existing proposals. In
    all the scenarios, GAMBAC- β requires significantly less initial energy to support
    the specific number of data collection rounds than the CHP algorithm. In future
    work, we will investigate randomization techniques to select cluster head nodes
    and algorithms to facilitate searching for the optimal number of clusters. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    multiple regions by constructing a planar Voronoi diagram with the seed elements
    consisting of the set of points S P ={ O 0 , O 1 ,…, O q } and the set of open
    line segments S L ={ O 0 O 1 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ , O 1 O 2 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯
    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ,…, O q O 0 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ } . Fig. 2 illustrates such Voronoi
    partition, where the Voronoi region of a point in S P is gray in color, while
    the remaining parts are Voronoi regions of the line segments in S L . For a node
    u , let ψ u be the point or line segment whose Voronoi region contains s u . It
    is straightforward to see that the Euclide distance between s u and its CH cannot
    be less than the distance between s u and ψ u , which is denoted as d( s u , ψ
    u ) (see Fig. 2). According to [25], the most energy efficient way for delivering
    data over a distance d( s u , ψ u ) is to take ν u =⌈ d( s u , ψ u ) R ⌉ hops
    with equal distance of d( s u , ψ u ) ν u , where ⌈.⌉ denotes the ceiling function.
    Let f u be the S2S energy consumption for delivering data from source s u to its
    CH. Then, we have f u ≥ ν u [ E RX (1)+ E TX (1, d( s u , ψ u ) ν u )] ≥ ν u [
    E RX0 + E TX0 +ϑ ( d( s u , ψ u ) ν u ) 2 ]. (3) View Source Lemma 1: If R t,t+1

    ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ | is the length of O t O t+1 ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ . Proof:
    We apply the Riemann summation to approximate an integral. Namely, we divide the
    Voronoi region into χ= ℓ t,t+1 / Δ x rectangles, each with equal width Δ x as
    illustrated in Fig. 8. Then for a rectangle Rec t i with height y i , we further
    divide it into J=⌈ y i R ⌉ subrectangles, where the first J−1 has height of R
    and the last has height of y i R −J+1 (see Fig. 8). As analyzed above, we can
    assert that a SN s u located in the j th subrectangle Subrec t j has the hop distance
    to its CH of at least ⌈ d( s u , ψ u ) R ⌉ , which is equal to j . Thus, we have
    ∑ s u ∈Subrec t j f u ≥ ∑ s u ∈Subrec t j j[ E RX0 + E TX0 +ϑ ( d( s u , ψ u )

    (RS) based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms has become a regular tool
    in precision agriculture (PA) for efficient data collection from large areas of
    farm fields. Widely used UAV-based sensing systems for agricultural applications
    include cameras with different spectral bands, such as RGB (red, green, and blue),
    multispectral, hyperspectral, and thermal cameras, as well as light detection
    and ranging (LiDAR) sensors. The UAV-based sensing systems have been used in different
    PA applications, such as weed and disease detection, vegetation growth and health
    monitoring, yield estimation, and irrigation management (Tsouros et al., 2019).
    When compared to other RS platforms such as satellites and manned aircrafts, UAV-based
    sensing systems are lower in cost, more friendly in operation, and flexible in
    data acquisition time and altitude. Furthermore, UAV-based sensing systems can
    collect data at high spatial and temporal resolution, have high image quality,
    and provide immediate access (Vega et al., 2015, Xie and Yang, 2020, Yang et al.,
    2017). Meanwhile, as compared to ground-based sensing platforms, UAV-based sensing
    systems are less time-consuming for fine-scale use and do not cause crop damage
    or soil compaction (Xie and Yang, 2020). The key factors for the successful implementation
    of PA technology include accurate site-specific information collection and timely
    decision making (Delavarpour et al., 2021). Site-specific information from UAV-based
    sensing systems usually relies on geo-referencing of UAV images by one of two
    methods: 1) aerial triangulation (AT) using ground control points (GCPs) or 2)
    direct geo-referencing (DG) based on the position and orientation measurements
    of the capturing camera (Rabah et al., 2018). Nowadays, the DG method based on
    the UAV onboard global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver is widely used,
    and location accuracy can be improved by using real-time kinematic (RTK) technology.
    For instance, a previous study showed root mean square error (RMSE) for total
    horizontal errors (easting and northing) of 0.843, 0.034 m, and 0.032 m for non-RTK
    UAV data processed via DG, non-RTK UAV data processed with GCPs, and RTK UAV data
    (Hugenholtz et al., 2016). However, RTK-GNSS is usually expensive (Obanawa et
    al., 2019) and installing sufficient GCPs in fields is a time-consuming, non-real
    time operation. Further, the exercise is sometimes difficult or impossible in
    certain field conditions (Štroner et al., 2021). This could occur, for example,
    when crops are very tall or the canopy has completely closed, when soil is very
    wet, or under narrow-row cropping systems. Moreover, the position accuracy when
    using GCPs depends on the configuration and number of GCPs used throughout the
    field (Sanz-Ablanedo et al., 2018). The conventional method of processing UAV
    images usually requires a substantial image overlap (about 75%) to construct orthomosaic
    images of study fields (Tsouros et al., 2019), which results in low efficiency
    in data collection (more flight passes and slower speed). This is especially noticeable
    for UAV data collected with low altitude (≤20 m) to provide sufficient resolution
    for small crop plants at early stages (Feng et al., 2020a, Vong et al., 2021).
    The collected images are then processed using commercial UAV image processing
    software such as Agisoft Metashape (Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg, Russia) or Pix4D
    mapper (Pix4D S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland), a process that may require from hours
    to days depending on the size of field, number of images, and image resolution
    (Feng et al., 2020a). In addition, the process of image stitching may require
    extensive computational resources and may cause a substantial delay for field
    decision making (Feng et al., 2020a, Xiang and Tian, 2011). Furthermore, orthomosaic
    images may contain image artifacts and distortions caused by image scenes, lighting
    conditions, camera parameters, flight plans (height, speed, and overlaps), and
    processing parameters (Gross and Heumann, 2016, Iglhaut et al., 2019). These issues
    can degrade the image quality and result in inaccurate results from image post-processing,
    such as for vegetation indices (VI) and canopy cover calculations. Post-image
    processing uses additional software such as Matlab, ArcGIS, and QGIS (Tsouros
    et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2017), which further increases complexity and time
    for data processing (Tsouros et al., 2019). Since consumer-grade UAV imaging systems
    are widely used in research and for these, RTK GNSS is generally not available.
    Therefore, a more cost-effective solution for timely image processing and real-time
    decision making is greatly needed. A previous study by Feng at al. (2020a) developed
    an efficient imagery data processing and analysis framework for timely evaluation
    of cotton emergence using a UAV-based imaging system and deep learning (DL) technology.
    The study introduced an approach of directly processing individual image frames
    rather than generating orthomosaic images, which can reduce the processing time
    and prevent image quality degradation. This framework was successfully tested
    for estimating and mapping cotton emergence (stand count and canopy size) with
    a position accuracy of 1.72 m ± 1.37 m (mean ± standard deviation). However, the
    position accuracy was not satisfactory to acquire site-specific information for
    research in PA. Since conventional plant row spacing of row crops such as cotton,
    corn, and soybean ranges from 0.76 to 1.02 m (Clawson et al., 2006, Elmore and
    Abendroth, 2007, Robinson and Conley, 2007), position accuracy should be improved
    to better than 0.38 – 0.51 m (half of the common row spacings) to generate a more
    accurate and reliable field mapping. This study aimed to develop a real-time image
    processing pipeline to process individual UAV images for improved position accuracy.
    The developed pipeline was then used to create emergence maps for cotton and corn
    at field scale to demonstrate its application. Moreover, the position accuracy
    was compared with the method from previous study to evaluate the performance of
    the developed method. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. UAV imaging system A UAV imaging
    system (Phantom 4 Advanced, DJI, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China) was used to collect
    high resolution RGB images in cotton and corn fields. The resolution of the onboard
    RGB camera was set to 4864 × 3648 pixels, resulting in the calculated spatial
    resolution of 3.0 mm pixel−1 at 10 m above ground level (AGL). Images were taken
    sequentially for both fields at 0.5 frames per second (fps) at a flight height
    of 10 m and flight speeds of 7.5 and 7.2 km h−1 for the cotton and corn field,
    respectively. The UAV flight trajectory and flight parameters were set using the
    control apps Autopilot (Hangar Technology, Austin, TX, USA) or Litchi (VC Technology
    ltd, London, U.K.). The image overlaps in both the sideward and forward directions
    were about 60 – 75 %. During aerial image data collection, the onboard GNSS system
    on the UAV continuously recorded the coordinates and altitude of the imaging system
    and provided geo-referencing for each image as part of the image metadata. Geo-referenced
    images were downloaded after the flight for further processing. 2.2. Experimental
    fields and configurations 2.2.1. Cotton field The cotton field was a research
    field located at the Fisher Delta Research, Extension and Education Center of
    the University of Missouri in the upper portion of the Mississippi River Delta
    region near Portageville, MO, USA (36.411° N, 89.696° W). The field has dimensions
    of 315 m (north–south, NS) × 150 m (east–west, E-W). The cotton cultivar PHY 320
    WRF (Dow Agrosciences, Indianapolis, IN) was planted on bedded soil using a John
    Deere 1700 (Deere & Co., Moline, IL, USA) planter on May 15, 2019. The field was
    seeded in a NS direction at a target seeding rate of 136,000 seeds ha−1 with a
    row spacing of 0.97 m. This resulted in a total of 152 crop rows. Most of the
    cotton emerged by May 22, 2019 and the UAV images were collected on May 31, 2019
    [16 days after planting (DAP)]. Ground truth and reference data including GCPs,
    stand count and seedling size, were collected on the day of the UAV flight. In
    this study, 28 GCPs (Fig. 1) were set in the field, including 16 fence posts (∼1.1
    m in height) each with a white-black polytechnic board (30 × 30 cm) on the top
    and 12 quadrats (53 × 53 cm) made with half-inch polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes.
    Two different types of GCP were used to mark different sampling methods for assessment
    of cotton stand count. A ground stake that could be recognized during the growing
    season (Fig. 1c) was placed at each GCP to mark its position so that the GCP could
    be placed at the same locations for each data collection. A RTK survey kit (REACH
    RS+, Emlid ltd., Saint Petersburg, Russia) with a ReachView app (Emlid ltd.) was
    used to obtain the coordinates of the 28 GCPs. At each GCP, six flags were used
    to mark six 1-m intervals of crop seedlings in two cotton rows as shown in Fig.
    1a and Fig. 1b. The number of seedlings in each 1-m interval was counted manually
    to serve as ground truth data for the stand count estimation. Meanwhile, a tape
    measure with a precision scale of 1 mm was placed along the cotton rows. A digital
    camera on a cell phone (iPhone 6 s, Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) was used to
    take videos of the crop rows while being held manually at a height of about 0.5
    m AGL with the camera facing down. Cotton stands were counted by playing back
    the videos and canopy size (top view) was calculated by comparing the scales of
    the tape measure and number of image pixels. Download : Download high-res image

    MO, USA (38.946° N 92.133° W) with dimensions of 160 m (NS) by 49 m (E-W). The
    field was planted with corn hybrid Pioneer 0589 (Corteva Agriscience, Wilmington,
    DE, USA) on April 20, 2020 using a custom-built four-row planter equipped with
    MaxEmerge XP row units (Deere & Co., Moline, IL, USA) at a 0.76-m row spacing.
    Four planting depth treatments (3.8, 5,1, 6.4, and 7.6 cm) with two replications
    were implemented to create different emergence dates. Each replication of each
    planting depth had eight rows (6.1 m) of corn along the NS direction of the field
    resulting in a total of 64 corn rows. Seeds were planted at the four defined depths
    at a seeding rate of 81,500 seeds ha−1, which was equivalent to an average plant
    intra-row seed spacing of 16 cm. Five monitoring sites were marked with flags
    for ground data collection with each site consisting of two adjacent corn rows
    6.0 m long (Fig. 2). Corn emergence was checked daily, and colored stakes were
    used to mark the newly emerged plants for each day. The first and last emergence
    checks in the monitoring sites were 2 and 12 May of 2020 (12 and 22 DAP). The
    same RTK survey kit with the ReachView app was used to obtain the GPS coordinates
    of the monitoring sites (a flag at one side of the monitoring site was used as
    the GCP). There was a total of five GCPs. The UAV aerial image data was collected
    on 22 May 2020, which was 32 DAP or 20 days after first emergence. This resulted
    in most plants at the site between vegetative growth stage V2 to V4. Then, plant
    spacing (PS) was measured using a tape measure on 15 June 2020 (56 DAP). Download

    development Fig. 3 illustrates the summary workflow of the image pre-processing
    and image processing pipeline to establish location information for single images.
    The collected images were pre-processed using decorrelation stretch to enhance
    the images and standard Hough transform (SHT) to rotate the images for crop row
    detection and ground sample distance (GSD) determination of each image with the
    detailed procedures described in Feng et al. (2020a, Fig. 3 dashed box). Inside
    the dotted box of Fig. 3 are the procedures of the image processing pipelines
    developed in the present study that improved position accuracy of single image
    frames compared to the methods of Feng et al (2020a). The first three procedures
    (symbols highlighted in blue) were modified based on previous customized image
    alignment and stitching algorithms described in Feng, et al. (2020b), focusing
    on image feature identification and matching followed by removal of false matches.
    The remaining three procedures (symbols highlighted in yellow) were added in this
    study to assign position information of each single image based on E-W (crop rows)
    and NS (position in each crop row) translations. The position information of images
    was then used to develop site-specific maps for parameters of interest (e.g.,
    stand count, canopy size, emergence date). Feng et al. (2020b) generated an orthomosaic
    image based on the matched features of the images for the whole field using post-processing
    method after data collection, which was time consuming. On the other hand, the
    image processing pipeline in this study aligned crop rows using single image frames
    (without image mosaicking) for the whole field, which improved the efficiency
    and made near real-time processing possible. The details of the image processing
    pipeline for single image frames (Fig. 3 dotted box) are described in the following
    sections. Download : Download high-res image (463KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Workflow of image pre-processing (dashed line box) and image processing
    pipeline (dotted line box) in this study. 2.3.1. Feature detection and matching
    Image features were detected using the method of Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF),
    a 128-dimension (8 orientation bins for each of the 4 × 4 location bins) local
    feature detector, and a descriptor (Bay et al., 2008). As a scale-invariant feature,
    SURF used image pyramids and different sized box filters to find points of interest
    at different scale spaces (Lowe, 2004). The scale space of SURF was divided into
    octaves and each octave was subdivided into a constant number of scale levels.
    The number of pyramid octaves and octave layers were both set to three in this
    study as suggested by Lowe (2004). After feature detection, the k-nearest neighbors
    (KNN) algorithm was used to match the most similar feature pairs in two successive
    images. The KNN calculated all the Euclidean distances of features to find the
    closest K matches. In this study, K was set to 2 (K = 2) so that the algorithm
    would return the two closest key points for each key point to be matched. 2.3.2.
    Removal of false matches False matches, i.e., the pixels that had the shortest
    Euclidean distance but were different objects in the successive images, would
    occur and needed to be removed. Two methods were used sequentially to remove these
    false matches: 1) distance ratio test; 2) matching line slope and length ratio
    test. The distance ratio test was performed using Eq. (1): (1) where, D1 and D2
    are the Euclidean distance of the closest key point and second-closest key point
    identified by KNN; R is the ratio selected by a trial-and-error approach. It was
    assumed that D1 came from the same object as the key point to be matched, while
    D2 came from another object, which could be noise. The distance ratio test then
    tested whether D1 was sufficiently different from D2 to decide it was a false
    match. If the difference was small, D1 could also represent noise. As suggested
    by Lowe (2004), R > 0.80 was initially used to remove all the false matches and
    less correct matches. However, this ratio still kept some false matches in this
    study, and the ratio was adjusted to R > 0.65 to remove all the false matches.
    The images were collected on a relatively calm day (wind speed ≤ 4 m s−1) and
    the UAV was flown parallel to the ground with minimum variations in roll and pitch.
    In our experiments, variations in UAV yaw angle were noticed and therefore the
    images were pre-processed (as described in Feng et al, 2020a) to align the crop
    rows. However, there was no substantial variation in angles to crop rows between
    two successive images since the heading variation was small during the acquisition
    of two images (2 s). Therefore, the correct matches were expected to have similar
    slopes and length. Hence, by calculating the slopes and lengths of matching lines
    using Eq. (2), (3), the ratio of the slope and the length of one matching line
    to the mean value of all matching lines in two successive images would be close
    to 1. (2) (3) where, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of a key point
    and its matching point in two successive images. Those matches with a large ratio
    difference from other matches were false matches and were removed by using the
    thresholds of < 0.9 and > 1.1 (determined by trial-and-error methods). Fig. 4
    shows an example of correct matches remaining (yellow lines) after removing false
    matches using the two methods. Before removing false matches, there were 10,978
    matches and after removing false matches using Method 1 (three example lines shown
    in red), there were 113 matches remaining, including false and correct matches.
    Finally, after removing false matches (three example lines shown in blue) using
    Method 2, the remaining 34 matches were all correct matches. The remaining matches
    were distributed on the bottom of left image and top of the right image as these
    are the areas overlapping between them. Fewer matched lines were found at the
    left corner of the two images (bottom left corner of left image and top left corner
    of the right image) as compared to their right corners, where there were fewer
    notable image features being filtered during the SURF feature detection process
    (Bay et al., 2008, Feng et al., 2019). In addition, it can be seen from Fig. 4
    that less matching features were detected from the left portion of images than
    those from the right portion. The possible reason might be that left portion of
    images was brighter or slightly saturated with less distinction between crops
    and soil background than the right portion, where more distinguished features
    were observed (darker soil background and crop row accompanied by shadow). Download

    (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader
    is referred to the web version of this article.) 2.3.3. Calculation of the geometric
    transformation matrix Once the correct matches were identified, transformation
    matrices of each matching pair within the two successive images were calculated.
    In this study, a generic transformation matrix M was used as shown in Eq. (4)
    (Szeliski, 2007): (4) where, tx and ty are the distance in pixels of translation
    in the E-W and NS directions; sx and sy are the scale factors in E-W and NS directions,
    respectively; and θ is the rotation angle. Assuming a pixel value of an image
    coordinate I(x, y) was to be transformed into its previous image coordinate I’(x'',y''),
    Eq. (5) shows the transformation of these two images based on the transformation
    matrix M: (5) where, (x, y) and (x’, y’) are image coordinates of image I(x, y)
    and I’(x'',y''). The images had been rotated to obtain crop rows aligned with
    the vertical axis of the images as stated earlier. Therefore, no rotation was
    needed in the image transformation (i.e., θ = 0). In addition, the GSD of each
    image frame was calculated using row spacing (detailed in Section 2.3.5) and the
    UAV did not have much variation between two images (within 2 s). Therefore, the
    scale factor between two successive images was relatively small in this study.
    This study aimed to develop a near real-time pipeline to process individual UAV
    images for improved position accuracy, which required timely data processing (minimize
    processing time). To reduce the computation time of matching two images, only
    translation was considered in the transformation matrix, i.e., without including
    scale factor and rotation (sx and sy = 1; θ = 0). 2.3.4. Crop row alignment based
    on the geometric transformation matrix After applying the SHT to the original
    images, the images were rotated and each crop row position in the rotated images
    was obtained. Then, crop row alignment was conducted, with Fig. 5 showing this
    process for the first two images of the cotton field. Firstly, the crop row numbers
    of the first image were identified manually. The tx in the geometric transformation
    matrix M controlled the distance in pixels of translation in the E-W direction.
    When each crop row in the second image was translated by tx pixels, they would
    match with the positions of each crop row in the first image and would be assigned
    to the row numbers corresponding with the row numbers in the first image. New
    crop rows that appeared on the right side of the second image would be assigned
    a successively higher number from the last crop row in the first image. This process
    would continue in every-two consecutive images until crop row numbers were assigned
    to all images. Download : Download high-res image (331KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Crop row alignment. There were 10 cotton rows identified
    manually in the first image from the cotton field. The numbers of 9 cotton rows
    identified by the SHT in the second image frame were aligned with the first image
    frame based on the distance in pixels in the E-W direction (tx) from the geometric
    transformation matrix M. The distance in pixels in the NS direction (ty) determined
    the image position within the entire crop row. 2.3.5. Image positions within each
    entire crop row The ty in the geometric transformation matrix M determined the
    distance in pixels of translation in the NS direction as demonstrated in Fig.
    5 and Eq. (4). When the UAV flew in the north to south direction, the images at
    the north and the images at the south were at the beginning and the end of the
    crop rows, respectively as shown in Fig. 6. The ty value was positive when the
    image sequence was from the beginning to the end (north to south). Similarly,
    when the UAV flew from south to north, the image sequence was from the end to
    the beginning of the crop rows and the ty value was negative. Due to the forward
    image overlaps when taking successive images in the fields, each image would move
    ty pixels from its previous image in the NS direction. Since actual UAV flight
    height was inconsistent due to some uncontrolled factors, resulting in different
    GSD for each image, the translation pixels in the NS directions would misrepresent
    the true translation based on the ground distance (translation in meters) for
    the entire crop rows. Hence, to resolve this problem, translation in meters was
    calculated using the GSD of each image as determined based on the fixed row spacing
    (Eq. (6)): (6) Download : Download high-res image (474KB) Download : Download

    entire crop row. Black cross in each combined image represents the center position
    for each image in their combined image. where ty_meter is the translation in meters
    in the NS direction, ty is the pixels of translation in the NS directions and
    GSD is the ground sampling distance. The GSD was determined automatically by dividing
    the number of pixels for plant rows (obtained after row detections by Hough transformation)
    by actual row spacing (determined by the planter) as described in Feng et al.,
    2020a. The first image of the data collection (the beginning of the first crop
    rows) was given a value of zero and used as the reference for all other images
    collected in each field (Fig. 6). Then, the position in the NS direction of all
    other images was determined by accumulating the ty_meter from each subsequent
    image as illustrated in Fig. 6. 2.3.6. Emergence mapping based on the image alignment
    Crop emergence is an important agronomic factor for plant development assessment
    and field management at early growth stages, and can be evaluated using plant
    population, stand count, uniformity, and seedling size (Sansone et al., 2002,
    Supak, 1990). Crop emergence mapping of these parameters is important for making
    early field management decisions, assessing yield spatial variability, and studying
    effects of soil and environment on crop emergence (Feng et al., 2020a, Vong et
    al., 2022). In this study, emergence maps of a few parameters including stand
    count and canopy area for the cotton field, and stand count, mean days to imaging
    after emergence (DAEmean), and standard deviation of plant spacing (PSstd) for
    the corn field were created. The created maps were based on a local coordinate
    system consisting of a two-dimensional X-Y plane oriented in the NS (Y axis) and
    E-W directions (X axis) with the center position of the first image in the first
    flight path as the origin point (refer to section 2.3.5). Multiple 1-m seedling
    segment images were cropped from each raw image using the method described by
    Feng et al. (2020a) (Fig. 3 dashed line box) and illustrated in Fig. 7. The previously
    stated emergence parameters were estimated using a Resnet18 model described in
    previous studies (Feng et al., 2020a, Vong et al., 2022). Then, the maps were
    created based on the location of each segmented image as determined by the row
    numbers in E-W direction and ty_meter in NS direction. The row numbers were recognized
    based on the crop row assignment steps delineated above. Since the ty_meter described
    the translation in meters in the NS direction for the geometric center of each
    image frame, the translation in meters of each segmented image could be computed
    by adding (segment images below the geometric center) to or subtracting (segment
    images above the geometric center) from the distance in meters of the ty_meter
    (Fig. 7). If some segmented images from different images were geometrically close
    (<1 m), the average of their estimated emergence parameters was used when generating
    the emergence maps. To further demonstrate the usage of the emergence maps created
    from the developed pipeline, the cotton canopy area and stand count maps were
    compared with a yield map generated from an Ag Leader Insight yield monitor installed
    on a cotton harvester (1996 Case IH 2155, Racine, WI). The details of the harvest
    and yield map generation were described in Feng et al. (2019). Then, a Pearson
    correlation was performed to correlate canopy area and stand count with yield.

    their position based on the geometric center of an image, ty_meter. 2.4. Position
    accuracy evaluation using GCPs To evaluate the performance of the developed pipeline
    in improving position accuracy, an RTK GNSS system was used to measure the coordinates
    of GCPs in both fields, as shown in Fig. 8 and denoted as ground measurement.
    Furthermore, coordinates of GCPs were also determined from the GNSS of the UAV,
    DJI Phantom 4 Advanced using the method described by Feng et al. (2020a) and denoted
    as Phantom measurement. Then, the distance between GCPs was calculated using the
    coordinates from the ground and Phantom measurement using the haversine formula
    (Feng et al., 2020a, Naik and Nair, 2019). For the pipeline measurement, the distance
    between GCPs was calculated based on ty_meter for the NS direction and the difference
    in crop rows for the E-W direction (Fig. 8c). Then, the position accuracy was
    computed as the difference in their distances for all the GCPs (Ground vs Pipeline
    and Ground vs Phantom) and represented in a boxplot. Download : Download high-res

    distance comparison between two different kinds of systems for the position accuracy
    evaluation: b) ground RTK measurement and c) pipeline measurement. An analysis
    of variance (ANOVA) test followed by Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD)
    test was conducted to compare position accuracy means at a 0.05 significance level
    (α = 0.05) for the two sets (Ground vs Pipeline and Ground vs Phantom). The cotton
    field had 28 GCPs as shown in Fig. 8b, with all the GCPs south of p1, p2, p3,
    and p4 in the same row. The comparison of coordinates (latitude and longitude)
    was between every-two GCPs in the same row (e.g., p1 and p5, p1 and p9, p1 and
    p13, p1 and p17, p1 and p21, p1 and p25, p5 and p9, etc.). One of the GCPs (p26)
    was not visible in the UAV image and was excluded from the position accuracy comparison.
    Hence, the total pairs for position accuracy comparison in the cotton field was
    78. On the other hand, the locations of GCPs in the corn field (Fig. 8a) were
    more random (at different rows) compared to those of the cotton field. The position
    accuracy comparison was between every-two GCPs (e.g., p1 and p2, p1 and p3, p1
    and p4, etc.), resulting in ten pairs. 2.5. Processing time comparison The processing
    time needed for the entire workflow in Fig. 3 for both fields was recorded and
    compared with the image stitching time needed from two commercial software packages,
    Agisoft Metashape (ver. 1.8.0) and Pix4D Mapper. A desktop configured as an Intel
    Core i9-9900 K 3.60 GHz, an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 6 GB memory, an NVIDIA
    GeForce RTX 2060 Super GPU with 8 GB memory, 32 GB RAM and 3 TB solid-state drive
    (SSD) was used to process the images using the new pipeline in this study and
    for image stitching by the two commercial software packages to make a comparison
    of their processing time. The commercial software packages used GPU resources
    of the desktop during processing while the pipelines did not use the desktop’s
    GPU resources. 3. Results 3.1. Position accuracy evaluation Fig. 9 shows the position
    errors of GCPs in both fields measured by the developed pipeline using single
    images, calculated as the distance difference between the ground RTK GPS coordinates
    and coordinates calculated by the pipeline (Ground vs Pipeline). For comparison,
    Fig. 9 (box plots in red color) also shows distance difference for the raw UAV
    images (Feng et al., 2020a, Ground vs Phantom). It can be seen that the distance
    differences (errors) of the developed pipeline were 0.32 ± 0.21 m and 0.57 ± 0.28
    m (mean ± standard deviation) for cotton and corn fields, which were significantly
    lower than those between ground RTK and the Phantom measurement system (1.98 ±
    1.53 m and 2.13 ± 1.89 m respectively). The position error of the previous study
    (Feng et al., 2020a) was 1.72 ± 1.53 m as they only involved 24 pairs of GCPs,
    i.e., every-two successive GCPs in the same row (e.g., p1 and p5, p5 and p9, p9
    and p13, etc.), compared to 78 pairs of every-two GCPs in this study. Download

    in the means at p < 0.05 for the Tukey HSD test. 3.2. Single image processing
    pipeline assessment (problems and solutions) A total of 2,200 and 517 images were
    collected for the cotton and corn fields, respectively. Some of the images were
    not assigned to the correct crop row numbers due to a low degree of overlap between
    two successive images. This was usually caused by an inconsistent actual AGL flight
    height of the UAV, which may have been due to errors in the UAV elevation sensor,
    field slope, signal noise, or low battery level. Moreover, when flying a UAV over
    a relatively larger field such as the cotton field in our study (5.1 ha) with
    a low flight height (10 m), multiple batteries were needed. When the battery level
    was low, we observed that the pre-set flight height changed (lower flight height),
    which resulted in a larger scale factor for the two successive images (between
    the last image before changing the battery and first image after changing the
    battery). Hence, two approaches were considered to solve these problems: 1) using
    side instead of forward overlapping images. The side overlapping images could
    be found based on the nearest position coordinates of images in the UAV flight
    path next to the target path; 2) manually identifying and assigning the crop row
    numbers of the image by referring to the surrounding images (the previous and
    side overlapping images). Fig. 11 illustrates some example situations encountered
    in the cotton field where one of the two solutions was used to solve the problem.
    For example, the successive images in Fig. 10a had<5 % overlap and crop row numbers
    were only able to be manually identified and assigned. Fig. 10b shows a successful
    example of aligning rows by matching features from side overlapping images. On
    the other hand, Fig. 10c illustrates images before and after changing the UAV
    battery, resulting in large scale factor differences and requiring manual row
    number assignment. In our study, < 0.4 % of images taken needed manual assignment
    of row numbers (7/2,200 for cotton and 2/517 for corn fields). This problem can
    be reduced in future studies by using a higher resolution camera, thus enabling
    a higher and more stable flight height for sufficient image overlaps. Download

    d, respectively, where each data point equates to a 4 m × 5 m area. A crop yield
    map with the same 4 m × 5 m cell size is shown in e. 3.3. Crop emergence maps
    To demonstrate the usage of the developed pipeline in creating emergence maps,
    a stand count map (seedlings m−1) and a canopy size map (cm2 seedling−1) were
    generated for the cotton field by calculating the number of plants and their average
    canopy size within each meter of each row (Fig. 12a and b). These maps had a resolution
    of 152 × 315 grids (i.e., 152 crop rows by 315 m in NS direction) and were down-sampled
    to a 38 × 63 grid (Fig. 12c and d) by averaging the stand count and canopy size
    of every 5 m in each four adjacent rows (equal to a 4 m × 5 m area) for matching
    with the four-row harvested yield data (Fig. 11e). The figures confirmed the positive
    correlation between yield and stand count/ canopy size (r = 0.3 for stand count
    and r = 0.35 for the canopy size, both with p-value < 0.001) by displaying the
    similar patterns of field variations in the figures. Higher stand count and canopy
    size corresponded to higher yield. For instance, the northeast portion (red circle
    in Fig. 11) of the field had lower stand counts, canopy sizes, and yield while
    the opposite was shown in the southwest part (black circle in Fig. 11) of the
    field. Download : Download high-res image (673KB) Download : Download full-size

    rows (a) and their emergence maps of stand count (plant m−1, b), mean days to
    imaging after emergence (DAEmean, days, c), and standard deviation of plant spacing
    (PSstd, cm m−1, d) in corn field. For the corn field, emergence maps of three
    parameters: stand count, DAEmean, and PSstd were generated using the developed
    pipeline as shown in Fig. 12b to 12d. These maps had a resolution of 72 × 160
    grids (i.e., 72 crop rows by 160 m in NS direction). Fig. 12a shows the schematic
    diagram of the crop rows, where there were 64 rows with planting depth treatments
    and the remaining eight rows without planting depth treatments. There was no obvious
    pattern in the stand count and PSstd maps related to planting depth, but DAEmean
    showed trends of higher DAEmean with decreasing depths. Collectively, these results
    suggest that the developed pipeline was able to provide position information for
    each single UAV image and further process those images to obtain the emergence
    maps, which would be beneficial in PA applications, especially in understanding
    the effect of spatial variability of the field on crop emergence and production.
    Furthermore, this method could reduce the time needed for putting GCP in the field
    and for image post-processing (image stitching and feature extraction). 3.4. Processing
    time comparison The workflow and parameters set in Agisoft Metashape and Pix4D
    Mapper to stitch the UAV images collected on both fields are detailed in Table
    1, Table 2. The settings for these parameters were to ensure the software used
    the full-size images (not down-sampled images) since the developed pipeline in
    this study used the original full-size images during processing. The common workflow
    to stitch the image to obtain the orthomosaic in Agisoft Metashape includes ‘align
    photos’, ‘build dense point cloud’, ‘build mesh’, and ‘build orthomosaic’. However,
    with the large number of images collected in the cotton field (2,200 images),
    an error occurred during the ‘build mesh’ step stating, ‘Not enough memory’. Therefore,
    another step, ‘build DEM’ was performed to act as the surface for the ‘build orthomosaic’
    step. For Pix4D Mapper, the stitching process failed and did not produce the final
    orthomosaic for either the cotton or corn field, which might be due to the low
    image overlaps. Image overlap for this software is recommended at least 75 % and
    60 % for forward and side overlaps, respectively (https://pix4d.com). Although
    the UAV flights (height, speed, and flight paths) were set to have 60–70 % image
    overlaps for both fields, the actual overlap changed due to inconsistent AGL flight
    height caused by several factors mentioned previously in section 3.2. Other studies
    also indicated that the image reconstruction process using stitching software
    was not fully completed when a side overlap was smaller than 55 % (Seifer et al.,
    2019). Even with the successful process, the resulting orthomosaic would have
    artifacts such as holes, dislocation, and distortion (Cui et al., 2021). Table

    image processing time using the algorithms developed in this study was 10.4 and
    5.7 s/image for the cotton and corn fields (as shown in Table 3). The difference
    in the image processing time between the two fields was mostly due to the time
    used in detecting and matching the image features, which were different in the
    images with different crops, soil conditions, residue backgrounds, and lighting
    conditions. These processing times corresponded to 6.4 h for the 5.1 ha cotton
    field and 0.82 h for the 0.8 ha corn field. Meanwhile, the processing times of
    the pipeline were lower than the image stitching time needed by the commercial
    software, which were 88.7 and 97.4 s/image for cotton and corn fields, respectively.

    Pipeline performance The study developed a near real-time UAV image processing
    pipeline that had higher performance than the method used in the previous study
    and achieved a better position accuracy. Without the need for an RTK unit on the
    UAV, the pipeline was able to produce more accurate field maps with an average
    position accuracy of 0.32 and 0.57 m for the cotton and corn fields, respectively.
    The position accuracy of the cotton field is well within half of the common crop
    row spacing, which is 0.38 to 0.51 m (Clawson et al., 2006). The position accuracy
    of the corn field was not within half of the common row spacing (0.19 to 0.49
    m; Elmore and Abendroth. 2007), and lower than that of the cotton field (higher
    distance difference), which might be caused by human errors. As illustrated in
    Fig. 13, a yellow ground stake, which could be clearly seen from the image (Fig.
    13a) was used to mark the GCPs in the cotton field. However, in the corn field,
    two flags were used to mark each monitoring site, with one of the flags used as
    the GCP. However, the point where the flag was inserted into the ground surface
    could not be seen clearly in the image (Fig. 13b). The location for the insertion
    point of the flag was estimated based on the location of the first color stake
    in each plant row (Fig. 13b). Download : Download high-res image (227KB) Download

    site and used as the GCP for corn field. The developed pipeline was expected to
    be a low-cost near real-time tool for row crop emergence estimation as it reduced
    the time needed for image stitching compared to the commercial software. Image
    stitching comprises several steps: 1) feature detection and matching between images;
    2) non-linear geometric transformation matrix estimation including translation,
    rotation, and scale; 3) warping transformation for mosaic processing (Brown and
    Lowe, 2007). When data are collected for row crops with fixed row spacing and
    under steady UAV flight conditions, the developed method of only calculating translations
    in the geometric transformation matrices required less processing time than the
    stitching process. The dynamic calibration of GSD for individual images using
    row spacing would make it possible for field mapping without the image mosaic
    process. 4.2. Cotton field emergence mapping The mapping of the cotton field in
    this study showed a low correlation value between emergence and yield, which was
    likely caused by environmental factors, irrigation, and other in-season management
    (Feng et al., 2022). Nonetheless, the finding of positive correlation was still
    consistent with previous studies indicating that higher plant density would have
    higher yields as there were more bolls per unit area (Yang et al., 2014, Zhi et
    al., 2016). Meanwhile, canopy size is one of the critical components of canopy
    structure relating to plant photosynthesis, fruiting, and biomass accumulation
    (Jiang et al., 2018, Jung et al., 2018), and is commonly used as a feature in
    cotton yield estimation (Feng et al., 2020c; Jung et al., 2018). More investigations
    are needed to study the effects of environments and crop development on the final
    yield. 4.3. Pipeline limitations Our pipeline has a few limitations. Firstly,
    the method was developed to be used for row crops with fixed row spacing (such
    as cotton and corn shown in this study) as it highly depends on the crop row detection
    for image rotation and GSD calculation for each image. Therefore, there would
    be large errors if crop rows were not detected. Secondly, the method is limited
    to row crops at early emergence, or the crop growth stages before the crop leaves
    of neighboring rows start to overlap and close the canopy. Once leaf overlaps
    occur, crop rows are hardly detected and the initial steps of rotating images
    and calculating GSD are not feasible. In addition, to ensure the best performance
    of the pipeline (without needing manual identification and assignment of crop
    row numbers as detailed in section 3.2), a stable flight height on a flat field
    is desired. Inconsistent flight heights (especially in the situation of UAVs flown
    at low altitude in fields with substantial slopes) and height differences of two
    different flight missions will cause large scale factor differences in images,
    which is not included in our transform matrix calculation. For studies conducted
    on a windy day with limited processing performance using the methods developed
    in this study, automatic detection and correction of scale differences (row spacing
    could still be used as a clue) will be one of the solutions for this issue, which
    we would include in our future studies. 4.4. Potential application and future
    study The pipeline can be applied in a UAV data processing framework with a graphical
    user interface similar to the framework in Feng et al. (2020a) to process the
    data after a UAV flight, which allows a more user-friendly data processing platform
    for different users such as agronomists, breeders, and farmers to obtain crop
    emergence or early growth maps. Furthermore, the pipeline can also be used as
    a processing unit integrated with the onboard UAV sensor to deliver real-time
    data processing and thus reduce the time data transmission and pre-processing,
    before obtaining the final crop emergence maps. Future studies should include
    modification of the pipeline to other row crops such as soybean and vegetable
    for different emergence parameters estimations on the field scale. These estimations
    can be used by researchers to explore the relationships between crop emergence
    and environmental factors such as soil and weather conditions as well as different
    planting treatments. Meanwhile, this can act as a low-cost near real-time tool
    for small-scale farmers to estimate the early emergence in their fields. For large-scale
    farmers, the method can be used to scout areas within fields with emergence issues
    or biotic stresses impacting stand for further management decisions, or field
    areas that cannot be accessed easily by ground vehicles. 5. Conclusion This paper
    reports the development of a near real-time image processing pipeline to process
    single UAV images with an improved position accuracy algorithm to generate emergence
    maps of row crops including cotton and corn. The emergence parameters included
    stand count and canopy size for cotton as well as stand count, mean days to imaging
    after emergence, and plant spacing standard deviation for corn. The developed
    pipeline procedures included feature detection and matching, false matches removal,
    geometric transformation matrix calculation, crop row alignment, assigning position
    of each single image, and mapping. The results showed that the position accuracies
    for the developed pipeline compared to RTK-GNSS ground-truth measurements were
    0.32 ± 0.21 m and 0.57 ± 0.28 m for the cotton and corn fields, respectively.
    Emergence maps of cotton and corn fields were generated to demonstrate the application
    of this new method. The processing time needed to run the algorithm was 8.6 and
    3.6 s/image for cotton and corn fields, respectively. After adding the time needed
    for image pre-processing, the time needed would be 10.4 and 5.7 s image-1, corresponding
    to 1.3 and 1.0 hr ha−1 for the cotton and corn field, respectively. The developed
    pipeline introduced a new approach in using UAV images to quantify crop early
    emergence in a shorter time and lower cost. The current study demonstrated the
    usage of the pipeline for cotton and corn. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    predictive controlPrecision irrigationSystem identification 1. Introduction The
    current and future generations face significant challenges in ensuring that nutritious
    food is sustainably produced from limited land and water resources. The FAO''s
    food and agriculture report of 2020 posits that 40% of the world population are
    inhabitants of water-scarce agricultural areas; of these, 37% inhabit agricultural
    zones with severe water scarcity [27,51]. Coupled with the rising population indices,
    meeting the food demand by 2050 will need a 70% increase in food production [28].
    In addition to developing quick maturing and high-yielding plant varieties, scientists
    need to ensure that less water is used to produce more food. It is estimated that
    about 70% of the water abstracted for irrigation is lost through conveyance losses
    and poor water allocation methods [76]. This means that a lot of water is presently
    used to produce a unit of food. Improving water use efficiency in irrigation systems
    requires intelligent irrigation monitoring and control systems to ensure that
    no water is wasted and precise water application is achieved [15]. Sustainable
    precision irrigation presents a timely solution to water wastage in irrigated
    agriculture by ensuring that intended irrigation amounts are applied at the right
    time and place. Precision irrigation scheduling is striving to achieve efficient
    water use per plant, in space and time, in the right quantities to compensate
    for losses. This is possible through effective monitoring and optimal control
    strategies, reducing pumping costs. Over the years, there has been a paradigm
    shift from traditional irrigation methods to smart irrigation systems. This has
    somewhat improved the water use efficiency by reducing conveyance losses. However,
    irrigation control is still a challenge due to the complex nature of agricultural
    systems. For example, most irrigation systems are designed based on historical
    climatic data, and irrigation schedules are developed based on this data. Precision
    agriculture has been facilitated by the tremendous advancement in the agricultural
    Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) through remote sensing
    [32,69]. The controlled monitoring of agricultural systems has enhanced the sapience
    of the changing dynamics of the water, plant and soil environment throughout the
    cropping season [5]. With advances in Big data analytics, more agricultural systems
    are becoming data-driven for decision-making purposes rather than relying on heuristic
    physics-based models [68]. Sustainable irrigation necessitates the adoption of
    irrigation control strategies that precisely direct irrigation water to the plant''s
    root zone. Boman et al. [11] observed improved water, energy, and fertilizer use
    efficiency when precision irrigation control strategies are implemented. Precision
    irrigation control strategies are divided into two, namely, closed-loop systems
    and open-loop systems. Whereas open-loop systems apply a preset action like in
    simple irrigation timers, closed-loop systems receive feedback from sensors, make
    decisions and implement the resulting findings in the irrigation system [15].
    Several authors have reviewed and classified closed-loop irrigation control strategies
    into three, namely, linear control, intelligent control and optimal control [4,15,23].
    Model predictive control has evolved over the past four decades with advances
    in real-time data measurements and an increase in computational power. Model Predictive
    Control (MPC) refers to a category of advanced computer-controlled algorithms
    that use an explicit process model to predict a plant''s future response [23].
    Developed in the 1960s, Model Predictive Control emanates from optimal control.
    The basic principle of MPC is to use a dynamic model to predict system behavior
    and optimize the prediction to decide the control move at the current time [71].
    In addition to its flexibility, Model predictive control repeatedly solves constrained
    optimal control problems online ([57]b). The ability to handle multivariate processes
    and address state and input constraints has made MPC indispensable in modern manufacturing
    industries [23,56,55,70]. In a control problem, the model predictive controller''s
    goal is to compute the plant input to follow the desired reference [60]. MPC uses
    a plant model to predict future plant output behavior and an optimizer that ensures
    that the predicted plant output tracks the desired reference [15,60] MPC has been
    widely studied and applied in processing industries ([4,23,33]; F. [38,52]; L.
    [78]). However, in the agricultural sector, not much has been reported on the
    application of model predictive control in modelling dynamic agricultural systems.
    The most recent review by Ding et al. [23] focused on model predictive control
    applications in agriculture in general. [23] assert that the application of MPC
    to agriculture can yield significant productivity and efficiency benefits despite
    its limited use in the past years. However, no review of data-driven model predictive
    control in precision irrigation applications has been reported. MPC has been applied
    to agriculture, but it has not been applied in all respects. This work builds
    upon existing reviews in the field of agriculture with a particular focus on precision
    irrigation. This review presents an overview of model predictive control in section
    2; data-driven MPC can be done through system identification, machine learning,
    and iterative learning control, as discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents
    the specific application domains of data-driven MPC in irrigation systems. The
    challenges and future perspectives of data-driven MPC are discussed in section
    5. Finally, the conclusion and future research are presented. 2. Overview of model
    predictive control 2.1. Historical perspective of model predictive control The
    concept of model predictive control dates way back in the 1960s to 1970s [66].
    However, MPC found its way into process industries until the 1980s [23]. Since
    then, model predictive control has undergone several stages of development. The
    first stage involves classical model predictive control between 1980 and 1990
    and mainly solves multivariable constraint control problems [52]. As a result
    of the failure to handle nonlinear systems in process industries, improved MPCs
    evolved towards the end of the 20th century giving more computational power with
    an extraordinary ability to handle constraints. This phase saw the continued penetration
    of the commercial MPC algorithms into various industries and a sound theoretical
    foundation for it. In the 1st decade of the 21st century, latest MPC evolved as
    many industries adopted model predictive control [52]. The latest MPC methods
    reduced computation time by decentralizing large-scale problems, reducing computation
    time directly, or simplifying computational processes [23]. The fourth phase has
    seen the evolution of data-driven model predictive control techniques aided by
    machine learning and data science advancements. Table 1 summarizes the different
    types of MPC since 1980. Fig. 1 presents the evolution of model predictive control.

    control. There has been a progression from the past decades in the category of
    systems where model predictive control is applied. Literature has reported a significant
    rise in MPC application in mechanical and electrical systems [52]. Some of the
    application domains include suspension [34], vehicle traction control [12], direct
    injection stratified charge engines [35], Grain drying processes [82], traffic
    management [48], automatic boats for aquaculture [81], modelling temperatures
    in buildings [25], amongst others. This is facilitated by the precedent developments,
    which enable MPC implementation on hardware, making it faster than traditional
    processes. 2.2. Main components of model predictive control The key to effective
    implementation of a control strategy is understanding how model predictive control
    works. Model predictive control has seven essential components (Fig. 2): prediction,
    receding horizon, modelling, performance index, degrees of freedom, constraint
    handling, and multivariable [73]. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Components of Model Predictive Control. Prediction:
    Model predictive control considers the future implication of current control actions
    by computing the predicted behavior over a horizon. Predictions must capture all
    the system''s transient and steady-state behavior [73]. Therefore, the prediction
    horizon dictates how far the future state will be predicted. Receding horizon:
    This is the horizon over which system dynamics are predicted. After defining the
    optimal trajectory of the future state, the actual control input to the plant
    only takes the first sample of the control signal, neglecting the rest of the
    trajectory [78]. Modelling: Prediction of a system''s future state requires a
    plant model. A good dynamic model will give a consistent and accurate prediction
    of the future. A mode of the system shows the dependence of the output on the
    current measured variable and the present/future inputs. Performance index: Performance
    index measures the numerical definition of the best input trajectory. Performance
    indices of a model change with time as the system''s internal model gets better
    over time. Performance indices must therefore be realistic and matched with model
    accuracy. Degree of freedom: Degrees of freedom describe the complexity of input
    trajectories. Brownlee [13] defined degree of freedom as the sum of parameters
    in the model that are determined from data. This is inclusive of the coefficients
    of the model and the data used to calculate the error of the model. Constraint
    handling: Model predictive control embeds constraints into the strategy development.
    The proposed input trajectory is optimal while satisfying constraints. The systematic
    embedding of constraint information is critical to effective and robust closed-loop
    behavior. Multivariable: Almost all dynamic systems have numerous inputs and outputs.
    Model predictive control can handle multi-input-multi-output systems (MIMO) systematically.
    In traditional control like Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), it is complex
    to design MIMO systems because limited data about the plant is used in the model
    design, and interaction becomes cumbersome. On the other hand, model predictive
    control algorithms require a model and thus utilize more data, making it easier
    to handle MIMO systems. 2.3. Theoretical formulation of model predictive control
    A model predictive controller is designed based on the state space equation of
    the process dynamics model as described by Rawlings et al. [71]. A state-space
    model is a probabilistic graphical model that describes probabilistic dependence
    between the latent state variable and the observed measurement [16,20]. Model
    predictive control solves an optimal control problem over a receding horizon,
    subject to system constraints, to determine the next control action ([43], 2018).
    The optimization is iterated at each time step, and the control law is updated
    Fig. 3a . Kaiser et al. [44] formulates a receding horizon control problem as
    an open-loop optimization for every time step with an optimal sequence of control
    inputs u (Fig. 3b ) (1) ≔ Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download

    a moving horizon window. Adapted from [14]. Over the control horizon given the
    current measurement that minimizes a cost over the prediction horizon , where
    is the timestep of the model. The control horizon is less than or equal to the
    prediction horizon such that then the input u is assumed constant after that.
    The first control value is then applied and the optimization is reinitialized
    and repeated at each subsequent timestep to solve for the unknown sequence . This
    results in an implicit feedback control law. (2) The cost optimization at each
    timestep is described as minimizing a performance index with up to three terms;
    an output penalty, an input penalty, and an input rate penalty; (3) The minimized
    cost function J is subject to constraints on the inputs and outputs; (4) 2.4.
    Data-driven model predictive control Data-driven control systems are broadly classified
    under control systems. The identification of the process model and the design
    of the controller are based entirely on experimental data collected from the plant
    [9]. Learning dynamical systems models from data is a vital challenge in mathematical
    physics, with a rich history dating back as far as the time of Kepler and Newton
    and the discovery of the laws of planetary motion. Initially, modelling of dynamic
    systems relied on a combination of high-quality measurements and expert intuition.
    With vast data and increasing computational power, the automated discovery of
    governing equations and dynamical systems is a new and exciting scientific paradigm.
    Data-driven models require automatic data collection, as they can react in real-time
    to changes in the input variables [31]. The data-driven models’ response can create
    a feedback loop into a larger online system. However, automatic data collection
    is associated with some challenges, and thus, characteristics of big data, namely,
    volume, velocity, variety, value and veracity (5Vs), need to be considered (Fig.
    4). Download : Download high-res image (285KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. The 5Vs of data-driven modelling. 3. System identification System identification
    is a form of machine learning, where an input-output map of a system is learned
    from training data in a representation that generalizes the data that was not
    in the training set [14]. Ljung [53] defined it as the art and science of building
    mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. System
    identification is essential where first principles or physics-based modelling
    of the system is not possible. Here, nothing is known about the system dynamics,
    also known as the black-box approach. Data is used to learn a mathematic model
    that mimics the input-output relationship using a model structure that represents
    the system behavior and parameter selection for fitting the data. A better understanding
    of the model is achieved with system identification, and future prediction becomes
    easy. Fig. 5 represents a flowchart for a system identification process Download

    System identification process. System identification can be done for linear systems,
    nonlinear systems and online and recursive systems. 3.1. Nonlinear system identification
    for control Powerful model-based control techniques like linear optimal control
    and model predictive control are aided by data-driven techniques that characterize
    the input-output dynamics from observed measurements without relying on first
    principles modelling. Nonlinear systems identification is made possible due to
    high computing power and powerful data-driven techniques. Once a low order model
    of the input-output dynamics from actuation u to measurements y and a full state
    x of the system is measured, then identification of dynamics f is made possible
    that satisfy (5) This then is discretized since data is collected in time steps
    and control laws are digitally implemented. This state dynamics then becomes.
    (6) 3.2. Online and recursive system identification Online systems identification
    means that the algorithm is running during the operation of the physical system.
    Online system identification algorithms estimate the parameters and states of
    a system model as data is obtained in real-time or near real-time from measuring
    devices [24]. Referring to the agro-hydrologic balance equation, the process dynamics
    of the system can be described as one with three inputs, rainfall, irrigation,
    and crop evapotranspiration and one output, soil moisture, as shown in Fig. 6.
    The process dynamics model assumes that deep percolation in an irrigated agricultural

    time by updating the model parameters each time step. For example, the algorithm
    could measure irrigation and compare it with the predicted irrigation amount to
    produce a prediction error. An online algorithm adjusts the model parameters to
    reduce the error. In the next step, a new set of measurements is recorded and
    compared with the model prediction. An error is again obtained and added to the
    old measurements and the process repeats itself. Online system identification
    is crucial where the model parameters are time-variant, especially as is the case
    for the weather parameters in the crop evapotranspiration model. 4. Machine learning
    control Machine learning is a rapidly developing field transforming our ability
    to learn and characterize dynamic systems [14]. Machine learning makes the control
    of complex, nonlinear systems possible because of its high dimensional, nonlinear
    and optimization techniques [26]. For example, given a schematic in Fig. 7 with
    high dimensional dynamics with external disturbances to achieve a high-level objective

    a controller based on sensor measurements of the system that can then drive the
    system through actuation. Examples of machine learning methods include genetic
    algorithms, genetic programming, reinforcement learning and adaptive neural networks
    (Fig. 8). These machine learning algorithms use biological principles like neural
    networks, evolutional algorithms, and reinforcement learning. Detailed information

    control (ILC) is an efficient technique used to improve the performance of transient
    systems that operate repetitively [79]. The aim of ILC is to improve the transient
    response through input adjustment based on observed errors. A standard iterative
    learning control scheme assumes stable dynamics, and the system returns to the
    same initial conditions at the start of each trial of the same length. A schematic
    of data-driven iterative learning control is presented in Fig. 9 [65]. Download

    Iterative learning control process. An Iterative Learning Control takes the form
    (10) Where;  = input to the system during the kth repetition,  = tracking error
    during the kth repetition and  = design parameter representing operations on  .
    There has to be a convergence of the input signals as k becomes large. This will
    ensure perfect tracking through the iteration process. The rate of convergence
    represents the desirable need for a rapid iterative learning process. Despite
    the uncertainty about the process dynamics, good algorithm performance is desirable.
    The operation   ranges from simple scalar gains to sophisticated optimization
    computations and is necessary to achieve design objectives. 5.1. Applications
    of data-driven model predictive control in precision irrigation management Owing
    to the similarity of agricultural processes to industrial processes, model predictive
    control has been applied in product processing, agricultural production, greenhouses
    and irrigation systems [23]. For example, model predictive control has been applied
    in canal flow control and regulation, irrigation scheduling, stem water potential
    regulation, soil moisture regulation and precipitation and evapotranspiration
    prediction. 5.2. Irrigation canal flow control and regulation Model predictive
    control has found applicability to canal flow control and gate operation. The
    management objective of MPC for irrigation canals is to keep the water levels
    as close to the setpoints as possible [45]. Therefore, a suitable model representing
    the canal water level dynamic is needed. Furthermore, the models need to be set
    up in such a way that they contain the appropriate dynamics of the water system
    for water level regulation. In this regard, MPC has been applied to model the
    behavior of the water movement in the open channel, maintaining certain water
    levels at various locations and the water flows that influence these water levels
    [29,30,63,79,80,84]. Control structures are used to manipulate the water flows,
    through which the controller can achieve the management objective [45]. However,
    achieving this objective is not straightforward, as some varying inflows and outflows
    disturb the water system. To predict the future water levels and flows as a result
    of disturbances and control actions, the water system (canal reaches, structures,
    disturbances, controller) needs to be modelled. Fig. 10 depicts a typical irrigation
    canal with water flowing by gravity and different offtakes along the canal reach.

    of the canal at the water surface in m, Q is the water flow rate in the canal

    outflow per unit length of the channel in m2/s, v the velocity in m/s, A is the
    wetted cross-sectional area, g the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2), so
    the channel bottom slope and sf is the friction slip of the irrigation canal.
    Several scholars have used model predictive control in controlling irrigation
    canal flows. Puig et al. [70] used model predictive control to generate flow control
    strategies from the water source to the consumer and irrigation areas in the Guadiana
    River. The results showed effectiveness in the use of model predictive control.
    Zhang et al. [83] designed a non-cooperative distributed model predictive control
    algorithm based on Nash optimality for water level regulation in irrigation canals.
    The system simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
    To effectively deliver canal flow without fluctuations, Han & Qiao [39]; Hashemy
    et al. [41,40]combined model predictive control with online water storage to compensate
    for an existing time delay and avoid wave disturbances. The results showed significant
    improvement for canal operations employing automation. Recently, Kong et al. [50]
    used model predictive control toolbox to control gate interval and water level.
    The authors tested it on a simulation model of an irrigation canal in Beijing
    consisting of 13 cascaded canal pools. The authors affirmed that model predictive
    control is a useful control strategy for gate opening at different intervals [49].
    6. Irrigation scheduling Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining the
    frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water to apply to meet the crop
    water requirements [59]. In conventional irrigation systems, irrigation scheduling
    is determined through experience, observation, and heuristic methods. On the other
    hand, precision irrigation systems rely on feedback from sensing devices. Irrigation
    scheduling can be achieved through weather-based, soil-based, or plant-based approaches.
    Precision irrigation systems aim at spatio-temporal irrigation scheduling depending
    on weather, soil, and plant physiological characteristics [3]. Model predictive
    control is used to perform irrigation scheduling using real-time field data to
    calibrate a crop and soil model and then using the calibrated model to determine
    optimum irrigation schedules [61]. Plant and soil real-time measurements are crucial
    to calibrate the model during the growing stages of the crop as irrigation advances.
    Considering the soil moisture balance model, the plant input is the irrigation
    amount, whereas the plant output is the soil moisture deficit. The crop evapotranspiration
    and precipitation values are considered disturbances as they cannot be controlled.
    Delgoda et al. [22], Lozoya et al. [56], and Saleem et al. [74] used model predictive
    control to predict the frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water using
    a soil moisture dynamics model. The authors used a combined mechanistic and data-driven
    modelling approach to describe the dynamics of the soil-plant-atmosphere system
    using sensing devices for real-time feedback to the control algorithm. However,
    the authors neglected the effect of precipitation and crop water use on the system
    dynamics. Delgoda et al. [21] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above model
    predictive control framework. The authors employed a disturbance affine feedback
    control approach and uncertainty modelling techniques to account for the dynamic
    nature of rainfall and crop water use. Moreover, the study reported optimal system
    performance in a humid region where considerable uncertainties in climate variables
    existed. Recently, Abioye, Abidin, Aman, et al. [2] and Abioye, Abidin, Mahmud,
    et al. [2] used a data-driven model predictive control to schedule irrigation
    in a greenhouse irrigation experiment. The authors used Laguerre functions in
    order to reduce the computation complexity brought about by input constraints.
    6.1. Stem water potential regulation Another important aspect in precision irrigation
    management is the soil water potential. It determines the ease with which plants
    can extract water from the soil. Soil water potential is a measure of the energy
    status of the soil water relative to that of water at a standard reference [59].
    On the other hand, stem water potential (SWP) is the direct measure of water tension
    within the plant [75]. Suter et al. suggested that plant moisture status needs
    to be determined through SWP measurements rather than the soil moisture content.
    Chen et al. [18] developed a stem water potential model using data-driven model
    predictive control to help reduce uncertainty in weather forecast errors. The
    authors formulated a state-space model that captures water dynamics in a plant-root-soil
    system. The water status of the system was modelled by monitoring water flow in
    the soil, root and plant system. Precipitation in the system was the water inflow,
    and evapotranspiration was the driving force in the system. The state-space model
    was linearized to reduce the computation burden caused by robust nonlinear optimization.
    The authors used the formulation of a robust optimal control problem that maintained
    stem water potential within certain limits. The authors reported a 7.9% reduction
    in the water consumption in almond trees using data-driven robust model predictive
    control. 6.2. Soil moisture regulation Irrigation aims to maintain the root zone
    soil moisture between field capacity and the permanent wilting point (Fig. 10).
    When the soil moisture goes above the field capacity, the soil becomes saturated,
    and below the wilting point, the plant experiences water stress and eventually
    dies. Management allowable depletion of 50% is adopted for most irrigation designs
    to ensure that the available moisture does not get depleted before irrigation
    occurs. This available moisture in the root zone depends on the plant''s effective
    root zone. Model predictive control has been used to minimize root zone soil moisture
    and irrigation amounts within a specific threshold or at specific set points [22,55,62].
    However, recent studies argue that a zone needs to be considered rather than a
    reference set point to ensure maximum water extraction from the root zone. The
    aim should be to regulate the soil moisture within the readily available moisture
    zone. Mao et al. [57c] proposed a methodical approach to system identification
    and root zone model predictive control design for soil moisture control of agro-hydrological
    systems. First, the authors simulated the soil water dynamics of the field from
    a mechanistic soil-water balance model. The model consisted of a nonlinear partial
    differential equation with source and sink terms characterizing the root water
    extraction, evaporation and transpiration, precipitation, and irrigation. A linear
    parameter varying model was identified based on the input and output data of the
    soil-water balance model, which was then used for zone model predictive control
    design. The authors report a satisfactory approximation of the soil moisture dynamics
    and the designed zone model predictive control suitability. 6.3. Precipitation
    and evapotranspiration prediction One of the challenges in precision irrigation
    management is the scarcity of climate data. Precision irrigation requires real-time
    data to aid in irrigation decisions. In developed countries, prediction systems
    are used to predict future weather events, and this data is availed to farmers
    for irrigation management decisions. In the absence of such, there is a need to
    bridge the gap using model predictive control to quantity the sources of uncertainty
    in the soil moisture dynamics model. To address this, Guo and You [37] used a
    novel data-driven local precipitation and evapotranspiration prediction by implementing
    an artificial neuro-network (ANN). It was embedded in the model predictive control
    toolbox and updated in real-time to formulate the dynamic uncertainty set to account
    for weather prediction errors in the irrigation control system. The authors reported
    effective control of the root zone soil moisture. A summary of studies conducted
    in the different application domains is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary
    of applications of MPC in irrigation. Application Domain Author Irrigation Canal

    and future perspectives of data-driven modelling in smart irrigation Data collection
    that is representative of the real dynamic system is challenging. When more data
    is provided, machine learning can be used in data-driven modelling to fit data
    and make predictions when more data is required. Some of the challenges encountered
    in data collection are discussed in this section. One of the major challenges
    affecting precision irrigation is the high cost of obtaining data in irrigation
    systems. To develop a data-driven model for smart irrigation, data about the soil,
    plant, and environment need to be monitored. Plant sensors need to monitor the
    physiological processes in plant-like crop water use. The different growth stages
    and their effect on the crop factors need to be established. The climatic factors
    that affect the rate of evapotranspiration need to be monitored in real-time,
    otherwise relying on historical data that is not representative of the real system.
    The data collection strategies and control methods are discussed in [4,15]. The
    challenges relating to data availability range from sampling frequency, incomplete
    data, sensor malfunction, working conditions, communication exceptions or database
    shutdown. This can affect the integrity of the experimental dataset collected,
    thereby resulting in poor model development. In addition, developing models from
    data requires capturing a large volume of data to represent the real systems and
    capture any variations. For example, in irrigation, the components of the agro-hydrological
    model vary from time to time. This variation must be captured, which makes the
    data collection process time-consuming. This may involve monitoring the dynamics
    for the entire season or year to get a representative model for the dynamics.
    Predictions are a key feature of data-driven models for irrigation optimization
    and intelligent decision-making. System boundaries define the capability of data-driven
    models. If the data is only a subsection of the field, the model may fail to make
    accurate predictions for an entire irrigation field. Therefore, it is pertinent
    to define the system boundaries and ensure model data development extends to the
    boundaries ensuring that only predictions made from the model boundaries are acted
    upon. The application of model predictive control in irrigation is still limited
    compared to processing industries. Large water and irrigation systems must reduce
    computation times and now incorporate data-driven model predictive control. In
    the future, there''s a need to model soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural
    systems as past studies stopped at simulation or implemented in a controlled environment
    agricultural system where disturbances to the model are minimized. Model predictive
    control can be applied to diverse aspects of precision agriculture to enhance
    agricultural productivity in the future. These application domains include aquaponics,
    hydroponics, viticulture, controlled environment agriculture, aquaculture, disease
    and pest control, and mechanization systems. 7. Conclusion Data-driven modelling
    in agriculture is on the rise due to the advancement of Internet of Things technologies
    and improved computational power. This article presents an overview of model predictive
    control over the past four decades, and data-driven model predictive control is
    discussed. From the review, model predictive control has been used in precision
    irrigation management, ranging from irrigation canal control, irrigation scheduling,
    stem water potential regulation, soil moisture regulation, and precipitation prediction
    and evapotranspiration. It is noted that for data-driven MPC to solve complex
    dynamic systems in irrigation, the availability of data, variability, boundary
    conditions and model evaluation must be harmonized for one to come up with a good
    representative model of the system. There is more research opportunity to explore
    on the application of data-driven modelling and controller development for predictive
    irrigation management. 8. Author contributions Conceptualization, EB; methodology,

    Location: Pune, India SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture, as the backbone of
    global food production, faces increasing challenges in the 21st century. The world''s
    population is Experiencing an unparalleled pace of growth, it is projected that
    by the year 2050, there will be over 9 billion mouths to feed. Coupled with climate
    change and resource constraints, this places immense pressure on the agricultural
    sector to boost productivity and sustainability. In this context, the concept
    of “smart agriculture” has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging technology,
    data, and advanced techniques to transform the way we grow and manage crops [1].
    At the heart of this transformation lies the efficient and precise Management
    of irrigation, a critical component for crop health and yield optimization. Traditional
    irrigation practices have often relied on scheduled watering or manual assessment
    of soil moisture levels, which can be inefficient, wasteful, and may not account
    for the dynamic environmental factors that affect crops. In response to these
    challenges, smart agriculture integrates cutting-edge technologies, data analytics,
    and machine learning to make irrigation more intelligent and resource-efficient.
    This article explores the application of deep learning, a subset of artificial
    intelligence (AI), to irrigation management within the context of smart agriculture[2].
    Smart agriculture, Precision agriculture, also referred to as digital farming,
    signifies a fundamental change in our approach to the cultivation of food. The
    integration of technological advances, data analytics, as well as automation synergistically
    harnesses their respective capabilities optimize agricultural processes. Within
    this framework, irrigation management holds a pivotal role, as water is a finite
    and increasingly scarce resource. Moreover, inefficient or excessive irrigation
    not only strains water resources but can also lead to soil degradation and environmental
    pollution[3]. To address these challenges, smart agriculture utilizes a diverse
    array of technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), imagery collection,
    and data analytics, are being used. These technological advancements provide an
    ongoing record of soil conditions, meteorological patterns, and the overall well-being
    of crops in real-time, leading to data-driven decision-making. One of the most
    promising branches of AI employed Deep learning is the subject matter under consideration
    within this particular situation [4]. Deep learning, a subfield within the domains
    of machine learning and artificial intelligence, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities
    in various fields, from the domains of image and voice recognition to the field
    of medical diagnostics, a wide range of applications have emerged autonomous driving.
    In agriculture, deep learning has found applications in crop disease detection,
    yield prediction, pest control, and irrigation management. Its potential in irrigation
    management is particularly intriguing, as it the ability to analyze several data
    sources, including moisture levels in the soil meters, weather forecasts, and
    satellite imaging, enables the generation of accurate and detailed insights timely
    decisions about irrigation needs. This can optimize water usage, reduce costs,
    and minimize the environmental footprint of agriculture[5]. A. Deep Learning for
    Irrigation Management Efficient irrigation management relies on a comprehensive
    understanding of the factors that influence soil moisture and crop water requirements.
    These factors include soil type, crop type, weather conditions, evapotranspiration
    rates, and historical irrigation practices. Deep learning models can ingest data
    from these sources and create complex, non-linear relationships, enabling accurate
    irrigation recommendations. One of the key benefits of using deep learning in
    irrigated management is its ability to enhance the capacity to efficiently handle
    and evaluate substantial quantities of data in real-time [6]. For example, soil
    moisture sensors placed at different depths in the field can provide continuous
    data on soil moisture content. Deep learning models can process this data and,
    based on historical information, make predictions about future moisture levels,
    thus informing when and how much to irrigate. These models can adapt to changing
    environmental conditions, providing a level of precision that traditional irrigation
    methods cannot achieve[7]. 1) Objectives To incorporate the ANN model for accurate
    data analysis, enabling precise irrigation control. To implement real-time data
    collection and monitoring for immediate response to changing agricultural conditions.
    To develop a decision support system that leverages ANN insights to guide irrigation
    decisions, improving crop health and resource efficiency. 2) Organization of the
    Study The work may be broken down into the following sections: Background of the
    proposed methods are provided in Section 2, an explanation of the methodology
    that underpins the recommended algorithm is provided in Section 3, Section 4 delivers
    the findings of the study, and Section 5 provides a conclusion. SECTION II. Related
    Work Conducted study addressing the incorporation of various machine learning
    techniques that have the potential to enhance irrigation decision management [8].
    The aim of this study was to examine the current research direction and practical
    application of machine learning methods, as well as the use of resulting machine
    learning models, in order to support farmers in the field of sustainable irrigation
    management. [9] This research conducted an examination of current academic literature
    about the use of deep learning methodologies in the agricultural domain during
    the past five years. This investigation aimed to identify and emphasize the noteworthy
    advancements made in this domain, as well as the challenges that have been successfully
    addressed. In addition, the author conducted a study on agricultural parameters
    that were monitored using the internet of things (IoT) technology. These values
    were then inputted into a deep learning system designed for purposes of analysis.
    [10] emphasized the key restrictions to agricultural output, conventional irrigation
    scheduling techniques, as well as the accompanying problems, Various initiatives
    and advancements have been undertaken In order to optimize water use efficiency
    (WUE), implementing sustainable agricultural practices that optimize water use
    and minimize waste providing an overview of several smart irrigation alternatives.
    [11] The inception of model predictive control (MPC) may be traced back to its
    first establishment, and its application in the field of precision irrigation
    is further elucidated. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis this study
    examines the use of data-driven modelling and predictive control models in the
    field of precision management of irrigation. Model predictive control (MPC) is
    being used in several applications related to irrigation canals, irrigation scheduling,
    stem water potential adjustment, soil moisture regulation, and plant disturbance
    prediction. [12] The main focus of this work revolves around the practical application
    of remote sensing technologies in the context of precision irrigation. The aforementioned
    methods are used to assess transpiration rates, including infrared thermography
    and the hydration status of crops agricultural characteristics. Precision agriculture
    has been incorporated as a vital component in the framework for reaching this
    aim. Using these strategies, the author may solve the issue of water scarcity,
    which is critical for agriculture. SECTION III. Background This section provides
    an overview of various algorithms, including in this study, we used several machine
    learning algorithms, including random forests, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and logistic
    regression CNN, by discussing their background and key features. A. Ann In the
    picture below, a neural network (ANN) model with two secret layers and partly
    linked nodes is shown. So many formative measurements are deciding factor in determining
    the number of input nodes. It is considered that there are I formative measures,
    which is denoted by the symbol x i (i=1,2,3,….I) . The overall input variables
    the amount of output variables both have a role when calculating the amount of
    neurons and layers that remain secret that are found in the hidden layer. It is
    presumable that there are W variables that are output to the system and N variables
    that are input to the system, denoted correspondingly as ξ w (w=1,2,3,…..,W) and
    η n (n=1,2,3,…..,N)[13].Overall the total of neurons with results is given from
    assumption that there are O reflecting measures, which are denoted by y o (o=1,2,3,…O)
    . The relationship between the measurements and the variables governs the connections
    between layers. The weights of the links among the input layer and hidden layer
    neurons are included in the W×I dimensional vector W I , which is denoted as W
    I . The linkage weights among buried layer neurons are included in the N×(W+N)
    dimensional vector, designated as W H . That linkage of weights between the results
    of the visible layer neurons and the neurons in the hidden layer are represented
    by the O×N -dimensional vector abbreviated as W o . In a neural network, each
    neuron has a nonlinear activation function.[14] Fig. 1. Ann architecture Show
    All B. Cnn The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a kind of artificial neural
    network (ANN) frequently employed in the domain of deep learning to analyze visual
    images. The term “convolutional neural network” (CNN) is often used to refer to
    a specific kind of neural network that is frequently used in the field of deep
    learning for the purposes of image recognition and processing. A convolutional
    neural network (CNN) has left three separate layers: the input layer, the hidden
    layer, and the output layer [15]. The intermediate layers inside a neural network
    with a feed-forward structure are often denoted as hidden layers due to the fact
    that the activation function as well as final convolution disguise the inputs
    and results of these layers. Convolutional layers constitute a subset of the concealed
    layers inside a convolutional neural network, which execute convolutions[16].
    Fig. 2. Cnn architecture Show All C. Lstm The model known as LSTM is used to identify
    whether network breaches have occurred. A specific extension of a recurrent neural
    network organisation, a DL model, is known as LSTM. For work on un-segmented data,
    relationship recognition patterns, voice recognition, including abnormal prediction
    in network traffic via IDSs, for example, LSTM may be utilised)[17]. The inputting
    gate, exit gate, remembering gate, and cell are the four basic parts of an LSTM
    system. Since cell memories usually only endure a limited time, three gates initially
    were used to define what information travels within and out of a cell. The figure
    below shows the LSTM for each phase of a cell. The horizontal uppermost line,
    which indicates the cell state, has a cell state implemented in it. As a result,
    when data has been completely regularised by gates in a cell state, the LSTM has
    no way to remove it. A cell contains important structural elements.[18]. Fig.
    3. structure of lstm cell Show All SECTION IV. Methodology The integration of
    ANN in irrigation management represents a cutting-edge advancement in smart agriculture.
    This methodology leverages the power of deep learning and attention mechanisms
    to optimize irrigation strategies. The objective is to dynamically schedule irrigation,
    enhance crop health, and conserve resources. The methodology encompasses data
    collection, pre-processing, ANN model training, real-time monitoring, and user-friendly
    interfaces for seamless interaction. Fig. 4. Proposed flowchart Show All A. Dataset
    Description In this study, we collected data from below website: https://www.kaggle.com/code/triptmann/irrigation
    - scheduling-for-smart-agriculture/input. This dataset comprises a collection
    of images capturing moisture and temperature information. It includes numerical
    data representing various features such as meteorological conditions, soil moisture
    levels, and the identification of specific crop types. The primary goal of this
    system is to facilitate automatic water supply management based on the gathered
    information. B. Pre-Processing Steps for Classification The objective is the objective
    of this research is to investigate the impact of various pre-processing techniques
    on the precision of the results many core convolutional networks. The next section
    presents a number of pre-processing approaches. Eliminate Noise The process of
    noise elimination, especially in image datasets, often involves various techniques
    and methods specific to the characteristics of the images. The information regarding
    which images are considered for noise elimination, the criteria for selection,
    or the methodology used to eliminate noise would typically be documented or described
    in the methodology section, associated documentation, or supplementary materials
    provided with the dataset. To calm down the agitation whenever a function known
    as Gaussian is applied to blur an image, a blur that resembles a Gaussian is the
    result. One of the goals of this common graphics effect the objective is to reduce
    the level of visual clutter. Gaussian smoothing is often used as a preprocessing
    step in computer vision algorithms. This action is being undertaken with the purpose
    of to enhance visual architectures across different scales. C. Train_test Split
    The dataset has been partitioned into separate test and training sets based upon
    the user-specified splitting ratio after all preparation procedures are finished.
    The models will then be validated using the test data after being properly trained
    using this segmented train data. Train the Network The train dataset is used for
    training the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    algorithms, together with the suggested Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
    The effectiveness of the suggested model is evaluated and compared with the existing
    models assistance offered by CNN and LSTM. The performance metrics enumerated
    below are utilized to assess the quality of the recommended algorithm. D. Performance
    Metrics Metrics such Accuracy, sensibility, precision, along with the F1-score
    are often used as evaluation metrics to examine the performance of an algorithm
    in relation to the performance measures derived from the confusion matrix. Accuracy:
    The term “identification rate” refers to the ratio of accurately identified individuals
    to the total count of disciplines. Accuracy= TP+TN TP+TN+FP+FN View Source Sensitivity:
    Recall, which is also referred to as sensitivity, denotes the proportion the computer
    system in question demonstrates a high level of accuracy in identifying and classifying
    labels as positive. Sensitivity= TP TP+FN View Source Precision: By considering
    the total count of accurate forecasts, it is possible to assess the level of accuracy
    in a forecast. This idea also goes by the name of predictive value. Precision=
    TP TP+FP View Source F1-Score: The F1-score is a quantitative metric that integrates
    both remembrance and accuracy. F1−score= 2 ∗ Precisiso n ∗ Recall Precision+Recall

    as specificity. Specificity= TN TN+FP View Source Where, TP True Positive TN True
    Negative FP False Positive FN False Negative SECTION V. Results Ann Fig. 5. Show
    All The confusion matrix of the proposed ANN architecture shows that Temp data
    are correctly identified 474 times and misclassified as moisture data 26 times.
    Moisture data are correctly predicted 475 times, with 25 misclassifications. The
    model exhibits good accuracy in distinguishing between non-defected and defected
    images. Cnn Fig. 6. Show All The provided confusion matrix illustrates the CNN
    architecture''s performance in distinguishing between temp (0) and moisture (1)
    data. The proposed method correctly identified 434 temp data but misclassified
    66 as moisture data. Additionally, it accurately predicted 401 moisture data but
    had 99 misclassifications. These results showcase the model''s strengths in accurate
    identification while also revealing areas for potential refinement in reducing
    misclassifications. Lstm Fig. 7. Show All The confusion matrix for the LSTM architecture
    reveals that it correctly identified 442 temp data, but misclassified 58 as moisture
    data. For moisture data, it achieved 412 correct predictions, but there were 88
    misclassifications. The model demonstrates a reasonably good performance in distinguishing
    between temp data and moisture data. However, it still exhibits certain classification
    errors. The model could be enhanced by investigating alternative hybrid deep learning
    models, which include the ANN model that has been given, in order to appropriately
    detect and tackle casting difficulties. Performance indicators like Accuracy,
    Sensitivity, etc. Specificity are computed to assess the efficacy of the architectures.
    The results are shown as follows: Fig. 8. Show All The previous graph makes it
    clear that The precision of the recommended artificial neural network (ANN) is
    The assessment and comparison were performed using two more models, namely the
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as well as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Consequence
    of this phenomenon is that proposed model beat the LSTM and CNN, producing an
    accuracy score of 97.24 as opposed to the recommended model''s scores of 95.68
    and 93.39. Fig. 9. Show All The performance of the recommended ANN The evaluation
    and comparison of the two more models, LSTM and CNN, is apparent from the given
    context following graph. The specificity value for ANN is 96.08. This led to the
    suggested model outperforming both CNN et LSTM, with specificity scores for the
    model suggested of 93.12, 94.84, respectively. Fig. 10. Show All The accompanying
    graph compares and contrasts the performance of the CNN and LSTM models with that
    of the proposed model ANN. The sensitivity value for ANN is 95.98. The model that
    was suggested performed better than CNN (92.37) nor LSTM (93.66). Table I. Architectures
    and values SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper presents a ground breaking advancement
    in modernizing agricultural practices by integrating Artificial Neural Networks
    (ANN) into irrigation management. The study''s core objectives encompass achieving
    precise irrigation control through accurate data analysis, implementing real-time
    data collection and monitoring, and establishing a decision support system leveraging
    ANN insights to optimize crop health and resource utilization. This integration
    of ANN represents a significant leap in smart agriculture, harnessing deep learning
    and attention mechanisms to fine-tune irrigation strategies. The evaluation of
    three key models such as ANN, LSTM, and CNN revealed compelling insights into
    their performance. The ANN model emerged as the standout performer across all
    metrics. With an accuracy of 97.24%, it outperformed both the LSTM (95.68%) and
    CNN (93.39%). This higher accuracy underscores the ANN model''s superior capability
    in accurately classifying temperature and moisture data. Furthermore, the specificity
    and sensitivity values of the ANN model, at 96.08% and 95.98% respectively, surpass
    those of both the CNN and LSTM models. These figures indicate the ANN''s exceptional
    ability to distinguish between non-defected and defected images, providing critical
    insights for precise irrigation management. In terms of specificity, the ANN model
    excelled with a score of 96.08%, surpassing both the LSTM (94.84%) and CNN (93.12%)
    models. This highlights the ANN''s effectiveness in correctly identifying non-defected
    images. Additionally, the ANN model demonstrated impressive sensitivity with a
    value of 95.98%. This further cements its superiority over both the CNN (92.37%)
    and LSTM (93.66%) models in accurately detecting defected images. In summary,
    the ANN-based irrigation management system showcased in this study exhibits outstanding
    performance across all key metrics, making it the preferred choice for modernizing
    agricultural practices. Its exceptional accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity
    values indicate its potential to significantly enhance the sustainability and
    productivity of farming. By dynamically scheduling irrigation, improving crop
    health, and conserving resources, this approach holds immense promise for the
    future of agriculture. The integration of ANN technology presents a transformative
    path towards more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. Authors Figures

    IrrigationParticipatory processDrainageCo-learningScheduling 1. Introduction Poor
    to modest adoption of tools and practices by New Zealand (NZ) pastoral farmers
    to manage on-farm natural resources such as water has commonly resulted in inefficient
    resource use and unrealised economic potential (Turner et al., 2013; Ministry
    for Primary Industries (MPI), 2011; Van Housen, 2015). Based on an investigation
    of water use in three pastoral farms in Canterbury (NZ) for an irrigation season
    (2014–15), Van Housen (2015) reported that 47–64% of irrigations were unnecessary
    and could have been avoided, had appropriate irrigation scheduling practices been
    in place. The NZ Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) (2012) had estimated that
    if the bottom three quarters of least efficient pastoral farmers adopted the management
    practices currently used by the most efficient, the country could have achieved
    an additional NZ$3 billion revenue annually from increased exports, without a
    need for new technology. However, Hornbuckle et al. (2009), Lea-Cox (2012) and
    others indicated that the technological complexity of irrigation scheduling tools
    often inhibit their adoption by farmers. More often, end-users perceive such technologies
    as a burdensome layer of management and thus ignore (Lea-Cox, 2012). Several studies
    in NZ and elsewhere have associated the lack of user engagement in the process
    of developing tools and practices to their poor uptake (e.g. Nguyen et al., 2007;
    Bruges and Smith, 2009; Reid and Brazendale, 2014; Payne et al., 2018; Small et
    al., 2021 and others). Payne et al. (2018) investigated the impact of NZ Government
    funded on-farm science and technology transfer projects over the last decade,
    and concluded that those projects that generated realistic, immediate, take-home
    outcomes, that were affordable (time, money), acceptable (social license), available
    (timeliness), practical (use of existing infrastructure) and convenient (ease
    of implementation), achieved the desired impact. To develop such options, MPI
    (2012) concluded that there needs to be increased direct interaction between technology
    developers and users. With approaches such as transfer-of-technology, there is
    an absence of direct interaction between developers and receptors (Rogers, 2002
    and others). A lack of interaction could otherwise lead to mismatch in the understanding
    of the problem among stakeholders and end-users (hereafter, in this paper, the
    term stakeholder includes both stakeholders and end-users), resulting in tools
    and practices that are either irrelevant, ill-informed, or both, thus becoming
    a burden to the users (Nguyen et al., 2007, Lea-Cox, 2012). Developing tools and
    practices that are relevant, usable and translate science into practice requires
    engagement methods that accommodate multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives,
    and that utilise the skills and knowledge of those stakeholders in the design
    process (Forester, 1999, Klerkx and Nettle, 2013, Payne et al., 2018). Participatory
    approaches that promote a closer and direct interaction between technology developers
    and users, right from the genesis of an idea to its design, development and implementation,
    substantially enhance uptake (e.g. Röling, 2009; Turner et al., 2013; Vereijssen
    et al., 2017; and others). In this paper, using a chronologically-structured analysis
    of a case study, we describe how a co-learning based participatory process guided
    the cognitive and operational evolution of an on-farm irrigation scheduling tool.
    Using the case study, we track the starting conditions, and the emergence of a
    context and relevance as enabled by the co-learning process. The case study employed
    in this paper has previously been used to investigate various aspects of participatory
    process. Srinivasan et al. (2017) who published the original case study, indicated
    that its primary objective was to improve irrigation water use, by combining high-resolution
    weather forecast and on-farm irrigation demand monitoring. Srinivasan et al. (2017)
    and Verejissen et al. (2017) studied the evolution and refinement of the case
    study objectives when the researchers opted for a participatory co-learning approach
    instead of a transfer-of-technology-model. Once a participatory approach was adopted,
    Srinivasan et al. (2019) examined the case study activities and delineated the
    phases of the case study development, from initiation to implementation. Fielke
    and Srinivasan (2017) and Srinivasan and Elley (2018) examined the case study
    to understand the evolution of non-tangible outcomes such as community resilience
    and trust among stakeholders, respectively, as instigated by the participatory
    process. In this paper, we address the eventual objective of the case study, improved
    water use through improved information use. Here, the improved water use is examined
    within the context of adoption of improved irrigation scheduling practices. We
    examine the development of a tangible output, an irrigation management tool, that
    emerged from the co-learning process. We track the participatory process as it
    was informed and influenced by the stakeholders, and the eventual shape and structure
    of the output. The paper is targeted at researchers and resource managers who
    are considering employing a participatory approach in translating their science
    findings into usable tools and practices for end-users. 2. Case study description
    The case study was initiated as a pilot project in 2013/14 under the Endeavour
    Fund managed by the NZ Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE),
    to enhance the uptake of improved irrigation practices by pastoral farmers and
    to improve on-farm water use. The case study researchers sought to combine real-time
    soil water monitoring with short-term weather (rainfall) forecasting, to inform
    irrigation scheduling. Soil water monitoring has long been used as a proxy for
    irrigation demand – the question being “is the soil dry enough to trigger an irrigation
    today?” The case study researchers explored the use of rainfall forecasts as a
    proxy for the next two to six-days of irrigation supply. The question was phrased
    as “could the forecast rainfall be used to either delay a scheduled irrigation
    event or adjust the amount of irrigation applied today?” At the start of the case
    study, the researchers described the improvement in water use by counting the
    number of irrigation events that were delayed, altered, or completely skipped,
    based on current demand and forecast supply. A total of 10 irrigated pastoral
    farms in the Canterbury region (NZ) was chosen for the case study. The Canterbury
    region is the home of approximately two thirds of irrigated lands in NZ (StatsNZ,
    2017), and irrigation allocation in this region accounts for approximately 80%
    of nationally consented irrigation water use (Booker and Henderson, 2019). Each
    case study farm was instrumented with a rain gauge and soil moisture sensor under
    one irrigator. The rain gauge measured both rainfall and irrigation, and the soil
    moisture sensor measured soil water and soil temperature at 200 mm depth below
    soil surface at one location. This depth of soil water measurement and the number
    of monitoring sites per irrigator are typical of pastoral farms in the region.
    A schematic of the instrumentation is shown in Fig. 1a. Data were collected every
    10 min and telemetered every hour. The forecast data included two- and six-day
    weather predictions. The two day weather forecast was updated every six hours,
    and the six-day forecast updated every day. The weather forecasts included rainfall,
    relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed and direction. The data format,
    frequency, synthesis, display and sharing protocols, and instrumentation evolved
    during the case study, principally informed by the co-learning process. These
    are discussed in subsequent sections. Download : Download high-res image (378KB)

    Phase one instrumentation is shown in a and phase two instrumentation is shown
    in b. 3. Case study participatory approach Participatory approaches are commonly
    neither prescriptive nor pre-defined (Bruges and Smith, 2009). Instead of adhering
    to a singular, regimented tech-transfer pathway, these approaches are focused
    on enabling active participation of stakeholders right from the early stages of
    the research (Kloppenburg, 1991, Massey et al., 2006, Jakku and Thorburn, 2010).
    Botha et al. (2017) described that participatory approach as organically evolving
    in response to stakeholder engagement. In the case study described here, a co-learning
    based participatory approach that focused on fostering learning among stakeholders
    was employed. The participatory process employed operating principles described
    in Nederlof et al. (2011) and Coutts et al. (2017) as a guide to engagement. The
    key principles used were: taking time to view and understand the problem from
    multiple (stakeholder) perspectives; applying equal value to all sources of knowledge;
    providing an atmosphere that fosters learning among stakeholders (co-learning)
    by actively listening and understanding; staying aware of wider (problem) context
    to balance between short-term outcomes and long-term vision; and remaining flexible
    and adaptable as the co-learning process requires. The co-learning process employed
    in the case study did not seek to confirm, validate or establish a perspective,
    preference, knowledge source or value held by any one group (e.g. researchers
    or farmers). Instead, it sought ways to contextualise water-use practices by encompassing
    stakeholder perspectives and evolving a relevant, legitimate and adaptable set
    of practices and tools. In the case study, co-learning between case study researchers
    and pilot farmers occurred through several one-on-one and group interactions at
    various stages. These interactions, engagement phases and evidence collected during
    each phase are described in detail in Srinivasan et al. (2019). Initially (2014–15),
    the researchers sought farmers’ interest and consent in participating in the case
    study. Interactions then moved to setting up instruments on farms and training
    the farmers to access data, and finally transitioning into end-of-the-season workshops
    that included all case study stakeholders. Co-learning between other stakeholders
    (regulators, government representatives, industry professionals, irrigation scheme
    managers and other non-participant farmers in the study region), researchers and
    pilot farmers occurred routinely at the end-of-the-season workshops (referred
    to as workshop(s) hereafter), where the group discussed the irrigation practices
    and outcomes from the previous irrigation season, and periodically during day-to-day
    operational interactions. Additionally, the researchers used the workshop as an
    opportunity to gather feedback on the data provided to the pilot farmers (more
    on this in subsequent sections) and their ease of use in supporting irrigation
    decisions. The workshop also focused on dissecting specific irrigation events
    to learn from them - understanding the accuracy of weather forecasts provided;
    incorporating weather forecast uncertainty into decision-making; discussing the
    usefulness and timeliness of data provided; assessing the need for additional
    data collection and sharing to support irrigation decisions; and considering other
    farm-specific challenges to managing irrigation such as availability of water
    supply, irrigation infrastructure limitations, staff capacities and capabilities,
    and others. At the workshop, the group discussed changes (on-farm operational
    as well as data collection, syntheses and presentation procedures) that could
    be implemented in the subsequent irrigation season to support more efficient irrigation
    practices. For example, for farmers, this could be a change in irrigation frequency
    or amount. For researchers, this adaption could be considering options for additional
    data collection, processing and sharing. The majority of co-learning happened
    at these workshops as all key stakeholders were present, enriching the discussions
    by sharing their perspectives and understanding others’. Co-learning emerged from
    the participatory process and the evolution of the irrigation scheduling tool
    was captured in three distinct, sequential phases. Each phase represented approximately
    two irrigation seasons. This much time was needed for the operation of the instrumentation
    to stabilise (in this case, it is the time for the soil moisture sensors to settle
    in the soil and provide reliable data), and for the stakeholders to become familiar
    with the newly available information and provide meaningful feedback. Phase one
    (alignment with existing practices) describes the early stages of the engagement
    process with stakeholders. The co-learning from this phase led to phase two, deviation
    from existing practices, where the understanding of irrigation water use broadened
    and the need for non-conventional data collection protocols emerged. Phase three,
    making the invisible visible, represents the emergence of a matured product, an
    irrigation scheduling tool, that culminated from co-learning process. The tool
    though existed in one form or other across all three phases, evolved and matured,
    guided by the co-learning process. 4. Phase 1: Alignment with existing practices
    At the time of the case study initiation (2014–15), those pastoral farmers that
    monitored soil water to schedule irrigation, monitored at a depth of 200 mm below
    surface. For pasture, generally a rootzone of 400–500 mm is assumed (Porteous
    et al., 1994) and the 200 mm depth is assumed to represent the midpoint. In accordance
    with the existing convention, at the start of the case study, soil moisture sensors
    were installed at 200 mm depth (see Fig. 1a). Also, unless there are distinct
    spatial differences in soil drainage properties or crop types, farmers generally
    monitored soil water at one location under each irrigator and scheduled irrigations
    accordingly. Generally, farmers are advised by irrigation consultants to schedule
    irrigation when soil water is at or close to stress point, and not to irrigate
    when soil water is at, near, or above full point. Stress point is crop-specific,
    and is an empirical representation of a condition below which a crop would exhibit
    water stress and thus a decline in growth. For pasture, stress point is typically
    50% of plant available water (PAW), a soil physical property that can be readily
    obtained from published soil databases such as S-Map (Lilburne et al., 2012).
    Full point is soil specific. It represents a condition when PAW is at 100% and
    the available soil storage is zero. Any addition of water to a soil at or above
    full point results in drainage or overland flow. Brown (2007), KC et al. (2018)
    and others had examined irrigation scheduling practices in Canterbury pastoral
    farms and reported that farmers seldom wait until stress point to trigger an irrigation,
    to avoid the risk of production loss from water stress. During phase one of the
    case study, the current irrigation demand (soil water observations) and forecast
    irrigation supply (rainfall) data were collated into a report and shared with
    the pilot farmers every day via email. The daily report included: • Last seven
    days of observed rainfall, irrigation, soil water, and soil temperature (both
    soil water and soil temperature were derived from the same soil moisture sensor
    buried at 200 mm depth); • Last seven days of estimated evapotranspiration based
    on weather observations from the nearest weather station; • Next two days of three-hourly
    rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed and direction; and
    • Next six days of daily rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind
    speed and direction A sample of the daily report is shown in Fig. 2. Even though
    the two-day forecast was updated every six hours, emails were sent out only once
    a day, the pilot farmers received only one forecast per day, the last updated
    forecast. Download : Download high-res image (382KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Daily update of (a) current demand and (b) forecast supply conditions
    at the case study farms. Phase one version of demand and supply data shared with
    the case study farmers. To increase the co-learning opportunities, irrigation
    and soil water data from all case study farms were collated in the daily report
    and shared with all recipients. This was to allow the pilot farmers see others’
    irrigation practices and soil water conditions with the aim of instigating moments
    of reflection and learning, which are discussed in detail in Srinivasan and Elley
    (2018). During this phase, and over the entire case study, the researchers neither
    advised the pilot farmers on making irrigation decisions, nor interfered with
    the ones they made. This was done deliberately as the wider goal of the case study
    was to co-produce a tool that was easy-to understand and use without the need
    for any expert input and guidance. Thus, the researchers confined their role to
    collecting and presenting the data. Also, the researchers did not have specific
    knowledge of on-farm conditions, such as a broken irrigator, non-availability
    of irrigation supply, staff availability, or stock movement, so were not ideally
    placed to provide farm-specific irrigation advice. However, at the workshops,
    the stakeholders talked about reasons behind specific irrigation decisions and
    practices during the previous season and the learnings that occurred from observing
    peers (see, Srinivasan and Elley, 2018). 5. Co-learning from existing practices
    (phase one) 5.1. Description of water use After the first two complete irrigation
    seasons (2015–16 and 2016–17), as the stakeholders had become familiar with the
    aim of the case study and the co-learning approach employed, the operational definition
    of water use as a metric of improved irrigation practice began to evolve. This
    is captured in Table 1, along with a description of drivers, perspectives and
    aims of specific stakeholder group. Table 1. Evolution of the description of improved
    water use by stakeholders and end-users through the participatory co-learning
    process. Empty Cell Driver Constraint Aim Changes to irrigation scheduling questiona
    Researcher An opportunity to combine real-time soil water monitoring and short-term
    rainfall forecast to improve water use Poor uptake of tools and practices Use
    of a co-learning based participatory approach to develop a tool for operational
    irrigation scheduling (technological efficiency) Would an irrigation event today
    be justified based on current soil water conditions and forecast rainfall? Farmer
    An opportunity to maintain or maximise production using improved irrigation scheduling
    and saving money by reducing the number of irrigation events using weather forecast

    forecast information to support irrigation decisions Schedule irrigation that
    supports pasture productivity (production efficiency) Would missing an irrigation
    event today impact pasture growth? Regulator An opportunity to minimise leaching
    by minimising drainage Absence of farm-specific field evidence on drainage from
    irrigation practices Schedule irrigation that minimises the loss of water from
    the rootzone, thereby minimising leaching potential (environmental efficiency)
    Would an irrigation event today cause drainage and leaching? a The original irrigation
    scheduling question was, “is irrigation needed today based on soil water conditions?”
    As the researchers regularly interact with state-of-the-art technologies such
    as high-resolution weather forecasting models and soil moisture sensors, and diverse
    climate, soils and hydrology datasets, they described improved water use as a
    way of scheduling irrigation using real-time soil water monitoring in the rootzone
    and short-term rainfall forecast. In other words, by combining data from multiple
    sources (specific on-farm observations and localised, high-resolution weather
    model forecasts) and time scales (current and future). The researchers sought
    to extend the conventional irrigation scheduling question from “is irrigation
    needed today based on current demand?” to “is irrigation justified today based
    on current demand and forecast supply?”. Relevant local government representatives
    (regional council regulators) were also invited to the workshops. They are the
    custodians and administrators of water resources in the region, responsible for
    both quantity and quality, water allocation and water use monitoring, and are
    focused on responsible resource use. Regulators are increasingly concerned that
    drainage from irrigation and rainfall leach nutrients below the rootzone into
    groundwater; thus, it is important to control drainage to contain the possibility
    of leaching (Robson et al., 2015). Although rainfall-drainage may not be able
    to be controlled, regulators focused on minimising irrigation-drainage. This phase
    of the case study coincided with the emergence of the Regional Council’s Matrix
    of Good Management (MGM) initiative. MGM represented the compilation of recommended
    irrigation practices to reduce nutrient leaching (Robson et al., 2015, MGM., 2015).
    Thus, the regulators defined improved water use as irrigation scheduling that
    minimises drainage. They framed their question as “would an irrigation today result
    in drainage and leaching?” as opposed to the conventional question, “is irrigation
    needed today based on current demand?”. For farmers, irrigation is one of the
    key inputs to agricultural production; they were therefore focused on a scheduling
    approach that supported the productivity objective. Often farmers erred on the
    side of scheduling an irrigation event rather than skipping one, as they perceive
    that the production repercussions were less damaging from irrigating than by skipping
    (Brown, 2007, KC et al., 2018). Thus, farmers’ definition of improved water use
    revolved around maintaining soil water conditions that did not impede production.
    Instead of asking “is irrigation needed today based on demand?” they asked, “would
    not irrigating today compromise the production?”. 5.2. Evidence for good irrigation
    scheduling The existing soil moisture sensor configuration (deployment at 200 mm
    depth) helped farmers to trigger irrigation events before the soil dropped to
    stress point but did not provide evidence to the regulator on irrigation-drainage.
    At one of the workshops during phase one, the researchers, using a simple water
    balance model, presented an estimate of seasonal drainage that would have occurred
    in the case study farms based on actual irrigation and rainfall data. This estimation
    was done by summarising daily rainfall, irrigation and evaporation data for each
    soil PAW, assuming any water in excess of PAW would have been lost from the rootzone
    through drainage. Even though the modelled estimates were useful in evaluating
    how well the farms performed with drainage, the timing (after the irrigation season)
    and time resolution (seasonal as opposed to individual irrigation event scale)
    of these drainage estimates did not help the farmers to learn about individual
    drainage events and alter their irrigation practices operationally. Nor could
    the seasonal drainage estimates categorically identified which irrigation events
    had resulted in drainage and what practices could have minimised those drainage
    events. The need for timely evidence of drainage for operational irrigation scheduling
    was a co-learning moment for researchers as it highlighted the absence of a dataset
    (real-time drainage) sought by stakeholders. 5.3. Data presentation During phase
    one of the case study, the meaningfulness of data collected, and their syntheses
    and presentation became a frequent discussion point among the stakeholders. A
    summary of these discussion points is captured below: • The soil moisture sensor
    at 200 mm depth did not provide conclusive evidence on drainage to the regulator
    and actionable intelligence for the pilot farmers to evaluate individual irrigation
    events; • Each daily email update only contained the last seven days of data which
    meant that the pilot farmers had to go through their previous daily email updates
    to get a historical view of the season; • The presentation format of the weather
    forecast was perceived complex (expert user focused; see Fig. 2b), which meant
    that the pilot farmers had to spend time in reading and understanding the data
    to make a decision; and • The presentation of historical (last seven days) soil
    water and forecast weather data (specifically rainfall) separately within the
    same update and in different formats (compare Fig. 2a and b) meant that the pilot
    farmers had to work to bridge the two data streams, and surmise the likely impact
    of forecast rainfall on soil water conditions to make an irrigation scheduling
    decision. 6. Phase 2: Deviation from existing practices Srinivasan and Elley (2018)
    recorded that the focus of case study towards the end of phase 1 shifted from
    when to start the irrigation to maintain productivity (farmer focused), to when
    to start the irrigation to maintain productivity and stop the irrigation to prevent
    drainage (farmer and regulator focused). This meant that the farmers needed near
    real-time evidence of drainage, or absence of it, following each irrigation event.
    With the existing soil moisture sensor at 200 mm depth, it was possible to say
    when the full point was exceeded in the mid-section of the rootzone, but it was
    not possible to categorically conclude that the excess water drained below the
    rootzone (~400–500 mm). The possibility of the excess water being redistributed
    within the rootzone, between 200 and 500 mm depth, could not be discounted. To
    gather evidence about drainage, during 2017–18 irrigation season, the researchers
    introduced a multi-level soil moisture sensor (“profile sensor”). The profile
    sensor, buried vertically, measured soil water and soil temperature at every 100 mm
    interval at eight successive depths (see Fig. 1b for the profile sensor set up).
    The top 4/5 levels (0–400/500 mm) of the profile sensor measured soil water conditions
    within the rootzone (“irrigation trigger zone”) and the bottom 3/4 levels (400/500–800 mm),
    measured soil water conditions immediately below the rootzone (“drainage signal
    zone”). Once the profile sensor was installed, the case study farmers were presented
    with data from all eight depths. These new data showed the transit of water within
    and between irrigation and drainage zones (see an example in Fig. 3). The case
    study farmers were trained to manage their irrigation scheduling based on soil
    water conditions within the irrigation zone, and assess the movement of water
    below the rootzone by following the changes (increases) in soil water in the drainage
    zone immediately following irrigation events. The profile sensor did not quantify
    the amount of water drained below the rootzone but signalled the occurrence and
    timing of drainage. This was enough for the farmers and regulators to understand
    the impact of individual irrigation event in near real-time. Download : Download

    Phase two version of near-real time update of demand and supply information provided
    to the farmers. 6.1. Enabling learning from accessing historical practices Co-learning
    from phase one helped to advance phase two in several aspects. This included the
    adoption of a new multi-depth soil water and soil temperature data collection
    scheme to address the evolving needs of farmers and regulators, a data sharing
    platform (website) to allow 24/7 data access, and access to historical data at
    ease. During irrigation seasons 2017–18 and 2018–19, following the installation
    of profile sensors, to enable farmers view historical data, the demand and forecast
    data were presented through a generic telemetry website built and operated by
    the host research agency (NIWA). The daily email update was discontinued, and
    all data sharing occurred via this website. The option of allowing each pilot
    farmer to view others’ data was retained. The website was not exclusively developed
    for the case study; it collates and displays a wide range of environmental data
    collected by the host research agency. Farmers were trained in using the website
    to access the data. On-farm measurements were made available in near-real time
    (less than 60-min delay). No changes were made to the forecast data presentation
    from phase one. The demand and forecast data streams were still maintained separately
    as they arrive from two different sources – demand data from on-farm monitoring
    and forecast data from numerical weather models run every six hours by the host
    research agency (NIWA). However, as the website was active 24/7, the two-day forecast
    was updated every six hours as new forecasts became available. Because of the
    number of soil water time-series data to be displayed (eight, one from each depth),
    the line plot visual became busier than before and reading the soil water trends
    at various depths became a challenge (compare Figs. 2a and 3). While farmers were
    advised to read the soil water traces selectively – say, a trace each from the
    irrigation and drainage zones - it became evident that there was a need to develop
    a more meaningful data display system to fully realise the potential of profile
    sensor data. The complexity of displaying multiple soil water traces and the format
    mismatches in the presentation of current demand and forecast supply data made
    the tool less accessible for easy decision-making. These challenges provided the
    researchers with a new set of co-learning moments. Phase three began with a search
    for a better data integration and presentation scheme. 7. Phase 3: making the
    invisible visible During irrigation seasons 2017–18 and thereafter, following
    the introduction of profile sensor and provision of soil water and forecast data
    via a generic website, the researchers turned their attention to combining current
    demand and forecast supply data into a seamless product. An exclusive web portal
    (IrriMate™; https://i2.niwa.co.nz/) was designed to display the data from 2018
    to 19 season. The web portal included the following: • Display of current daily
    rainfall, irrigation, and potential evapotranspiration conditions and forecast
    rainfall and potential evapotranspiration conditions; • Current and forecast soil
    water conditions; • Updated weather forecast every six hours and current conditions
    every hour; • Ability for users to scroll back to view all available historical
    data, and zooming in and out of any specific periods of interest; • Daily minimum
    and maximum soil temperature data at 100 mm depth; • Daily modelled pasture production
    data; and • Provision of a water balance by summarising daily rainfall, irrigation
    and evapotranspiration data to estimate soil water excess, or deficit The IrriMate
    design allowed inclusion of other data such as measured on-farm water use, although
    that was not measured as a direct component of the case study. One of the co-learnings
    that occurred early during the case study was that farmers’ preferred to access
    all irrigation related data (demand, supply and use) from one portal (even if
    not from one source), hence IrriMate was designed to be adaptable and flexible
    to bring external data steams other than those collected in the case study. Following
    the installation of profile sensors, the farmers saw an opportunity to access
    soil temperature data at 100 mm depth. Based on field observations and analysis
    of pasture growth and soil temperature data from various pasture growing regions
    of NZ, Charlton et al. (1986) concluded that soil temperature at 100 mm depth
    is a good indicator of pasture growth potential, and, thus, nutrient and water
    use. So, generally farmers are advised to monitor soil temperature at 100 mm depth
    before starting (or ending) an irrigation season as soil temperature dips below
    optimal growing conditions during these shoulder seasons. With the profile sensor,
    the case study farmers saw an opportunity to objectively begin and end an irrigation
    season based on soil temperature measurements at 100 mm depth. Access to soil
    temperature was not possible before the installation of profile sensor. This data
    stream was added to the IrriMate portal on the farmers’ initiative. Similarly,
    daily water use data, which was not measured as a part of the case study, was
    added to the IrriMate portal based on the researchers’ initiative. The core component
    of IrriMate was the insight plot, an integrated visual representation of soil
    water data both spatially and temporally (see Fig. 4). It visually revealed the
    soil drying and wetting patterns, soil water transfer within and between irrigation
    and drainage zones, and changes in soil water based on historical and forecast
    weather conditions. The insight plot enabled stakeholders to visualise the relationship
    between inputs (rainfall, irrigation and evapotranspiration) and output (soil
    water conditions) in near-real time as well as in a forecast mode. This cause-and-effect
    relationship was previously invisible, and the insight plot has made it visible.

    Phase three version of the multi-faceted portal co-designed through a co-learning
    process. The IrriMate portal and insight plot were designed to show the timing
    and duration of drainage events. The rainfall, irrigation, water use and evapotranspiration
    data were summarised as daily data and soil water and soil temperature data were
    summarised as hourly to 2-hourly data. By zooming in, users could identify the
    start and end of a drainage event (daily resolution) and link that back to the
    irrigation or rainfall event that had caused it. In case of irrigation events
    that had resulted in drainage, farmers were encouraged to explore options such
    as varying irrigation amounts and/or frequency, and trigger times. For example,
    if drainage was recorded after an irrigation event, and if the irrigation infrastructure
    does not allow altering the amount of irrigation applied, subsequent irrigation
    events could be started at a drier soil water condition. If irrigation amount
    could be altered, then the irrigation could be triggered at the same or similar
    soil water condition, but less water could be applied. The implementation of these
    options relies on the availability of irrigation supply on-demand if irrigations
    are delayed to a drier condition, and the capability of the irrigation infrastructure
    if irrigation amounts are to be varied. The IrriMate portal and insight plot served
    multiple purposes as described below: (1) Spatially (within the soil profile,
    0–800 mm depth), it reduced the complexity of reading multiple soil water traces
    from individual depths into a continuous and intuitive colour plot (compare Fig.
    3, Fig. 4 for changes in soil water representation in phases two and three, respectively).
    This was achieved by standardising the soil water data at each depth using depth-specific
    full point estimated from historical data. (2) Temporally, it integrated current
    soil water and forecast supply data into one seamless product. This was achieved
    by deriving forecast soil water data using current soil water, and forecast rainfall
    and evapotranspiration data. This eliminated the guesswork by the farmer in combining
    demand and supply data streams. (3) Historically, farmers could retrace and see
    their irrigation practices over a period to understand the dynamic relationship
    between cause (rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration) and effect (soil water
    changes and drainage) and any observable changes in their irrigation behaviour
    (4) Educationally, the combined spatial and temporal plot provided farmers with
    a knowledge of wetting (from rainfall and irrigation) and drying (from evapotranspiration)
    patterns of their soils and their variability over the season. The insight plot
    also highlighted the differences in wetting patterns and water redistribution
    within the soil profile resulting from rainfall and irrigation events as they
    differ in their intensities (5) For compliance purposes, the occurrence and timing
    of drainage provided regulators the needed evidence of good irrigation practices.
    Regulators could temporally align drainage events to irrigation and rainfall events.
    In a few cases, the insight plot captured the rise of water table, or lateral
    flow, which was by picked up by increases in soil water without any addition of
    rainfall or irrigation (6) Operationally, the insight plot allowed farmers to
    evaluate the response of their paddock to irrigation scheduling practices. This
    meant they could identify the optimal soil water conditions to start an irrigation
    event, or optimal irrigation amount that could be applied at an existing soil
    water condition without causing a drainage. The farmers could begin and end an
    irrigation season based on soil temperature measured at 100 mm depth. (7) From
    a production perspective, the insight plot further evolved to include modelled
    daily pasture production data based on available soil water, sunshine hours and
    solar radiation. As farmers control soil water through irrigation practices, they
    could visualise variations in pasture production. More details on the formulations
    used in developing various components of insight plot and methods used for standardising
    and forecasting soil water data are available in Srinivasan et al. (in preparation).
    7.1. An example of self-learning using the insight plot One of the aims of the
    case study was to develop a tool that is self-explanatory and easy to use, a requirement
    highlighted in many previous studies (e.g. Nguyen et al., 2007; Payne et al.,
    2018, and others). One of the pilot farms was moderately limited by irrigation
    infrastructure. The travelling irrigator on that farm was on a rotation between
    paddocks and had a return period of eight to nine days. Within each paddock, the
    irrigator speed could be varied to apply anywhere between 21 and 39 mm. These
    limitations led to relatively large and infrequent irrigation applications which
    presented two risks. From the regulator’s perspective, a large application of
    irrigation per event could potentially result in drainage if soils could not retain
    it. From farmer’s perspective, the long gap between irrigation applications could
    result in soil drying below the stress point and impacting pasture growth. Based
    on the insight plot, using a trial and error approach, the pilot farmer learned
    to devise a routine that would ensure continued productivity while limiting drainage,
    without having to invest in a new irrigation infrastructure. The pilot-farmer’s
    self-learning is captured in the insight plot shown in Fig. 5. To start with,
    the pilot farmer was not sure how much irrigation to apply per event (21 or 39 mm,
    or somewhere in between) to balance between production and drainage outcomes.
    But using a trial-and-error method and by following the insight plot after each
    irrigation event, the pilot farmer was able to find an optimal irrigation amount
    that would fit an eight to nine-day return period without causing any drainage.
    Between irrigation events, the soil water within the top 200 mm dropped to stress
    point, but there still was enough water within the root zone between 200 and 400/500 mm
    depth to support pasture growth. The availability of additional water would not
    have been picked by the soil moisture sensor at one depth as done in phase one
    and would have convinced the pilot farmer that they were losing production. However,
    a complete knowledge of soil water conditions within the rootzone gave the pilot
    farmer the confidence that they were not losing out on potential production. During
    this period, the pilot farmer independently measured pasture growth to have additional,
    independent evidence. The initial few irrigation events resulted in drainage,
    but over the six-week period shown Fig. 5, the pilot farmer had settled on an
    optimal irrigation amount and frequency based on infrastructure limitation. Through
    this self-learning exercise, the pilot farmer was able to avoid investing in a
    new irrigation infrastructure that would allow them to apply less water more frequently.
    According to Fazey and Schultz (2009) such experimentation by the farmer is a
    hallmark of adaptive management – a means of actively seeking new ways of doing
    things to influence outcomes and learning about the system being managed. Download

    plot to balance between irrigation amount and frequency, drainage and pasture
    growth. 8. Discussion 8.1. Roles of context, relevancy and legitimacy Many studies
    have concluded that the uptake of tools and practices among farmers would increase
    if they (farmers) perceive the information provided is beneficial and relevant
    (Daberkow and McBride, 2003, Adrian et al., 2005, Pierpaoli et al., 2013, Reid
    and Brazendale, 2014, Payne et al., 2018). In this study, the stakeholders helped
    to describe the context (“improved water use”) and the legitimacy and relevancy
    of the irrigation scheduling tool developed within that context. Cash et al. (2003)
    presented comprehensive definitions of relevancy and legitimacy. Relevancy is
    the usefulness of the information provided to the needs of the decision makers
    and legitimacy refers to the perception that the information respectful of stakeholders’
    divergent values and beliefs (Cash et al., 2003; pg 8086). Here, we describe legitimacy
    as the acceptability of IrriMate as a tool to schedule irrigation by the farmer
    and the insight plot as an evidence of irrigation practice. When the case study
    was launched, the researchers hypothesised that adoption of soil water monitoring
    and weather forecasting for irrigation scheduling would improve water use. However,
    the co-learning process revealed additional layers that refined the context of
    improved water use. Such an evolution of perspective is central to a co-learning
    process, which happens when researchers seek a wider perspective to the problem
    and start including values and knowledge from all sources (Coutts et al., 2017).
    The establishment of context (e.g. Table 1) strengthened the relevancy of the
    tool as it encompassed multiple perspectives to improved water use. When the first
    version of the tool was developed (phase one), it was designed to specifically
    fit the existing landscape (soil moisture sensor @ 200 mm as well as presenting
    soil water data as a line trace; Fig. 2a). When the co-learning process enabled
    the stakeholders to voice their expectation of data needs to improve water use
    (see Table 1), it became evident that the current (then) technology needed to
    be revisited to meet the expectations. Operationally, both regulators and farmers
    needed irrigation-event based, (near) real-time evidence to know the impact of
    irrigation practices, which the then technology did not offer. This provided an
    impetus to look for other options such as the profile sensor. The introduction
    of profile sensor, IrriMate portal and insight plot challenged the conventional
    practice, an outcome of participatory process reported in many other studies (e.g.
    Burges and Smith 2009; McEntee, 2016). A visual representation of cause-and-effect
    (drainage followed by irrigation or rainfall) provided a compelling evidence and
    learning opportunity for the pilot farmers to alter their practices. The inclusion
    of modelled pasture production data linked to on-farm soil water conditions helped
    farmers to understand the relationship between the two. Burges and Smith (2009)
    concluded that such cause-and-effect evidence is an important component of a decision
    support tool. The participatory process induced a similar change in the way researchers
    presented forecast data during the first two phases. The co-learning process enabled
    them to redesign the forecast data presentation (compare Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig.
    4 for an evolution of data presentation). According to Cox (1996), this represents
    an analytical phase of a tool development process where the professional models
    are deconstructed to suit the intended purpose. The inclusion of regulators in
    the participatory process assisted with its context and legitimacy. The regulators
    were able to gain a first-hand account of data collected on farm and their limits
    and use in making irrigation decisions that are directly linked to resource use.
    When they identified a gap in the data collected (evidence for drainage and impending
    drainage controls through MGM process), they provided a context for the researchers
    to introduce the profile sensor. Roth et al. (2010) highlighted the importance
    of contextualising practices to allow end-users to understand their impacts. Regulators
    presented the imminent context that the farmers would need to provide evidence
    of good management practices, and this allowed the launch of the profile sensor
    technology. The importance of such an alignment of technology and context has
    been reported by Lindblom et al. (2017), Rose et al. (2018), and others. By acknowledging
    the value of data provided by the profile sensors, the regulators legitimised
    their (profile sensors’) application. The profile sensor did not quantify the
    drainage, but signalled its timing and occurrence, which the regulators considered
    a sufficiently defensible evidence of irrigation practice. Through their interaction
    with the researchers and farmers during the engagement process, the regulators
    understood the financial challenges and technical feasibility in quantifying drainage
    in every farm. 8.2. Experimentation and learning by doing In the case study, co-learning
    led to the development of IrriMate portal and insight plot that enabled experimentation.
    Insight plot led to an environment that allowed learning-by-doing and doing-by-learning
    through experimentation, the two key learning methods described in Bos et al.
    (2013) and others. The example of self-learning described earlier highlights the
    experimentation process. Such experimentation is a key enquiry step that leads
    to adapting new practices (Van der Brugge and Rotmans, 2007; Raven et al., 2010;
    Loorbach, 2010; Rotmans and Loorbach, 2010; Bos et al., 2013, and others). Even
    though the researchers consciously decided not to provide any irrigation decision
    advice, the insight plot provided the opportunity for experimentation on farm.
    As the researchers shared the data in near-real time, the pilot farmers were able
    to experiment and practice various options to arrive at a desired outcome(s).
    Such experimentation included a cycle of plan-do-observe-reflect. This learning
    cycle has been reported by Boyce et al. (2016) and others. Experimentation using
    the insight plot triggered three levels of knowledge as described in Kaiser and
    Fuhrer (2003), Garmendia and Stagl (2010), Bos et al. (2013) and others. Firstly,
    the plot provided an insight into the problem. The pilot farmers got the first-hand
    knowledge of the magnitude of irrigation impact on soil water conditions, drainage
    and pasture production. This knowledge was termed as declarative knowledge. Equipped
    with this declarative knowledge, through experimentation, the pilot farmers altered
    their irrigation practices to achieve multiple outcomes such as reduced drainage
    and unimpeded pasture growth. This procedural knowledge enabled farmers to understand
    multiplicity of options available to achieve the same outcomes. In the case study,
    these options could have been anywhere from altering the irrigation frequency
    to the amount of irrigation applied. According to Kaiser and Fuhrer (2003), Garmendia
    and Stagl (2010) and Bos et al. (2013), this procedural knowledge leads to an
    effectiveness knowledge where the pilot farmers were able to compare the effectiveness
    of various options investigated. In the case of self-learning example described
    earlier, the pilot farmer was able to alter the amount of irrigation applied and
    to some extent frequency (between 8 or 9 days) to identify the most suitable option
    to achieve drainage mitigation and production maximisation outcomes. 8.3. Roles
    of researchers in a participatory process Participatory process demands stakeholders,
    specifically researchers, to perform a variety of roles during a project. Fisher
    (2011), Harvey et al. (2012) and Hammill et al. (2013) have broadly classified
    these diverse roles under four general categories – information intermediary,
    knowledge intermediary, knowledge broker and innovation broker. At the start of
    the case study, during the early engagement process (phase one), the researchers
    performed the role of an information intermediary, by bringing together a range
    of data and information to help pilot farmers make an informed irrigation scheduling
    decision to improve water use. As the case study progressed towards the end of
    phase one, when the regulators required evidence for drainage, the researchers
    processed the daily rainfall, evapotranspiration, and irrigation data to estimate
    seasonal drainage for the case study farms. While the pilot farmers had access
    to these data over the entire time, they lacked the skill and/or time to process
    them to come up with such meaningful performance indicators. As a knowledge intermediary,
    the researchers synthesised these data into usable information (seasonal drainage)
    for the pilot farmers. The researchers continued to play the role of knowledge
    intermediary as they developed IrriMate portal that integrated multiple streams
    of data. During phase three, with the introduction of insight plot, the researchers
    performed the role of a knowledge broker. As a knowledge broker, they worked on
    presenting current and forecast data in a format that could help pilot farmers
    make informed decisions. The insight plot also led to the pilot farmers upskilling
    themselves in managing their irrigation within on-farm infrastructural limits.
    This is clearly illustrated by the self-learning example presented earlier. In
    the case of self-learning, the researchers’ role was limited to presenting the
    information in such a way that the pilot farmers could make their own decision.
    Such an evolution of the decision support tool from an analytical phase into usable
    information has been widely reported in the literature (e.g. Cox, 1996; Armstrong
    et al., 2003 and Cox et al., 2004). The researchers acted as innovation brokers
    by including the regulator as one of the stakeholders. The regulators alerted
    the group to the impending arrival of good management irrigation practices (e.g.
    MGM) and forewarned the pilot farmers and researchers to start exploring ways
    of gathering evidence to ground-truth their practices. The inclusion of regulator
    to the co-learning group introduced the challenge of drainage management, leading
    to the introduction of profile sensor, which eventually led to the insight plot.
    9. Conclusions A co-learning based participatory approach was employed in developing
    an operational irrigation scheduling tool for NZ pastoral farms. The participatory
    approach included researchers, farmers, regulators and industry professionals.
    Including multiple perspectives throughout the tool development process revealed
    unexpected insights and resulted in improved outcomes for all stakeholders. The
    co-learning process resulted in three overlapping yet distinct descriptions of
    improved water use. Researchers provided a technology-based definition (irrigation
    scheduling using soil water monitoring and weather forecast), regulators provided
    an environmental-based definition (irrigation scheduling that minimises drainage
    and nutrient leaching) and the case study farmers provided an economic definition
    (irrigation scheduling that supports pasture growth and productivity). The co-produced
    irrigation scheduling tool evolved to include all three perspectives to improved
    water use, thereby enhancing the relevancy and legitimacy of the tool, and potentially
    its uptake. The co-learning-based irrigation tool development process led to a
    number of self-learning opportunities. Researchers evolved their data collection
    (profile soil moisture sensor) and information presentation (insight plot) processes;
    and the pilot farmers learned to use the insight plot to maximise the use of their
    irrigation infrastructure to balance mitigating drainage and maximising pasture
    growth. While the initial phases of the co-learning process enabled definition
    of case study context (multiple descriptions of improved water use), the phases
    that followed resulted in an operational tool that internalised that context,
    thereby providing relevancy. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

    the progress of human civilization, agriculture plays a vital and a tactical part
    in the procedure of economic improvement of the country. In the various aspects
    of life such as: it is the source of work of many people around the world, roughly
    2.5 billion of the rural people directly rely on agriculture as a mean of living
    it contributes to national income for countries that are in developing stage,
    and it offers food for the population and fodder for animals, this agricultural
    sector plays a significant part. Irrigation becomes difficult and it plays a critical
    role in agriculture, in areas that are dry or where there is no adequate rainfall:
    this crucial factor assures the good yields and production of high quality food
    in sufficient quantities to fulfill the demand, and by irrigation the population
    can become constant. So much water evaporates instead of feeding the plants, not
    to mention leaks and other losses, so irrigation system cannot always give the
    expected results. Hence to accomplish its merits, we ought to make use of the
    new technologies (Tamayo et al. 2010; Nuvvula et al. 2017; Rodríguez et al. 2017).
    To meet the particular management objective, irrigation management which is a
    difficult decision- making procedure should define how much water and when it
    has to be applied for the growing crop. The existing situation cannot to observe
    by the farmer, if he is too far from the farm (Awati and Patil 2012). Huge water
    efficiency, the very less consumption of energy, and large crop productivity were
    the primary target of precision irrigation, which makes use of the technologies
    like remote sensing, wireless sensor networks, real-time control, information
    systems and mobile devices (Achanta and Karthikeyan 2019). Wireless sensors network
    (WSN) is most commonly used process for observing the climate and utilizing the
    data of soil nutrient to estimate the crops health and the superiority of agricultural
    produces (Lachure et al. 2015). Sensor node, communication device, power supply
    and processors were the devices of WSN. In clustering or direct way the sensor
    nodes broadcast the data to the base station. By monitoring the weather conditions
    (namely temperature and humidity) and soil moisture for precision agriculture
    nowadays (Kadiravan et al. 2017; Xia et al. 2011) to build decision support systems
    (DSS) to increase agricultural yield, irrigation can be planned. An automatic
    Smart data mining based irrigation support system is projected in this study for
    regulating the irrigation in agriculture, where the real time soil moisture content
    from land and weather conditions will be gathered by means of WSN (Xiong et al.
    2009; de Lima et al. 2010). For irrigation management, convolutional neural support
    vector machines hybrid classifier (CNSVMHC) was brought-in in this work. This,
    in turn, avoids the weekly irrigations which is required for plantation, according
    to soil measurements and climatic variables collected by numerous independent
    nodes organized in field. Through the intricate and varied information created
    schemes, the effectiveness and consistency of irrigation can be preserved through
    the weather, soil, water, and crop data. In order to do this process, we need
    help from the sensor network and other agricultural techniques for storing and
    using the rain water, maximizing their crop productivity, minimize the cost for
    cultivation and utilize the real time values rather than depending on prediction.
    2 Literature review Utilization of humidity and temperature sensor at appropriate
    positions for observing crops was proposed by Manikandan and Rajaram (2016). According
    to the feedback control mechanism the sensing system works by means of central
    control unit that regulates the flow of water in the real time depending on the
    prompt values of temperature and moisture on the field. CPU gathers the data from
    sensor. Hence, they were given the accurate quantity of water that maximizes the
    productivity of the farm, which helps the agriculturalists to monitor the sensory
    data and plan them self the action to be taken. A self-designed moisture wireless
    sensor was introduced by Xiao et al. (2010), which observe the water level and
    moisture content infield. From this network, the smart irrigation control scheme
    the construction of the wireless sensor network and was planned. Expert data and
    real-time moisture statistics aids to implement the irrigation test. The system
    verifies the applicability and feasibility of enforcing the process of rice growth
    and to be a respectable examination in the field of precision agriculture and
    continuous resources of water. A wireless scheme for intellectual field irrigation
    system devoted to Jew''s-ear planting in Lishui, Zhejiang, China, which depends
    on ZigBee technology was offered by Zhou et al. (2009). The wireless design made
    it very simple for installation and maintenance, rather than conventional wired
    connection. The software algorithm and hardware design of portable controller
    and wireless sensor/actuator node, which behave as the terminal device and controller
    in ZigBee wireless sensor network are explained elaborately. Finally, performances
    of the entire scheme were computed. Variable sampling interval precision agriculture
    (VSI-PA) system was suggested by Hamouda and Msallam (2020) which computes and
    observes the factors of agricultural for a suitable activities of agricultural
    like irrigation of water. The sensor nodes were chosen for every area at every
    step, for sensing the temperature and moisture of soil. Further, for each separate
    area the variable sampling interval was separately measured based on area’s soil
    temperature. The experimental examination concludes that the projected VSI-PA
    scheme delivers a substantial enhancement in using the energy at the same time
    preserving a small difference of the soil moisture in spite of the soil temperature
    values. Fuzzy logic based irrigation control system (FLB) utilizing a wireless
    sensor network for precision agriculture was presented by Patil et al. (2012).
    An appropriate dampness in agricultural soil regulates irrigation controller,
    by generating the irrigation pump off or on according to the readings of sensor,
    which, in turn, provides the science basis that helps water assets under the expertise
    of temperature sensors, soil moisture sensors, accurate irrigation gear, intelligent
    fuzzy controller, and devices controlled by computer, hence agricultural irrigation
    can acquire the finest part out of utilization of water. So an intelligent controller
    was proposed through fuzzy logic approach, for giving the irrigation for agriculture
    and it mimics or matches the intelligence of human being. An entire agrarian solution
    for the agriculturalist according to the GSM technology and Wireless Sensor Networks
    was introduced by Bansal and Reddy (2013). PVIDSS: was developed by Zhang et al.
    (2015), which is an irrigation system that works according to the wireless sensor
    network (WSN) for providing an efficient method to increase the productivity of
    irrigation. The survey, interview and document evaluation were done initially,
    to be acquainted with the chief aspects influencing the growth of vine and accumulate
    the requirements of system and irrigation rules. According to the function requirement
    the PVIDSS architecture was designed. The system observes vineyard’s the key parameters
    precisely like soil wetness and temperature, and measures the precision irrigation
    depending on the vine’s water requirement rule and field data, by incorporating
    the WSN based on ZigBee. The experimental analysis discloses that in data processing
    WSN centered decision support scheme is ideal and it is very simple to implement
    and deploy, and it favors the effective water usage agriculture development. A
    novel irrigation wireless sensor network using high altitude platform (HAP) and
    an adaptive switched-beam concentric circular antenna array was proposed by Albagory
    (2018) and it gives very wide area coverage that extends to various tenses of
    kilometers and hence it can bridge the complexity of executing the wide area sensor
    networks by conventional techniques especially for hard terrain regions. Otherwise,
    the switched-beam antenna system provided by the proposed technique has very high
    gain with narrow main lobe and low side lobe levels which supports the communications
    link between HAP and ground irrigation sensors and actuators over wide areas.
    A classical drip irrigation scheme architecture through the WSANs was proposed
    by Bennis et al. (2015). Temperature, Soil moisture and pressure sensors observe
    the operations of irrigation were there in our model. Particularly, it considers
    the scenarios where the system malfunction occurs, when situation like pipes rupture
    or the block emitters happens. Further, it distinguish 2chief levels of traffic
    for the data broadcasted by the WSAN, and helps for sufficient priority dependent
    routing protocol in order to accomplish the great QoS output. A system was projected
    by Nikolidakis et al. (2015), which functions according to the association of
    a combined system for programmed irrigation administration with a modern new routing
    protocol for wireless sensor networks (WSNs), called as ECHERP (equalized cluster
    head election routing protocol). This scheme concentrates mainly on the managing
    effectively the supply of water in cultivated fields in an automatic method. Here
    the scheme assumes the past statistics and the modifications on climatic values
    for computing the amount of water that are necessary for irrigation. If suppose
    the gathered value is beyond the brink value, to diminish the essential amount
    of water more regular data grouping is projected. In order to manage crop-field
    utilizing sensors (temperature, soil moisture, humidity, Light) and systematize
    the system of irrigation, the Rajalakshmi and Mahalakshmi (2016) developed a new
    system. The information from the sensors was sent to the database of Web server,
    through wireless transmission; here the information was enciphered in JSON format.
    So, this system helps in parts where the level of water is limited and it is 92%
    further effective than the traditional method. An wireless sensor network application
    for a cost efficient wireless managed irrigation solution and real time moisture
    of soil was observed and it was proposed by Dursun and Ozden (2011). A wireless
    acquisition station powered by solar assists us in performing data acquisition
    for managing the valves for irrigation. It consists of three parts: valve unit
    (VU), base station unit (BSU) and sensor unit (SU). Irrigation system that is
    acquired avoids trees moisture stress and salification, at the same time it gives
    an effective utilization of fresh water reserve. Furthermore, the established
    irrigation technique eliminates the requirement for handiwork for flooding irrigation.
    An intelligent irrigation scheme which functions on the wireless sensor networks
    and fuzzy control was designed by Gao et al. (2013) and it comprises of the monitoring
    centre and wireless sensor networks. Solar power will be used by entire nodes
    in Monitoring area for gathering the facts of soil moisture, along with the information
    of diverse crops growth in diverse durations. The rate of change of deviation
    and soil moisture content deviation were considered as the input variables of
    the fuzzy controller, and the fuzzy control normal database was presented for
    the fuzzy irrigation control system. The data transmission from wireless sensor
    network node goes into the monitoring centre, and output figures of irrigation
    water insist to communicate through a wireless sensor network for closing and
    opening time of the valve in the field (crop regions). A competent irrigation
    scheme centered on computing evapo-transpiration (ET) and the mandatory irrigation
    quantity employing fuzzy inference methodology was given by Mousa et al. (2014).
    Scheduling the irrigation on basis of specific demands of the produce and the
    modification in numerous climatologically parameters and further aspects were
    considered as the target of this system. Over- or under-watering will be eliminated
    by this method, which considerably disturbs the quality of crop and produces utilizing
    the projected algorithm. Furthermore, algorithm projected by us minimizes the
    switching of power, because it protects energy from wasting. From the experimental
    result it is confirmed that the fuzzy framework is a swift and precise tool for
    gauging the evapo-transpiration along with the essential net irrigation. Beside,
    our model forbids reduction in soil humidity from attaining 100%; which, in turn,
    indicates the everlasting wilting point. Irrigation begins at once when the ratio
    of depletion extents to50% of total soil humidity available. Goldstein et al.
    designed various irrigation recommendation prediction models utilizing three machine
    learning (ML) schemes, including the classical linear regression and two nonparametric
    schemes, gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT) and boosted trees classifier
    (BTC) is used (Goldstein et al. 2018; Asfaram et al. 2016).The models were trained
    with eight versatile feature subsets. The results revealed that non-parametric
    models, such as GBRT and BTC models had high accuracy in predicting irrigation
    decisions compared to linear regression models, having success rates of 93 and
    95%, correspondingly. Table 1 shows the comparative analysis of the existing approaches
    and their limitations. By analyzing these approaches, it can be said that, the
    neural network based approach provides a better performance in comparison with
    the other available schemes. Table 1 Comparative analysis of the available techniques
    Full size table 3 Proposed methodology The proposed irrigation control model will
    be explained in this section. Two components were there in this model: real time
    collection of data and irrigation prediction, where the real time soil moisture
    content (MC) data collection were performed with the assistance of wireless sensor
    network (WSN) and then irrigation will be controlled according to those collected
    data through convolutional neural support vector machines hybrid classifier (CNSVMHC)
    for an efficient irrigation management is illustrated in Fig. 1. The Overall structure
    of the projected model is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Overall structure of the
    discussed model Full size image In various agricultural cropping systems in semi-dry
    and dry regions, irrigation is considered as the crucial practice and it assist
    the water solicitations and organization were assumed as main challenges. Self
    driven centre pivot including the linear-move irrigation systems frequently put
    on water from time to time; But continuous differences in properties of soil and
    water accessibility happens in maximum fields. In this case, the way to pertain
    site-specific irrigation management to improve the temporally and spatially variable
    conditions could maximize the efficiency of application, minimize the environmental
    influences, and possibly enhance the harvest. Merits of a distributed in-field
    sensor based site-specific irrigation system with a smart Decision support system
    (DSS) scheme gives probable means to maximize the harvest and quality as well
    as save water. Agriculture data’s were already gathered and stored in the database
    for the training of the irrigation prediction system which was implanted with
    the help of this developed WSN platform and gateway node by considering some parameters
    (Nuvvula et al. 2017). So, here we start with the real time land monitoring process
    by considering the factors like weather, soil moisture content, water, and crop
    data with the help of this proposed system. With the help of robust estimation
    methodologies such as neural network algorithms, we can rectify the agricultural
    system model and it is a tedious nonlinear systems. Convolutional neural support
    vector machines hybrid classifier (CNSVMHC) technique was proposed in this work
    for estimating the soil moisture content by taking into account the soil and environmental
    factors (Turkoglu et al. 2019). The agriculture facts collection was executed
    by the established gateway node and WSN platform. In this proposed approach, the
    soil and environmental data is gathered with wireless sensor network (WSN) environment
    for the real-time monitoring and evaluation of soil moisture content (MC). From
    soil temperature sensor, soil moisture sensors, environmental temperature sensor,
    environmental humidity sensor, CO2 sensor, and sunlight intensity sensor the data’s
    were collected and they were maintained in gateway node and wifi connectivity.
    From the wifi network the real-time data were mined and sent over to the computer
    server for soil MC forecast with the help of the convolutional neural support
    vector machines hybrid classifier (CNSVMHC). 3.1 Weather dependent irrigation
    prediction According to those collected soil moisture content data and weather
    conditions, the irrigation will be estimated. Two or more other algorithms were
    combined to rectify the same issue with a hybrid algorithm, either by selecting
    one (based on the data), or swapping between them over the course of the algorithm.
    And it is linked via the preferred features of each; hence the whole algorithm
    is superior when compared with the separate components. 3.2 Convolutional neural
    networks CNNs are considered as the hierarchical frameworks of MLPs where the
    consecutive interchanging layers were intended to acquire the knowledge of the
    progressively higher-level features, and classification results are provided by
    the last layer. The interchanging layers in CNNs provides2 fundamental actions,
    convolution and sub-sampling (e.g., pooling operations), significant of modest
    and complex cells in the mammalian visual cortex. The presented session concentrates
    on the task of CNNs visual identification (Rajalakshmi and Mahalakshmi 2016).Convolutional
    Layer: Here we perform the 2D filtering among input moisture content and weather
    x and a bank of filters w, producing additional set of data h. The input–output
    relationships was denoted by a connection table CT, here filter replies from the
    inputs where linked to the same output data and finally they were combined linearly
    (Wang et al. 2019). The convolutional layer executes the mapping, \\({\\text{h}}_{{\\text{j}}}
    = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{\\text{i}}}^{ } {\\text{k}} \\in {\\text{CT}}_{{{\\text{i}},{\\text{k}},{\\text{j}}}}
    \\left( {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} \\times {\\text{w}}_{{\\text{k}}} } \\right)\\).
    A non-linear activation function, a scaled hyperbolic tangent, were enforced to
    h, identical to the scenario of MLPs. Sub-sampling layer Here we perform “Max-Pooling
    operation”, this bring-in the minor invariance to translation and distortion,
    which results in quicker merging and enriched generalization. Fully-connected
    layer The fully connected layer’s input (i.e., the second last layer) is a set
    of aspects maps from the lower layer and here we match the outcome of the preceding
    layer into a 1-dimensional feature vector, and it is preceded via the scaled hyperbolic
    tangent activation function. Output layer The output layer contains 1 output neuron
    unit for each class label, and it behaves as a linear classifier working on the
    1-dimensional feature vectors which is measured from the layers that are fully-connected
    are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Convolution neural networks Full size image Stochastic
    gradient descent (SGD) methods are better suitable, because of extremely non-linear
    nature of the error surface, since they generally eliminate the stuck in poor
    local minima (Dursun and Ozden 2011). 3.3 Support vector machines SVMs focus on
    recognizing the hyper plane in the feature space; this segregates the categories
    of data whereas increasing the margin in that space. Provided with a controlled
    soft-margin classification issue and a training set of N data points \\(\\left\\{
    {{\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} ,{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right\\}_{{{\\text{i}}
    = 1}}^{{\\text{m}}}\\), where \\({\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{R}}_{{\\text{n}}}\\)
    refers to the ith input pattern and \\({\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{R}}\\)
    indicates the ith output pattern, the SVM technique focus at building a classifier
    of the form (Gao et al. 2013): $$y\\left( x \\right) = {\\text{sign}}\\left( {\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{m} {\\alpha_{i} y_{i} k\\left( {x_{i} ,x} \\right) + b} } \\right),$$ (1)
    here \\(\\alpha_{i}\\) stands for the positive real constants, b indicates a real
    constant and \\({\\text{K}}\\left( {.,{ }.} \\right)\\) indicates a non-linear
    Kernel function, which match the input space onto a advanced dimensional space
    is shown in the Fig. 3. For maximizing the hyperplane margin for a soft-margin
    SVM, the subsequent cost function (i.e., primal SVM issue) has to be reduced.
    $$minimizew,\\varepsilon ,b\\left\\{ {\\frac{\\left\\| w \\right\\|2}{2} + c\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{m} { \\in_{i} } } \\right\\}.$$ (2) Fig. 3 Hyperplane margin for a soft-margin
    SVM Full size image Limited by the 2 constraints \\({\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}}
    \\left( {{\\text{w }}\\cdot{\\text{ x}}_{{\\text{i}}} { } - {\\text{ b}}} \\right){
    } \\ge { }1{ } - \\xi_{{\\text{i}}}\\) and \\(\\xi_{{\\text{i}}} { } \\ge { }0\\),
    for \\(i = \\left\\{ {1, 2, \\ldots ,m} \\right\\} \\cdot \\xi_{i}\\) refers to
    a slack variable, which computes the amount of mis-classification done on data
    xi and the parameter C limits the compromise among the faults on training data
    and margin maximization \\(({\\text{C }} = { }\\infty\\) results in a hard-margin
    SVM) (Mousa et al. 2014). SVMs were guided by bringing-in the Lagrange multipliers
    and rectifying the dual quadratic programming problem, which yet isn’t valid to
    CNNs (Raghav et al. 2020). Hence, to assist a CNN and SVM we make use of an individual
    algorithm with the competency of online incremental updates, and the highlight
    is on “primal gradient-based methods”, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
    based methods. The process of support vector machines training model is shown
    in Fig. 4. The SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns features to
    create the training model with the help of RBF kernel. Fig. 4 Process of support
    vector machines training Full size image 3.4 Convolutional neural support vector
    machines In learning the invariant features from data, CNNs is considered as an
    effective one, but it doesn’t always give the optimal classification results.
    As a contradictory, the knowledge of the difficult in variances cannot be obtained
    from the SVMs static kernel function, but it gives decent decision surfaces by
    increasing the boundaries through approaches like soft-margin. Exploring a hybrid
    system is the main aim of this context, where the CNN gets the knowledge to absorb
    the structures that are comparatively invariant to unrelated differences of the
    input. Similarly, best solution for differentiating the classes in the learned
    feature space can be obtained from SVM having a non-linear kernel. Next to this
    method, proposed convolution neural support vector machines (CNSVMs), a heterogeneous
    combination of the CNN and SVM, where the output layer of the CNN is substituted
    with an SVM (i.e., the CNNs the fully connected layer is the SVM input). Our CNSVMHNN
    is qualified through a stochastic gradient descent based method, with the ability
    of online incremental updates, as conversed after in this segment (Goldstein et
    al. 2018).\\({\\text{w }} \\cdot \\varphi \\left( {\\text{x}} \\right){ } + {\\text{
    b}}),\\) here w indicates the vector of weights, b refers to a bias, and all factors
    were involved in φ. In the case of φ-machines and SVMs, \\(\\varphi\\) refers
    to a random function. The aim of the projected CNSVMHNN is to be familiar with
    a hyperplane \\({\\text{f}}\\left( {\\text{x}} \\right)\\) in the Reproducing
    Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which separates the data classes at the same time
    take full advantage of the margin among the classes and hyperplane. Officially,
    it is specified with a training set \\({\\text{S }} = { }\\{ ({\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}}\\),
    \\({\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} )\\} {\\text{m}}_{{\\text{i}}} = 1,\\) where \\({\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}}
    {\\text{R}}_{{\\text{n}}}\\) and \\({\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} \\left\\{ { + 1,{
    } - 1} \\right\\}\\) for a binary classification problem (it can be modified to
    multi-class problems), the CNSVM reduces the below given cost function: $$minimize_{w}
    \\left\\{ {\\frac{\\lambda }{2}\\left\\| w \\right\\|^{2} + \\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{m} {l\\left( {x_{i} ,y_{i} ;w} \\right)} } \\right\\}$$ (3) Here \\({\\text{l}}\\left(
    {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} ,{\\text{ y}}_{{\\text{i}}} ;{\\text{ w}}} \\right){
    } = {\\text{ max}}\\left\\{ {0,{ }1{ }{-}{\\text{ y}}_{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{f}}\\left(
    {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right)} \\right\\}.\\) In Eq. (3), \\({\\lambda
    } \\ge { }0{ }\\) refers to a regularization factor (brought-in to avert over-fitting),
    which scales \\(\\left\\| w \\right\\| ^{2}\\). The term max \\(\\left\\{ {0,{
    }1 - {\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} {\\text{f}}\\left( {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} }
    \\right)} \\right\\}\\) indicates the hinge-loss, and f(xi) refers to a RKHS with
    associated kernel \\({\\text{K}}\\left( {.,{ }.} \\right).\\) The \\(\\frac{\\lambda
    }{2}\\left\\| w \\right\\|^{2}\\) assists us to increase the margin through regularization,
    while the term \\(\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{m} {l\\left( {x_{i} ,y_{i}
    ;w} \\right)}\\) reduces the training error. The misclassification parameter C,
    which does the scaling of the empirical loss term, is associated to the regularization
    parameter: \\(\\lambda = 1 /mC .\\) By reducing the primal problem in Eq. (2),
    we train SVMs and this equation focus on restraints, the ideal solution w (or
    weight vector) can be indicated as a linear aggregation of the training samples
    in a high-dimensional space, such that w = \\(\\frac{1}{\\lambda }\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{nsv} {y_{i} \\alpha_{i} \\theta \\left( {x_{i} } \\right)}\\) where φ refers
    to the high-dimensional mapping indirectly expressed by \\({\\text{K }}\\left(
    {.,{ }.} \\right)\\) and only a subset of samples satisfies the condition, \\({\\upalpha
    }_{{\\text{i}}} \\ne 0\\) refers to the Support Vectors (SVs) in w, indicated
    by NSV. It specifies that the output weight vector w is a sparse fusion of the
    learned features \\(\\varphi \\left( {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right).\\)
    By reducing a given criterion \\({\\text{R }}\\left( {{\\text{f}}\\left( {{\\text{x}}_{{\\text{i}}}
    } \\right),{\\text{y}}_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right)\\) over the training set, so that
    the term \\(\\frac{1}{m}\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{m} {R\\left( {fx_{i} } \\right),y_{i}
    }\\) is diminished, the training of CNNs and SVMs can be accomplished. It is monitored
    that the CNSVM cost function in of Eq. (3) can be reduced with the help of Stochastic
    Gradient Descent (SGD) methods that is suitable for online incremental learning.
    Here, stochastic sub gradient projection (SSGP) method was proposed (refer Algorithm
    1) for the online incremental training of proposed CNSVMHNN. The SSGP fits the
    situation of irrigation prediction tasks quite good (Asfaram et al. 2016). 3.5
    Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach Two user-defined parameters were required
    for Algorihtm 1, they are: (i) parameter m as provided in Eq. (3), that describes
    the amount of training samples to employ in every mini-batch of training data
    for calculating the sub-gradients, and (ii) T for \\(t = \\left\\{ {1, 2, \\ldots
    ,T} \\right\\},\\) that signifies the number of iterations to do. In SSGP implementation,
    originally the weight vector w is initialized to any vector whose norm is nearly
    \\(\\left\\| w \\right\\| \\le \\frac{1}{\\lambda }\\) At every iteration t of
    the algorithm, a set of \\(\\{ At \\left( i \\right)|i = 1, 2, \\ldots , m\\}\\)
    samples is necessary and handled by the swarm, with Eq. (3) taking the form below:
    $$f\\left( {w;A_{t} } \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda }{2}\\left\\| w \\right\\|^{2}
    + \\frac{1}{m}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{\\left( {x,y} \\right) \\in A_{t} }}^{m}
    l\\left( {x_{i} ,y_{i} ;w} \\right)$$ (4) The learning rate will be set and decayed
    by a factor \\(= \\frac{1}{{{\\lambda t}}}\\), and \\({\\text{A}} + {\\text{ t}}\\)
    is determined as the set of samples in \\({\\text{At}}\\) for which w undergo
    a loss that is non-zero. Then it is proceeded by execution of a two-step update:
    (i) \\({\\text{w}}_{{\\text{t}}}\\) gets scaled by \\(\\left( {1 - \\eta t\\lambda
    } \\right)\\) for every sample \\(\\left( {{\\text{x}},{\\text{ y}}} \\right){\\text{
    A}} + {\\text{ t }},\\) and (ii) the vector \\(\\frac{{{\\text{ynt}}}}{{\\text{m}}}{\\text{
    x}}\\) is added to w, where the resultant weight vector is indicated by \\({\\text{w}}_{{{\\text{t}}
    + \\frac{1}{2}}} = {\\text{w}}_{{{\\text{t}} - {\\upeta }_{{\\text{t}}} \\nabla_{{\\text{t}}}
    }}\\). Hence, the sub-gradient projection is conveyed by: $$\\nabla_{t} = \\lambda
    w_{t} - \\frac{1}{{\\left| {A_{t} } \\right|}}\\sum\\nolimits_{{\\left( {x,y}
    \\right) \\in A _{t}^{ + } }} {yx}$$ (5) where \\({\\text{w}}_{{{\\text{t}} +
    \\frac{1}{2}}}\\) is updated by the sub-gradient of the objective function computed
    with \\({\\text{At}}\\). As the description of the hinge-loss indicates that \\(\\nabla\\)t
    refers to a sub-gradient of \\({\\text{f}}\\left( {{\\text{w}};{\\text{ At}}}
    \\right),\\) in this instance, wt + 1 is fixed as the projection on \\({\\text{wt}}
    + { }1/{ }2{ }\\) which generates a quick reduction in the learning rate. Then,
    \\({\\text{wt}} + 1\\) is acquired by reducing \\({\\text{wt}} + { }1{ }/2\\)
    (as provided in the second final step of Algorithm 1). The finest solution of
    the CNSVM relies in the set B and the output of the SSGP is the updated weight
    vector \\({\\text{wt}} + 1.\\) The regularization parameter required to be adjusted,
    where \\(1/\\lambda\\) takes charge for the complexity of the issue. 4 Result
    and discussion The investigational outcomes of projected scheme were discussed
    in this section; it is executed with the help of NS2. The current PVIDSS algorithm
    (Zhang et al. 2015), fuzzy based neural network (FBNN) algorithm (Wang and Hu
    2015) and proposed convolutional neural support vector machines hybrid classifier
    (CNSVMHC) were distinguished with respect to precision, recall and accuracy for
    the dataset for the dataset of Harmonized World Soil Database v 1.2. The database
    Harmonized World Soil Database is basically a 30 arc-second raster database having
    more than 15 000 diverse soil mapping units that matches the current regional
    and national updates of soil information universally (SOTER, ESD, Soil Map of
    China, WISE) with the facts confined within the 1:5 000 000 scale FAO-UNESCO Soil
    Map of the World (FAO, 1971–1981). The consequential raster database comprises
    of 21,600 rows and 43,200 columns, and these are connected to harmonized soil
    property statistics and to utilize the standardized structure we need to permit
    the connection of the data attribute with the raster map to show or inquire the
    arrangement in terms of soil units and the classification of the chosen soil parameters
    (pH, organic Carbon, water storage capacity, soil depth, cation exchange capacity
    of the soil and the clay fraction, total interchangeable nutrients, lime and gypsum
    contents, sodium exchange percentage, salinity, textural class and granulometry).
    Table 2 shows the performance comparison results values for the various metrics.

    is defined as the ratio of an appropriate instances, which have been recovered
    over the total number of relevant instances. The proposed algorithm is determined
    as $${\\text{Recall}} = \\frac{{{\\text{Truepositive}}}}{{{\\text{truepositive}}
    + {\\text{Falsenegative}}}}.$$ (7) 4.1.3 Accuracy Accuracy is one metric used
    for computing the classification models. Casually, accuracy is the fraction of
    predictions that is got correct by this model. Officially, accuracy can be given
    as follows: $${\\text{Accuracy}} = \\frac{{{\\text{Truepositive}} + {\\text{Truenegative}}}}{{{\\text{Total}}}}.$$

    in farming, an automatic Smart data mining based Irrigation Support System was
    proposed. For irrigation management, the suggested work convolutional neural support
    vector machines hybrid neural network classifier (CNSVMHC) was brought-in in this
    work. The system predicts the weekly irrigations which are required for a plantation,
    which is done according to climatic variables and soil measurements both were
    collected by numerous independent nodes installed in field. As of the intricate
    and varied information centered systems, the effectiveness and uniformity of irrigation
    were maintained, by assuming the factors like soil, weather, water, and crop information.
    The experimental result confirms that the projected scheme gives improved results
    in terms of the precision, recall and accuracy metrics. The future deployment
    concentrates on enhancing water application efficiency. So, both the energy and
    water helps in water pumping in irrigation and it will be preserved. In developing
    countries it is foreseen that this will substitute setting up of low-capacity
    solar photovoltaic water pumping schemes for irrigation that ensemble the socioeconomic
    situations of small scale farmers. References Achanta SDM, Karthikeyan T (2019)

    I. Introduction In the Mediterranean region, agriculture is the sector that contributes
    the most to overall water abstractions, accounting for 50% of total water withdrawals
    on average, up to more than 80% in some countries such as Morocco, Greece and
    Syria [1]. These figures are associated with an unsustainable over-exploitation
    of water resources, further characterized by water scarcity and degradation limiting
    the expansion of the agricultural sector with consequences on food and environmental
    security [2]. The efficient use of water for irrigation is a key component in
    solving water scarcity issues at regional scales, but it is also vital for optimizing
    crop yield and quality, which are the main and direct concerns of farmers. The
    goal of optimal irrigation is to maintain soil extractable water in the rooting
    zone within defined values, that vary between crop types and during the season,
    in order to improve both crop yields and fruit quality. The most diffused irrigation
    management procedure consists in manually applying water at a fixed frequency
    based on farmers knowledge on a scheduled basis. In reality, the fixed frequency
    and amounts may vary depending on farmers perception of weather conditions and
    plant water status [3]. Data-enabled technologies can enhance irrigation management
    by monitoring soil and weather spatial and temporal variability with in-situ sensors
    and providing accurate and reliable real-time information to farmers that can
    define better irrigation scheduling – i.e. when and where to apply water and in
    what amount. In particular, those technologies can enable i) feedback-based irrigation,
    i.e. manually applying water based on the weather and soil information provided
    by sensors, and ii) automated irrigation, i.e. automatically opening or closing
    valves fully confiding in the information provided by the sensors. As a data enabler
    technology, Internet of Things (IoT) is going to play an increasingly central
    role in farming. However, there are still some challenges that needs to be addressed
    in order to promote a wide adoption of IoT technologies for irrigation management
    practices in real-life scenarios. Indeed, while there is a plethora of open source
    IoT platforms [4], to the best of our knowledge, there are no open and low-cost
    IoT-based solutions that focus on real-time services for irrigation. There have
    been different approaches based on IoT to help farmers apply the correct amounts
    of water at the proper time but they are limited to collection and visualization
    of real-time data coming from sensors [5] [6], experimental frameworks for smart
    water management [7], batch analysis of crop performance to provide recommendations
    on agriculture practices [8] and evaluation of open IoT solutions for precision
    agriculture in testbed-like scenarios [9]. The main aim of the paper is to present
    and discuss the design, implementation and deployment of an IoT-based solution
    in real-life scenarios, based on low-cost devices, low-power wireless technologies
    and open source platforms in order to foster innovation in irrigation management
    practices through real-time computation of crop water demand based on soil and
    weather information. SECTION II. A Prototype Iot-Based Service For Irrigation
    Management An important step in designing an IoT-based service is the deployment
    of the wireless communication network between the devices that gather real-time
    data from the environment (e.g. weather, soil and water applied for irrigation)
    and the backend IT system (usually cloud-based) that provides data storage, analysis
    and visualization. An emerging open standard for wireless communication, such
    as LoRaWAN [10] appears very appropriate for agricultural use cases: i) rural
    environments are often characterized by a good line of sight over long distances;
    ii) the temporal variability of the measured physical variables is relatively
    low and partially predictable, thus a low frequency monitoring, in the order of
    few messages per hour, is more than adequate; iii) battery powered devices in
    rural environments are preferred and sometimes are the only possible choice, if
    power sources are missing, thus requiring a network deployment that is adequate
    for low power consumption. LoRaWAN has been developed to create low-power and
    wide-area networks (LPWANs) and designed for sensors and applications that need
    to send small amounts of data over long distances a few times per hour, offering
    a mix of long range, low power consumption and secure data transmission. A network
    based on the LoRa wireless technology can provide coverage that is greater in
    range compared with other wireless networks. Other communication networks such
    as WiFi or cellular technology are great for applications that need high data
    throughput and have a power source. Moreover, LoRAWAN is a low-cost and open source
    technology requiring minimal infrastructure and based on open specification [11].
    The architecture of the prototype service with its main components and the LoRaWAN
    topology, compliant with the LoRa alliance specification, is shown in Fig. 1,
    where it consists of several elements described in the following. End-Node. End-Nodes
    are elements such as remote sensors and actuators. Contrary to other wireless
    networks, such as cellular, that require energy consumption for synchronization,
    the end-nodes in a LoRaWAN network are asynchronous and communicate when they
    have data ready to send, increasing the battery lifetime. LoRaWAN utilizes different
    device classes (A, B and C) according to the application requirements, with a
    trade-off between network downlink communication latency and battery lifetime.
    Class A devices (e.g. battery powered sensors) are the most energy efficient ones,
    with downlink communication available shortly after the end-device has sent an
    uplink transmission. Class B devices (e.g. battery powered actuators), in addition
    to the Class A random receive windows, open extra receive windows at scheduled
    times, when it receives a time-synchronized beacon from the gateway, allowing
    the server to know when the end-device is listening. End-devices of Class C (e.g.
    main powered actuators) have no latency for downlink communication; they can almost
    continuously listen, except when transmitting. Gateway. Gateways are access points
    for end nodes, that aggregate the received data and forward it to the network
    server via some standard IP connection (cellular, WiFi, Ethernet or satellite);
    they also emit radio frequency (RF) packets (i.e. downlink communications) that
    are sent by the network server. In a LoRaWAN network, end-nodes are not associated
    with a specific gateway; several gateways can be co-located in an area and can
    transparently share a single connection to the network server, thus data transmitted
    by a node is typically received by multiple gateways. Gateways can use multichannel
    and multi-modem transceivers so that simultaneous messages on multiple channels
    can be received, increasing the LoRaWAN network capacity. Network Server. The
    Network Server manages the networks by filtering duplicate/redundant uplink frames
    received by the gateway(s), scheduling downlink data transmissions and performing
    adaptive data rates. Figure 1. Architecture of the prototype service. Show All
    Application Server. Application Servers are responsible for the management of
    a LoRaWAN infrastructure end-devices, as well as the handling of join-request
    during the Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) protocol and the handling and encryption
    of application payloads. Application Servers can be enhanced/integrated with IoT
    backend (cloud-based) systems that can perform data analysis and visualization.
    According to the LoRaWAN architecture portrayed above, we will describe, in the
    following paragraphs, the components of the prototype service developed for irrigation
    management, by integrating low-cost and open source solutions available in the
    IoT ecosystem. A. End Nodes Rapid advances in electronic technologies and efforts
    similar to open source software initiatives to enable free and open sharing of
    hardware design have resulted in a variety of new and inexpensive sensing, monitoring,
    and control capabilities which offer opportunities for implementation in agricultural
    and natural-resource research applications [12]. Open solutions such as Arduino
    [13], Raspberry [14], Pycom [15] have contributed to the innovation, improvement
    and rapid and wide adoption of low cost-devices for monitoring applications. In
    our prototype service for irrigation management, we have considered two station
    types: i) Weather Station for meteorological variables monitoring and ii) Field
    Station for soil moisture and applied water monitoring. The sensors connected
    to each station type are listed in Table I. Table I Weather and Field Station
    Sensors The weather and field stations share the same data logger for reading
    and communicating sensor values. The data logger is based on three open and low-cost
    microcontrollers (see Fig. 2), each one providing a specific purpose, which are
    described in the following. Sensor Board. The sensor board, based on the ATMEGA
    328p microcontroller (Arduino-like), is physically connected to the sensors and
    can be programmed in C/C++ language to read values from sensor measurements. The
    Cayenne Low Power Payload (LPP) library [16] has been used to encode the sensors
    values, which will be sent with the LoRaWAN module. Management Board. The management
    board, based on AriettaG25 [17], an ARM9 CPU Microchip AT91SAMG25, provides the
    communication bus, power supply and battery charge regulation, USB expansion and
    communication ports. The board contains a custom Linux distro that allows process
    synchronization, input/output management and remote controlling (via a 3G module),
    allowing operations such as firmware updates and reboots when needed. Figure 2.
    Data logger of Weather and Field Stations. Show All LoRaWAN Module. The LoRaWAN
    module is based on Pycom LoPy 1.0 [18]. It can be programmed in MicroPython and
    it is responsible for sending data to the LoRaWAN gateways. It has been programmed
    in order to use the OTAA protocol: the module performs a join procedure with the
    network server, during which a dynamic device address is assigned, and security
    keys are negotiated. B. Gateway As a prototype for the LoRaWAN Gateway, the Lite
    Gateway by IMST GmbH [19] has been used to develop and test the private LoRaWAN
    network. The gateway platform consists of a concentrator iC880A [20], a Raspberry
    PI, a pre-configured SD-card and an aluminum housing. A LoRa packet forwarder
    program [21], running on the Raspberry Pi, ensures forwarding of RF packets received
    by the concentrator to a server through an IP/UDP link and emits RF packets (downlink
    communications) that are sent by the server. C. Network Server For our prototype
    service, we have considered the lorawan-server [22] open source solution that
    includes all functions required to run a private LoRaWAN network and provides
    the integration with external applications using backend handlers and connectors.
    Moreover, the lorawan-server automatically parses Cayenne payload formats, that
    were chosen as the encoding for the messages sent by weather and field stations.
    The lorawan-server provides connectors that define transport of data fields to/from
    external IoT platforms. Each connector is linked with one handler and specifies
    the communication protocol, target endpoint (i.e. server address and message topics)
    and encoding of the data fields (i.e. json, raw data and web form). Figure 3.
    Rule Chain to compute the reference evapotranspiration. Show All Figure 4. Rule
    Chain to compute the crop evapotranspiration and the suggested water for irrigation.
    Show All D. Application Server The lorawan-server provides both the possibility
    of developing internal applications (running on the same server) and the integration
    of external IoT middleware/platforms through MQTT protocol configurations (see
    [23] for a complete list of supported platforms). For our prototype, we have considered
    the ThingsBoard IoT platform [24], an open source solution allowing rapid development,
    management and scaling of IoT projects and that can be easily integrated within
    the LoRaWAN deployment. In particular, ThingsBoard allows provisioning and managing
    devices, assets and customers and defining relations between them; collecting,
    storing and visualizing data from devices and assets; analyzing incoming telemetry
    in real-time and triggering alarms using customizable rule chains; controlling
    devices using remote procedure calls (RPC); designing dynamic and responsive dashboards
    for presenting device telemetry to end-users. ThingsBoard architecture consists
    of different components (see Fig. 1), that are described in the following. Transport
    provides MQTT, HTTP and CoAP based APIs that are available for receiving telemetry
    data from devices/gateways. Each transport component communicates with the main
    ThingsBoard Core Service using Kafka [25]. In our prototype service, the MQTT
    transport has been selected by appropriately configuring the lorawan-server connector.
    Rule Engine is a framework for building event-based workflows (i.e. Rule Chains),
    that allows filtering, enriching and transforming incoming messages generated
    by IoT devices. In our prototype service, the Rule Engine has been used to develop
    custom Rule Chains to compute in real-time the reference and crop evapotranspiration
    [26] (see Fig. 3 and 4) and the suggested water for irrigation (see Fig. 4). A
    Rule Chain is composed of different Rule Nodes connected with each other with
    relations, so the outbound message from a Rule Node is sent to the next connected
    Rule Nodes. ThingsBoard provides different types of Rule Nodes (filter, enrichment,
    transformation, action and external nodes) and allows to build custom JavaScript
    functions to parse, filter and transform messages (see Fig. 5 for a custom JavaScript
    function to compute the reference evapotranspiration). Storage/Database is used
    to store entities (devices, assets, customers, dashboards, etc.) and telemetry
    data (attributes, time series sensor readings, statistics, events). ThingsBoard
    supports three database options at the moment: SQL - Stores all entities and telemetry
    in SQL database (PostgreSQL [27] for production and HSQLDB [28] for local development
    purposes); NoSQL - Stores all entities and telemetry in NoSQL database (Cassandra
    [29] is the only NoSQL database supported by ThingsBoard); Hybrid - Stores all
    entities in SQL database and all telemetry in NoSQL database. For our prototype
    service, the entities are stored in PostgreSQL database and the time series, related
    to the telemetry data coming from all stations, are stored considering the PostgreSQL
    extension TimescaleDB [30] (by creating an hypertable for the ThingsBoard table
    ts_kv). TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series database optimized for fast
    ingest and complex queries. TimescaleDB provides faster operations on time series
    such as 2000x faster deletes with respect to PostgreSQL [31] that are critical
    for implementing data retention policies; also, the comparison with Cassandra
    shows faster operations on the time series - for complex analysis queries TimescaleDB
    is 3100x-5800x faster with respect to Cassandra [32]. Figure 5. JavaScript function
    to compute the reference evapotranspiration. Show All Figure 6. Real-time dashboard.
    Show All Web UI allows the configuration of customizable IoT dashboards. Each
    IoT dashboard may contain multiple widgets that visualize data from multiple devices.
    ThingsBoard provides the developer with a rich library composed of a number of
    predefined widgets divided into macro categories: time series, latest values,
    control, alarm and static widgets. For each category, different kinds of graphical
    solutions are available, such as charts or tables, maps, simple HTML cards, GPIO
    (General Purpose Input/Output) controls, analog and digital gauges and so on.
    The platform also allows the developer to customize a widget in order to make
    it more suitable for its purpose; a very simple page allows specifying the logical
    behavior (HTML/JavaScript) and the graphical aspect (CSS) of the widget. In our
    prototype service, a dashboard composed of library and custom widgets allows farmers
    to access and visualize real-time raw and derived (rule-chain based) data. The
    web user interface has been designed with the aim of providing the farmer with
    a comprehensive and immediate view of the weather, soil and water parameters,
    in order to reduce water consumption, increase crop productivity, and allow real-time
    verification and understanding of soil moisture dynamics in response to irrigation
    events and weather conditions. For the irrigation management service, the user
    interface consists of three views: an interactive map, a real time dashboard and
    a historical dashboard. The interactive map (based on the open source map service
    OpenStreetMap [33]) shows the geographical distribution of the irrigated fields
    through the use of markers; the user can select one field to view its status in
    detail (i.e. changing the dashboard state to the real-time section). In the real-time
    dashboard (see Fig. 6), the farmer can visualize and monitor raw and derived data
    (i.e. computed by the rule chains) related to weather, soil moisture and applied
    water for irrigation. In the left section of the dashboard, the following information
    is reported in real-time: the total applied water from the beginning of the irrigation
    season; suggested water volumes for irrigation; hourly cumulative applied water
    in the last week; surface and deep soil water potential values in the last week.
    The right side of the view shows the current status of raw and derived meteorological
    variables, i.e. air temperature and humidity, wind intensity and direction, solar
    radiation, pressure and the reference evapotranspiration (ET0). The chart at the
    bottom correlates, in the last week, the hourly amount of precipitation with the
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc) to give an insight to the farmers how these two
    physical phenomena concur to change the amount of water in the soil. Finally,
    the third view (the historical dashboard) shows the trend over time, average or
    cumulative, according to the type of variable, of all weather, soil and applied
    water metrics. The dashboard has also been configured to fit the mobile viewing
    of the visualization widgets, allowing farmers to have easy access to the irrigation
    management information via iPad/tablets and/or smartphones. SECTION III. A Pilot
    Application: Citrus Farming In Sicily The prototype service described in the previous
    section, has been deployed in the plain around Catania (Sicily, Italy), that is
    famous for its citrus production, in particular orange. Ten farms have been selected
    based on multiple criteria, such as irrigation systems, orange varieties, root
    stocks, plant spacing, water management practices used. A total of eleven end-nodes
    have been deployed in the Catania plain, consisting of ten field stations and
    one weather station, alongside with two gateways covering all the end-nodes (within
    10km max range). The lorawan-server and the application backend system have been
    deployed on Scaleway [34] public cloud, and the irrigation management service
    can be accessed by the farmers connecting to the web application https://citrus.cmccos.it.
    The service will be tested in the next three years starting from April 2019 (beginning
    of the irrigation season). During this time frame, the service will be monitored
    to assess the performance and to improve the accuracy of real-time information
    provided, based on the farmers’ feedback in using the system. SECTION IV. Conclusions
    and Future Works The paper has discussed the design and implementation of an IoT-based
    service for irrigation management by integrating low-cost, open source hardware/software
    and open standard. A complete end-to-end solution for citrus farming has been
    developed considering low-cost weather and field stations, the deployment of a
    private LoRaWAN network and an application backend, based on ThingsBoard platform,
    for the visualization and analysis of real-time information. Future works will
    focus on the improvement of irrigation management along two main directions: i)
    integration of open source solutions for big data analytics and AI/machine learning
    (such as Spark [35], Tensorflow [36]), providing even more accurate farm specific
    management rules by merging weather and soil moisture real-time information as
    well as remote sensing of plant water status; ii) integration of weather and climate
    seasonal forecast (i.e. Copernicus Climate Change Service [37]), to plan water
    applications accounting for future climate events and to identify in advance agronomic
    practices that can cope with droughts. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to thank all
    the farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs for their kind hospitality and collaboration

  description: Decision Support Systems (DSSs) are used in precision agriculture to
    provide feedback to a variety of stakeholders, including farmers, advisers, researchers
    and policymakers. However, increments in the amount of data might lead to data
    quality issues, and as these applications scale into big, real-time monitoring
    systems the problem gets even more challenging. Visualisation is a powerful technique
    used in these systems that provides an indispensable step in assisting end-users
    to understand and interpret the data. In this paper, we present a systematic review
    to synthesise literature related to the use of visualisation techniques in the
    domain of agriculture. The search identified 61 eligible articles, from which
    we established end-users, visualisation techniques and data collection methods
    across different application domains. We found visualisation techniques used in
    various areas of agriculture, including viticulture, dairy farming, wheat production
    and irrigation management. Our results show that the majority of DSSs utilise
    maps, together with satellite imagery, as the central visualisation. Also, we
    observed that there is an excellent opportunity for dashboards to enable end-users
    with better interaction support to understand the uncertainty of data. Based on
    this analysis, we provide design guidelines towards the implementation of more
    interactive and visual DSSs.

    used in differing areas of agriculture. • The majority of DSS utilise maps with
    satellite imagery as the central visualisation. • There are great opportunities

    Support Systems (DSSs) are used in precision agriculture to provide feedback to
    a variety of stakeholders, including farmers, advisers, researchers and policymakers.
    However, increments in the amount of data might lead to data quality issues, and
    as these applications scale into big, real-time monitoring systems the problem
    gets even more challenging. Visualisation is a powerful technique used in these
    systems that provides an indispensable step in assisting end-users to understand
    and interpret the data. In this paper, we present a systematic review to synthesise
    literature related to the use of visualisation techniques in the domain of agriculture.
    The search identified 61 eligible articles, from which we established end-users,
    visualisation techniques and data collection methods across different application
    domains. We found visualisation techniques used in various areas of agriculture,
    including viticulture, dairy farming, wheat production and irrigation management.
    Our results show that the majority of DSSs utilise maps, together with satellite
    imagery, as the central visualisation. Also, we observed that there is an excellent
    opportunity for dashboards to enable end-users with better interaction support
    to understand the uncertainty of data. Based on this analysis, we provide design
    guidelines towards the implementation of more interactive and visual DSSs. Previous

    interactionInformation visualisationPrecision agriculture 1. Introduction Decision
    Support Systems (DSSs) are designed to assist humans in making more effective
    decisions. In the field of agriculture, different stakeholders such as farmers,
    advisers and policymakers use software tools that facilitate farm management by
    gathering data from multiple sources, analysing these data and utilising a series
    of suggestions that are presented by different visual outputs. Many DSSs are designed
    to support the concept of precision agriculture (PA) which seeks to provide a
    holistic approach to assist farmers with optimising resources (Paustian and Theuvsen,
    2017). McBratney et al. (2005a) defined PA as the “kind of agriculture that increases
    the number of (correct) decisions per unit area of land per unit time with associated
    net benefits”. Thus, PA research concentrates on enabling users to make the right
    decisions considering both space and time. In the history of agricultural systems,
    user-driven data and model development has played an essential role in meeting
    users’ analysis need for decision-support (Jones et al., 2017). Still, models
    remain unfriendly, inside a black-box and behind DSS software. This black-box
    nature often leads to trust issues, notably when suggestions coming from a DSS
    fail (He et al., 2016). Moreover, an increase in the use of farm sensors, high-tech
    harvesters and drones, among others, has created a massive amount of data that
    might be difficult for decision-makers to grasp (Manos et al., 2004). Users, therefore,
    need additional tools for understanding and interpreting their data (Ruß et al.,
    2009a). Visualisation is a powerful technique to address these issues and has
    demonstrated its usefulness in PA (Wachowiak et al., 2017) to communicate uncertainty
    from both the data and the models (Frías et al., 2018). Visualisation techniques
    have been used to assist users to better interact and understand data by aggregating,
    filtering, searching or otherwise sifting through and scaling down relevant information.
    Moreover, visualisations are often explicitly designed to assist our visual system
    in handling detail that might otherwise require significant cognitive effort.
    For instance, visualisations provide information that can be easily perceived,
    recognised and processed into inferences. In this sense, visualisations also offer
    short-term or long-term memory aids to reduce memory and cognitive load. Such
    support can make data, including potentially complex information, more easily
    consumable. As Rind et al. (2013,) suggest, visualisation tools and techniques
    “combine the processing power of modern computers with human cognition and visual
    abilities to better support analysis tasks”. In line with participatory DSS development,
    visualisations can be especially practical and useful when following user-centred
    design approaches (Hertem et al., 2017). In fact, a number of qualitative PA studies
    highlighted the importance of using a participatory-design approach (Odom, 2010,
    Aragó Galindo et al., 2012a), where the farmer’s perspective is used as the central
    focus of the design. A key goal of such an approach is to support complex data
    analysis by providing diverse visualisation techniques and adapting the tool according
    to the farmer needs (Stojanovic et al., 2017a). A great number of visualisations
    and visual analytics tools have been proposed in the domain of agriculture with
    the aim to support the decision-making process. However, to the best of our knowledge,
    a comprehensive analysis of such tools, by considering their application areas,
    visualisation techniques and intended end-users, does not yet exist. Previous
    literature reviews in agriculture have focused on similar areas such as DSSs and
    PA, but not on visualisation techniques. For example, Kamilaris et al. (2017)
    presented a survey on the recent practices of big data analysis in agriculture
    that would help farmers and companies to extract value from data, improving their
    productivity. This survey highlighted the opportunities of big data analysis for
    smarter farming. A different systematic review (Le Gal et al., 2011) highlighted
    the methodologies that can be used to support farmers in designing innovative
    agricultural production systems. In the context of precision agriculture, Imam
    et al. (2015) reviewed design issues for wireless sensor networks and showed a
    comparison of different characteristics of humidity sensors, such as sensor type,
    their sensitivity and power consumption, which play a key role for wireless sensor
    networks for precision agriculture applications. As such, a number of reviews
    have addressed the issues surrounding DSSs and PA, but the use of visualisations
    in DSSs has yet to be understood. To address this gap, in this paper, we review
    the use of information visualisation techniques in 61 articles that report their
    support for end-user decision-making. From an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)
    perspective, we explore the design methodology behind the implementation of such
    systems and investigate the rationale behind the use of visual components in different
    application domains. HCI is a discipline in which users as well as technology
    and environment are emphasised in the design process (Saizmaa and Kim, 2008).
    For example, paying little attention to the environment could result in the DSS
    being unfit for the intended environment. A recent study (Rose et al., 2018) explored
    the reasons behind the lack of interest by farmers in the computer-based support
    systems and highlighted the importance of HCI perspectives when designing DSSs.
    The study also found clear benefits of designing a DSS that is easy to use, fits
    the existing workflow of users, performs well and incubate trust (Rose et al.,
    2018), which are some of the most commonly accessed metrics of HCI research. We
    had two specific goals in this review: our first goal was to examine user interaction
    with DSS for agriculture (i.e., input to the system, output from the system and
    other interface factors) in order to identify design features that go into the
    making of effective DSS. Our second goal was to gain insight into the evaluation
    of DSS, as well as to learn from these evaluations to identify opportunities for
    future research. To guide this work, we have defined our research questions as
    follows: • RQ1: What visualisation techniques are being used across different
    domains in agriculture? • RQ2: How are these visualisations being used by end-users
    to make decisions? • RQ3: What is the role of uncertainty in the visualisation
    tools that support decision-making? • RQ4: What is the role of HCI in the design
    and development of visualisation tools to support end-user decisions? The contributions
    of this paper are the following: first, we present an extensive overview of visualisation
    and visual analytics techniques that have been elaborated in the agriculture field,
    highlighting the potential of DSSs and their use of visualisations for decision-making
    in agricultural contexts. Second, we present an analysis of a wide range of characteristics,
    including visualisation techniques that are commonly used, how data is captured
    and how these systems have been evaluated. Based on this analysis, we outline
    guidelines for the design of DSSs as well as directions for future research for
    this area. 2. Method In this section, we first elaborate the method employed for
    the selection of articles/papers for our systematic review. We also define the
    different categories that were used for coding the existing tools. 2.1. Eligibility
    criteria This review includes articles that investigated or reported the usage
    of DSSs involving visualisation techniques to support end-users in the field of
    agriculture. The eligibility criteria were specified according to the PICO framework
    (Table 1), stated in the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis
    statement (Moher et al., 2009). Table 1. Overview of the search strategy, keywords

    written in English. The population was targeted to all articles reporting end-users
    (i.e. farmers, policymakers or advisers) using any kind of decision tools, (i.e.
    demos, proof-of-concept tools, dashboards and simulations) in the agriculture
    domain and being supported by the use of any type of visualisation for decision-making.
    DSSs were included without restrictions on the platform of use (i.e. desktop,
    web-browser or mobile applications). Literature was included if they added a clear
    description of the DSS, stating the data input, collection and outcome for any
    end-user involved in the agriculture domain (i.e. farmers, advisers, policymakers).
    Articles describing the use of visualisations in text or figures were included.
    Papers that reported the design process of the tool and user studies regarding
    visualisation techniques were included and analysed in detail separately. 2.2.
    Search strategy A scoping exercise to nail down search keywords was conducted
    in the Google Scholar and ScienceDirect databases in May 2018. The keyword identification
    was complemented by using keyword services such as Google Keyword Planner and
    Keyword Tool. The produced keywords are presented in Table 1. Using the defined
    keywords, hand searching (i.e., a method of manually examining a paper to identify
    all eligible criteria (Higgins et al., 2005)) of relevant authors and articles
    was conducted in Google Scholar. As Google Scholar provides a broad result of
    papers, we used the advanced search functionality for initial searches and narrowed
    down the search using the specific keywords defined in the eligibility criteria
    section, and listed in Table 2. Journals in the agriculture domain were identified
    using ScimagoJR.2 The search of papers within the identified journals was done
    in the ScienceDirect platform. Results from the search are presented in Table

    (n = 2132). Titles and abstracts were screened, excluding those who were not relevant
    to our research and/or did not meet the previously defined eligibility criteria.
    Afterwards, the remaining articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility
    at full-text (n = 140). The process of paper selection is illustrated in Fig.

    Flow diagram illustrating the literature selection process. 2.4. Data extraction
    Data from the included articles were coded and extracted in a spreadsheet designed
    for this review: https://goo.gl/SeJDdV. The 61 papers included in this review
    were coded based on the following main categories: end-user, tool type, development
    status, platform, the visualisation technique, data source, research domain and
    evaluation. At the beginning of this stage, an inter-coder reliability assessment
    was conducted between the researchers using Cohen’s kappa (McHugh, 2012). A random
    selection with 20% of the papers was listed in a spreadsheet and coded following
    the defined coding categories and subcategories. The decisions made by the second
    researcher were compared against the first, generating Cohen’s Kappa statistics.
    The statistics revealed a substantial agreement between the researchers, ( CI,
    to ), . Disagreements were discussed and resolved. Consistency in coding was kept
    throughout the remaining reviewed papers. Categories and subcategories were identified
    based on our research questions and objectives, most of them emerged as common
    themes derived from the articles in this review, for all the categories we used
    both open and closed coding approaches (see Table 3 for an overview of the categories).
    In the following subsections, we briefly describe these categories. Table 3. Definitions

    are the main targets of DSSs in agriculture. In this review, we identified four
    types of stakeholders: farmers, domain experts (farm advisers or agronomists),
    academic researchers and policymakers (see Table 3). In this review, we used the
    end-user category to identify the types of visualisations that are targeted at
    specific types of stakeholders. 2.4.2. Tool type Some DSSs are designed to provide
    a simulation approach where farmers can walk-through simulated farming scenarios
    to explore and better understand their practices (e.g. Dolinska, 2017). This approach
    can also help leverage learning of farmers. Unlike the simulation approach, there
    are DSSs that have been designed for practical applications in real farms. Such
    systems provide decision support solutions for a particular decision-making scenario
    (e.g. irrigation scheduling, fertiliser application, etc.). In addition, there
    are systems that provide farmers with necessary tools for the planning required
    for the whole farm. As such, we categorised the papers into three tool types based
    on their approach: simulation, real practice and whole-farm management. 2.4.3.
    Development status DSSs are often evaluated at different stages of the development
    life circle. Thus, although certain papers present the systems that are currently
    being applied in real farms, there are others that are under development or at
    a concept stage. We used this category to identify the status of the application
    and understand the usage of visualisation at different levels. Subcategories include
    concept, prototype and production. 2.4.4. Platform Since the scale of agricultural
    operations has increased over the years, DSSs are required to support on-the-fly
    access and in-field decision-making (Tan et al., 2012). Thus, many researchers
    have started looking into the use of different devices (i.e. desktop or mobile).
    The systems themselves and visualisation requirements can differ according to
    the platform. In this review, we identified the papers that are intended for mobile
    and/or desktop uses. 2.4.5. Visualisation techniques One main goal of this review
    was to identify visualisation techniques that are proposed for agricultural decision
    support systems. Visualisation techniques may vary according to the needs of the
    users, application domain, visual literacy, etc. With this category, we identified
    an exhaustive list of visualisation techniques that are used to display agricultural
    data and predictions. 2.4.6. Data source Outputs of DSSs are driven by data (Pham
    and Stack, 2018). The type of data collected and how they are utilised play an
    important role in providing optimal decisions and can vary depending on the decision-making
    requirements. Thus, we identified data sources of the selected DSSs. 2.4.7. Application
    domain There are diverse sub-domains in agriculture, some of which include: wheat
    production, irrigation management, crop management, etc. Depending of the domain,
    decision requirements can also vary vastly. Since our initial analysis showed
    that DSSs have been proposed for many sub-domains of agriculture, we identified
    the application domain of each DSS. 2.4.8. Design approach The design stage has
    been identified as one of the critical steps in the development of visualisation
    tools and agricultural DSSs (Parker and Sinclair, 2001). It also plays an important
    role in the adoption of the system (Lindblom et al., 2017). Thus, significant
    efforts have been put into applying user-centred approaches for developing DSSs
    (Parker, 1999). We categorised the selected DSSs based on the following user-centred
    design approaches: participatory, focus group and iterative. A brief definition
    for each of these categories has been provided in Table 3. It is important to
    note that the design approach generally defines a framework for evaluating a system.
    Various evaluation methods maybe used under a selected framework. These evaluation
    methods are described in Section 2.4.9. 2.4.9. Evaluation methods Evaluation is
    an important part of the software development life circle as it ensures that all
    the requirements of the software are met. As mentioned in Section 2.4.8, different
    evaluation methods can be used under a selected design framework. Our initial
    analysis showed that a number of evaluation methods have been used by previous
    work in agriculture. Thus, we identified DSSs based on the following evaluation
    methods: observation, questionnaire, interview and workshop. A brief definitions
    for these categories can be found in Table 3. In general, user observations are
    conducted “in the wild” where users are typically allowed to explore a given tool
    freely. Interactions with the tool are observed and recorded. In certain cases,
    questionnaires may be administered to users who then provide written answers to
    a set of questions which can include both open- and close-ended questions. Unlike
    asking the questions verbally as in interviews, questionnaires demand less effort
    from the questioner and provide structured sets of answers. On the other hand,
    interviews involve delivering both questions and answers verbally. Interviews
    allow the questioner to capture in-depth feedback and to pose further questions
    which is not possible with the questionnaire approach. Workshops, unlike interviews,
    involve a group of users answering to a set of questions which are typically introduced
    by the questioner. Workshops create a great environment to capture rich opinions
    from users by allowing them to discuss the questions and come up with solutions.
    3. Analysis We analysed the selected papers based on the nine categories presented
    in Table 3 as explained above. An overview of the number of papers identified
    within each category is shown in Fig. 2. In the following subsections, results

    DSSs that have been elaborated in various application domains and demonstrate
    how they have been applied to assist with decision support tasks. Although many
    of the systems are grouped by their application domain, some fall under various
    domains, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Although this figure is by no means exhaustive,
    it provides insights into the typical cross-domain supports of current DSSs in
    agriculture. A complete list of DSSs under each application domain is presented

    vineyard monitoring, reducing costs and at the same time, generating a more transparent
    representation of the existent variability in the vineyard, which is valuable
    for the optimisation of the harvest and producing high-quality grapes (Best et
    al., 2005). Rossi et al. (100 (2014)) is a DSS for crop management of vineyards
    (Fig. 4a). Using sensors, the system shows visual information about soil water
    content to help farmers monitor adequate water levels. Decision support modules
    provide information about vine growth, pest control and diseases in grape berries.
    The visualisation of real-time information supports farmers to make informed decisions
    and maintain a record behind each management action. Blauth and Ducati (2010)
    introduced a map visualisation of the land usage in vineyards (Fig. 4b). The system
    monitors grape variety, production and inventory information, using a map to indicate
    vineyards, vegetation, bare soil or nearby urban areas. Terribile et al. (2017)
    provides support to farmers at a landscape level (Fig. 4c) with an interactive
    dashboard that allows the selection and comparison of areas of interest together
    with multiple data layers on top of a map. Download : Download high-res image

    Dairy farming According to an annual report published by United States Department
    of Agriculture,3 feeding animals for dairy farming is one of the highest expenses
    for dairy producers across the states. In order to optimise productivity, dairy
    producers focus on formulating diets based on the growth rate, milk production
    and reproduction. Thus, DSSs have also become widely popular in dairy farming.
    Oliver et al. (2017) is a DSS that provides a visualisation of the agricultural
    land to manage microbial pollution risks (Fig. 5a). A participatory design approach
    was used to engage with stakeholders in order to create a user-friendly system
    for guiding on-farm risk assessment. The resulting tool visualises patterns of
    E. coli in space and time. Cabrera et al. (2005) is a DSS intended for producers
    and regulatory agencies. The main purpose of this tool is to integrate nutrient
    budgeting, crop and optimisation models to assess nitrogen leaching from dairy
    farm systems. The user interface of DyNoFlo Dairy provides a graphical representation
    of all system modules and their connections, allowing users to interact with different
    models in order to optimise nitrogen leaching and profit (Fig. 5b). Download :

    than any other commercial crop and continues to be the most important food grain
    source for humans. Its production leads all crops, including rice, maize and potatoes.
    We found four tools (Armstrong and Nallan, 2016, Lorite et al., 2013, Thierry
    et al., 2017, Lundström and Lindblom, 2018) that visually support end-users in
    the wheat production domain. Armstrong and Nallan (2016) provides valuable information
    for Western Australian wheat growers, using diverse visualisation techniques to
    illustrate seasonal rainfall and yield production (Fig. 6a). AquaCrop (Lorite
    et al., 2013) provides simulation analysis towards the impact of climate change
    on wheat yield in Southern Spain by visualising yield and rainfall (Fig. 6b).
    ATLAS (Thierry et al., 2017) simulates crop availability at the landscape scale
    by visualising in 2D and 3D maps different crop scenarios in relation to pests,
    diseases and biological control (Fig. 6c). cropSAT (Lundström and Lindblom, 2018)
    is a DSS to visually analyse nitrogen fertilisation of winter wheat using satellite
    images: farmers can recognise and explain visualised variation in the crop biomass
    (Fig. 6d). Download : Download high-res image (516KB) Download : Download full-size

    et al., 2017), (d) cropSAT (Lundström and Lindblom, 2018). 3.1.4. Pest and disease
    control Pest control is a vital process in the agricultural business, as pests
    and diseases can lead to important economic and ecological losses (del Águila
    et al., 2015). A number of DSSs have focused on providing support for farmers
    to identifying and treating (Rossi et al., 100 (2014), Rupnik et al., 2019) a
    particular pest (see Fig. 7). CognitiveInputs (Devitt et al., 2017) (Fig. 7a)
    is an interactive tool aimed for cotton growers that allows them to explore weed
    management decisions while considering uncertainties under climate conditions.
    Designed as an extension for existing farm management systems, AgroDSS (Fig. 7b)
    (Rupnik et al., 2019) uses data mining and statistical methods to make predictions
    for simulated scenarios and to better understand the dependencies within a domain.
    This includes identifying pest populations and species. AgroDSS uses time-series
    graphs to visualise such data. Vite.net (Fig. 7c) (Rossi et al., 100 (2014)) is
    a comprehensive farm management system that can also visually represent pest occurrences
    over the season. Time-series graphs are used to show in-depth information regarding
    a disease, an infection chain and/or infection severity. Further decision support
    is provided for treatment plans using a decision tree. In addition, a dashboard
    shows alert levels of a disease and protection of the last fungicide spray against
    diseases. Download : Download high-res image (455KB) Download : Download full-size

    et al., 100 (2014)). 3.1.5. Irrigation management Irrigation advisory services
    provide the farmers with assistance in irrigation scheduling knowledge, considering
    crop water conditions in different crops, optimising production and cost-effectiveness.
    Visualisations support farmers with a better overview of water distribution to
    their crops by showing moisture content, water uptake, etc. Such views allow farmers
    to adjust their irrigation process depending on the soil, farm area and season
    in order to optimise crop production. As an example, the tool designed by Byishimo
    and Garba (2016) uses real-time data collected from in-field sensors to produce
    live visualisations allowing farmers to monitor and process information about
    the soil, temperature and irrigation. Interaction is limited as users can only
    hover over the time-series visualisation to see annotations indicating details
    about the data over time (Fig. 8a). Another example is DIDAS (Friedman et al.,
    2016), a tool that allows to evaluate a farm based on a number of inputs such
    as soil, evaporation, plant resistance and land structure and assists with the
    design and scheduling of drip irrigation systems (Fig. 8b). By visualising water
    flow, DIDAS can assist farmers in taking decisions about irrigation schedules
    under conditions where water is a crucial limiting factor in crop productions.
    HydroQual (Accorsi et al., 2014) uses a dataset consisting of sequences of biological
    indices and physico-chemical values for geo-localised river stations and allows
    experts to visually analyse river water quality of different geographical areas
    (Fig. 8c). Download : Download high-res image (554KB) Download : Download full-size

    (Accorsi et al., 2014). 3.1.6. Crop management Crop production is deeply dependent
    on climate conditions, diseases and pests, making it essential to provide farmers
    with risk management technology. AquaGIS (Fig. 9a) (Lorite et al., 2013) is a
    visualisation tool that uses AquaCrop, a crop growth model, to simulate results
    of crop management in multiple fields and seasons. AquaGIS features visualisation
    modules that facilitate the presentation of spatial data. It allows an efficient
    visualisation in a map using different colours that facilitate spatial visualisation.
    An interactive component allows interaction between different maps that describe
    the evolution over time of the results provided by AquaCrop. AgMine (Fig. 9b)
    (Armstrong and Nallan, 2016) is a DSS that comprises multiple components of statistical
    analysis powered by visualisation modules. Visualisation is used in this tool
    as a powerful technique for geo-spatial analysis, climate and crop-yield mapping.
    With the proposed framework, farmers can use the visualisations to detect seasonal
    patterns of rainfall and see the effects on various scenarios comparing dry and
    wet years in crop production. Download : Download high-res image (315KB) Download

    Fertiliser management The aim of precision agriculture is to optimise farm outputs
    while preserving resources (McBratney et al., 2005b). Thus, fertiliser management
    plays an important role in precision agriculture. CropSAT (Fig. 10) (Lundström
    and Lindblom, 2018) is a tool developed for calculation of variable rate application
    files for nitrogen fertilisation from satellite images. The images generated in
    CropSAT show visual representations of crop biomass variation, which is difficult
    to achieve by just walking or driving in the field. Download : Download high-res

    Weather prediction and climate Weather forecast is a big challenge in the practical
    application of seasonal predictions in different economic sectors (Frías et al.,
    2018). Fortunately, interactive visualisation is well known for facilitating the
    analysis of probabilistic predictions under uncertainty (Spiegelhalter et al.,
    2011, Diehl et al., 2017), particularly towards non-expert users (Kay et al.,
    2016). An example tool, Geovisage (Jarvis et al., 2017), is a web-based decision
    support system designed for farmers that displays graphs of current sensor data
    from several weather stations. The tool visualises real-time data in a time-series
    plot offering a quick view of recent weather conditions where time periods and
    different weather stations are compared; a table provides extra details with statistical
    information (Fig. 11a). CAMDT (Fig. 11b) (Han et al., 2017) is another example
    that aims to facilitate probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts. The tool provides
    a user interface to help decision-makers adjust their crop and water management
    practices that may improve outcomes given the expected weather condition of the
    growing season. It provides “what-if” scenarios where the forecast is presented
    for visual comparison. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download

    majority of tools we reviewed are designed to support farmers, there are some
    that also support other end-users including domain experts (farm advisers and
    agronomists), policymakers and academic researchers. In this section, we present
    our findings of tools that have been designed to help different stakeholders in
    agriculture. A comprehensive list of these tools is presented in Table 5. Table

    34 9 4 4 4 Percent (%): 56 15 7 7 7 3.2.1. Farmers We discovered that a large
    number of tools in agriculture (34 out of 61) are designed for farmers. These
    tools focus on assisting farmers with various aspects of farming. The majority
    of the tools used one or more visualisation techniques to help the farmers better
    understand the status of their farm and crops and to be able to make accurate
    decisions regarding irrigation schedules (Fig. 8), fertiliser applications (Fig.
    10), pest control (Fig. 7), etc. Details of individual visualisation techniques
    found in each of these tools are presented in Section 3.3. 3.2.2. Policymakers
    We found a total of four tools (Tayyebi et al., 2016, Gandhi et al., 2016, Río
    et al., 2011, de Souza et al., 2003) that are designed to be used by policymakers.
    Policymakers, such as rural extension technicians, use DSSs to facilitate the
    evaluation of consequences of changes in agriculture, such as crop affectations
    in landscapes. For instance, SmartScape (Tayyebi et al., 2016) provides diverse
    visual components, such as maps and radar charts, to provide assistance to policymakers
    in evaluating the consequences of ecosystem services in agriculture landscapes
    (see Fig. 12). In addition, some tools (e.g. de Souza et al., 2003) are designed
    to help with information dissemination, allowing policymakers to exchange knowledge
    back and forth with farmers. Download : Download high-res image (656KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 12. User interface of SmartScape (Tayyebi et al.,
    2016), a tool to support policymakers. 3.2.3. Domain experts Farm advisers, including
    agronomists, are considered domain experts who are often consulted by farmers,
    as well as by researchers for designing DSSs (Adinarayana et al., 2008, Accorsi
    et al., 2014, de Souza et al., 2003). They also assist policymakers to implement
    farming policies and in changing farmer behaviour (Ingram, 2008). Farm advisers
    typically assess the farms by using varieties of statistical models and analysis
    methods, evaluating the risks of different management scenarios and finally propose
    strategies/guidelines for farmers. Thus, the tools designed for both farm adviser
    and farmers are typically capable of conducting analyses and simulations, as well
    as visualising the resulting guidelines for farmers (Fig. 8c). There are nine
    tools (Han et al., 2017, Lorite et al., 2013, Yalew et al., 2016, Aragó Galindo
    et al., 2012b, Rossi et al., 100 (2014), Oliver et al., 2017, Acutis et al., 2014,
    Thysen and Detlefsen, 2006, Han et al., 2019) that have been designed to support
    farm advisers. Agronomists, amongst all domain experts, are known for establishing
    good communication with farmers due to regular on-site meetings, local knowledge
    and long-term relationships with farmers (Ingram, 2008). Agronomists tend to provide
    practical farming decisions that are more likely to coincide with those of farmers,
    instead of urging new initiatives or regulations as some advisers do (Ingram,
    2008). In this review, we found a total of four tools (Stojanovic et al., 2017b,
    Han et al., 2017, Le Ber et al., 2006, Devitt et al., 2017) that have been designed
    to support agronomists. 3.2.4. Academics We found four tools (Stojanovic et al.,
    2017b, Ochola and Kerkides, 2004, Gandhi et al., 2016, Tan et al., 2012) that
    have been designed for academics. AgriAG (Stojanovic et al., 2017b) was developed
    with the aid of academics that provided feedback to the elaboration of the tool.
    Mostly, these applications (Tan et al., 2012, Gandhi et al., 2016) are used by
    academic researchers to explore new technologies to support agricultural decision-making.
    3.3. Visualisation techniques Through this review, we found a number of visualisation
    techniques currently being used in DSSs for agriculture. Table 6 shows an exhaustive
    list of different visualisation techniques that are found in the papers we reviewed.
    In the following subsections, we present the ten most common visualisation techniques.

    used in agriculture to visually communicate geo-spatial data, providing an overview
    of the farms. In total, our review identified 46 papers (i.e. 75%) that used a
    type of map visualisation (see Table 6 for details). As seen in Fig. 13, both
    2D and 3D map visualisations have been proposed to represent physical landscapes.
    Out of the 46 papers, a large proportion (i.e. 42 papers) have implemented 2D
    maps. Examples include ViPER (Oliver et al., 2017) (Fig. 13a) and AQUAGIS (Lorite
    et al., 2013) (Fig. 13b), where plots of physical landscapes are virtually displayed
    on a 2D map. Example usage of 3D maps includes AgriAG (Stojanovic et al., 2017b)
    (Fig. 13c) and ATLAS (Thierry et al., 2017) (Fig. 13d). Both 2D and 3D maps are
    often layered with various colour representations, such as a heatmap to further
    visualise areas of interest in the farm. Download : Download high-res image (843KB)

    Heatmap Heatmaps represent data values contained in an area of interest using
    a colour range. Since heatmap visualisations generally highlight areas of interest,
    they are often used as an overlay on top of geographical maps. Heatmaps are for
    instance used to represent the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to
    indicate the density of green on a patch of land. Other types of data visualised
    with heatmaps include biomass, weather, water density, risk of flooding, etc.
    We found a total of 17 tools that used heatmaps to visualise regions of interest
    across landscapes (see Table 6). CropSAT (Lundström and Lindblom, 2018), for example,
    uses heatmaps to indicate biomass in a patch of farm using satellite-based images
    (see Fig. 10). Another example is the vineyard management tool designed by Blauth
    and Ducati (2010) (see Fig. 4b) that uses a heatmap to differentiate vineyards
    from other vegetation, bare soil and urban areas. CAMDT (Han et al., 2017), as
    shown in Fig. 11b, uses heatmaps to indicate areas of land that are at the risk
    of flooding. 3.3.3. Time-series Time-series visualisations are used to show a
    distributions of data points that are ordered by time. They are similar to line
    graphs in that they present two dimensional data where a sequence of time (e.g.
    months) is usually plotted on the x-axis. Due to their simplicity and effectiveness
    in presenting data points through time, time-series are commonly seen in agricultural
    tools. We found a total of 24 tools (see Table 6) that used time-series to visualise
    various farm data. An example is CropGIS (Machwitz et al., 2019) which displays
    the biomass growth of a farm over time (see Fig. 10). In a similar way, DIDAS
    (Friedman et al., 2016) shows relative water uptake using time-series (see Fig.
    8b). Other example applications include AgMine (Armstrong and Nallan, 2016), visualising
    wheat yield and rainfall patterns, and LMTooln (Falloon et al., 2018), visualising
    temperature, precipitation and wind speed. 3.3.4. Bar chart Bar charts present
    bars clustered in groups, showing the values of more than one measured variable.
    One axis of bar charts shows the specific categories being compared and the other
    axis represents a measured value. We found a total of eight tools (see Table 6)
    that used bar charts to present data. We also discovered that, in agriculture,
    bar charts are commonly used in combinations with other types of visualisations.
    For instance, AgMine (Armstrong and Nallan, 2016) (Fig. 9b) uses bar charts with
    time-series to show average wheat yield between years. Similarly, DIDAS (Friedman
    et al., 2016) (Fig. 8b) shows water supply scheduling for irrigation over a 24-h
    period. AgriSuit (Yalew et al., 2016) (Fig. 14c) uses a heatmap and bar chart
    together to present the distribution of suitable agricultural lands in an area
    of interest. Download : Download high-res image (784KB) Download : Download full-size

    2016) (d) Vite.net (Rossi et al., 100 (2014)) (e) HydroQual (Accorsi et al., 2014).
    3.3.5. Histogram Histograms are used to represent an estimate of the probability
    distribution of a continuous variable (Pearson, 1895). It differs from a bar chart
    in the sense that a bar graph represents categorical variables, whereas in a histogram
    each column/bar represents a continuous quantitative variable. We found seven
    tools that used histograms to present farm-related data. SmartScape (Tayyebi et
    al., 2016) (Fig. 12) uses a histogram to illustrate simulation results of various
    crop change scenarios. The results illustrated include changes in vital soil chemical
    contents, bird habitat, biofuel, pollinators, net income and net energy. In AquaGIS
    (Lorite et al., 2013) (Fig. 6c), histogram is used to illustrate a comparison
    between crop yield and rainfall over time. 3.3.6. Pie chart A pie chart is a circular
    visualisation which is divided into slices with different colours to illustrate
    a numerical proportion. Much like bar charts, pie charts are used to visualise
    a distribution between categories of data. However, compared to bar charts, pie
    charts are less popular in agriculture. We found a total of five tools that used
    pie charts to visualise farm data. The VBoxReporting system (Bimonte et al., 2016)
    is an example of usage of the pie chart in agriculture. This tool uses pie charts
    to illustrate a comparison of work time and fuel consumption in a day between
    different plots. 3.3.7. Radar chart Radar charts are frequently used to visualise
    multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart. Thus, they can be used
    when three or more variables are present. In agriculture, however, radar charts
    are less common. In this review, we discovered three tools that uses radar charts.
    SmartScape (Tayyebi et al., 2016) (Fig. 12) is an example tool that uses a radar
    chart to illustrate environmental outcomes between current and hypothetical crop
    change scenarios. The outcomes include vital soil chemical contents, bird habitat,
    biofuel, pollinators, net income and net energy. As presented in Section 3.3.5,
    SmartScape (Tayyebi et al., 2016) also uses a histogram to illustrate such outcomes
    in two different ways. 3.3.8. Clustering A clustering view shows clusters of similar
    information organised by colours and shapes. While clustering is a commonly used
    prediction technique, the visualisation of these clusters for interpretation by
    end-users is quite uncommon: we found only one tool, HydroQual (Accorsi et al.,
    2014), that offers such a view. In HydroQual, water stations across a map are
    illustrated in groups by their behavioural similarity (see Fig. 8c). 3.3.9. Temporal
    pattern view Also in HydroQual (Accorsi et al., 2014) (Fig. 8c), a “temporal pattern
    view” is described, which is essentially a variation of a node-link diagram. It
    is used to illustrate patterns of changes in biological indices and physico-chemical
    parameters over time. In this review, we found the use of such a temporal pattern
    view, or node-link diagram, only in HydroQual. 3.3.10. Dashboards Dashboards are
    a collection of visualisations that provide relevant information to be monitored
    on a single screen at a glance (Few, 2006). They provide an easy access to diverse
    visual components to display detailed data, providing a unified display to the
    decision-maker for interaction and exploration (Saket et al., 2019). In this review,
    we identified 11 tools that use a dashboard. Fig. 14 illustrates example applications
    of dashboards in DSSs for agriculture. Notice how all five examples in this figure
    have a main interface from which various other visualisations can be accessed.
    For instance, Geovit (Terribile et al., 2017) (Fig. 14a), a dashboard designed
    for viticulture, provides diverse interactive components surrounding a heatmap,
    allowing instant access to various different features. Similarly, SmartScape (Tayyebi
    et al., 2016) (Fig. 14b), a spatial decision support system, uses a map together
    with a radar chart, histograms and various diverse interactive components. AgriSuit
    (Yalew et al., 2016) (Fig. 14c), tool for agricultural land suitability assessment,
    also uses a map which is augmented by heatmap and bar chart visualisations, surrounded
    by various interaction elements. HydroQual (Accorsi et al., 2014) (Fig. 14e),
    tool for visual analysis of river water quality, uses a clustering view together
    with a map and a pattern view. A vineyards management system, Vite.net (Rossi
    et al., 100 (2014)) (Fig. 14d), unlike the previous dashboards, does not use a
    map but rather a unique combination of progress bars, time-series, barometer,
    colour shades and decision tree. We discovered that dashboards in agriculture
    are substantially used in farm management and landscape assessment tasks, with
    some tools (e.g. HydroQual Accorsi et al., 2014) designed for the analysis of
    river water quality. It appears that the primary goal of dashboards is to show
    an overview map to users, which is logical given that landscape is an important
    part of farm management. As shown in Table 6, the majority of the tools that have
    a dashboard (9 out of 11) use 2D maps to provide an overview of the landscape.
    A few other familiar visualisations used in the dashboards include heatmaps (6
    tools), time-series (5 tools), a bar chart (2 tools), a histogram (1 tool), a
    radar chart (1 tool) and a pie chart (1 tool). We discovered that a few unique
    visualisations such as a cluster view, horizontal plots and a pattern view have
    also been used as part of a dashboard. Since dashboards are designed to provide
    a unified display to the decision-maker (Saket et al., 2019), we believe that
    the use of familiar visualisations is an important aspect of dashboards, especially
    because most end-users in agriculture are non-experts in visualisation and data
    analytics. Overall, the 11 tools that have a dashboard covered the following application
    domains: land suitability assessment, crop biomass analysis, crop control, wheat
    production, fertiliser management, pest control, dairy farming and vineyard management.
    For the other domains such as livestock management, aquaculture analysis, cotton
    production, rice production and soil-moisture analysis (see Table 4), various
    visualisation tools exist but a dashboard has yet to be introduced. We believe
    that many of such domains can also greatly benefit from a dashboard. Based on
    an analysis of various aspects of these dashboards, we highlight opportunities
    for future research in Section 4. 3.4. Interaction Interaction is an important
    aspect of visualisation tools since perception and understanding of complex data
    can be strongly influenced by the interactivity of a visualisation component (Zudilova-Seinstra
    et al., 2009). The benefits of visualising complex data arise from being able
    to better interact and understand data by aggregating, filtering, searching or
    scaling down relevant information. Examples of interactive visualisation components
    can be found in various agricultural DSSs. Thirty-one of the reviewed papers reported
    the use of interactive visualisations in their tools (see Table 6). Many of the
    reported interactive visualisations are included in dashboards, where visualisation
    components interact together to provide insights to user. ViPER (Oliver et al.,
    2017) is an example tool that provides an interactive drag-and-drop interface
    where users can explore livestock and examine “what-if?” scenarios. Moreover,
    AgriSuit (Yalew et al., 2016) provides an interface to allow a customised selection
    of weights based on user preferences to achieve better insights. Geovit (Terribile
    et al., 2017), provides an interactive dashboard that allows the selection of
    areas of interest: based on this selection, users can explore information about
    soil, climate and hydrology in real-time. 3.5. Tool type, platform and development
    status All 61 papers of this review present one or more visualisations which are
    designed to support various farming applications (e.g. irrigation scheduling,
    fertiliser application, etc.) and platforms (e.g. mobile and desktop). We found
    15 tools (see Table 7) that are designed to assist with decision support requirements
    by using a simulation approach. These tools allow farmers to walk-through simulated
    farming scenarios helping them explore and better understand their practices.
    On the other hand, we found 24 tools that have been designed for applications
    in real farming practices (i.e. non-simulation). These tools are designed to assist
    with decision support requirements for a particular real-world decision-making
    scenario, for example, irrigation scheduling or fertiliser application. Table

    while a number of tools have focused on individual farming practices such as irrigation
    scheduling or fertiliser application, only two out of the 61 tools used visualisations
    to support whole-farm planning. Whole-farm planning is a difficult task, and its
    practices are often delivered to farmers by technicians and experts.4 Whole-farm
    planning systems provide users with necessary tools for all the planning required
    for the whole farm, something farmers have to engage in nearly every day. We believe
    that future tools should provide farmers with various plug-and-play components
    allowing them to perform plannings for the whole farm or individual requirements.
    In addition, we found that many of the tools have been designed to support a particular
    device (i.e. desktop or mobile), with the exception of two tools (Tan et al.,
    2012, Mudisshu et al., 2016) that were designed for both mobile and desktop devices.
    Overall, 30 out of the 61 tools are desktop applications while only nine are mobile
    applications, out of which two are designed for both desktop and mobile devices.
    Clearly, the support for mobile devices has been considered less frequently. However,
    since the scale of agricultural operations has increased over the years, it is
    important that the tools are scalable and support multiple devices for on-the-fly
    access and in-field decision-making (Tan et al., 2012). Finally, we also discovered
    that while some of the tools (16 out of 61) are being used in practice, the majority
    of them (33 out of 61) are under the prototype stage (see Table 7 for details).
    Out of the two DSSs we discovered for whole-farm planning, only one (Cabrera et
    al., 2005) is currently available for end-users whereas the other one (Acutis
    et al., 2014) is at the prototype stage. Similarly for the tools that are designed
    for mobile devices, we found only one (Luvisi et al., 2011) that is currently
    available for end-users, which again supports the argument that more tools should
    consider support for multiple devices for flexible decision-making (Tan et al.,
    2012). 3.6. Data source Since PA is driven by data to support decision-making
    (Pham and Stack, 2018), the type of data collected and how they are utilised play
    an important role. We found various types of data that are being used amongst
    the DSSs reviewed in this paper. An overview of the different types of data together
    with the respective DSSs is presented in Table 8. Table 8. DSS categorised by

    such as coordinates is the most widely used data type in agricultural visualisation.
    In total, we discovered 42 tools (i.e. 69%) that used it geographical data. This
    result is unsurprising, as we also discovered that maps are the most common type
    of visualisation in agriculture (see Section 3.3.1). In order to plot map visualisations,
    coordinates are vital. The second most common data types are soil and crop data,
    both having been used in 25 of the tools. it Soil data usually contains vital
    elements for crops such as potassium, calcium, phosphorous, nitrogen, iron, magnesium,
    zinc, copper and pH. it Crop data often contains growth rate, species and any
    other data that is related to the particular crop’s anatomy. Both it soil and
    crop data, separately or together, are often used to predict additional requirements
    for any given farm, which includes irrigation planning, fertiliser management,
    environmental management, etc. SmartScape (Tayyebi et al., 2016) (Fig. 12), for
    example, uses both data to evaluate and compare different crop change scenarios,
    assisting policymakers with their decisions. The third most commonly found data
    type is weather data. Our review has seen a total of 20 tools that use it weather
    data to provide decision support. Both soil and weather play an important role
    for crops development. They are also unpredictable as changes can occur rapidly
    and without warning. Soil chemicals, for example, can vary frequently depending
    on animal waste on the farm. Thus, many DSSs take into account these data. As
    we can see in Table 8, it weather and soil data are often measured by sensors.
    Following weather data, rainfall (13 tools) and it crop yield (14 tools) have
    been used most frequently. Rainfall, like weather data, is vital for crops. However,
    rainfall alone does not determine crop development; humidity, it soil temperature,
    etc. are also important for crops. Thus, weather data is more commonly used than
    rainfall alone. For instance, AquaGIS (Lorite et al., 2013) uses both rainfall
    and weather predictions to show water levels in an area of interest, allowing
    for selection of a field. it Crop yield, as seen in 14 tools, is often used as
    a metric to measure return and farm performance. In addition, four tools have
    also used economy data to be able to optimise resources and leverage profit. Next,
    we found that landscape data is also used as an input in 12 different DSSs. The
    ability to hold water, for example, is greatly defined by the shape of a landscape.
    This, in turn, has an impact on irrigation requirements of the farm. In a few
    cases, it irrigation data has also been used as an input for decision support.
    We discovered five tools that used irrigation data as an input. As discussed in
    Section 3.1.5, irrigation data is often used in irrigation management systems,
    together with additional data such as soil, location, crop type, rainfall and
    weather predictions (see Table 8). Similarly, there are tools designed for fertiliser
    management (7 tools) and live stock management (4 tools) which keep track of crop
    fertilisation and it live stock data, respectively. These management tools usually
    illustrate the current status of a farm, allowing farmers to keep track of the
    impact on crops and environment. ViPER (Oliver et al., 2017), for example, illustrates
    the risk of microbial pollution (e.g. E. Coli) on a land using livestock data.
    Pest control is also an important aspect of agriculture. However, we found only
    four tools that used it pest data for decision support with pest and disease control.
    Interestingly, the use of it pest data is only found in DSSs that are designed
    to assist with whole-farm management (e.g. Vite.net Rossi et al., 100 (2014) and
    MOTIFS Meul et al., 2008). Tools designed for other stakeholders in addition to
    farmers, such as farm advisers, agronomists, policymakers and academic researchers,
    tend to use different sets of data compared to those designed for farmers only.
    These data include: vegetation (8 tools), it water quality (6 tools), it water
    resources (4 tools), biomass (2 tools), it environmental risk (2 tools), it biological
    index (1 tool), pollution (1 tool), it flux data (1 tool) and it domain ontology
    (1 tool). However, as can be observed in Section 3.2, not many of the tools are
    designed for farm advisers, agronomists, policymakers and academic researchers;
    the majority of the tools are designed for farmers. 3.7. Uncertainty Large amounts
    of unstructured data and complex predictive models are known to lead to uncertainty
    (Daradkeh et al., 2010). Given the concerns regarding trust and technology adoption
    in PA, the study of uncertainty assessment through visualisation is relevant to
    our research (Marra et al., 2003). Visualisation mechanisms for communicating
    uncertainty have proven to be successful gaining trust particularly for non-expert
    users (Kay et al., 2016). The incorporation of uncertainty into the decision-making
    process is crucial for making decisions and maximising benefits (Daradkeh et al.,
    2017). Only two out of the 61 papers considered the communication of uncertainty
    through visualisation: CropGIS (Machwitz et al., 2019) and visualizeR (Frías et
    al., 2018). CropGIS (Machwitz et al., 2019) uses a time-series to show information
    about biomass development of maize with a range of uncertainty describing various
    meteorological scenarios (see Fig. 15a). visualizeR (Frías et al., 2018) uses
    a bubble plot together with a map to visualise seasonal forecasting of climate,
    where the colour and size of the bubble are used to encode different levels of
    probability (see Fig. 15b). Such uncertainty representations better reflect the
    reality compared to static forecasts, making the prediction more reliable for
    farmers. Download : Download high-res image (948KB) Download : Download full-size

    shows the variability of biomass estimation over time. (b) visualiseR (Frías et
    al., 2018) uses bubble plot to communicate uncertainty in climate change scenarios.
    3.8. Design and evaluation Despite the potential of visualisation, many approaches
    are poorly received by end-users, which is attributed to a lack of engagement
    in the design process of the tools (Whitman et al., 2015). To tackle this gap
    between complex scientific tools and more “user-friendly” systems, a human-centred
    approach is desired. In this review, we found a total of 11 articles that followed
    a user observation approach (see Table 9). The majority of these articles (10
    out of 11) also reported using questionnaires for evaluation. In total, we found
    12 articles that used questionnaires to evaluate their DSSs. Besides, we found
    that nine out of 61 articles reported using interviews as a feedback method during
    evaluation. Amongst these articles that used observations, questionnaires and
    interviews, only one (i.e. Geovisage Jarvis et al., 2017) reported the use of
    a qualitative analysis method, thematic analysis, to analyse feedback from end-users.
    Finally, we found four articles that declared the use of workshops to obtain feedback
    from end-users. Table 9. The visualisation tools categorised by evaluation methods

    11 12 9 4 1 3 4 11 Percent (%): 18 20 15 7 2 5 7 18 Participatory design has been
    identified as an important methodology in the design and development of tools
    used by end-users in the agriculture domain, with the purpose of gaining trust
    and technology acceptance, increasing adoption with end-users. However, only 11
    out of 61 articles reported using a participatory design approach. Meanwhile,
    three articles used a focus group approach during the design process, and four
    reported the use of an iterative design approach. 4. Discussion The results presented
    have many implications to consider for many future research directions. Here,
    we discuss the results around the research questions presented in Section 1. 4.1.
    RQ1: What visualisation techniques are being used across different domains in
    agriculture? As presented in Section 3.3, the vast majority of visualisations
    in agriculture used a 2D map to provide an overview of the landscape to the user
    with a few attempts of 3D maps to provide more detail about the terrain. On top
    of these maps, the use of heatmaps is relevant, which are often layered over the
    maps to highlight different kinds of data for the user. Time-series are commonly
    used to display information over time, such as daily data coming from sensors.
    Histograms are also often used to provide information coming from sensors to show
    the distribution of data over time. Clustering visualisations, radar and pie charts
    were used to compare metrics from data in the map. Dashboards are relevant since
    they provide immediate access to various interactive components to monitor and
    display data, offering a set of visual tools to the decision-maker for interaction
    and exploration. We also discovered that dashboards are being used in a wide variety
    of application domains such as land suitability assessment, crop biomass analysis,
    crop control, wheat production, fertiliser management, pest control, dairy farming
    and vineyard management. In a number of other domains that we looked at, such
    as livestock management, aquaculture analysis, cotton production, rice production
    and soil-moisture analysis (see Table 4), dashboards are not yet introduced. We
    believe that these domains (but not limited to) can also greatly benefit from
    a dashboard. Uncertainty visualisation is another aspect that many existing DSSs
    have ignored, but can unquestionably improve user understanding of the decisions
    provided by the system. The role of uncertainty visualisation is further discussed
    in RQ3. 4.2. RQ2: How are these visualisations being used by end-users to make
    decisions? Most of the applications discovered in this review are intended for
    farmers for various activities in the field, ranging from land suitability assessment
    to livestock and crop management. Some others are used by advisers and agronomists
    to provide feedback to farmers in their decision-making. A few of these applications
    are designed for policymakers who use systems to simulate conditions and plan
    ahead on how policies can affect particular environments. For instance, visualisation
    of crop status in maps allows the farmer to know the right amount of fertiliser,
    irrigation water or pesticide needed to achieve the optimum yield at a particular
    location within a parcel. Overall, three different types of DSSs were observed:
    those designed for a particular farming requirement, simulation and whole-farm
    management (see Section 3.5 for details). Unfortunately, while whole-farm management
    is a difficult task and is often engaged by farmers nearly every day, not many
    tools are currently available to support such a task. More tools should provide
    farmers with various plug-and-play components allowing them to perform planning
    for whole-farm management or individual farming requirements. Similarly, with
    the growth in agricultural operations over the years, we should consider designing
    tools that are scalable and support multiple devices (i.e. desktop and mobile)
    for on-the-fly access and in-field decision-making. 4.3. RQ3: What is the role
    of uncertainty in the visualisation tools that support decision-making? Despite
    the importance of illustrating uncertainty in visualisations, the agriculture
    domain has not yet seen many applications of uncertainty visualisations. In this
    review, only two tools reported communication of uncertainty through visualisation.
    We claim that representation of uncertainty provides higher reliability and better
    reflection about the reality, making predictions more reliable for end-users (Sacha
    et al., 2016) and producing high quality and informed decisions (Fernandes et
    al., 2018). While many of the DSSs analysed in this review presented visualisations
    to aid stakeholders in their decision-making, they often lack an appropriate representation
    of uncertainty, despite this being an essential part of the decision-making process.
    Moreover, uncertainty has to be represented in a way that corresponds to the user’s
    expectations and knowledge in a way that is easy to understand (Kwon et al., 2011).
    We believe that visualisation should be used to support the fundamental parts
    of the analysis, especially during uncertain scenarios, allowing users to control
    and evaluate data at all stages and empowering their decision-making process (John
    et al., 2015). Presentation of uncertainty to non-expert users can be helpful,
    but to maximise its effectiveness it must be displayed in a way that reveals its
    advantages to end-users (Kinkeldey et al., 2015). 4.4. RQ4: What is the role of
    HCI in the design and development of visualisation tools to support end-user decisions?
    As presented in Section 3.8, only a few tools included a report about the usability
    evaluation or a participatory design process. Although we have discovered a great
    amount of visualisation tools in agriculture, it is still a difficult task to
    select the most suitable visualisation and interaction techniques for end-users.
    Feedback from end-users is an important aspect in developing tools that are usable
    in practical settings (Saizmaa and Kim, 2008, Rose et al., 2018). A lack of uptake
    of agricultural DSSs has been noted previously by researchers as a major challenge
    in the field (Rose et al., 2018). The “problem of implementation” is based on
    the knowledge that participatory strategies during the design and development
    stages are the most critical factors to build technology adoption (Lindblom et
    al., 2017). In fact, there is a significant effort to adopt a more user-centred
    approach in the design of DSS applications (Parker, 1999). A user-centred approach
    in the design and development of DSSs has shown to have a positive influence,
    for instance, in crop production (Parker and Sinclair, 2001), being seen as a
    beneficial method for transferring knowledge from scientists to farmers. One of
    the main reasons on low adoption and acceptance is because most of the existing
    DSSs are based on what scientists and developers consider as the necessary knowledge
    that should be implemented in the tool, but in reality, they fail to capture the
    expertise and practical needs of the farmers. In this review, the System Usability
    Scale (SUS), focus groups and semi-structured interviews appeared in some of the
    design and development stages of applications. In particular, the case of VisAdapt
    presented a collaborative and interactive design process, leading to satisfactory
    results towards the development of the tool. Focus groups and semi-structured
    interviews are well-established methodologies for exploring perceptions and gathering
    ideas from the stakeholders which are developed as a result of the social and
    interactive nature of the process. 5. Limitations There are some limitations to
    this systematic review study that should be articulated. First, our included studies
    were limited to those written in English, meaning that relevant studies written
    in other languages may have been excluded. Second, even though an extensive scope
    search was conducted in scientific databases and most relevant journals of the
    agriculture domain, some relevant literature in other domains might have been
    excluded. Third, we may have missed some tools that are used in practice, but
    that are not reported in scientific literature. Finally, some of the categories
    we used in this review could not be clearly identified in the papers we analysed.
    For example, a few papers did not clearly state the development status of the
    tools being presented. 6. Conclusion This systematic review presents a comprehensive
    report on the use of visualisation techniques in the field of agriculture. We
    have discussed the most used visualisation techniques considering end-users, data
    sources, representation of uncertainty and evaluation methods. Based on this analysis,
    we have also provided design guidelines towards the implementation of interactive
    visual DSSs. We found that while the vast majority of applications are intended
    to use maps for visualisation together with satellite imagery, there is a significant
    opportunity of using dashboards to support farmers and advisers with more interactive
    components and dashboards to handle and interact with uncertain data. We also
    recommend the use of participatory design research, that has been successfully
    applied to increase the usability of applications for farmers. In addition, we
    highlight the role of representing uncertainty to increase user confidence and
    trust. The extensive body of analysed tools provide rich examples of how DSSs
    for agriculture can be designed on top of a variety of data sources involving
    different stakeholders in the design process, and representing both the data as
    well as underlying uncertainty to support informed decision making. We hope that
    this review will inspire and motivate many researchers and practitioners towards
    creating dashboards and visualisations following participatory research methods
    and uncertainty representations in future design and developments of agricultural
    DSSs. Acknowledgements Funding for this research has been provided by the European

  description: Scientific organizations and researchers are eager to apply recent
    technological advancements, such as sensors and actuators, in different application
    areas, including environmental monitoring, creation of intelligent buildings,
    and precision agriculture. Technology-assisted irrigation for agriculture is a
    major research innovation which eases the work of farmers and prevents water wastage.
    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used as sensor nodes that directly interact
    with the physical environment and provide real-time data that are useful in identifying
    regions in need, particularly in agricultural fields. This paper presents an efficient
    methodology that employs WSN as a data collection tool and a decision support
    system (DSS). The proposed DSS can assist farmers in their manual irrigation procedures
    or automate irrigation activities. Water-deficient sites in both scenarios are
    identified by using soil moisture and environmental data sensors. However, the
    proposed system's accuracy is directly proportional to the accuracy of dynamic
    data generated by the deployed WSN. A simplified outlier-detection algorithm is
    thus presented and integrated with the proposed DSS to fine-tune the collected
    data prior to processing. The complexity of the algorithm is O(1) for dynamic

    are eager to apply recent technological advancements, such as sensors and actuators,
    in different application areas, including environmental monitoring, creation of
    intelligent buildings, and precision agriculture. Technology-assisted irrigation
    for agriculture is a major research innovation which eases the work of farmers
    and prevents water wastage. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used as sensor
    nodes that directly interact with the physical environment and provide real-time
    data that are useful in identifying regions in need, particularly in agricultural
    fields. This paper presents an efficient methodology that employs WSN as a data
    collection tool and a decision support system (DSS). The proposed DSS can assist
    farmers in their manual irrigation procedures or automate irrigation activities.
    Water-deficient sites in both scenarios are identified by using soil moisture
    and environmental data sensors. However, the proposed system''s accuracy is directly
    proportional to the accuracy of dynamic data generated by the deployed WSN. A
    simplified outlier-detection algorithm is thus presented and integrated with the
    proposed DSS to fine-tune the collected data prior to processing. The complexity
    of the algorithm is O(1) for dynamic datasets generated by sensor nodes and O(n)
    for static datasets. Different issues in technology-assisted irrigation management
    and their solutions are also addressed. Topic: Energy Management in Buildings

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Water is an important
    resource and must be used efficiently. The agriculture sector is the main water
    consumer; it uses approximately 70% of all available water resources worldwide
    [1]. This sector’s consumption will be controlled if modern technology is adopted
    with traditional irrigation procedures, particularly flooding. However, in this
    sector, modern technologies are accepted only if they exhibit a sufficient potential
    to increase crop yield while preserving as many resources as possible [2]. At
    present, different activities, particularly irrigation, in agriculture are performed
    with traditional procedures that are time consuming, labor intensive, and wasteful
    [3]. The traditional agricultural paradigm was geared toward modern technology
    utilization in the last decade, and its acceptance ratio at the commercial level
    increased. Technology adaptation has led to the automation of different agriculture-related
    activities, and this automation is known as precision farming or precision agriculture
    in literature [4]. The main motivation is that crop quality and production rates
    will improve if the right resources are applied at the right time under suitable
    environmental conditions. Such mechanisms improve crop yield and conserve considerable
    resources, such as water, pesticide spray, and potassium. Different mechanisms
    are utilized to collect environmental parameters and soil features, such as moisture,
    salinity, pH, temperature, air humidity, and wind direction [5], [6]. Scientific
    and research organizations are eager to apply the potential of micro-electro-mechanical
    system (MEMS) technology and the overwhelming characteristics of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) in different application areas, including the military, intelligent
    buildings and bridges, medical field, industries, and precision agriculture [7]–[9].
    In precision agriculture, WSNs are deployed in fields to sense and report various
    parameters that are vital to plant growth. Initial experiments with WSNs in the
    agriculture sector have been conducted in controlled environments, such as greenhouses,
    in which sensors/actuators are deployed to control the indoor environment automatically
    [10], [11]. WSNs have also been utilized in different projects, such as automating
    greenhouses, efficient water utilization, and identification of crop diseases.
    Most of these studies used WSNs as data collection tools, and decision support
    systems (DSS) were responsible for actual decisions. After the successful deployment
    of WSNs in controlled environments, researchers and scientists explored their
    applications in open field environments, but such an exploration was challenging.
    As part of a LOFAR project, Baggio [12] deployed a small network of wireless nodes
    in potato fields to detect a fungal disease known as Phytophthora. A similar experimental
    study was performed as a joint project of Switzerland and India in [13]. Mancuso
    and Bustaffa [14] explored the potential of WSNs to control various tomato diseases
    and described how this technology helps in controlling such diseases. Burrell
    et al. [15] deployed sensor nodes in a vineyard to assist managers in handling
    different scenarios, frost risk, and specific location by providing valuable information
    continuously. The FLOW-AID project used WSN to identify water deficit situations,
    scenarios where plants are in desperate need of water [16]. In 2011, Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Information and Communication
    Technology utilized WSNs to help recover the ecological integrity of Queensland’s
    Spring Brook National Park and regenerate the rain forest from agricultural grassland
    [17]. Other experimental studies have been conducted recently, but their description
    is beyond the scope of this work. The literature on WSNs in the agriculture sector
    is robust, but most of the studies neglected an important issue associated with
    data generated by sensor nodes, namely, outliers. Outliers are noisy data generated
    by sensor nodes when a sensor is malfunctioning or generated because of interference
    or colliding packets. These data must be detected and corrected prior to examination
    by DSS. Existing noise detection algorithms are highly complex, and their implementation
    in real-time DSS, a system that operates 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, is
    difficult. Therefore, a simple mechanism that does not degrade the overall performance
    of real-time DSS is needed to detect outliers. Most existing studies are designed
    for sprinkler systems and are inapplicable to real agriculture environments where
    flooding mechanisms are generally used to irrigate crops; such a practice is particularly
    common in Asia. In this work, a WSN-based outlier detection and irrigation management
    system is developed to assist farmers in handling crop irrigation schedules. The
    proposed system collects environmental and soil-related data through sensor nodes
    that are examined by the outlier detection module. The proposed noise detection
    algorithm is implemented to improve the system’s accuracy. Afterward, DSS further
    examines it to identify water deficient sites in agricultural fields. After identification,
    the alarming unit is activated, and text messages are sent over a local area network
    (LAN) to inform farmers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
    Section II, a brief overview of WSNs, particularly in the agriculture sector,
    is presented, followed by the proposed system architecture in Section III. Section
    IV describes the proposed outlier detection algorithm and its working mechanism.
    The different issues identified and solved during this study are presented in
    Section V. In Section VI, the achievements of the proposed approach are described,
    and a comparison of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms is performed
    based on real-time and benchmark datasets. The last section provides the concluding
    remarks. SECTION II. WSN in Agriculture Sector The distinguishing characteristics
    of WSNs make this technology an ideal solution to various real-world problems.
    These problems arise in different domains, such as the military, medicine, telemetric,
    intelligent building, hazard environments, and agriculture [18]. In the agriculture
    sector, WSNs are used to assist farmers in different activities, such as irrigation
    (whether sprinkled or flooding), detection and prevention of crop diseases in
    early stages or preventing favorable occurrence conditions, water-deficient location
    identification, and duration of field monitoring and pesticide spraying [19].
    Various experimental studies on WSNs in the agriculture sector have addressed
    particular problems. The studies that are relevant to our work are presented in
    this part. WSNs have been deployed in greenhouses to control the dew condensation
    problem that arises due to temperature, air humidity, pressure, and other environmental
    factors [20]. Park et al used different sensor nodes to collect data and adjust
    greenhouse environments accordingly. To compute for dew condensation, they utilized
    a well-known Bahrenburg formula. In a joint project to determine the ratio of
    arsenic in underground water, a WSN was deployed in [21] to collect various soil
    parameters of a rice field, such as arsenic, soil moisture, temperature, calcium,
    carbonate, chloride, nitrate, and pH. The collected data were thoroughly examined
    in sophisticated laboratories to determine the required ratio. Similarly, sensor
    nodes were deployed in Malawi to collect pH, reduction/oxidation (redox), and
    turbidity values to determine the quality of water [22]. In Spain, WSN was deployed
    to monitor soil contents, such as moisture, salinity, pH, and temperature [23].
    This system was successfully implemented in a real agriculture environment, but
    the decisions were not automated. To describe how few sensor nodes covered a particular
    area, the authors wrote an expression that describes the relationship between
    shower nozzle capacity and sensor node radius [24]. Konstantinos et al. presented
    a WSN-based architecture to control environmental conditions in a commercial greenhouse.
    The collected data were thoroughly examined to find their correlation with crop
    conditions [25]. Proper seedling of watermelon relies on environmental parameters,
    such as temperature, air humidity, and light values. Sensor nodes were deployed
    in greenhouses to collect and examine desired information and assist farmers in
    proper seedling of watermelon. A process control strategy management system was
    also designed in previous studies to determine proper and automatic seedling of
    watermelon; its various components were WSN, DSS, RFID-based method, and queuing
    theory-based algorithm [26], [27]. Phytophthora is a potato fungal disease that
    occurs due to certain environmental conditions, and if these conditions are prevented/avoided,
    then the possibility of the disease’s existence will become negligible. Baggio
    [12] utilized a WSN to collect desired data and attempted to avoid conditions
    that are favorable for the disease. Similarly, WSNs were deployed in potato fields
    by Shinghal et al. [3] to improve productivity. Favorable conditions for tomato
    diseases were avoided by using WSNs inside greenhouses [14]. In vineyards, sensor
    nodes were deployed in different locations to collect valuable data that were
    used for predicting various diseases, pest control, and facilitating the handling
    of different activities [15]. Kotamäki et al. [28] deployed a WSN near a river
    basin to determine the quality of water and described its effects on soil content
    and crop yield. The Common Sense Net Project was designed for marginal farming
    in India, in which different sensor nodes were used to identify areas whose water,
    rain, reservation capacities were high. Additionally, the project can identify
    various crop diseases [13]. The Flow AID Project was designed to utilize the WSN’s
    potentials in determining water-deficient sites in agriculture fields [16]. Dursun
    and Ozden [29] presented an automatic drip irrigation management system for cherry
    trees. Pardossi et al. [30] described a mechanism to integrate rote zone sensors
    with WSN and used it in the identification of water deficit situations. Various
    investigations on automatic control of greenhouses were reported in [4], [31],
    and [32]. Different site-specific automatic irrigation management systems were
    presented in [33]–[36]. SECTION III. Proposed System Architecture and Deployment
    A. Architecture Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of the proposed DSS. In the proposed
    architecture, an application layer is designed to provide services to farmers
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). These services include
    interaction with the real-time system, identification of water-deficient locations,
    vulnerable situation alarms, and environmental monitoring. The middle layer describes
    how various components of the proposed system interact with one another, physically
    or logically, to provide the desired services precisely. The sensor manager unit
    collects data from sensors and forwards these to a microprocessor that conducts
    aggregation for further processing. The gateway module receives packets from sensor
    nodes, and is attached to a computer that runs the proposed DSS. DSS collects
    the newly arrived packets from the gateway module, checks their accuracy through
    a noise detection module, decides the current situation, and stores it. The physical
    layer directly interacts with the environment. Sensor nodes that use various sensing
    capabilities collect soil moisture, air humidity, temperature, and leaf wetness
    data and send the data to the sensor manager. These parameters are vital in the
    development of a precise DSS for irrigation. FIGURE 1. Architecture of the proposed
    DSS. Show All Real-time systems need to be continuously operational to assist
    farmers, but at the same time, the sensor node sampling rate must be adjusted
    accordingly to prolong the WSN’s lifetime. In our testbed, wasp-mote agriculture
    sensor boards with desired functionality were programmed and deployed in a real
    agriculture environment, namely, an orange orchard. During the first phase of
    the experimental setup, the boards were placed in close proximity to reduce packet
    losses, thereby improving communication reliability. In the second phase, the
    boards were placed to cover as much area as possible, and each node can communicate
    with the gateway either directly or through multi-hop communication. Their transceivers
    use the Xbee protocol and can communicate within a 500 m range. Nod e 3 was deployed
    within the direct communication range of the gateway (460 m), and Nod e 1 and
    Nod e 2 were placed at a distance of 460 m from Node3. The distance between the
    nodes and gateway was kept small to maximize their throughput. The proposed DSS
    performance is not affected by increasing or decreasing scalability of sensor
    nodes because these nodes act as data collection points. Dense deployment increases
    data packets, but this situation is not an issue, particularly in the agriculture
    sector, in which the sampling rate of the deployed sensor nodes must be very low,
    namely, two or three packets per 24 hours. B. Wasp-Mote Boards Deployment The
    implementation of a precise real-time DSS in any application depends on the selection
    of appropriate technology, sensors, and parameters to be monitored. Sensor board
    selection is based on coverage area, battery lifetime, processing capability,
    transceiver, and integration of sensors. Parameter selection is application-specific.
    In our study, we considered soil and environmental parameters. Soil moisture is
    vital in the development of a precise irrigation schedule; that is, if the sensed
    value is below a threshold value, then this area needs water and must be irrigated.
    For this purpose, soil moisture sensors were deployed at three different levels
    in the agricultural field, as shown in Figs. 2 and Fig. 3. In addition to the
    soil moisture parameter, an atmospheric moister exerts drastic effects on the
    watering schedules of various crops and must be monitored regularly. These sensors
    are deployed in close proximity to plant leaves, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally,
    temperature and humidity parameters are significant in the design of a precise
    DSS because the soil moisture threshold value is directly proportional to the
    environmental temperature. Therefore, these sensors are integrated with wasp-mote
    boards to collect their full potential, as shown in Fig. 5. The gateway module
    is connected to a computer to receive data and process them. FIGURE 2. Deployment
    of soil moisture sensors in orange orchard. Show All FIGURE 3. Deployment soil
    moisture sensor in real agricultural environment. Show All FIGURE 4. Leaf wetness
    sensor deployment near plant leaves. Show All FIGURE 5. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors deployment. Show All SECTION IV. Proposed Decision Support System The
    proposed system collects soil and environmental parameters through its deployed
    WSN in the orange orchard. Initially, the collected data are examined by the concerned
    board to minimize redundant packets via aggregation, and the data are transferred
    to the destination via a gateway. The data sensed by four different sensors are
    merged into one packet to increase the efficiency of the proposed system in terms
    of energy consumption. These packets are forwarded to the outlier detection module
    where their accuracy is checked and sent to DSS for onward processing if found
    correct. DSS thoroughly examines these packets by comparing different parameters
    with their defined threshold values, particularly soil moisture (250 Hz).The threshold
    values such as soil moisture (250Hz), are determined through deploying the sensors
    (3) in dry soil; and collecting their readings over a period of three days. If
    the data are in the defined range, then they are stored in a database; otherwise,
    the alarm unit is activated, and alert messages are forwarded to the LAN or mobile
    phone. The GUI of the proposed system shows collected data in graphical and textual
    formats. The operation of the proposed system is summarized in Fig. 6. FIGURE
    6. Working of the proposed system. Show All A. Proposed Outliers Detection Algorithm
    Outliers are data packets generated by a malfunctioning sensor or via interference
    and collision. WSNs are highly susceptible to outliers due to various restrictions
    on their size, processing, and transceivers. The literature on outlier/noise detection
    is bulky, but most of the approaches were presented and validated based on static
    datasets, and their implementation in a real-time system is difficult or impractical.
    These algorithms improve dataset accuracy but equally degrade the overall performance
    of a real-time system because for every packet, the mechanism repeatedly searches
    the entire dataset [37], [38]. Moreover, the accuracy of these algorithms is directly
    proportional to dataset size and computation time. Their accuracy for large datasets
    is extremely high, but the computation time is also high and results in low performance
    of DSS, particularly in a real-time system. Therefore, a simplified outlier detection
    algorithm was developed to overcome these issues and improve the performance of
    real-time DSS and dataset accuracy. The performance of a real-time system based
    on the proposed outlier detection algorithm is unaffected by dataset size because
    the algorithm does not scan the overall dataset and considers the most recent
    packets only. Its computation time and performance are exceptionally good in real-time
    datasets, and it is equally applicable to static datasets. Algorithm 1 starts
    by matching the currently received packet with the previously stored one, which
    is the last accurate packet, that is, the packet received at time T i and T i−1
    . If their difference is less than the defined threshold value (10 Hz for the
    soil moisture sensor), then it is forwarded to the DSS for further analysis. However,
    if their difference crosses the defined limit, then it is either an outlier or
    an abrupt change scenario that occurs because of direct connection of water with
    soil moisture sensors. In this case, data are stored temporarily, and further
    processing is delayed until the next packet from that particular node arrives.
    Then, the recently received packet is compared with two packets, namely, the one
    that is temporarily stored and the last packet stored in the database. For example,
    data collected at time T 3 are matched with data received at time T 2 and stored
    temporarily, and data gathered at time T 1 is successfully stored. If the difference
    between packets received at T 3 and T 1 is less than the defined threshold value,
    then the data packet received at T 2 is an outlier and replaced with the average
    value of data packets T 1 and T 3 . However, if the difference between data packets
    T 2 and T 3 is less than the threshold value, then it is an abrupt change scenario,
    and both values are stored in the database. Algorithm 1 Proposed Outliers Detection

    21: else 22: Temp−Locatio n i ← Cur-Pkt 23: Outliers-ID ← 1 24: end if We consider
    Fig. 7 in which the soil moisture value received at time 13:00 is 0 Hz, representing
    the most recent packet. The packet collected at time 12:30, 850 Hz, is the last
    accurate value stored in the database. These two values are matched, and their
    difference is much larger than the threshold value, which is 10 Hz in our case.
    Therefore, this packet is temporarily stored, and the decision is delayed until
    the next packet from the same node, Nod e 1 , arrives. When the next packet at
    time 13:30 is received, it is matched with the packet collected at time 12:30
    or with most recently stored packet. The difference between these packets is below
    the threshold value, 1 Hz, indicating that the temporarily stored packet is an
    outlier and must be replaced with the average value of data packets that arrived
    at times 12:30 and 13:30 (840 Hz). Then, both values are stored in the database,
    and the data are as shown in Fig. 8. In this scenario, a real-time DSS that does
    not use the outlier detection mechanism activates the alarm unit for the water
    deficit condition and sends a text message over LAN because the soil moisture
    value is less than the threshold value. However, smart DSS, which possesses outlier
    detection facility, easily handles this situation. Another debatable scenario
    for real-time DSS in the agricultural environment is the separation of the abrupt
    change that occurs because of the direct connection of water with a soil moisture
    sensor, as shown in Fig. 8 at time 15:30. The proposed algorithm handles this
    situation through a similar mechanism described for the detection of outliers.
    However, in this case, the temporarily stored value and the currently received
    value are identical or approximate each other. Both values are stored in the database
    without modification. FIGURE 7. A scenario of both outliers and abrupt change.
    Show All FIGURE 8. Outliers free scenario. Show All SECTION V. Issues Resolved
    During Proposed Experimental Setup During the deployment phase of the proposed
    testbed, various issues were identified and resolved. A. Packets Collision and
    Nodes Overhearing A sensor node uses a broadcasting mechanism to communicate with
    the gateway and other nodes in the network, thereby resulting in the collision
    of packets or reduction of throughput. Collision usually occurs due to the concurrent
    communication of sensor nodes deployed in close proximity or within the communication
    range of one another. In the proposed testbed, a simplified mechanism, namely,
    delay timers in wasp-mote boards, is used to avoid concurrent communication of
    sensor nodes and collision. Every experimental setup uses a sampling rate or a
    sensor node rate of transmission, which is 30 minutes in our case. The criteria
    for packet transmission of every node are adjusted according to the neighbor node
    communication schedules. For example, if nod e 1 begins communication with other
    nodes or the gateway at time 10:00:00, then its neighbor nodes must wait for the
    maximum propagation delay; that is, the time required for successful communication
    between the most widely separated nodes (approximately 5 seconds in the proposed
    experimental setup). Therefore, nod e 2 , a neighboring node of nod e 1 , must
    delay its communication for 3 seconds and start around 10:00:04 if its neighbors
    are not interested in transmission. However, this mechanism works only for a testbed
    in which a limited number of sensor nodes are used. For dense WSNs, other mechanisms,
    such as channelization, are utilized. Overhearing of a sensor node in WSNs exerts
    drastic effects on node lifetime and needs to be handled efficiently, particularly
    in highly dense networks. To avoid this problem, sensor nodes are placed in such
    a manner that each node has at most one path for communication with the gateway
    and does not hear other neighboring nodes where feasible. In our case, the problem
    was successfully solved through manual adjustment of the distance between sensor
    nodes. However, this method is useful only in the engineered setup of WSN only
    and is not feasible for random deployment. This technique introduces the path
    loss problem in large networks, but it is efficient for small networks. B. Crops
    Canopy Crop canopy is another important problem associated with the deployment
    of WSNs in agricultural fields, particularly orchards. Crop canopy affects the
    communication range of sensor nodes in a network and environmental parameters.
    During the initial phase of our project, the problem was not considered, and nodes
    were deployed randomly at different locations but within the direct communication
    range of the gateway module. However, only nod e 3 packets were received successfully,
    and the remaining node packets were lost due to crop canopy. Further analysis
    of the experimental setup and field was performed, and different alternatives
    were applied to resolve this issue. This thorough investigation led us to the
    problem of crop canopy and its effects on the communication range of sensor nodes
    because nod e 1 was in the direct line of sight with the sink node, whereas the
    other nodes were not. Obstacles or orange trees were also present. Therefore,
    nodes were deployed in the orange orchard in such a manner that each node was
    in the direct line of sight with its intended receiver node. Node deployment in
    direct line of sight does not necessarily mean that nodes are unable to communicate
    when obstacles exist between transmitting and receiving nodes. Nodes placed in
    the crop canopy can communicate, but their coverage area and transmission range
    are much smaller than those in the direct line of sight communication. Another
    issue caused by crop canopy was the effects on sensor node readings, particularly
    sensors that collect environmental data (e.g., temperature and humidity). In summer,
    nodes deployed in a shady region generate temperature readings of 40 °C– 44 °C,
    whereas sensors exposed to sunlight sense temperatures in a range of 44 °C– 49
    °C. To overcome this problem, 50% of the sensor nodes were deployed in direct
    sunlight, and the remaining nodes were placed in shady areas. C. Effects of Heavy
    Rain Heavy rain is vital to plant growth rate, particularly in summer when watering
    requirements are high. In traditional approaches, flooding/watering schedules
    are postponed due to heavy rain and particularly based on farmers’ experience.
    Therefore, the proposed DSS must handle this scenario in a manner similar to traditional
    approaches but without requiring an experienced farmer to monitor the system and
    judge its decisions. In the proposed DSS, the decision whether to irrigate or
    not is primarily based on soil moisture content and other supplementary parameters.
    In the case of heavy rain, soil moisture sensor readings exceed the threshold
    value, clearly indicating that the irrigation schedule must be deferred. Similarly,
    conducting specific case studies for every season is not needed because if soil
    moisture content values are above the threshold value, then irrigation is unnecessary.
    Additionally, the proposed system possesses the flexibility to adjust threshold
    values whenever required and can be used in different agricultural scenarios.
    D. WSNs Lifetime An important aspect of the applicability of WSNs in different
    application areas is their lifetime, which mostly relies on the onboard batteries
    of sensor nodes. Efficient utilization of available power resources increases
    WSN lifetime. In the proposed testbed, sensor nodes actively probe the environment
    for the shortest duration of 1 minute and then switch to sleep mode for approximately
    29 minutes. Every board conducts aggregation of the data collected by its sensors
    and merges the data into a single packet. The aggregation approach combines the
    data gathered through temperature, air humidity, soil moisture and leaf wetness
    sensors into a single data packet. The aggregation mechanism reduces the number
    of transmitted packets from 4 to 1, and individual packets for every sensor are
    attached to a wasp-mote board, thereby improving the lifetime of WSNs. Additionally,
    in the agriculture sector, particularly in the watering schedules of open field
    crops, collection of data once or even twice a day is appropriate or needed. Therefore,
    the sampling rate of deployed nodes must be decreased to 12 hours or more to further
    increase WSN lifetime. SECTION VI. Results and Discussion In the case of real-time
    data, the worst case complexity of the proposed outlier detection algorithm is
    O(1), whereas pattern anomaly value (PAV), MPAV, and rare pattern drift detector
    (RPDD) algorithms [37], [38] have complexities of O( n 2 ) , O(n) and O( n 2 +n)
    respectively. Hence, the proposed algorithm is the best solution among these algorithms
    for real-time DSS because it does not affect the functionality of DSS. Similarly,
    the proposed algorithm’s worst case complexity for a static dataset is O(n) ,
    where n represents size of the dataset. These algorithms were tested on real-time
    data obtained via our testbed deployed in an orange orchard. The performance of
    the algorithms in terms of computational time is presented in Fig. 9, which shows
    that the proposed algorithm outperformed contemporary schemes. Moreover, the performance
    of these algorithms was examined thoroughly by continuously increasing the dataset
    size. Unlike the proposed algorithm, the other schemes were inconsistent with
    the dynamically changing dataset. In the case of the real-time dataset, the computational
    time of the other algorithms was directly proportional to the size of the dataset,
    whereas the proposed algorithm was not affected. Moreover, the proposed algorithm’s
    memory requirements were fewer than those of the other algorithms. The implementation
    of these complex algorithms in real-time DSS required highly sophisticated and
    demanding technology, which is expensive, whereas the proposed algorithm worked
    well with existing technology. The algorithms were also tested on a static dataset,
    and their computation time is depicted in Fig. 10. Our algorithm’s performance
    was better than that of the other algorithms, particularly in terms of execution
    time. FIGURE 9. Computational time comparison on real time data set. Show All
    FIGURE 10. Computational time comparison on static data set. Show All The complexity
    of an algorithm is vital to its development, implementation, and execution in
    real-time systems. Complexity is directly proportional to algorithm accuracy and
    computation time. In real-time DSS specifically for the agriculture sector, an
    algorithm must be as accurate and simple as possible so the overall performance
    of DSS is unaffected. If the algorithm is accurate and precise but degrades the
    overall performance of the system, then it is useless. An accuracy comparison
    is presented in Fig. 11. Although the proposed algorithm’s accuracy is lower than
    that of the other algorithms, its effect on the overall performance of real-time
    DSS was smaller, and the algorithm works on a personal computer. Improving the
    accuracy and precision of an algorithm results in increased complexity, degradation
    of the overall performance of the real-time system, and inability to run efficiently
    on personal computers. FIGURE 11. DSS’s accuracy. Show All In addition to the
    real-time dataset, the algorithms were examined thoroughly by using benchmark
    datasets, as shown in Table 1. The execution time of the proposed algorithm was
    less than that of the other algorithms specifically for dynamic datasets. The
    proposed algorithm is an ideal candidate for an efficient real-time DSS. The precision
    and accuracy of these algorithms on the benchmark datasets are presented in Table
    2. Accuracy is described in terms of accurate decisions taken by DSS when these
    algorithms were implemented as a separate module to fine tune data before processing.
    The proposed algorithm is not precise for datasets that possess multi-valued noise,
    such as the FacesUCR dataset. However, when datasets have single-valued outliers
    only, the proposed algorithm is ideal. TABLE 1 Comparative Computation Time of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets TABLE 2 Comparative Accuracy of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets A real-time decision support system
    was designed in this study to facilitate farmers in various agriculture-related
    activities. Farmers will adopt a technology-assisted system if it has a simplified
    interaction paradigm, possesses a simple GUI, and provides the desired services.
    The proposed DSS possesses a user-friendly interface that is can be easily understood
    by inexperienced users and provides different services simultaneously, as shown
    in Fig. 12. FIGURE 12. A sample screen shot of the proposed system showing data
    of soil moisture sensor. Show All SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work The
    demand for efficient utilization of available water resources, specifically in
    the agriculture sector, is increasing daily due to water scarcity and global climate
    change. Therefore, technology-assisted irrigation mechanisms, sensors, and actuators
    must be realized in real agriculture environments. These approaches provide water
    upon demand and control water wastage. They are helpful in controlling water resources
    but exert drastic effects on plant growth rate and yield. In this work, we developed
    a technology-assisted outlier detection and decision support system (DSS) to facilitate
    irrigation, particularly flooding. The proposed system is highly precise because
    it uses an embedded outlier detection module that thoroughly examines the correctness
    of the collected data and forwards the data to DSS for further processing. DSS
    analyzes different parameters to identify water-deficient sites and reports them
    to farmers or generates an alarm. This system possesses a user-friendly interaction
    environment that makes it easy to use. In the future, we will further improve
    the accuracy of the proposed DSS by examining additional parameters and will enhance
    it to assist farmers in other agriculture-related activities, such as pesticide
    and fertilizer use and determination of soil properties. Furthermore, due to nodes
    un-availability and their security issues, the proposed scheme was evaluated only
    on three sensor nodes. As a future work, we will investigate the proposed algorithm
    on a large-scale. ACKNOWLEDGMENT All authors declare that they have no conflict

  description: Many agricultural activities can be highly enhanced by using digital
    technologies. One of these activities is the regulation of the quantity of water
    in cultivated fields, a process which is directly interwoven with the sustainability
    and the productivity of crops, since insufficient or excessive irrigation may
    not only be obstructive, but also destructive. This paper proposes a scheme based
    on the collaboration of an integrated system for automated irrigation management
    with an advanced novel routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), named

    the climate values to calculate the quantity of water that is needed for irrigation.
    In case that the change on the collected values is above a threshold more frequent
    data collection is proposed to minimize the necessary quantity of water. On the
    other hand, in case that the change of the values is below a preset threshold
    then the time interval to collect data can increase to save sensor energy, leading

    Efficiency 1. Introduction Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy and,
    in many cases, in the survival of nations, since it provides the basic subsistence
    for the entire population of a country while at the same time it interacts with
    several other industries. Especially in rural areas, inhabitants depend on agriculture
    as it is critical not only for their nutrition but it also constitutes the base
    of all trade. Moreover, the ever increasing world population demands larger amounts
    of food which subsequently presupposes a well-managed and cost-effective agriculture.
    Throughout the world, irrigation is one of the main water consumers. Almost 60
    percent of all the world water, taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and wells,
    is used for the irrigation of. Without irrigation, crops would never have been
    grown in the deserts of California and Israel. Irrigation has been around for
    as long as humans have been cultivating plants. Even though the traditional way
    of pouring water on fields is still a common irrigation method, other more efficient
    and mechanized, methods are also used. One of the more popular mechanized methods
    is the centre-pivot irrigation system, which uses moving spray guns or dripping
    faucet heads on wheeled tubes that pivot around a central source of water. There
    are many irrigation techniques farmers use today, since there is always a need
    to find more efficient ways to use water for irrigation. Producers need to find
    more effective and efficient use of water resources while maintaining high crop
    yields. Some efforts to more efficiently utilize water for crop production are
    examined, Producers has to find more effective and efficient use of water resources
    while maintaining high crop yields. While the producers have to apply water to
    meet the needs of the crop, they must realize that with traditional management
    practices, yields and returns from the irrigated crop will be reduced as compared
    to a fully irrigated crop. Moreover, to properly manage the water for the greatest
    return, producers must have an understanding of how crops respond to water, how
    crop rotations can enhance irrigation management, and how changes in agronomic
    practices can influence the water needs. Water stress during critical times may
    result in low yields. Crops, such as corn, respond with more yields for every
    inch of water that the crop consumes as compared to other crops such as winter
    wheat or soybeans. However, crops, such as corn require more water for development
    or maintenance before any yield is produced. Corn requires approximately 10 in.
    of water to produce the first increment of yield as compared to 4.5 and 7.5 in.
    for wheat and soybeans respectively. The integration of automated procedures in
    agriculture increases the productivity as well as the quality of the products,
    thus fulfilling the ever increasing demand for healthy and inexpensive food around
    the world. However, an efficient automated system has to describe all the main
    processes that are involved in the agriculture chain. Plant cultivation, which
    can be considered as the most critical process, is affected by many factors such
    as the temperature, the humidity and the topography of the surrounding environment.
    Achieving ideal values for these factors and optimizing their consequences depend
    on the type of the crops cultivated. Thus, the design of an efficient irrigation
    system should consider these factors to achieve a successful and high quality
    harvest. For example, the process of grape maturation is affected by the photo-synthesis
    that produces the sugar that is stored in the grapes. In grapes, the balance among
    sugar, acid, pH and potassium is fundamental in determining the quality of the
    produced wine. This balance depends to a large extent on the frequency of the
    irrigation of the cultivated fields. The scientific discipline of Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSNs) has reached a point of maturity that it can provide accurate and
    highly effective services to farmers. Thus, WSNs should monitor the above described
    factors to achieve an improved harvest (Shu-ming et al., 2009). WSNs are able
    to rapidly capture process and transmit critical data in real time. The real-time
    data collected by sensors located in the cultivated fields may be used by experts
    or by automated systems to make decisions, such as which irrigation policy should
    be applied. Additionally, since a WSN does not require the deployment of wires,
    the need for human intervention is minimized. For these reasons, it is expected
    that WSNs will become a low cost yet effective approach for the monitoring of
    fields in the near future. Additionally, WSNs can be combined with a system that
    manages the water applied to each field based on the environmental conditions
    and on the feedback sent by the individual sensors. There are several advantages
    in using WSNs and automated decision systems in agriculture: • Improved estimation
    and planning of field irrigation based on the available water supply. • Minimization
    of the required human resources, time, and effort in the agricultural production.
    • Early detection of possible floods in the field that could be destructive for
    the crops and proper pumping of the water to mitigate such cases. • Better coordination
    between different working groups, i.e. farmers and technical assistants thanks
    to a clear division of responsibilities. • Creation of knowledge gathered from
    the deployed sensor networks for future applications in the agriculture domain.
    All the irrigation models that have been proposed so far do not use an agriculture
    model to calculate the quantity of water for irrigation. Moreover, they use WSNs
    to collect data from the area without considering the routing of data from the
    sensors to the base station, a technique that could provide improved energy efficiency.
    In this paper, we propose a system that takes into consideration the historical
    data and the change of the climate values to calculate the quantity of water that
    is needed for irrigation. In case that the change of the collected values is above
    a threshold more frequent data collection is proposed to be performed to minimize
    the necessary quantity of water. On the other hand, in case that the change of
    the values is below a preset threshold then the time interval to collect the data
    can increase to save sensor energy, leading to a prolonged sensor lifetime. In
    this paper an integrated architecture, based on the use of WSNs, for automated
    irrigation management is proposed that aims to achieve effective and prompt irrigation
    of parcels with great energy efficiency due to the utilization of a novel routing
    protocol. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work is
    presented. Section 3, describes the structure of the proposed system. Section
    4, presents the performance evaluation. In Section 5, the paper is concluded and
    areas of future work are presented. 2. Related work The work in the area of WSNs
    in agriculture is composed of two parts. The first part deals with the routing
    protocol used to minimize the energy consumption in WSNs, while the second part
    addresses the development of irrigation systems in agriculture that manage the
    water used for irrigation. 2.1. Energy efficient routing algorithms in WSNs There
    exist several proposals to develop protocols that consider the energy efficiency
    of sensors in their routing activities. In hierarchical networks, nodes are organized
    in clusters in which a node plays the role of a cluster head. The cluster head
    is responsible for coordinating activities within the cluster and for forwarding
    information between clusters. Clustering has the potential to reduce energy consumption
    and to extend the lifetime of the network, by achieving a high delivery ratio
    in a scalable manner. In agriculture, the network used may be rather large since
    it needs to cover the entire cultivated fields. Therefore, the hierarchical protocols
    may be suitable and beneficial for precision agriculture. In (Heinzelman et al.,
    2000) LEACH, a hierarchical protocol in which most nodes transmit to cluster heads,
    is presented. The operation of LEACH consists of two phases: • The Setup Phase.
    In the setup phase, the clusters are organized and the cluster heads are selected.
    Each node determines whether it will become a cluster head in this round by using
    a stochastic algorithm at each round. If a node becomes a cluster head once, it
    cannot become cluster head again after P rounds, where P is the desired percentage
    of cluster heads. • The Steady State Phase. In the steady state phase, the data
    is sent to the base station. The duration of the steady state phase is longer
    than the duration of the setup phase in order to minimize overhead. LEACH is a
    wireless distributed protocol that helps WSNs to use less energy. However, LEACH
    uses single-hop routing where each node can transmit directly to the cluster-head
    and the sink. Therefore, it is not recommended for networks that are deployed
    in large regions. PEGASIS is an energy efficient protocol (Lindsey and Raghavendra,
    2002) using a chain-based protocol and providing an improvement over LEACH. In
    PEGASIS each node communicates only with a nearby neighbour in order to send and
    receive data. It also takes turns (cluster head transmit after collecting data
    from all the nodes) transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount
    of energy spent per round. The nodes are organized in such a way as to form a
    chain, which can either be accomplished by the sensor nodes themselves, using
    a greedy algorithm starting from a certain node, or the Base Station (BS) can
    compute this chain and broadcast it to all the sensor nodes. TEEN is a hierarchical
    protocol designed for sudden changes in the sensed attributes, such as sudden
    drops in temperature due to frost (Manjeshwar and Agrawal, 2009). Responsiveness
    is an important attribute of time-critical applications, in which the network
    is operated in a reactive mode. The sensor network architecture in TEEN is based
    on a hierarchical grouping where closer nodes form clusters and this process goes
    to a higher level until the sink is reached. Even though TEEN works well in conditions
    like sudden changes in the sensed attributes, in large area networks and when
    the number of layers in the hierarchy is small, TEEN tends to consume a lot of
    energy, because of long distance transmissions. Moreover, when the number of layers
    increases, the transmissions become shorter and the overhead in the setup phase
    as well as in the operation becomes dominant. In (Lotf et al., 2008), a routing
    protocol for self-configuration and hierarchal routing, named ELCH, is presented.
    In this protocol, the sensors vote for their neighbours to elect suitable cluster
    heads. It combines the cluster architecture with multi-hop routing for the reduction
    of the total transmission energy. The above approaches take into consideration
    the energy consumption of the sensors in order to extend the lifetime of the network.
    However, since they are general purpose networks they do not take into account
    the principles, characteristics and requirements of the specific application that
    sensor networks are used for. All the aforementioned protocols try to minimize
    the energy consumption. However, they differ on the algorithm used. Most of these
    algorithms are based on the selection of the node having the higher residual energy
    in every cluster as the cluster head for the next round. Although, this consideration
    seems to be quite rational, there are many cases where its effectiveness is limited.
    For instance, in the cases where the node having the higher energy residues is
    positioned close to the border line of its cluster, significant amounts of energy
    are spent by the cluster nodes in order to transmit to their cluster head. 2.2.
    Automated irrigation in agriculture WSNs have been used for the automated irrigation
    of parcels (Rehman et al., 2011). These applications address the scarcity of water
    problem and the need of proper water management. This is achieved by providing
    water only to places where it is needed, while at the same time controlling the
    quantity of the consumed water. Various models, systems and methodologies for
    the irrigation of parcels have been developed. In (Diaz et al., 2011) a methodology
    to guide the development of applications for the agricultural domain based on
    WSNs is presented. This methodology divides the development of applications in
    agriculture in steps that gets an input, produces an output, and describes the
    procedures to be undertaken by a specific group of users. Specifically, the purpose
    of this methodology is to describe the life cycle of applications by identifying
    the responsibilities of the individual users. In (Stone et al., 1985), a computer-based
    monitoring system for continuous measurements of soil water potential is proposed
    and analyzed. This model measures the quantity of water during a period. The results
    are used to decide the quantity of water to be used for irrigation. Indirect estimates
    using direct measurements of the soil moisture are discussed in Zazueta and Smajstrla
    (1992). In this model the measurements of time in samples are used to estimate
    the quantity of water that is required for irrigation. Moreover, in Meron et al.
    (1995) a control system for apple tree irrigation management using densitometers
    is presented. In this model the water required for irrigation is measured using
    a soil sensor-actuated automatic irrigation system. Sensor actuation thresholds
    are optimized for high fruit yield and quality. In (Testezlaf et al., 1997) an
    automated irrigation control system for the management of greenhouse container
    plants is evaluated. The system consisted of soil moisture sensors, a hardware
    input/output interface, a computer with the relevant software and actuators. An
    evaluation of the control system is performed considering a greenhouse. The results
    show that the control system is reliable in applying water responding to the plant
    demands. Reliable measurements of the substrate water tension using sensors presented
    a major difficulty. In (Kim and Evans, 2009) the design of decision support software
    and its integration with an in-field WSN to implement site-specific sprinkler
    irrigation control via Bluetooth wireless communications is described. This model
    consists of machine conversion, localization, and mission planning. The first
    requirement is to convert a self-propelled irrigation machine from a conventional
    mechanical and hydraulic system to an electronically controllable system for individual
    sprinkler head control. Then, the geographic location of the irrigation machine
    is continuously monitored by a self-positioning system. Once the machine is controllable
    and accessible, mission planning decide the time to irrigate that each sprinkler
    head should apply at each location. In (Sudha et al., 2011), a TDMA-based medium
    access control (MAC) protocol is used to collect environmental data such as soil
    moisture and temperature of an irrigation system. The sensors are in the idle
    state and change to the active state to measure the temperature and the moisture
    level of the soil. The base station sends requests to nodes to collect the temperature
    and the moisture level of a particular area. A node responds to this request by
    sending back the present value of the moisture and the temperature of that region.
    The other nodes remain in the idle state. After sending the required data the
    node goes back to the idle state. This process is repeated for all the nodes.
    In using a direct communication method each sensor node sends its data directly
    to the base station. In addition to the above, there also exist some recent attempts
    to develop remote sensing and control systems for irrigation management using
    WSNs. In (Kim et al., 2008), a remote sensing and control of an irrigation system
    using a distributed WSN is described. The field conditions are monitored by sensor
    stations distributed across the field based on a soil property map, and they are
    periodically sampled and wirelessly transmitted to a base station. In (Xiaohong
    et al., 2009), a water-saving irrigation system based on fuzzy control technology
    and WSN is described. The node takes the soil moisture error and error change
    rate as its input and obtains the water demand amount of the crops under certain
    soil moisture conditions. In (Dubey et al.., 2011), a WSN based remote irrigation
    control system and automation using dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) code is described.
    The system uses signalling to control the water flow for sectored, sprinkler or
    drip section irrigation. In (Zhang et al., 2011), a calibration method for detecting
    soil water content based on information sharing is described. The system is an
    efficacious approach to determine the balance between the calibration accuracy
    of moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production. All these attempts
    propose systems that are able to provide irrigation services to parcels without
    considering in depth the efficient management of the water used. 3. Overview of
    the proposed system The proposed system considers climate values, such as humidity,
    temperature and wind to calculate the quantity of water that is needed for proper
    irrigation. Also, when evaluating the climate parameters it considers past states
    and compares them to the current states to make efficient decisions. For example,
    if the value of the temperature in the previous day has decreased then less water
    is required. Based on the collected historical values the quantity required might
    be larger. Thus, water can be conserved in case of a high rate of change of these
    environmental values. The total complexity of the model is 2n + n, where n is
    the number of nodes in the cluster. The proposed automated irrigation management
    system, as mentioned above, aims at the automatic irrigation of parcels with possibly
    non-uniform composition like the one shown in Fig. 1, which comprises of five
    neighbouring parcels having different crops. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Neighbouring parcels hosting different kinds of crops. The proposed automated
    irrigation management system comprises of two subsystems. The first subsystem
    concerns the WSN which collects the data from the cultivated fields, as shown
    in Fig. 2a. The second subsystem involves the decision making system, the flow
    chart of which is depicted in Fig. 2b. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    2. (a) The proposed WSN architecture, (b) the flow chart of the proposed decision
    making system. The proposed WSN structure includes a set of sensors that monitor
    the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity, the temperature and the
    speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day. The individual sensors
    are placed at appropriate locations in the parcels. The collected information
    is transmitted to a base station. More specifically, the sensors at the field
    scan the weather conditions periodically (for example every 10 s). The collected
    data are sent via wireless (for example, a ZigBee radio transmitter) to the base
    computer at the receiver. The sensors are self-powered by a battery. A set of
    sensors is used to measure air humidity and temperature. Also humidity sensors
    are used to measure soil moisture content and wind speed. Moreover, specialized
    sensors are used to measure the flooding water levels. The main application is
    based on the collected inputs it receives from the sensors. It then, acts based
    on the configuration that is applied to the system. This configuration is based
    on the requirements for the place that needs to be monitored. This is related
    to the type of crops that are planted in the field (corn, potatoes, etc.), the
    chemical soil components (i.e. sodium content) and the season of the year (i.e.
    winter, summer etc). This system can be used by growers, who want to monitor the
    status of soil moisture content and watch on their computer monitor the conditions
    at various locations, follow the weather information and monitor in detail the
    irrigation operation. During the irrigation, they may also want to see the current
    location of irrigation. For example, if a rain shower passes over the field, the
    software should be able to automatically adjust the amount of water being applied.
    In the proposed system, the routing protocol that is used to send traffic from
    the information sources to the destination assumes the coexistence of a base station
    and, without loss of generality, of a set of homogeneous sensor nodes. These nodes
    are randomly distributed within a delimited area of interest. The base station
    is located at a long distance away from the sensor field. Both the base station
    and the set of sensor nodes are considered stationary. The base station is able
    to transmit with high enough power to all the network nodes, due to its unlimited
    power supply. Moreover, the sensors are hierarchically organized into clusters.
    3.1. The irrigation and decision making system In agriculture, the efficient management
    of water should be considered. Therefore, the water required for irrigation has
    to be minimized. The proposed system based on the information sent from the sensors
    estimate the quantity of water needed. The sensors are used to send to the base
    station the humidity and the temperature of the soil, the humidity, the temperature
    and the speed of the air, and the duration of sunshine per day. The proposed system
    based on these values calculates the water quantity for irrigation. Moreover,
    to develop a more accurate system the historical data regarding the quantity of
    irrigation used in previous period are considered to adjust the quantity of water
    that is needed for irrigation. A comparison between current and past states is
    necessary to arrive at optimum decisions. The main parameters that affect the
    surface runoff are the following: the climate (rainfall intensity, moisture content,
    wind, evaporation) and the type of vegetation. An important factor for the implementation
    of an irrigation system is the knowledge of the soil moisture at the beginning
    of the growing season, which depends mainly on the weather conditions during the
    preceding winter. Additionally, the knowledge of the water quantity stored in
    underground aquifers, which is available for plants through the capillary rise,
    is critical. In order to reach a decision for the irrigation needs of a particular
    parcel, it is necessary to add up the useful water from the rain (Pe), the change
    in the stored moisture (SM) in the soil root zone at the beginning of the germination
    period, the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the water that by capillary elevation
    reaches the crop rooting zone from the ground (GW) – all these are measured in
    kg/m2 day. If the soil is cohesive, the water can easily rise above the ground
    level, but the rate of capillary rise is slow. On the contrary, if the soil is
    light, then the height of the capillary rise is limited, but the pace of growth
    is fast. If these rates are sufficient to meet the water needs of the plant there
    is a steady development of the crop and the following holds: (1) If these water
    sources cannot meet the water needs of the crops for normal growth, the water
    balance is in deficit. To achieve a smooth development and a normal yield, the
    crops should be provided with a quantity of water (IRn) equal to this deficit:
    (2) where ETc is expressed as follows: (3) kc is the crop coefficient and ETo
    is the reference evapotranspiration in kg/m2 day that is expressed as follows:
    (4) where Ra is the theoretical solar radiation expressed as equivalent depth
    of evaporated water in mm d−1, Tmean is the mean air temperature in °C and TD
    is the difference between maximum and minimum air temperature in °C. Pe is presented
    as follows: (5) where Pt is the total precipitation in kg/m2 day and D is the
    decline allowed in the soil moisture content until the next irrigation dose is
    applied. The function f(D) is an adaptation factor that equals 1 when D = 75 kg/m2
    day, whilst for every other value of D f(D) is expressed as follows: (6) The SM
    contribution is significant in a water balance model for net crop requirements.
    The soil moisture is controlled by a combination of climate properties, land surface
    model characteristics and land–atmosphere interaction. GW contributes to the partial
    coverage of net the crop water requirements, through capillary elevation. The
    extent of the capillary elevation depends on the soil characteristics and the
    distance to the water table. In this paper, the main focus is on the use of a
    WSN to collect data using sensors and to send the data to a database. Then the
    sensed data can be used by a system for the automated irrigation of the fields.
    Therefore, in this paper Pe, SM, GW are not further analyzed. It is assumed that
    their values are provided by appropriate tensiometer sensors. Therefore, Pe, SM,
    GW are considered to sum up to a value k as presented in the following: (7) In
    this framework we consider k to be equal to the total amount of rain in this area
    expressed in kg/m2 day. Nevertheless, the value of the evapotranspiration (ETc)
    that is used to describe the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the
    land surface to the atmosphere is calculated based on information provided by
    sensors located in the fields. Evaporation is related to the amount of water that
    is sent to the air from sources such as soil, canopy interception and waterbodies.
    Transpiration is the amount of water in a plant and the subsequent loss of water
    as vapor through the stomata in its leaves. The rate of evapotranspiration depends
    on climatic factors (i.e. on temperature, sunlight, wind speed, and humidity).
    Therefore, an increase in the temperature in the wind speed or in the amount of
    sunlight results to a corresponding increase of evapotranspiration. On the other
    hand, humidity has the opposite effect. The models used in the literature to estimate
    the water quantity are categorized in empirical, computational and combinational.
    The empirical relationships are based on air temperature (Hargreaves, 1974, Thornthwaite
    and Hare, 1965). They only require as input the value of the air temperature and
    calculate the water without using other parameters, such as moisture or wind speed.
    Moreover, they are based on the mean values of temperature and may provide limited
    results if the period of use is less than a month. The computational models are
    based on the solar radiation (Caprio, 1974, Idso et al., 1977). They use the value
    of the radiation during the day to estimate the water without considering other
    parameters as moisture or temperature. They may have limited performance if the
    parcels are on a hill. The computational models may provide more accurate results
    as they consider all the environmental parameters to estimate the water for irrigation.
    In (Monteith, 1965), a combination model for the water based on parameters as
    temperature, moisture and wind speed is proposed. This model is general and does
    not consider the kind of crops in the estimation process of the required water.
    In (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977), a model that is an improvement of the model in
    Monteith (1965) and it is based on the kind of crops is proposed. However, both
    models offer high complexity and are difficult to use in case of frequent changes
    on the parameters. Therefore, in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) a model that is based
    on the previously proposed models but is more flexible due to its low complexity
    is proposed. This model does not use the resistance of the surface to estimate
    the water. In this paper, the model proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) for
    the calculation of evapotranspiration is used. The evapotranspiration according
    to this model is calculated as follows: (8) where αe is a fixed value and is considered
    to be equal to 1.3. Δ symbolizes the curve slope of the vapor saturation and is
    calculated based on the information from sensors on the air temperature and the
    saturation pressure of water as follows: (9) where T is the air temperature and
    es is the soil temperature expressed as follows: (10) γ represents the air cool
    factor that depends on the air speed at 2 m height and it is calculated by the
    sensor as follows: (11) where u2 is the air speed at 2 m height. Rn expresses
    the total net radiation energy that depends on microwave radiation that is sent
    from the sensor. (12) where Sn is the algebraic sum of the incoming minus the
    reflected microwave radiation and Ln is the net microware radiation. Both these
    values are based on the soil and air humidity values reported by the sensors.
    The parcels are categorized based on the geographical, topological and climate
    information as well as on the type of crops cultivated in them. In Fig. 1, we
    see an example where five different parcels with different crops are monitored.
    The parcels are then divided into clusters and the sensors are allocated in each
    cluster. For example, parcel A can be divided into two clusters. Then, based on
    the above mentioned characteristics of each cluster and on the real time data
    collected by the sensors the quantity of the water needed (QWi) at cluster i is
    calculated using the following equations: (13) (14) The values of the above equations
    are collected by the sensors that are located in the parcels. The proposed system
    to save water for irrigation makes an adjustment on the quantity of water as calculated
    in (14) based on the information reported by the sensors. The system considers
    the mean value of the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity, the
    temperature and the speed of air, as well as the duration of the sunshine hours
    per day for the specific geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, the
    mean value of the water quantity used in previous periods is calculated as follows:
    (15) where Δ′ symbolizes the curve slope of the vapor saturation and is calculated
    based on the information in previous periods of the air temperature and the saturation
    pressure of the water. γ′ represents the air cool factor that depends on the wind
    speed at 2 m height that is collected in the previous period. Rn′ expresses the
    total net radiation energy that depends on the microwave radiation that is sent
    from previous period. Moreover, the ratio of change on the values during the last
    days is calculated as follows: (16) where Δ″ symbolizes the curve slope of the
    vapor saturation and is calculated based on the information collected during the
    last days regarding the air temperature and the saturation pressure of the water.
    γ″ represents the air cool factor that depends on the wind speed at 2 m height
    during the previous days. Rn″ expresses the total net radiation energy that depends
    on microwave radiation during the previous days. Therefore, the quantity of water
    needed for irrigation (QWrequired) is calculated as follows: (17) If no historical
    values are available, the proposed system can be adjusted to use only the information
    provided by the real time values from sensors. 3.2. Case study It is important
    to consider the mean values of the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity,
    the temperature and the speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day
    for the specific geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, their mean
    values for a specific area during the same month in previous years could provide
    indication on the environmental conditions. These mean values combined with the
    real time values collected by the sensors could provide better results for the
    water quantity required for irrigation. The proposed model is considered as an
    improvement to the one proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) as it estimates
    the water for irrigation based on the previous values collected by sensors. An
    example that proves the efficient management of water by the system is the case
    that for a specific field the mean water required for irrigation based on (14)
    is 10 kg/m2 per day. This quantity of water can be minimized if historical data
    are considered. If historical data are used, then the mean value for irrigation
    could be less than the current measurements. If the value is 5 kg/m2 the water
    that will be used for irrigation will be less than the current amount (using (14))
    and it can be calculated as follows: (18) Therefore, there is no need for irrigation
    when historical data are used but there is a need to pump out water. Thus, water
    can be managed more efficiently. Moreover, in case that the mean ratio of change
    of the water required for irrigation the previous month is −1 and the current
    water required for irrigation is 10 kg/m2 then less water is required for irrigation
    (see Table 1, Table 2). Table 1. The detailed values of the quantity of water

    the proposed model is evaluated using ECHERP, a protocol that pursues energy conservation
    (Nikolidakis et al., 2013). ECHERP is a scheme that is based on the appropriate
    selection of nodes as cluster heads. It models the network and the energy spent
    to transmit data from sensors to base station, as a linear system. Then, using
    the Gaussian elimination algorithm it selects the cluster heads of the network.
    Its main characteristic is that it elects as cluster head the node that minimizes
    the total energy consumption on the cluster. Based on the energy level and location
    information that the nodes send, each node sets up a neighbour information table
    and sends this table along with its corresponding information to its neighbours.
    This information is sent to the BS that runs a Gaussian elimination algorithm
    to compute the number of rounds at which every node can be a cluster head, trying
    to maximize the network lifetime. The BS broadcasts the unique IDs of the newly
    selected cluster heads and their cluster members and the nodes use this information
    to enter a cluster. The lower level cluster head aggregates the data and then
    transmits the compressed data to the upper lever cluster heads until the data
    reaches the base station. The sensor nodes placed in a WSN have the responsibility
    of the event detection, data processing and transmission of data. The energy spent
    on these actions has to be minimized as the nodes are battery equipped and thus
    have limited energy. The notation of rounds is used to describe the successful
    send of data from sensors to the BS. Therefore, one round is the one-time data
    send from all sensors to the BS. The energy ETx(k,d) that a node dissipates for
    the radio transmission of a message of k bits over a distance d is due to running
    both the transmitter circuitry ETx-elec(k) and the transmitter amplifier ETx-amp(k,d)
    and is given by the following: (21) where Eelec is the transmitter circuitry dissipation
    per bit, which is supposed to be equal to the corresponding receiver circuitry
    dissipation per bit and εamp is the transmit amplifier dissipation per bit per
    square meter. Moreover, in case that the node distance from the base station is
    d, it is more efficient to split this distance including a few nodes in the middle.
    In case that d = d1 + d2 + d3, then . Thus the ETx(k,d) reaches its minimum value.
    Similarly, the energy ERx(k) dissipated by a node for the reception of a k bit
    message is due to running the receiver circuitry ERx-elec(k) and is given by:
    (22) In order to evaluate the performance of ECHERP, simulations over 50 different
    100 m × 100 m network topologies were performed. The general network architecture
    considered is the following: • A fixed base station is located away from the sensor
    nodes. • The sensor nodes are energy constrained with a uniform initial energy
    allocation. • Each node senses the environment at a fixed rate and always has
    data to send to the base station. • The sensor nodes are immobile. • The network
    is homogeneous and all nodes are equivalent, i.e. they have the same computing
    and communication capacity. • The network is location unaware, i.e. the physical
    location of the nodes is not known in advance. • The transmitter can adjust its
    amplifier power based on the transmission distance. In all the simulation scenarios
    we examined 100 homogeneous nodes with an initial energy of 3 J, randomly scattered
    within a 100 × 100 m2 sensor field. The BS was positioned at point (0,150), so
    it is at least 100 m away from the centre of the field and the packets sent are
    36 bytes. The energy consumption due to communication is calculated using the
    first order energy model (Heinzelman et al., 2000). We assume that each sensor
    node generates one data packet per round to be transmitted to the BS. The sensor
    nodes were grouped into clusters consisting of cluster heads that send data to
    upper level cluster heads to finally reach the BS. Fig. 7 shows the number of
    nodes that remain alive when LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP are applied. More precisely,
    the depletion of all the network nodes in LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP takes place during
    the 800th, 980th and 995th rounds respectively. Download : Download full-size

    to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a number of simulations using
    different values of time required for a round have been considered. In the simulation
    tests the trade-off between the time of a round and the water required is defined.
    The main objective of this model is to keep the energy consumption of the nodes
    in low level while having more accurate measurements from sensors on the water
    required. The total water required for irrigation is expressed as follows: (23)
    where Total Water represents the quantity of water required based on the irrigation
    model presented in (17). Mean Water represents the average value of the water
    required when different values of time for a round are considered. Moreover, the
    round represents the number of times that the exchange of data from sensors to
    base station is performed. The quantity of water required for irrigation is calculated
    as follows: (24) Based on the above formulas simulation tests were performed to
    calculate the quantity of water required and the lifetime of the network for various
    values of round time ranging from 10 to 230 s. In all the tests it was assumed
    that the duration of the network lifetime was equal to 995 rounds. The simulation
    results are summarized in Table 6. Therefore if a round in ECHERP is equal to
    110 s energy efficiency is provided while smaller quantities of water are consumed.
    5. Conclusions This paper focused on the issue of automated irrigation in agriculture
    and proposed a novel system for efficient irrigation using WSNs. The proposed
    system is based on a model which performs efficient irrigation management by finding
    the appropriate schemes for the rational utilization of water for irrigation.
    The automated irrigation system proposed is based on the use of a novel routing
    protocol named ECHERP. The utilization of this protocol offers remarkable energy
    efficiency. The development of novel systems, like the one proposed in this paper,
    which combines efficient irrigation models along with energy efficient utilization
    of WSNs shows to be a very promising and effective application of automation in
    agriculture. The proposed model can be further extended to consider the effect
    of the field characteristics on the quantity of water required for irrigation.

    water allocationGIS 1. Introduction Water crises around the world frequently occur
    because of global climate change and the increasing intensity of human activity.
    The main reason for water crises is the lack of sustainable methods of water resource
    management (UNESCO, 2006). Many international organizations, including the Global
    Water Partnership (GWP), the International Network of Basin Organizations (INBO),
    the European Parliament, and the International Center for Integrated Water Resource
    Management (ICIWaRM), have made considerable efforts to improve water resource
    management efficiency. A Decision Support System (DSS) is an efficient tool that
    is often used to address water resources management problems. DSS, which is management
    in origin, can solve semi-structured and un-structured problems that cannot normally
    be expressed in unambiguous formulas (Little, 1970; Anthony et al., 1971). The
    underlying premise of DSS has been applied to water resources decision-making
    processes since the early 1970s (Hashemi and Decker, 1969; Andersen et al., 1971;
    Cleary et al., 1973; Kumar and Khepar, 1980; Fedra, 1984), even though the DSS
    concept was not proposed until later. Guariso et al. (1985) developed the first
    Water Resource Management Decision Support System (WRMDSS) and applied it to Lake
    Como in northern Italy. Since then, many successful WRMDSSs have been developed,
    including WaterWare (Jamieson and Fedra, 1996a, Jamieson and Fedra, 1996b; Fedra
    and Jamieson, 1996), RiverWare (Zagona et al., 2001), L-THIA (Engel et al., 2003),
    mDSS (Mysiak et al., 2005), E2 (Argent et al., 2009), and other DSSs (David et
    al., 2012; Rowan et al., 2012). DSS has also proven to be a useful and widely
    applied tool in environment (McIntosh et al., 2011; Panagopoulos et al., 2012),
    policy support (Delden et al., 2011), and urban water management (Aulinas et al.,
    2011; Gualtieri, 2011). WRMDSSs have been developed in China to address water
    resource problems, including water allocation (Chen et al., 2008), water use management
    for agriculture (Xu et al., 2003; Niu and Quan, 2009), and water supply management
    (Liu, 2000). The development of WRMDSS was prompted by two factors. One factor
    is that the ability of DSS to address semi- or un-structured problems is gradually
    increasing because of the integration of optimization methods (Azamathulla et
    al., 2008; Efendigil et al., 2008; Azamathulla et al., 2009), physical models
    (Mysiak et al., 2005; Zagona et al., 2001), geographical information systems (GISs)
    (Crossland et al., 1995; Liu, 2004; Qi and Altinakar, 2011), remote sensing (RS)
    (Jones and Barnes, 2000; Cai et al., 2006; Michel et al., 2012), expert systems
    (ESs), and other technologies. GIS has ushered in a revolution in the development
    of distributed modeling. GIS has been widely applied to support the parameterization
    of many distributed models (Jamieson and Fedra, 1996a, Jamieson and Fedra, 1996b;
    Koutsoyiannis et al., 2003; Maia and Silva, 2009) due to its advantages in the
    analysis and visualization of spatial data. The other factor driving the development
    of WRMDSS is that each component of the water cycle with a higher spatial and
    shorter time resolution can be accurately calculated by means of the physical
    processes in the water cycle, which have been clearly described and simulated
    by scientists. In addition, the keys to developing a successful WRMDSS lie in
    fully understanding real water resources management problems and dealing with
    the relationship among the applicability, maneuverability, and flexibility of
    systems (Mysiak et al., 2005; Argent et al., 2009). Water resource management,
    however, is increasingly influenced by climate change and human activities (Arnell,
    1998; Christensen and Lettenmaier, 2007). Climate change is an exogenous process
    related to runoff and precipitation, which cannot be affected by decision makers,
    managers or farms. Climate change can cause more extreme hydrological events (e.g.,
    flood, drought) and create greater uncertainty in water resource management. The
    impacts of human activities (e.g., hydraulic engineering, crop structure, and
    water allocation among multi-level sectors) on water resource management are subjective
    and can be prioritized by policy makers based on the information available to
    them. It may be difficult for decision makers or managers to devise a water allocation
    scheme for a particular region within a particular period without up-to-date information
    due to the considerable extent of human activities. This paper, therefore, introduces
    a methodology for allocating water based on water requirements and equity to help
    multi-level decision makers manage water resources in a DSS while fully accounting
    for the effects of human activities (e.g., hydraulic engineering and crop structure).
    The methodology is incorporated into DSS for water allocation along the middle
    reaches of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. This DSS integrates GIS,
    Internet, relational database (SQLServer), software engineering, and visualization
    techniques to provide a flexible, user-friendly, and applicable information system.
    The DSS also incorporates models that are used to calculate the components related
    to solving water resource management problems. The next section introduces the
    background and the user''s requirements. Section 3 describes the system design
    and implementation. The components and models combined in the system and their
    application will be introduced in Sections 4 Application of HD: the middle reaches
    of the Heihe River Basin, 5 Conclusion, respectively. The last section discusses
    the benefits and shortcomings of the WRMDSS. 2. Background 2.1. A brief description
    of the water resource management context As a representative inland river, the
    Heihe River Basin of northwestern China, crossing Qinghai province, Gansu province,
    and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is separated into upper, middle, and
    lower reach areas and has a surface area of approximately 14.3 × 104 km2. The
    inflow of the middle and lower reaches is measured by the Yingluo Gorge and Zhengyi
    Gorge hydrology stations, respectively. The Heihe River, with a length of 821
    km, originates from the Qilian Mountains, and the end of Juyan Lake. The mean
    annual runoff of the Heihe River is approximately 1.588 × 109 m3 (Yingluo Gorge
    hydrological station, from 1945 to 2010). In the middle reaches, where 95% of
    the population and 88.7% of the economy contributing to the Heihe River Basin
    (Sun, 2002) is concentrated, agriculture is the dominant activity, with 84% of
    the total available water resource volume consumed by irrigation. The mean annual
    precipitation is only 120 mm. However, the mean annual potential evaporation is
    approximately 1410 mm. With the goal of maximum economic benefit, the agricultural
    water consumption has gradually increased, and groundwater has been excessively
    exploited due to the lack of sufficient surface water, which has caused numerous
    ecological and environmental problems. Thus, water management for agriculture
    plays an important role in water resource management. In addition, there are 33
    main irrigation districts located in 6 counties (Shandan, Minle, Ganzhou, Linze,
    Gaotai, and Sunan) in the middle reaches (Fig. 1). The water authority is decentralized
    into irrigation districts, counties, and cities which have formed multi-level
    sectors of coordination management for water resources. Different levels of water
    authority sectors work on different water resource management problems (e.g.,
    field water distribution for water management sectors of irrigation districts,
    water allocation between irrigation districts for water management sectors of
    counties, water allocation between counties for water management sectors of municipalities),
    and low-level sectors are governed by high-level sectors. Accordingly, the factors
    impacting water resource management problems are different among the multiple
    levels and sectors. At present, each water management sector develops a water
    policy or a water allocation scheme to maximize the economic benefit according
    to only limited statistical information and little coordination with other sectors.
    Thus, it is difficult to reach a water allocation equilibrium among all water
    management sectors. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Map of the study
    area. An investigation of existing WRMDSSs shows that a general WRMDSS can be
    applied to some regions; however, it is not presently implemented in the Heihe
    River Basin. It is difficult to apply WRMDSSs in the Heihe River Basin for the
    following reasons: (1) Water resource management problems exhibit large differences
    between regions or countries due to the impacts of geological conditions, water
    policies, economic development, and the complex relationships among water management
    sectors. In economically developed countries or regions, there are high-quality
    hydraulic infrastructures, flow, and water quality monitoring systems, and efficient
    water-saving technologies. Water resource management problems focus on how to
    optimize drip irrigation, spray irrigation, and sprinklers to allocate water at
    small spatial scales (Pedras et al., 2009) and how to control the emission of
    pollutants and their migration to protect water quality and aquatic ecosystems
    (Monte et al., 2009). At the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin, however,
    flood irrigation is the common system, and water allocation for different levels
    of water use units, rather than water quality problems, is a the priority for
    decision makers. (2) Decision makers play an important role in water resource
    management. They may subjectively use different methods to address the same water
    resource management problem because of the impact of culture, water policies,
    and the cognitive ability to solve problems. How one makes a decision largely
    depends on one''s culture and personality (e.g., hierarchist, individualist, egalitarian,
    and fatalist) (Douglas, 1982), which are internal causes, as well as one''s cognitive
    ability. Water policies are external causes for decision makers and are influenced
    by government, climate change, and economic development. (3) The development of
    DSSs requires cohesion among diverse members of a group to address complex problems.
    Water resource managers, decision makers, scientists, and system developers are
    included in the group. When these group members communicate in meetings or seminars,
    water resource managers, and decision makers usually discuss water problems that
    are generally semi-structured or un-structured, scientists analyze the complexity
    of these problems and find modeling methods to solve them using mathematical formulas,
    and the problem-solving processes are implemented by system developers who design
    system interfaces for diverse users using computer language. Accordingly, the
    most successful WRMDSSs are developed to resolve the unique water resource management
    problems of special regions. Although some WRMDSSs can address many water resource
    management problems, they have limitations when applied to other regions. 2.2.
    Objectives of the study The objectives of this study are to allocate water to
    different water use units (e.g., sectors, agricultural fields) using mathematical
    models based on water requirements and equity and to develop an information system
    for different water management sectors to manage and share data related to water.
    The models and the information system are incorporated into a DSS (HD: Heihe River
    Basin Irrigation water resource management Decision Support System). The water
    requirement is estimated by taking into account water rights, crop structure,
    hydraulic engineering (e.g., ditches, reservoirs), and irrigation patterns. 3.
    System design and implementation 3.1. Model choice DSS models are selected in
    consideration of the objectives and application of the DSS (Kort and Booij, 2007).
    Therefore, water problems and decision objectives must be taken into account to
    find the most appropriate models. Implementing the model requires a large amount
    of observation data. The application of many models is limited due to the lack
    of an essential observation system. In addition, models must have the same spatial
    and temporal scales. Thus, the following principles were followed in the model
    selection. (1) The models should satisfy the users'' requirements under the current
    monitoring infrastructure conditions, and its parameters should be easy to obtain.
    (2) If there is no available model, the development of a new model should be taken
    into account by means of the users'' demands rather than overhauling the current
    complex models. (3) The emphasis is on water allocation by multi-level water resource
    management sectors. Therefore, the models from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations) were selected to calculate the crop water requirement.
    A new model of irrigation water allocation was developed for decision makers at
    different levels by combining the irrigation water allocation and crop water consumption
    models (see Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Framework of
    water resource allocation for multiple level water management sectors. 3.2. HD
    system architecture System architecture is very important for a successful WRMDSS
    software system. An architecture with 5-layers is applied in HD to provide a seamless
    communication mechanism between inner modules of the system to enhance their logical
    relationship, reduce the system development and maintenance cost, and improve
    the system flexibility. The 5-layers include the user interface layer, pre-process
    layer, transaction layer, post-process layer, and database layer, which are described
    in detail below (see Fig. 3.): (1) The user interface layer is used to receive
    the requirements from the user. This layer is composed of a GIS module, an input
    module, and an output module. The input module provides a user-friendly and simple
    interface for users with different computer technologies. All model results are
    visualized using texts, reports, and 2-dimensional charts in the output module.
    (2) The pre-process layer is a bridge between the middle layer and the database
    layer. This layer plays an important role in providing the various interfaces
    to access the geo-information and non-spatial data in the layer. There are two
    geo-information formats: one is raster data, which comprise land use/land cover,
    county boundary, reservoir and soil type; and the other is vector data consisting
    of river, channel, city, trail, road, well, water resource management sectors,
    and hydro-stations. These data are managed using MapWindow. (3) In the middle
    layer, many affairs and models are defined as the core of HD. The affairs comprise
    the multi-level data access control mechanism and the multi-level data check process,
    which are managed by a data management system. The models are defined in the model
    library and managed by a model management system, which includes the Water Allocation
    Model (WAM), Irrigation Water Allocation Model (IWAM), and Crop Water Consumption
    (CWC). (4) The objective of the post-process layer is to transform the results
    of the model by means of drawing 2-dimensional charts, making images based on
    a grid using GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library), opening a GIS component,
    and generating water allocation scheme reports. (5) Geo-formation and non-spatial
    data saving processes are implemented in the database layer. Download : Download

    is developed to address decision-making problems regarding how to fairly allocate
    water to different levels of water use units to help improve water allocation
    schemes for water managers. Fig. 4 illustrates two processes that contribute to
    developing an irrigation water allocation scheme and implementing water allocation.
    In the first process, the irrigation water allocation scheme is developed using
    the irrigation water allocation model at the field level (see Sections 3.3.2 Irrigation
    water allocation model at the field level – FWA, 3.3.3 Water allocation model
    at the irrigation district level – IWA, 3.3.4 Water allocation model at the county
    level – CWA for details) taking into account irrigation water quotas, water right
    areas, channel engineering information and crop patterns. The objective of this
    step is to compute the rate of different levels of channel inflow and the time
    of the channel inflow, whether opened or closed, which is the basis of the water
    allocation scheme at the irrigation district level. Then, the daily crop water
    demand is calculated using the CWC model (see Section 3.3.1 for details) integrating
    crop patterns and channel engineering information, which is the basis of the irrigation
    water allocation model at the irrigation district level. Finally, the reasonable
    irrigation water resource allocation scheme is formed for high-level water resource
    managers based on the irrigation water allocation model at the county level according
    to the water rights ratio among different counties. In contrast, during the implementation
    of water allocation, water allocation schemes at different levels are devised
    to assist water resource managers in allocating the water for water use sectors.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Water resource allocation process
    for different levels of water management sectors. 3.3.1. Crop water consumption
    model – CWC The basic principles of CWC are to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration
    using the Hargreaves equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) with minimal climatological
    data, or the Penman–Monteith equation with detailed climatological data; to calculate
    the empirical coefficient (Kc) with the data contributed by the FAO and to estimate
    the crop water consumption according to crop structure, crop area, Kc, and the
    water use coefficient. (3-3-1) where, Dij is the crop water consumption volume
    at the ith irrigation district on the jth day. Ak is the crop area for the kth
    crop. ηi represents an integrated irrigation water use efficiency at the ith region.
    The terms and Raij denote the extent of different crop water requirements at different
    times and a solar constant at different regions, respectively. The items Tcij
    and Tdij are daily average temperature and the difference between the daily maximal
    and minimal temperature values, respectively. 3.3.2. Irrigation water allocation
    model at the field level – FWA At present, the crop water demand of fields is
    evaluated according to farmers'' water rights area and the irrigation water quota
    and lacks an accurate spatial distribution of the crop structure. The channel
    outflow at the bottom-level was determined by the crop water demand and water
    use efficiency of the fields. The amount of water lost is mainly due to infiltration
    and evaporation of the channels, and the channel infiltration rate is different
    for each channel level; there is a distinction for the infiltration rate of channels
    at different levels. The different channel inflows are generated by means of the
    water consumption of the field, the water use efficiency of channels, and the
    channel length. Channel inflows, Wdi are defined as (3-3-2) where subscripts j
    and l are the number of fields and channels, respectively. Rj is the water rights
    area of the jth field, and Ll is the length of the lth channel. The items Qjc
    and Qld denote the irrigation water quota per Mu of the jth field and the outflow
    of the lth channel, respectively. The two water use efficiencies are represented
    by ηjf and ηld, which represent field and channel, respectively. In practice,
    it is efficient to control the water volume flowing into land with the opening
    and closing times of the channel inflows'' sluice gate, i.e., the irrigation time,
    which is determined by the irrigation cycle and crop water requirement. The irrigation
    time, Ti, is expressed in terms of (3-3-3) where Wdi is the inflow of the ith
    channel. The denominator denotes the flow of the ith channel. The irrigation water
    allocation scheme was developed according to the irrigated schedule and water
    supply (see Fig. 5). The water requirement of channel inflows is multiplied by
    the water supply rate to equally distribute the water for farmers if the water
    supply cannot satisfy the crop water requirement. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Flow chart for devising the irrigation water allocation plan at
    the field level. 3.3.3. Water allocation model at the irrigation district level
    – IWA The objective of the water allocation model at the irrigation district level
    is to fairly distribute the water for all irrigation districts that are under
    the jurisdiction of the same county according to the total available water and
    the water demand. The water demand of irrigation districts is mainly determined
    by crop water consumption in addition to domestic, ecological, industrial water
    use, and the water use of other sectors. The water demand proportion of irrigation
    districts Pij is defined as (3-3-4) where Dij is the water demand of the ith irrigation
    district at the jth period of time. Then, the water volume, , which is allocated
    for different irrigation districts, can be represented as (3-3-5) where the items
    Wsj, Wdj, Wej, WInj, and Woj denote the total available water, domestic water
    use, ecological water use, industrial water use, and water use of other sectors,
    respectively, at the jth period of time. 3.3.4. Water allocation model at the
    county level – CWA The water allocation scheme is devised by using the irrigation
    water demand of the county and the water rights ratio among different counties.
    When the total available water is greater than or equal to the total water demand,
    the water demand of different counties should be taken into account; otherwise,
    water should be allocated to counties using the water rights ratio. The irrigation
    water volume of the county, , is computed according to (3-3-6) (3-3-7) (3-3-8)
    (3-3-9) where δk is the water rights ratio of the county and ψk is the irrigation
    water allocation proportion of the county. The item denotes the irrigation water
    demand of the kth county at the jth period of time. is the total available water
    of the entire region. 3.4. System implementation HD is coded in visual C# based
    on the Microsoft .Net 2003 environment. All affairs and models are encapsulated
    in the middle layer of the HD framework with the classes. The interfaces between
    the layers and between models are designed to be simple and efficient according
    to the data flow in the HD. ODBC (Open DataBase Connection), which is a database
    API (Application Programming Interface) based on CLI (Call Level Interface), is
    applied to access the non-spatial data stored in the SQLServer database. During
    the system''s development, considerable effort was applied to the development
    of a user-friendly GUI according to the design principles. All GUI operations
    are designed to be as simple as possible while meeting the users'' requirements.
    The user''s vocabulary is taken into account to design the operation processes
    as well as their computer skills and language habits. The implementation details
    of any operation process will be not exposed to the users, and the system''s GUI
    can automatically be customized as needed when users login to HD. In addition,
    Nplot, a free charting library that is created in the .Net environment is integrated
    into HD to draw 2-dimensional charts for the model results. An opening code GIS
    component, MapWindow, is also applied to create a raster image with GDAL. The
    GIS component is capable of providing a visual view for geo-information and spatial
    analysis functions such as buffer analysis and length and area measurements. To
    enhance the flexibility of operation, the tasks are simplified, and complex processes
    are run by computer. Few inputs are provided to the users, and they can analyze
    the data from the HD database and the external data files. 4. Application of HD:
    the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin 4.1. Results of HD application To
    investigate the feasibility and performance of the HD for water resource management
    and irrigation management, the HD was tested to allocate water to different levels
    of water use units as a standard decision support tool based on the actual total
    available water from the rivers, reservoirs, and groundwater. More than 60 water
    decision makers used the system at over 40 locations along the middle reaches
    of the Heihe River Basin. The system interface is shown in Fig. 6. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 6. HD interface. Although HD is not designed to
    solve all water resource management problems, it is generally used as an operational
    tool in designing water allocation processes associated with estimating water
    demand and the water rights of different water use units. The system provides
    a crop water demand model to estimate the agricultural temporal–spatial distribution
    of the water demand, which is a central consideration for the lowest-level water
    managers when allocating water to fields. Accordingly, different levels of channel
    flow are determined based on field water demand information containing a channel''s
    hydraulic engineering data, e.g., the channel water use coefficient and the channel
    cross sectional area. When the water supply cannot meet the requirements of a
    region, the water rights are taken into account as another important equitable
    element to design the water allocation scheme. HD also enables a multi-level water
    allocation model for different levels of water management sectors to be developed,
    allowing water allocation equity to incorporate the relationship between water
    supply and demand and between multiple level sectors. HD also aids in the decision-making
    process related to water allocation scheme implementation and can facilitate a
    real-time response with the change of water supply and then form a new water allocation
    scheme according to the actual relationship between water supply and demand. The
    existing GIS environment is utilized to help decision makers or managers devise
    hydraulic engineering schemes (e.g., planning of a canal system, location of water-saving
    engineering) by means of accurate spatial information. In addition, the system
    provides a data-sharing and checking mechanism that facilitates the decision efficiency
    of water managers and decision makers at different levels. Before the system is
    validated, abundant data are submitted to the system by water managers at different
    levels based on the checking mechanism. These data comprise river runoff (from
    1945 to 2010) and crop structure including crop type, crop area and crop growing
    periods (in 2008). Moreover, channel inflow information is entered into HD as
    well as hydraulic engineering data. Meteorological data with a 5-km spatial resolution
    were generated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and were
    used to compute daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, and daily
    average temperature. In addition, the basic spatial data, which comprise distributions
    of, e.g., ditches, counties, rivers, reservoirs, and land use, are generated using
    topographic maps, CBERS (China–Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) data with a 19.5-m
    resolution, ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer)
    images with a 15-m resolution, and GPS measurements. Ditch data are classified
    into three categories according to the hydraulic engineering data: the main canal,
    branch canal, and Dou canal. 4.2. Crop water demand The crop water demand estimation
    produced by HD is first validated against all available data, and key factors
    impacting water demand within the irrigation district are analyzed. The annual
    irrigation water requirement is also computed using Equation (3-3-1) and a dataset
    that mainly includes crop structure and channel engineering parameters. In the
    case study, three counties were selected to validate the CWC, where there are
    17 irrigation districts. There are 15 types of cultivated crops in this region,
    including wheat, corn, corn seed, cotton, beet, and woodland. Fig. 7 shows that
    the total crop water requirement calculated by the CWC model at the seventeen
    irrigation districts in 2008 is 8.74 × 109 m3as a theoretical water demand value,
    but the annual water allocated to these irrigation districts was approximately
    10.06 × 109 m3. The result indicates that approximately 13% of the actual water
    allocated is not contained in the crop water demand in addition to the evaporation
    and seepage of the channel, field, and transpiration of the crop. The CWC model
    can aid in water management policy, e.g., improving the water transfer environment
    and enhancing the water-saving awareness of farmers to increase water use efficiency.
    Advice should be given to decision makers to put water-saving technologies such
    as channel lining, plastic-film-mulched fields, greenhouse cultivation, spray
    irrigation, and drip irrigation into practice to obtain improved economic benefits.

    requirement from the CWC model (see Equation 3-3-1) with the actual allocated
    water at 17 irrigation districts in 2008. 4.3. Water allocation scheme 4.3.1.
    Water allocation scheme at the county level – CWA The irrigation water allocation
    at the county level is determined by the agricultural water demand and water equity
    distribution principle, which is the foundation of water allocation for regions.
    The irrigation water allocation volumes of three counties in 2008 were generated.
    The results of the irrigation water allocation are shown in Table 1. The results
    indicate that the water consumption period of the three counties differs due to
    the diversity in crop structure. The water allocation volume to Ganzhou is the
    highest, accounting for 43.1% of the total water volume, because the maximum acreage
    under cultivation is 60.96 kha. Linze follows, and Gaotai has the lowest volume.
    The main reason more water is distributed to Linze is that crops with high water
    consumption are cultivated there. Table 1. Comparison between the actual irrigation
    water allocation and the result from the CWA model of three counties in 2008 in

    at the irrigation district level – IWA Part of the aim is to carefully allocate
    the irrigation water generated by the CWA model to irrigation districts. The agricultural
    water requirement of each irrigation district is computed according to the different
    water requirements of the crops by applying the IWA model within HD. The IWA model
    also yields the values of irrigated water using the results of Section 4.3.1.
    The results of the IWA model are provided in Table 2. The water allocation volume
    of each irrigation district maintains positive correlativity with the crop-planting
    area at Ganzhou because the main economic crop in the region, corn as seed, is
    widely grown, resulting in water being equitably allocated spatially. However,
    there is a large difference in agricultural water use between irrigation districts
    at Gaotai due to high-economic-value and high-water-consumption crops being disproportionately
    concentrated in the regions with good water conditions (e.g., groundwater) and
    excellent hydraulic engineering establishments. Table 2. The irrigation water

    water allocation scheme at the field level – FWA In the Zhangye municipality of
    the Heihe River Basin, the rural community is the smallest irrigated unit and
    can be managed by water management authorities. There are approximately 1000 rural
    communities in an irrigation district. One irrigation district, Hongshuihe, is
    selected as an example. Here, an irrigation water allocation scheme at the field
    level is devised to validate the FWA model by means of irrigation quota, water
    rights area, and hydraulic engineering parameters, including the water use efficiency
    of different levels of channels and their length. In this scenario, the water
    supply rate is set to 80% and the water volumes in 13 irrigated areas are allocated,
    as displayed in Table 3 at the first irrigation period in the summer of 2008.
    The results of the FWA model indicate that the water flow process through multi-level
    channels can be simulated because it can generate the multi-level channel inflow.
    These channels include the Dou, Branch, and Main channels. The present model also
    yields the water loss in the water flow in the channels. When the irrigation water
    allocation scheme is implemented, the flow velocity of the channel inflows is
    measured using a flow velocity meter. Then, the irrigated time period can be computed
    according to the flow velocity and the inflow of channels. Table 3. Irrigation

    A DSS was developed to help water resource management decision makers address
    water resources management problems. The DSS was demonstrated along the middle
    reaches of the Heihe River Basin, where poor water resource management methods
    are used. The DSS emphasizes the impacts of human activities on water resource
    management, which includes crop structure, hydraulic engineering and multi-level
    water authorities. Accordingly, the DSS is effective for water allocation in agricultural
    regions. DSS is also an integrated environment to share and manage data and to
    facilitate cooperation among different levels of users. The models utilized in
    the system are selected or developed according to practical water resource management
    problems and model selecting principles. The practical water problems are investigated
    through close communication among decision makers, scientists, and system developers
    through meetings, workshops, and seminars. These models focus on calculating quantifiably
    key parameters, e.g., crop water consumption, agricultural water demand, and water
    use efficiency, for decision processes. These parameters can aid decision makers
    in making effective decisions. The spatial distribution of agricultural water
    demand is one of the main elements used by decision makers to allocate water to
    different regions. Based on these key parameters, a water resource management
    model is employed to develop an irrigation water allocation scheme for different
    levels of users. The CWA, IWA, and FWA models contributed to three levels of users
    corresponding to county, irrigation district, and field, respectively. Object-oriented
    technology is applied to encapsulate all models, and a number of interfaces are
    defined for communication between models. In addition, a user-friendly GUI is
    provided that fully takes into account the users'' computer skills and language
    habits. Many complete documentations of HD are made, which comprise user''s manuals
    of HD and model descriptions as well as technical reports and training materials.
    Although the paper focuses on the development and implementation of HD, an application
    case was also briefly introduced. HD was validated in the Zhangye municipality
    of the Heihe River Basin at the three levels, namely, county, irrigation district,
    and field, in 2008. The daily crop water requirement was simulated to provide
    irrigation water allocation schemes for different levels of water managers according
    to the crop structure, the water use efficiency of channels, and the irrigated
    quota of crops supplied by local water management authorities. The results indicate
    that HD is a feasible tool for assisting water managers or decision makers at
    different levels to develop irrigation water allocation schemes. HD based on the
    equitable water allocation principle may help avoid certain water allocation problems
    brought about by man-made factors, and can be adapted to resolve irrigation water
    allocation problems in agricultural areas. In addition, empirical models were
    applied in the system to pursue the capability of solving actual water resource
    management problems that arise due to a lack of observation information. These
    models were applied because they are simple and easy to use and require few parameters.
    With the improvement of regional hydrological observation systems used in water
    resource management, physical models will be added to HD in the future. The AquaCrop
    model will be integrated into HD to calculate the crop yield, and SEBAL (Surface
    Energy Balance Algorithm for Land) will be combined with remote sensing data in
    the next phase to obtain more accurate crop evapotranspiration values. There are
    several important factors, including flood protection, water quality monitoring,
    and forestry, that are involved in decision-making regarding water resource problems.
    Thus, successful decision-making depends on knowing how to build a collaborative
    mechanism among different departments. A web-based multi-sectoral consultative
    environment can play an important role in decision-making regarding water resource
    management and will be a focus of the Decision Support System of water resource
    management in the future. Acknowledgments This paper was supported by the CAS

    highlight the benefits from the integration of wireless sensor network / meteorological
    data and remote sensing for monitoring and determine irrigation demand in Cyprus.
    Estimating evapotranspiration in Cyprus will help, in taking measures for an effective
    irrigation water management in the future in the island. For this purpose both
    multi-spectral satellite images (Landsat 7 ETM+ and ASTER) and hydro-meteorological
    data from wireless sensors and automatic meteorological stations have been used.
    The wireless sensor network, which consist approximately twenty wireless nodes,
    was placed in our case study. The wireless sensor network acts as a wide area
    distributed data collection system deployed to collect and reliably transmit soil
    and air environmental data to a remote base-station hosted at Cyprus University
    of Technology. Furthermore auxiliary meteorological field data, from an automatic
    meteorological station, nearby our case study, where used such as solar radiation,
    air temperature, air humidity and wind speed. These data were used in conjunction
    with remote sensing results. Satellite images where used in ERDAS Imagine Software
    after the necessary processing: geometric rectification, radiometric calibration
    and atmospheric corrections. The satellite images were atmospheric corrected and
    calibrated using spectro-radiometers and sun-photometers measurements taken in
    situ, in an agricultural area, south-west of the island of Cyprus. Evapotranspiration
    is difficult to determine since it combines various meteorological and field parameters
    while in literature quite many different models for estimating ET are indicated.
    For estimating evapotranspiration from satellite images and the hydro-meteorological
    data different methods have been evaluated such as FAO Penman-Monteith, Carlson-Buffum
    and Granger methods. These results have been compared with E-pan methods. Finally
    a water management irrigation schedule has been applied. The final results are
    presented and compared with some conclusion remarks. © (2009) COPYRIGHT Society

  description: CIMIS, California Irrigation Management Information System, is a program
    that collects weather data around the state to assist irrigators in planning and
    scheduling their irrigations. It also consists of a computer program that gives
    irrigation scheduling utilizing historic weather data averages. The program was
    not developed to be a real time irrigation scheduling program but was easily modified
    to include this capability. The main improvement reported on this paper is adding
    specific scheduling capabilities for center pivots.

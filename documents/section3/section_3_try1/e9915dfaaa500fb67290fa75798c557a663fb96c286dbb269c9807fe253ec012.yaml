    IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Water is a basic
    necessity for all the life forms on Earth [1], [2]. It is well known that water
    is the main reason behind Earth being the only living planet. It is impossible
    for any living being to live without water [3], [4]. Without water, a plant cannot
    perform its essential photosynthesis. It is understandable that if the problem
    of water scarcity continues to increase, it will remove the greenery in the future.
    As a result of which, there will be less rainfall. Water is also essential for
    agricultural production and food security [5]–[7]. Technology has always served
    to overcome such problems and to make lives easy with its innovations. Here through
    this study one such solution is introduced, named ‘lOT based Soil Management System,’
    a model for controlling irrigation that uses IoTto sense soil moisture with temperature
    and humidity of the surroundings with a microcontroller to make an intelligent
    irrigation system to help millions of farmers and University gardeners [8], [9].
    Soil moisture is critical to plant growth, and maintaining the right amount of
    moisture can help plants grow faster and produce better yields. An efficient soil
    moisture management system can help conserve water by reducing the water needed
    for irrigation [10], [11]. A soil moisture management system can help reduce water
    usage and lead to cost savings of water bills and other expenses. By managing
    soil moisture levels, it helps to maintain soil health and reduce erosion, which
    is essential for sustainable agriculture [12]–[14]. Farmers and growers can proactively
    avoid drought conditions and other weather-related risks that can harm crops by
    monitoring soil moisture levels [15]–[17]. To evaluate the link between soil moisture
    readings acquired from soil moisture sensors and the gravimetric approach, a study
    was conducted at the Water Technology Centre farm (WTC) at Hyderabad based college
    [18]. In 2021, Fengfei et al.''s Portable PHS Method for Moisture in the Soil
    Monitoring Based on Thermal Effect is implemented. The results were compared to
    those obtained using the drying procedure, confirming the practicality of the
    suggested method [19]. In 2019, G. S. Swileam et al. assessed soil heterogeneity
    utilising electrical resistance for typical alluvial soils in Egypt [20]. In 2018
    smith et aI., proposed a system for efficiently maintaining optimal soil moisture
    levels for crops using various traditional soil management systems [21]. Gupta
    et al. (2020) analyze whether rooftop harvesting of rainwater and outline bunding
    enhances the moisture in the soil. Their effects on yields of crops, availability
    of water, and soil moisture management are examined [22]. Contour plowing, terracing,
    and checking dams in arid environments are the main focus of this study by Patel
    et al. It assesses their ability to reduce soil moisture evaporation and increase
    water retention [23]. To measure the soil moisture content, humidity, and temperature
    using Raspberry Pi Pico and other sensors to minimize the over-watering and under-watering
    of plants. This paper deals with multiple sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico
    to measure the current readings of the soil & surrounding of the University plants,
    analyze them, display the measurements on the webpage, and automatically water
    the plants when required by connecting them to a water pump. IoT-based soil management
    systems can collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather conditions,
    and other relevant factors. This enables farmers and growers of the university
    to make data-driven decisions and respond quickly to changes in soil moisture
    levels. Farmers and growers can remotely monitor soil moisture levels and other
    factors with this system. This can save time and reduce the need for manual labor
    in the field. The curated system can automate the irrigation process based on
    soil moisture levels and other data. Intelligent systems can help reduce water
    waste and improve crop yields. IoT -based soil management systems can be easily
    scaled to accommodate more significant areas of farmland or garden spaces in universities.
    These innovative systems are also suitable for large-scale agricultural operations
    and smaller-scale applications. SECTION II. Proposed Work This IoT -based system
    deals with multiple sensors/modules and Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the current
    readings of the soil & surroundings, analyze them, display the measurements on
    the website, and automatically water the plants when required by connecting to
    a water pump. The system uses micro python to interface the sensors and modules
    with the microcontroller Raspberry Pi Pico. This project deals with the automatic
    watering of plants whenever the moisture, humidity, and temperature level decreases
    to a specific standard limit. The working of proposed model consists of a soil
    moisture sensor and a temperature humidity sensor, which tracks the soil moisture
    along with the humidity and temperature of the surroundings. When the measurements
    exceed the required standard readings, the relay directs the motor to pump water
    to plants. This model will benefit people with large patches of gardens, Universities,
    or those farther from their places. The proposed system has advantages in reducing
    costs, restricting water waste, and minimizing physical interference. It also
    promotes irrigation that requires little maintenance and is environmentally friendly.
    In order to regulate the water flow, a relay module has been installed. The model
    shows expected impacts at various levels of humidity and temperature. Figure 1
    shows the proposed model of our IoT -based system. Fig. 1: Proposed IoT-based
    system for Soil Moisture management system Show All SECTION III. Methedologies
    Used The Soil Moisture Sensor yields real-time data in the form of an analog.
    Analog to Digital (A/D) and data conditions are converted using Raspberry Pi Pico
    Microcontroller. The Microcontroller is used to acquire real-time soil moisture
    using a soil moisture sensor. The Thonny Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
    is a cross-platform application that supports high-level programming languages
    like Python. The IDE makes writing code and uploading the source program to the
    board easy. It contains libraries and cores. The samples are measured from low
    to High moisture contents of the soil. The gardener can get the processed data
    through the webpage with the help of Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Technology. This
    system can give real-time data on soil moisture. The Soil moisture system is connected
    to the web page. We have interfaced the soil moisture sensor, DHTII Module, and
    relay with a Raspberry Pi Pico to measure the volumetric concentration of water
    inside the soil and the humidity and temperature of the surroundings. This system
    uses Raspberry Pi Pico as a microcontroller, which is then connected to the Moisture
    Sensor, which measures the soil''s moisture content. Raspberry Pi Pico acts as
    the central brain of the IoT-based soil moisture management system, responsible
    for data collection, processing, analysis, communication, and automated control.
    It is also linked to DHT -11, the Temperature and Humidity sensor, which measures
    the ambient temperature and humidity. The Pico is also connected to the Wi-Fi
    module ESP-Ol, bridging the divide between the hardware and software components
    of the system shown in fig. 2. The measurements of the above sensors and modules
    and the standard measurements will subsequently be displayed for users on our
    self-designed website using the ESP-Ol. Fig. 2. Schematic Layout of our Proposed
    System Show All SECTION IV. Experimentation & Model Evaluation The proposed intelligent
    system captures data in real-time using a range of sensors and modules shown in
    fig. 5. University gardeners use these sensors to assess soil and environmental
    conditions. The soil management system we built is responsible for several duties.
    It begins by measuring the soil moisture content using a capacitive soil moisture
    sensor and then monitors the humidity and temperature of the surrounding environment
    with a DHTII Module. All plants have a threshold value set to standard soil moisture
    content for home/university gardeners. When the moisture level falls below the
    set standard/threshold level, the relay module turns the Motor On and begins pumping
    water to the plants from the tank until the moisture level returns to the desired
    level. The measurements mentioned above’ readings will be shown on a website built
    with the ESP-OI, which we designed with HTML and CSS and coded in Python. Fig.
    3 shows the hardware connection of sensors/modules to Raspberry Pico and figure
    4 depicts the Circuit diagram of the connection of all the sensors, modules, and
    motors. Fig. 3. Hardware connection of sensors/modules to Pico Show All Fig. 4.

    our proposed System Show All SECTION V. Result Analysis & Validation The analysis
    of the results demonstrates the efficacy of IoT-based watering systems in sustaining
    optimal soil moisture levels for plant growth in the university. These systems
    provide optimal irrigation, water conservation, improved plant health and growth,
    resource efficiency, data-driven insights, remote monitoring and control, and
    flexibility. Using IoT technology, plant owners, farmers, and gardeners can achieve
    precise and effective watering techniques, resulting in healthier and more robust
    plants. The moisture reading experiments conducted at our University on different
    plants and shrubs can provide valuable insights into plant water requirements
    and watering patterns shown in fig. 6. Fig. 6. Soil moisture reading experimentation
    done at our University''s Plants & Shrubs Show All The collected data on moisture
    readings from the different plants and shrubs helps in understanding their specific
    water requirements and watering patterns. This IoT-based system enables informed
    decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling, optimization of water management
    practices, and adjustment of watering parameters based on the specific needs of
    each plant species. The model then starts measuring and taking the readings displayed
    on the Thonny Shell shown in fig. 7. Table I shows the soil moisture readings
    from the capacitive soil moisture sensor & level of accuracy of the sensor when
    compared to the recommended moisture level. Fig. 8 depicts the soil moisture level
    and the recommended moisture needed for the plants. The relationship between soil
    moisture levels and the recommended moisture level for plants is graphically represented
    in Figure 8. Individuals can make informed decisions to promote healthy plant
    growth, conserve water, and preserve natural and agricultural ecosystems by comprehending
    this relationship. Gardeners can decide when and how much to water their plants
    by monitoring soil moisture and using the specified range. Avoiding under watering
    and overwatering optimizes plant growth and conserves water. Water management
    influences the ecological balance and is essential for plant and animal survival.

    Accurate description of surface soil moisture (SSM) in vegetation-covered areas
    is of great significance to water resource management and drought monitoring.
    To remove the effect of vegetation on SSM estimation, the vegetation index obtained
    from Sentinel-2 (S2) was applied for vegetation water content (VWC) estimation.
    The VWC model was substituted into the water cloud model (WCM), and thus, the
    SSM estimation model was developed based on the WCM. The methodology was tested
    at Daxing, Beijing, and Gu’an, Hebei, in which training and validation data of

    (1) For the vegetation-covered areas, the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio

    was 0.023 cm3/cm3. Thus, this methodology has the potential for SSM estimation
    in vegetated areas. Keywords: Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; surface soil moisture; water
    cloud model; red-edge band; vegetation water content 1. Introduction Surface soil
    moisture (SSM) is a vital parameter in many fields such as agriculture [1], meteorology
    [2], and hydrology [3]. It is widely used in drought monitoring, weather forecasting,
    and hydrology forecasting [4,5,6]. SSM, which is the content of water contained
    in 0–5 cm of the soil layer [7], is a vital index for crop yield estimation, pest
    and disease control, irrigation management, and land improvement in agricultural
    planting areas [8]. It is of great significance to obtain this parameter accurately
    for sustainable agricultural development [9]. SSM is also an important part of
    soil water content, which is the initial condition for the transportation of soil
    moisture and heat, leading to a great effect on the accuracy of soil moisture
    content simulation in the root zone. Traditional SSM monitoring methods, such
    as the weighing method and the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method [10,11],
    have accurate monitoring data, but they consume a lot of human capital, material
    resources, and financial resources. A more serious problem is its inability to
    meet regional monitoring objectives [12]. With the progress of remote sensing
    science and technology, regional SSM monitoring has become possible, and the accuracy
    of estimation is constantly being improved. It has become one of the indispensable
    means of regional soil moisture monitoring [13,14,15,16,17]. Remote sensing methods
    include two categories, namely optical and microwave remote sensing. Optical remote
    sensing is susceptible to cloud, fog, rain, and ground vegetation, which often
    leads to poor data quality and low availability, especially in southern China.
    Thus, optical remote sensing methods are generally applicable only for SSM estimation
    in bare or free vegetation-covered areas and under good weather conditions. In
    contrast, microwave remote sensing at longer wavelengths has a stronger penetrating
    ability that is not affected by meteorological conditions. It can be used to monitor
    various surface parameters, including SSM, over vegetated areas [18] and has certain
    advantages in SSM estimation [19]. Sentinel-1 (S1), which can provide near-real-time
    synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, is widely used in agricultural monitoring.
    Based on S1 SAR images, Paloscia et al. [20] developed an SSM mapping algorithm
    based on the artificial neural network (ANN) method. The results showed that the
    validation results were very much in line with the Global Monitoring for Environment
    and Security (GMES) requirements, which indicated a good correlation between estimated
    and in situ measured SSM values. Li et al. [21] presented an improved convolutional
    neural network (ICNN) method through combined multipolarized SAR and original
    multispectral images, which achieved regional SSM information with an average
    root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0145 cm3/cm3. Most of the developed methods
    can achieve desirable results in bare or sparse vegetation-covered areas, but
    the precision is not ideal for SSM estimation in vegetated areas. The water cloud
    model (WCM) is a commonly used semi-empirical model for SSM retrieval in vegetated
    areas [22]. Based on the WCM, previous studies [23,24] estimated SSM from C- and
    X-band SAR with an accuracy better than 8 vol%. Rawat et al. [25] used S1 and
    Landsat-8 images to retrieve SSM over vegetated areas based on the modified water
    cloud model (MWCM). The results showed a good correlation between estimated and
    in situ measured SSM. In the WCM, the backscattering coefficient includes soil
    contribution and direct vegetation contribution. The vegetation backscattering
    coefficient is calculated by one or more vegetation descriptors. The vegetation
    water content (VWC) is one of the most vital parameters in the WCM. To remove
    the effect of vegetation on SSM estimation, it is necessary to obtain the VWC.
    Numerous studies [26,27,28] have indicated the application of the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), as the vegetation descriptor allows for the calculation
    of the vegetation backscattering coefficient on the total backscattering coefficient
    with good accuracy. In addition, some studies [29,30,31] have demonstrated that
    the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) can be used for VWC estimation instead
    of measuring by manual work. However, the NDVI is limited to a certain range of
    vegetation coverage, and the NDWI has a poor ability to remove the effect of background
    soil reflectance, although the NDVI and NDWI can reduce the effect of vegetation
    coverage. The Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (CARI) measures the depth of
    chlorophyll absorption at 670 nm relative to the green reflectance peak at 550
    nm and the reflectance at 700 nm to describe the chlorophyll content of vegetation.
    Daughtry et al. [32] developed the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index
    (MCARI) based on the CARI, mainly by increasing the R700/R670 ratio, in an attempt
    to minimize the influence of soil reflectance and canopy nonphotosynthetic substances.
    Chlorophyll is a plant biochemical parameter that is closely related to nitrogen,
    cellulose, water, and other vegetation biochemical parameters [33]. At present,
    there are few reports on VWC estimation using this index, and its potential for
    soil moisture estimation needs to be further explored. Therefore, we attempted
    to use the MCARI to describe the VWC and remove the effect of vegetation on SSM
    estimation in order to make positive contributions to agricultural water resource
    management and drought monitoring. Based on S1 SAR and S2 MSI data, this study
    took farmland in Daxing, Beijing, and Gu’an, Hebei, China, as the study area.
    Aiming at the problem that the sensitivity of radar signals in farmland vegetation
    coverage decreases in SSM estimation, a planting cover index was introduced, namely
    the MCARI. In this paper, a semi-empirical model of SSM estimation in a vegetation-covered
    area based on microwave and optical RS data was developed, and soil moisture inversion
    experiments under six inversion modes formed by the combination of the vegetation
    indices (NDVI, NDWI, and MCARI) and the polarization modes (VV and VH) were carried
    out to analyze the robustness of the proposed model, which provides a research
    idea for the cooperative inversion of SSM in vegetation-covered areas. The method
    was tested in semi-arid farmland crop cover areas in Daxing, Beijing, and Gu’an,
    Hebei, China. 2. Data and Methodology 2.1. Study Area The Haihe basin is located
    in North China (35° N–3° N, 112° E–120° E), with an area of 318,000 km2 [34].
    It meets the needs of around 10% of China’s population and contributes about 8%
    of cultivated land in China. Corn and wheat are widely cultivated in the basin.
    The agricultural production of corn and wheat accounts for 36% and 27% of the
    total panting area [35], respectively. The study area is located in the middle
    of the Haihe basin and covers an area of 1728 km2 (Figure 1). It has a sub-humid
    monsoon climate with an elevation of 14–52 m. The annual average temperature is
    11.6 °C, and the annual average precipitation is 556 mm. The rainfall in July,
    August, and September accounts for 60–70% of the annual total precipitation. The
    soil types in the study area are mostly loam and sandy loam, and the main crops
    are winter wheat and summer corn. The growth period of winter wheat is from March
    to May, and summer corn is grown from July to September. Figure 1. Satellite data

    (S1) is a vital component of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security
    (GMES) proposed by the European Space Agency (ESA). It includes two satellites,
    namely Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, which were successfully launched on 3 April,
    2014, and 25 April, 2016, respectively. The time resolution of a single satellite
    is 12 days, which decreases to 6 days after two satellites are networked. S1 is
    equipped with a C-band SAR sensor and has two kinds of VV and VH polarization,
    with a working frequency of 5.4 GHz. There are four data acquisition modes (Table
    1). The S1 images used in our research are Level 1 products with a single-look
    complex (SLC) format from an IW mode. Two S1 images were obtained on 28 April
    2019 and 29 April 2021 from the ESA (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) to test the
    developed SSM estimation method (Table 2). The obtained S1 SAR images needed to
    be preprocessed before being analyzed. The SARscape 5.2.3 software was applied
    to conduct the radiometric calibration and geocoding to obtain the backscattering
    coefficient. The backscatter radiation was calculated from previously calibrated
    S1 images and converted to decibels (dB) by the transformation relation [13]:
    σ 0 d B = 10 log 10 σ 0 (1) Table 1. Characteristics of the various imaging modes
    of S1 image. Table 2. S1 images used in this research. 2.2.2. Sentinel-2 Sentinel-2
    (S2) contains two satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B), both carrying a multispectral
    imager (MSI) with a bandwidth of 290 km. The S-2A satellite carries an innovative
    wide-swath high-resolution multispectral imager with 13 spectral bands. These
    working bands have three different geometric resolutions ranging from 10 to 60
    m, specifically, high-resolution visible images (red, green, blue, and near-infrared
    bands), with a 10 m ground sample distance (GSD), and red-edge, narrow near-infrared,
    and shortwave infrared bands with a 20 m GSD. With the launch of Satellite S-2B,
    the two sensors in orbit have significantly shortened the revisit time, resulting
    in a 5-day interval for S2 images. Its superiority in spatiotemporal resolution
    provides adequate and high-quality data in areas, facilitating the broad application
    of satellite images. S2 images are provided freely for users through the United
    States Geological Survey (USGS) (https://glovis.usgs.gov/). Optical RS images
    of the study site were obtained from Sentinel-2A on dates 25 April 2019 and 27
    April 2021, which are close to those of the S1 images acquired (28 April 2019
    and 29 April 2021). In theory, it is possible to obtain one S1 image and one S2
    image with a difference in time of less than one week because, in agricultural
    areas, the vegetation does not change much within one week [36]. The obtained
    S2 images need to be processed before being analyzed. S2 Level 1C images (S2 L1C)
    were selected, to which geometric correction and radiometric correction were made.
    The Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) was used to treat it as an L2A product.
    Based on the S2 images, image registration was performed on S1 and S2 data after
    pretreatment. 2.2.3. In Situ Measurements In this research, in situ experiments
    were designed on 28 April 2019 and 29 April 2021. The soil volumetric moisture
    at a 0–5 cm depth was obtained by handheld TDR. A total of 172 experimental points
    (91 points were used for model building, and 81 points were used for validation)
    were set up on both dates, with a reasonable spatial distribution. A detailed
    distribution of the experimental points is displayed in Figure 2a. The soil volumetric
    moisture content on every experimental point was obtained from the average of
    three measuring points, which were arranged within a radius of 3 m from the experimental
    point. A portable global positioning system (GPS) receiver was used for positioning
    measurement. Figure 3 shows the statistics of the 172 in situ measured SSM values.
    As shown in Figure 3a, the in situ measured SSM values range between 0.05 and
    0.32 cm3/cm3. The mean, maximum, and minimum values of the in situ measured SSM
    were 0.169, 0.32, and 0.05 cm3/cm3, respectively. The measurements collected for
    wheat, corn, vegetables, soybean, and sweet potato were 82, 50, 24, 10, and 6,
    respectively. Figure 2. Basic information of in situ measurements: (a) distribution
    of experimental plots in the study area; (b) photograph of the scene. Figure 3.

    of our research is illustrated in Figure 4. First, the downloaded S1 images were
    preprocessed, and the backscattering coefficient images in the study area were
    obtained. Second, the backscattering coefficients of each sample were extracted
    according to the latitude and longitude. Third, the downloaded S2 images were
    preprocessed, and the spectral index images covering the study areas were obtained.
    Moreover, the vegetation indices of each sample were extracted according to the
    latitude and longitude coordinates. In order to eliminate the influence of vegetation
    on SSM inversion, the VWC estimation model was established by using the S2 spectral
    index. This model was substituted into the original WCM, and an improved WCM with
    the spectral index was established. Finally, the SSM estimation model was developed
    based on the improved WCM. Figure 4. Workflow of this research. 2.3.1. Water Cloud
    Model To distinguish the backscattering of soil and vegetation in the vegetated
    areas, the WCM developed by Attema and Ulaby [22] was adopted in our research.
    The WCM is based on the radiative transfer model, assuming that the vegetation
    canopy is a uniform horizontal cloud layer, ignoring multiple scattering between
    the vegetation and the surface. In the WCM, the scattering of the vegetated areas
    can be divided into two parts: one is the backscattering reflected directly by
    the vegetation, and the other is the scattering from the soil [17]. The model
    is simple and practical in describing radar scattering mechanisms in vegetated
    areas. Thus, this model has often been used for relevant information estimation
    in vegetated areas. The WCM is expressed as: σ 0 = σ v e g 0 + T 2 σ s o i l 0
    (2) σ v e g 0 = A M v cos θ 1 − T 2 (3) T 2 = exp − 2 B M v sec θ (4) In addition,
    the term exp − 2 B M v sec θ was described with the Taylor formula: exp − 2 B
    M v sec θ = 1 − 2 B M v sec θ + 2 B 2 M v 2 sec 2 θ + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ (5) where σ 0 is the
    total backscattering coefficient, dB; σ veg 0 is the vegetation backscattering
    coefficient, dB; σ soil 0 is the soil backscattering coefficient, dB; Mv is the
    VWC, kg/m2; T2 is the double attenuation factor; θ is the incident angle, o; A
    is the vegetation reflectance; and B is the attenuation factor. 2.3.2. Vegetation
    Water Content Estimation The VWC is the most vital parameter in the WCM. To remove
    the effect of vegetation on SSM estimation, the VWC needs to be calculated. Published
    studies [26,36,37] have indicated the spectral indices calculated from remote
    sensing images can be used for VWC estimation. The spectral indices commonly include
    NDVI, NDWI, and MCARI. The calculation formulas are as follows: NDVI = R n i r
    − R r e d R n i r + R r e d = R b 8 − R b 4 R b 8 + R b 4 (6) NDWI = R n i r −
    R s w i r R n i r + R s w i r = R b 8 − R b 11 R b 8 + R b 11 (7) MCARI = R v
    e g − r e d − R r e d − 0.2 R v e g − r e d − R g r e e n × R v e g − r e d R
    r e d = R b 5 − R b 4 − 0.2 R b 5 − R b 3 × R b 5 R b 4 (8) where Rnir is the
    reflectance of the near-infrared band, Rred is the reflectance of the red band,
    Rblue is the reflectance of the blue band, Rswir is the reflectance of the shortwave
    infrared band, and Rbx is the reflectance of the x-band of the S2 satellite. It
    was demonstrated that the relationship between the VWC and vegetation indices
    is linear, one-variable quadratic, or exponential [38,39]. Considering that the
    study area is flat and the influence of soil roughness is not taken into account,
    the land cover is mainly farmland, which is similar to the research conditions
    carried out by Bao et al. [40] in Spain and the UK. Therefore, the VWC can be
    expressed as follows: M v = a ⋅ VI 2 + b ⋅ VI + c (9) 2.3.3. Algorithm of SSM
    Estimation The backscattering coefficient is sensitive to the surface dielectric
    constant and is closely related to SSM. A previous study [41] has shown there
    is a good linear correlation between the soil backscattering coefficient ( σ s
    o i l 0 ) and SSM. Thus, the σ s o i l 0 can be expressed as follows: σ s o i
    l 0 = d ⋅ SSM + e (10) where, d and e are the parameters of the soil. To build
    the SSM estimation model, Equations (9) and (10) were substituted into the WCM.
    Finally, the SSM estimation model was established: SSM = l 1 + l 2 σ 0 + l 3 VI
    + l 4 VI 2 + l 5 VI 3 + l 6 VI 4 + l 7 σ 0 sec θ + l 8 σ 0 VI sec θ + l 9 σ 0
    VI 2 sec θ (11) where SSM is the surface soil moisture, cm3/cm3; σ 0 is the VV
    or VH backscattering coefficients, dB; VI is the vegetation index calculated from
    S2 images; θ is the S1 incident angle (o); and l1–l9 could be obtained by the
    method of the best-fitting regression. 2.3.4. Statistical Metrics To fully evaluate
    the performance of the estimated SSM, three metrics were used, including the determination
    coefficients (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean square error
    (RMSE). The R2 indicates the fit degree of the model, and the larger the R2, the
    better the fitting effect, and the stronger the robustness of the model. The RMSE
    indicates the prediction accuracy of the model, and the smaller the RMSE, the
    higher the prediction accuracy of the model. The MAE is the average of the absolute
    value of the deviation between all individual measured values and estimated values.
    Compared with the mean error, the MAE will not be offset by positive and negative
    because the deviation is absolute. Therefore, the MAE can better reflect the actual
    situation of the predicted error, and the smaller the MAE, the better fitting
    effect of the model. The statistical metrics are calculated as follows: R 2 =
    ∑ i = 1 n S i − S ¯ 2 ∑ i = 1 n M i − S ¯ 2 (12) MAE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n S i − M i
    (13) RMSE = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n S i − M i 2 (14) where n is the number of validation
    values during the day, and Mi and Si are the in situ measured and estimated SSM,
    respectively. 3. Results 3.1. SSM Estimation from Sentinel-1 Images The established
    semi-empirical model was used to estimate the SSM values from the S1 SAR images
    combining the S2 vegetation indices. A simulated data set was established based
    on the WCM, and SSM was estimated by six modes of different polarization (VV and
    VH) and different vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, and MCARI). Figure 5 shows SSM
    mopping in a sample area. Nonagricultural land, such as buildings and roads, has
    a good removal effect (Figure 5). The variation trend of SSM obtained by the six
    modes was consistent in the same space. Figure 5d shows the highest SSM values,
    while Figure 5c shows the lowest. For the same vegetation index, the SSM values
    obtained by VH polarization were generally higher than those of VV polarization.
    Under the same polarization mode, the trend of SSM values obtained by the different
    vegetation indices is basically the same, which can be clearly seen in the circled
    part in Figure 5. Under VH polarization, the SSM values obtained by the different
    indices showed NDVI > NDWI > MCARI. However, under VV polarization, the SSM values
    obtained by the different indices showed little difference. Figure 5. SSM mapping
    in a sample in Gu’an, Hebei. Table 3 shows the estimation equation and accuracy
    of the model under the different polarization modes (VV and VH) and different
    indices (NDVI, NDWI, and MCARI). The number of training sets of the model is 91,
    and the fitting equations in the table are obtained by the least-squares method.
    As shown in Table 3, compared with the performances of S1 VV and VH polarization
    on SSM estimation, VV polarization obtained higher accuracy, and the accuracies
    obtained by NDVI, NDWI, and MCARI were 0.565, 0.576, and 0.588, respectively.
    Compared with S1 VV polarization, the accuracy of VH polarization was 0.2 lower.
    The accuracies of NDVI, NDWI, and MCARI were 0.336, 0.329, and 0.385, respectively.
    According to the fitting effect, it is preliminarily judged that the combination
    of the VV polarization mode and MCARI is most consistent with the real situation.
    Table 3. Estimation equations and accuracy of SSM under different polarization
    and vegetation indices. 3.2. Validation of SSM Estimation Model To evaluate the
    robustness of the SSM estimation model, 81 in situ measurement points were selected
    to verify the model. The agreement between the estimated SSM values and in situ
    measured SSM values was evaluated on the basis of statistical metrics, i.e., R2,
    MAE, and RMSE. The estimated values of the six models were compared with in situ
    measured SSM, and the R2, MAE, and RMSE were calculated (Figure 6). In VH polarization,
    the predicted SSM values were higher than the in situ measured results, and the
    scattered points were separated from the attachment of the 1:1 line. The predicted
    results of VV polarization were close to the in situ measured SSM values, and
    most of the scattered points were located near the 1:1 line. Figure 6. SSM validation
    under six models. By comparing the R2, MAE, and RMSE of the six SSM estimation
    models with the measured values, it can be seen that the combined effect of VV
    polarization and MCARI is the best. As seen in Figure 6c, the best performance
    is the combination of VV polarization and MCARI, with RMSE, MAE, and R2 of 0.028
    cm3/cm3, 0.023 cm3/cm3, and 0.867, respectively. Compared to the republished research
    [42] using single RS data, the method of combining the S1 and S2 images acquired
    higher accuracy. In summary, we chose MCARI and VV polarization to estimate SSM
    in our study. 3.3. Application of the SSM Estimation Model The model was used
    to estimate regional SSM from the S1 SAR and S2 MSI images in the vegetation-covered
    area under clear-sky conditions. Figure 7a,b shows the SSM (20 m × 20 m) maps
    in Daxing on 28 April 2019 and 29 April 2021, respectively. The spatial distribution
    of the estimated SSM has large variability with a range of 0–0.49 cm3/cm3, mainly
    distributed between 0.12 and 0.28 cm3/cm3 (Figure 7a). There were no significant
    drought events or other extreme weather events. As seen in Figure 7b, the fields
    are slightly wetter than in Figure 7a. The estimated SSM is below 0.44 cm3/cm3,
    and the eastern part is wet. This can provide valuable reference information for
    various types of applications, especially for water resource management. Figure
    7. SSM mapping on two different dates: 28 April 2019 (a), and 29 April 2021 (b),
    in Daxing, Beijing, China. Figure 8a,b shows the SSM maps in Gu’an on 28 April
    2019 and 29 April 2021, respectively. As seen in Figure 8a, SSM is distributed
    from 0.09 to 0.46 cm3/cm3, the western part of Gu’an is relatively dry, while
    the southern part is relatively dry. As seen in Figure 8b, the fields are slightly
    droughter in most areas. SSM is below 0.40 cm3/cm3, but in most areas, it is between
    0.06 and 0.27 cm3/cm3, and the northern area is arid. This can provide valuable
    reference information for irrigation management. Thus, it can be concluded that
    SSM estimated by the model was highly consistent with in situ measured SSM. The
    model developed in our research is applicable for SSM estimation of farmland.
    Figure 8. SSM mapping on two different dates: 28 April 2019 (a), and 29 April
    2021 (b), in Gu’an, Hebei, China. 4. Discussion 4.1. SSM Estimation in Vegetated
    Areas Many RS-based models are available for SSM retrieval [43,44,45,46,47,48].
    However, these models have limited potential to estimate SSM directly over vegetation-covered
    areas due to the distributed scattering of vegetation. Microwave RS can be widely
    used in SSM estimation because it is not affected by weather or light and has
    strong penetration, which can improve reliability and effectiveness. However,
    in vegetation-covered areas, the attenuation and scattering of microwave radiation
    signals from soil by the vegetation layer and radiation from the vegetation itself
    will influence the accuracy of SSM estimation. In the research of SSM retrieval,
    removing the effect of the vegetation layer has always been the focus, and some
    progress has been made. In this paper, the WCM was used to estimate SSM in vegetation-covered
    areas, and satisfactory results were obtained, with an R2 of 0.867, MAE of 0.023
    cm3/cm3, and RMSE of 0.028 cm3/cm3. The results were close to those obtained in
    other studies. Bao et al. [40] used an improved water cloud model to estimate
    SSM in partial vegetation-covered areas in UK and Spain and found that the modeled
    value had a high consistency with the in situ measured value (R2 = 0.829); this
    value was slightly lower than the validation obtained in the present study (R2
    = 0.867). This difference is mainly due to differences in the used optical RS
    data and the number of verification points. Bousbih et al. [14] used the WCM to
    estimate SSM in the Kairouan plain, and the validation results were relatively
    poor (R2 = 0.4, RMSE = 0.064 cm3/cm3). However, it has been well applied in irrigation
    mapping. Gao et al. [49] obtained regional SSM with a spatial resolution of 100
    m in Urgell (Catalunya, Spain) using S1 SAR and S2 optical data based on change
    detection and found that the modeled value had a high consistency with the in
    situ measured value (RMSE = 0.087 cm3/cm3); this value was slightly higher than
    the validation obtained in the present study. This difference is mainly due to
    differences in the spatial resolution and methods used. Santamaría-Artigas et
    al. [50] developed the evaluation of an optical–passive microwave method for SSM
    estimation at the regional scale using RS and reanalysis data. The results contribute
    to the use of single linear and semi-empirical regressions to calculate SSM at
    the regional scale based on SMOS L-band bipolarized brightness temperature. Meng
    et al. [51] developed an SSM retrieval algorithm from multisource fusion data
    through the sowing, jointing, heading, and flowering stages of maize. The results
    showed that the improved Dubois (IDubois) model was better than the Dubois model,
    based on the RMSE (RMSEIDubois = 0.0371 cm3/cm3, RMSEDubois = 0.0654 cm3/cm3);
    these values were slightly higher than the validation obtained in the present
    study (RMSE = 0.028 cm3/cm3). This difference may be caused by the different models
    used. Based on the above studies, it can be found that the improved WCM based
    on the vegetation red-edge band proposed in this research has improved accuracy
    with a high spatial resolution (20 m × 20 m), which has a wide application prospect.
    4.2. Some Errors and Research Expectations Section 4.1 compared relevant studies
    on SSM estimation in vegetated areas, and the accuracy obtained by different studies
    is inconsistent. Part of the bias is caused by objective factors such as the inaccuracy
    of the input data and the limitations of the validation methods. Meanwhile, additional
    bias is contributed by the subjective factor of the innate defects of the algorithms.
    There are also errors in this study. On the one hand, S1 SAR and S2 MSI images
    have their own registration errors and correction errors, as well as spatial resolution
    matching errors of S1 and S2, which will affect the inversion accuracy of SSM.
    On the other hand, the spatial distribution of SSM has strong spatial heterogeneity,
    and the in situ measured sample value cannot completely objectively and truly
    reflect the actual situation of the 20 m spatial scale (spatial resolution of
    remote sensing image data resampling–sampling). In this research, the vegetation
    red-edge band with a central wavelength of 0.705 μ m was used to calculate the
    MCARI, which was used to estimate the VWC. The SSM estimation model was established,
    and high accuracy was obtained. However, there are four vegetation red-edge bands
    of the S2 satellite, and their central wavelengths are 0.705, 0.740, 0.783, and
    0.865 μ m , respectively, corresponding to Band 5, Band 6, Band 7, and Band 8A.
    The indices calculated from each vegetation red-edge band are called MCARI1, MCARI2,
    MCARI3, and MCARI4, respectively. That is, our research used MCARI1 without a
    comparative analysis of MCARI2, MCARI3, and MCARI4. We still do not know the effects
    of the other three indexes on SSM estimation. In the future, the above four indices
    can be compared to further clarify the MCARI and which vegetation red-edge band
    calculated has the best performance in SSM estimation. The SSM estimation model
    developed in our research is simple and easy to implement, and the estimated SSM
    has very satisfactory robustness at a high spatial resolution. There is no denying
    that the developed model also has some disadvantages that need to be addressed
    in the future. First, there is still some error introduced due to ignoring the
    surface roughness and crop type. Secondly, the transit date of the S2 satellite
    is not completely synchronized with the transit date of the S1 satellite. In addition,
    although clouds, rain, and other extreme weather conditions have little to no
    impact on S1 images, they have a great impact on optical remote sensing images,
    and the data obtained by the cloud processing algorithm is not the best choice,
    which may be a challenge. At present, soil moisture data sets with a high spatiotemporal
    resolution are still scarce. In the future, to produce a high spatiotemporal resolution
    products (e.g., 20 m × 20 m, daily), it is needed to make full use of MODIS and
    Landsat images and introduce spatiotemporal fusion methods, e.g., the Enhanced
    Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) [52], the Flexible
    Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF) [53], and the Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal
    Enhancement Method (CESTEM) [54]. 5. Conclusions The timely and accurate acquisition
    of SSM information is very important for agricultural water resource management
    and drought monitoring. Many scholars have carried out a series of studies on
    bare soil or sparse vegetation areas and made positive contributions to this field.
    However, there are relatively few studies on SSM in vegetation-covered areas such
    as farmland. At present, the potential of the MCARI for SSM estimation has not
    been exploited, and it is an important part of our research. In this paper, backscattering
    coefficients and spectral indices were obtained from S1 and S2 images, respectively.
    Then, the effectiveness of the MCARI in SSM estimation was evaluated with the
    WCM and compared with the other two vegetation indices (NDVI and NDWI). Finally,
    the model was validated with in situ measured SSM values, and the SSM of the vegetated
    areas in Daxing, Beijing, and Gu’an, Hebei, in two periods was plotted. The detailed
    conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows: Compared to VH polarization,
    VV polarization was more suitable for SSM estimation and achieved higher accuracy.
    The MCARI performed well in estimating the VWC, which made it show excellent potential
    in estimating SSM in vegetation-covered areas. Based on the MCARI, the SSM estimation
    model was developed. The R2, RMSE, and MAE between the estimated and in situ measured
    SSM values were 0.867, 0.028 cm3/cm3, and 0.023 cm3/cm3, respectively. This method
    can obtain SSM information with a high spatial resolution, which can be used to
    guide agricultural irrigation and make positive contributions to agricultural
    water resource management and drought monitoring. Author Contributions Methodology,

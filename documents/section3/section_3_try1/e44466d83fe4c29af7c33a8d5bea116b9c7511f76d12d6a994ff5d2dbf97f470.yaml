  description: With the extensive application of Internet of Things (IOT) technology
    and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), to address the needs for plant growth environment
    monitoring in agricultural production, this study presents a plant growth environment
    remote monitoring system using Zigbee wireless network technology. By using CC2530MCU
    and ZigBee WSN module, this system could realize short-distance data transmission
    and real-time monitoring and control via ZigBee wireless network; and establish
    connection with remote data server through monitoring computer and Ethernet to
    realize long-distance data transmission and monitoring. This system could realize
    data collection and remote monitoring for temperature, humidity, lighting and
    other environmental factors through humidity, temperature, CO2 concentration and
    other sensor modules, as well as the corresponding execution modules. After testing
    and verification, this system is stable and convenient for operation, and has
    low packet loss rate. This system is featured by small size, low energy consumption
    and flexible installation, thus is suitable for the monitoring and management
    of small and medium scale agricultural production such as household vertical farms,
    plant factories etc.

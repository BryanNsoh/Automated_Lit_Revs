  description: Evapotranspiration (ET) networks have been developed and used to support
    weather and related ET information needs of U.S. agricultural production for nearly
    half a century, but many networks have been affected by inherent problems associated
    with sustaining operations. Consequently, these challenges have led to the discontinuation
    of network service in many cases. Most ET networks have been impacted by inadequate
    financial support compounded by inadequate public awareness and understanding
    of their usefulness and value in irrigation management, water conservation and
    water planning, and policy activities. Data accuracy is vital to usefulness, yet
    network data quality is often degraded when limited resources result in reduced
    equipment maintenance and data QA/QC. A discussion of ET network requirements
    and associated costs is presented. Estimates of the value and pumping reduction
    using the Texas High Plains ET networks are presented documenting the improvements
    of crop water use estimates and the impact associated with these improvements
    on irrigation groundwater withdrawal.

    network, Evapotranspiration network, Irrigation scheduling, Irrigation value,
    Water management tools, Water savings. Highlights Irrigation scheduling using
    accurate ET network data can conserve energy and water. ET networks can be a valuable,
    cost effective, and feasible management tool in water policy. The Texas High Plains
    ET Network saved irrigated producers an estimated $US 22M dollars annually. ET
    network benefits and use extend beyond the agricultural sector. Abstract. Evapotranspiration

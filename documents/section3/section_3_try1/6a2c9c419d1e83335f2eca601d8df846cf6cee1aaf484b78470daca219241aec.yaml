    and extended coverage of base station signals were realized by combining narrow
    band internet of things (NB-IoT) and LoRa network. The circuit was examined using
    terminal electrical parameter and the power was calibrated, which was combined
    with the anomaly detection algorithm to accurately monitor the operation status
    of the equipment. The abnormal status was uploaded immediately, and the data upload

    Result: Abnormal status was uploaded within 150 ms and the frequency was limited
    to 20 000 times per year for the orchard real-time monitoring system. After calibrating
    the detection power, the determination coeffecient was 0.999 8 for the linear

    India SECTION I. Introduction According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO), providing adequate food for the increasing world population is one of the
    most serious challenges of the 21st century. Limited cultivable land, declining
    freshwater resource, unsuitable climate, inadequate light for photosynthesis and
    constrained financial resources are some of the major challenges to increasing
    agricultural produce. In this context, industrial greenhouses have a huge potential
    in providing food security in many parts of the world, particularly if they are
    used properly and efficiently. However, greenhouse ecosystem is a complex system
    coupled with dynamics of environmental factors like soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, light and CO2 concentration. Maintaining an optimal greenhouse environment
    may lead to significant improvements in crop produce and hence a key goal for
    today''s advanced agriculture and this is the motivation behind carrying out the
    work described in this paper. IoT driven agriculture monitoring may potentially
    revolutionize the agriculture industry. It enables quality remote monitoring and
    control from anywhere at any time through a combination of devices and also improved
    access to quality information. Reduction in electricity and labour costs, and
    higher convenience are added advantages. The use of IoT based systems for the
    purpose of monitoring and control of greenhouse ecosystem provide several advantages
    over existing methods. A reduction in wiring deployment and maintenance cost,
    quick and easy retrofitting in the existing infrastructure, convenient and non-invasive
    remote monitoring and control without disturbing the plant biome by frequent visits,
    less disturbance to normal farming operations are some of the benefits. In addition
    to these benefits, these systems are more reliable, easily scalable and can be
    extended to more advanced functionalities such as fusion of information from more
    than one sensor node for better inference and precise control of the environment.
    A research carried out by LOFAR Agro Consortium in Netherlands is reported where
    wireless sensor network is used to monitor temperature and humidity for potato
    crop cultivation and hence control Phytophtora Infestans fungous disease [1].
    Zhang et al. developed a small network for monitoring humidity and temperature
    at various points in a plant nursery [2]. Belasare et al. developed a system to
    monitor Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) in a greenhouse using WSN and visualize
    the data on LabView [3]. Roop Pahuja et al. proposed a GSM based system for remote
    control of various parameters such as humidity, light and temperature using ARM7
    microcontroller in a greenhouse [4]. Ravi et al. (2016) monitored nitrogen, phosphorus,
    potassium and other minerals in soil using electrochemical sensors, and carry
    out drip fertigation when required [5]. Koprda et al. implemented a GSM based
    system for monitoring and control of soil moistures using soil humidity sensors
    [6]. The control is done using Android app. Nattapol et al. proposed the use of
    Wireless Sensing Networks (WSN) and smartphone for monitoring and control of various
    crop parameters like soil moisture, temperature and humidity [7]. Sekulic'' et
    al. developed a smart spraying system for disease forecasting of grapevine downy
    mildew (Plasmopara Viticola) in the vineyard region of Montenegro [8]. The system
    collects weather data from the sensor nodes. Based on the measurements, grapevine
    growth stages and field monitoring of the pathogen development, the system is
    calibrated for disease forecasting. The above-mentioned literature report monitoring
    and control of temperature, soil moisture, soil nutrient content, vapour pressure
    deficit etc. However, research suggests that quality of air as well as intensity
    of individual spectral components of light also affect the growth of plants. Besides,
    most of the systems mentioned above use zigbee based wireless sensor networks
    for monitoring and control, with a limited range of operation, a limited bandwidth
    and lack of cognitive abilities due to limited computing power. In the work presented
    in this paper, an IoT based cloud integrated telemetry and control system is developed
    to remotely monitor and maintain environment suitable for plant sustenance and
    growth in greenhouse. The proposed cloud integrated IoT system has no range limitations,
    the only constraint is the availability of GSM and ethernet/WiFi connections.
    The main objective of the design was to develop a low cost, user friendly system
    for field measurement with the aim of reducing the manual operations and using
    the measured data from the sensor nodes for intelligent inference and remote control.
    The developed system provides realtime wireless sensor data transmission, data
    visualization and processing at the central monitoring server / PC via ThingSpeak
    cloud and ubiquitous GSM infrastructure. The use of lightweight and fast Blynk
    IoT platform for implementing the mobile app for messaging and control of greenhouse
    environment is a key feature of the developed system. Blynk platform enables a
    multilateral connection with the sensor node, Blynk server/software, and mobile
    phone. Real time irrigation needs are received via messages on the Blynk app installed
    on the mobile phone. In order to test system developed in this work, experimental
    tests were conducted in greenhouse by us and the results obtained have been presented
    and discussed in this paper. The paper is organized as follows: Section II describes
    the overall architecture of the proposed system. Section III and IV give the hardware
    and software details of the system, respectively. Section V and VI report the
    experimental results and conclusions, respectively. SECTION II. System Architecture
    Fig. 1. gives the system architecture of the IoT based remotely monitored and
    controlled greenhouse ecosystem. The system comprises of three major components:
    GPRS enabled sensor nodes deployed at various locations in the field, an Ethernet
    connected central monitoring server/PC at the remote station, and mobile controlling
    of actuator connected to the switches controlling devices. A. Sensor Node (SN)
    Each sensor node comprises of sensors, a microcontroller and GSM shield for communication.
    The sampled sensor data is processed, packetized and transmitted wirelessly to
    the server through General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). B. Central Monitoring
    Server The central monitoring server receives, stores, displays and analyse live
    data from the sensor nodes. It may also be programmed/configured to generate/send
    notifications under certain conditions. The server processes the received information,
    makes suitable inferences and send control command to the actuator node. C. Mobile
    Phone Based Monitoring and Control Unit /AN The actuator node (AN) is used to
    wirelessly receive and execute the control commands from the Blynk server. It
    has connections to various coloured LEDs, irrigation pumps fan/cooler etc. Fig.
    1: Data flow architecture of IoT based telemetry and control system for a greenhouse
    Show All SECTION III. System Implementation A. Sensor Node The sensor node employed
    in this work for IoT based greenhouse monitoring uses an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller
    based on ATMega1280. The board requires a power supply of 7-12V supplied either
    at VIN via an on-board regulator or USB. It operates at frequencies of up to 1
    MHz. It includes up to 128 kB of flash memory, up to 8 kB of SRAM, USB Device
    interface, SPI interface, 4 UART serial ports, digital input-output pins, 1 PWM
    pins and 1 analog input pins[9]. The soil moisture sensor used in the node is
    EVANA SM12. It estimates the soil volumetric water content by measuring the dielectric
    constant (soil bulk permittivity) of the soil. The soil water content and dielectric
    constants are directly proportional to each other. This sensor measures the resistance
    between two pins of its Printed Circuit Board (PCB). Hence, it gives a lower resistance
    when soil moisture is high and vice-versa. The operation of the sensor requires
    a biasing voltage of 3.3-5V. The sensor has a digital as well as analog output
    interface (EVANA SM12 Datasheet) [10]. The ambient light intensity sensor used
    is BH1750. It measures the intensity of the incident light using a photo diode.
    It has a measurement range of 1–553 lx and a resolution of 0.1 lx. The maximum
    input voltage of BH1750 is 4.5V and the operating voltage being around is 3.6V.
    The influence of the infrared radiations on the sensor output is small [11]. The
    air quality sensor MQ135 is used in the node to monitor the CO2 content of the
    atmosphere. As the concentration of CO2 increase, the conductivity of gas sensor
    also increases. It is assumed that the other gases like ammonia, aromatic compounds,
    Sulphur, benzene vapor, smoke etc. to which the sensor is sensitive are constant
    in the atmosphere. The output of MQ135 can be an analog signal that can be read
    with an analog input port of the Arduino or a digital TTL output that can be read
    with a digital input port of the Arduino [12]. GSM Shield SIM900A is used to enable
    communication of the developed sensor node with remote server. The interfacing
    of sensor node electronics comprising microcontroller, sensors and GSM Shield
    is shown in Fig. 2. The function of the sensor node include periodically measuring
    the environmental parameters, data processing and packetization, and wireless
    transmission to ThingSpeak channel. These functions were implemented by a program
    in embedded C language, uploaded on the microcontroller using Arduino IDE (Integrated
    Development Environment). When the sensor node is powered on the program automatically
    starts and follows the logic in the flowchart indicated in Fig. 3. B. Central
    Monitoring Server In the prototype in this work, ThingSpeak is used as a monitoring
    cloud server. ThingSpeak is an IoT analytics platform that enables real time data
    collection, visualization and analysis. The information can be viewed by the user
    when required. Online analysis and processing of the data may also be done in
    MATLAB. Fig. 4 shows the program flow for cloud server used in this work. Fig.
    2: Sensor node electronics Show All Fig. 3: Sensor node program flow Show All
    C. Mobile Phone Based Monitoring and Control Unit (AN) The actuator node consists
    of a microcontroller programmed to sense any control commands from Blynk app installed
    on the remote mobile phone. Whenever, the intensity of light displayed at ThingSpeak
    channel is outside the desired ambient light intensity range, a command is sent
    from the Blynk app to switch on / off the light. Likewise, the irrigation pump
    is switched on / off when the received sensed soil moisture values fall outside
    the desired levels. Microcontroller executes the received commands by controlling
    the relevant switches via the digital input / output pins and connected relays.
    The flowchart for actuator node is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 4: Cloud server routine

    All SECTION IV. System Working and Results The working of the developed system
    is shown in Fig. 6. The working of the developed system is shown in Fig. 6. The
    developed system was tested to perform a real-time remote environmental monitoring
    of soil moisture, air quality and light for cultivation of tomato plants. The
    sensor and the actuator nodes were installed in the in-vitro culture lab, Department
    of Botany, Faculty of Life Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU). The monitoring
    started since November 16, 2017 with every one minute interval of measurement.
    The central monitoring server was placed at Advanced Communication Laboratory,
    Department of Electronics Engineering, AMU. The environmental data comprising
    air quality, light intensity and soil moisture was monitored for seven days. Fig.
    7. shows the implemented system setup at the in-vitro culture lab, Department
    of Botany. The actuation function was successfully tested for controlling the
    irrigation pump, air conditioner and artificial lights. Fig. 6: Working of the
    developed system Show All Fig. 7: Testing of the implemented system prototype
    Show All Fig. 8. shows the successful real-time visualization of received measurements
    on ThingSpeak server for a) soil moisture sensor b) light sensor and c) air quality
    sensor. Offline measurement data were also observed on the personal computer.
    The offline measurement record may help keep continuity and robustness of monitoring
    in case of unstable GSM network. The offline data observed on serial monitor of
    Arduino IDE is shown in Fig. 9. Table 1 shows a sample series of successfully
    received environmental data for soil moisture, light intensity and air quality
    over time. Soil moisture sensor values above 1000 indicate the need for irrigation.
    Light intensity values less than 50 indicate darkness. Similarly, air quality
    measurements more than 350 indicate poor air quality. The data can be utilized
    to support daily farm activity. In view of the use of cloud-based system, the
    measured environmental data could be checked using PCs and smartphones anytime
    and anywhere. Depending upon the measured sensor values, required actuation of
    devices can be performed via Blynk app. Analog voltage values measured by the
    above sensors can be calculated from raw mentioned values using the formula: Analog
    sensor voltage output= raw sensor output value 1023 View Source These voltages
    are proportionally indicative of soil moisture percentage, light intensity and
    air quality respectively. Table I: Reading of different sensors collected by ThingSpeak
    server Fig. 8: ThingSpeak server data for different sensors Show All Fig. 9: Data
    on serial monitor of arduino IDE Show All As soon as the levels rise/fall below
    the set threshold for soil moisture sensor, the ThingSpeak server displays an
    alert notification on mobile as shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10: Alert notification
    received on mobile Show All The control of these parameters is done remotely and
    wirelessly via Blynk app which allows user to press a button and turn on/off the
    equipments. This wireless control via Blynk app was tested for switching ON/OFF
    the LED and the results are shown in Fig. 11. These LEDs were replaced by relays
    connecting to the appliances used for actual actuation. Fig. 11: Testing control
    via blynk app Show All SECTION V. Conclusions In this paper, a prototype cloud
    integrated Internet of Things system for tele-monitoring and control of greenhouse
    environment is developed and successfully tested. The system collects measured
    environmental sensor data on ThingSpeak cloud server from the GPRS enabled sensor
    nodes. The sensor node data can be monitored from anywhere using an Internet connected
    laptop / mobile phone. The ThingSpeak platform can analyse the effect of greenhouse
    environment on plant growth from the received sensor data. Through the analysis,
    it enables intelligent control of the greenhouse environment suitable for plant
    growth. The use of lightweight and fast Blynk IoT platform for implementing the
    mobile app for messaging and control of greenhouse environment is a key feature
    of the developed system. Blynk platform enables a multilateral connection with
    the sensor node, Blynk server/software, and mobile phone. Real time irrigation
    needs are received via messages on the Blynk app installed on the mobile phone.
    Fan, lights and irrigation pump in greenhouse are also successfully controlled
    via Blynk mobile phone app using GPRS transmission to the sensor node. Computing
    and telecommunications technologies are still not widely adopted for agriculture
    applications, in many regions of the world. Increasing bandwidths in terms of
    high speed mobile and internet services to rural areas are gradually becoming
    available in these regions. In this scenario, the work presented in this paper
    assumes great significance as the advent of IoT has a great potential to revolutionise
    farming and agricultural practices. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper authors would like

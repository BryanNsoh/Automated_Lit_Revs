    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    recommendation. Full size image A confusion matrix is an illustrative format that
    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Effective support for agricultural production-management strategies
    relies on the accurate monitoring of crop growth and grain yield estimation at
    the field scale, making it an urgent need for the development of precision agriculture.
    Crop models are capable of simulating the growth and development of crops. In
    addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) provides high temporal and spatial resolution
    for remote sensing, which can quickly and accurately obtain the crop growth status
    of small and medium-sized areas. This research utilized multispectral remote sensing
    information collected via UAV, alongside the WOFOST (World Food Studies) model,
    to evaluate the growth of summer maize within the experimental site. By utilizing
    vegetation indices derived from the UAV remote sensing data, the LAI (Leaf Area
    Index) of summer maize was ascertained, which further revealed a robust correlation
    between LAI and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The model parameters
    were calibrated using crop and soil data from the Irrigation Experiment Station
    of Northwest A&F University. Verification indices revealed good consistency with
    a normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of around 25 %, indicating that the
    model was suitable for simulating summer maize growth in this region. The ensemble
    Kalman filter algorithm was utilized to assimilate the remote sensing observation
    data with the WOFOST model, and the results showed that assimilation improved
    the accuracy of the yield simulation for each treatment. The optimal assimilation
    frequency should be more than three times, and assimilation during the flowering
    and grain-filling stages of summer maize could obtain better yield simulation
    results. By assimilating remote sensing observation data with 33 years of historical
    meteorological data from the Yangling Meteorological Station using the ensemble
    Kalman filter algorithm, this study predicted the yield and obtained a relative
    error of less than 5 %. The predicted yield value obtained on September 6 was
    more accurate than the predicted yield obtained at other times.

    production-management strategies relies on the accurate monitoring of crop growth
    and grain yield estimation at the field scale, making it an urgent need for the
    development of precision agriculture. Crop models are capable of simulating the
    growth and development of crops. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) provides
    high temporal and spatial resolution for remote sensing, which can quickly and
    accurately obtain the crop growth status of small and medium-sized areas. This
    research utilized multispectral remote sensing information collected via UAV,
    alongside the WOFOST (World Food Studies) model, to evaluate the growth of summer
    maize within the experimental site. By utilizing vegetation indices derived from
    the UAV remote sensing data, the LAI (Leaf Area Index) of summer maize was ascertained,
    which further revealed a robust correlation between LAI and NDVI (Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index). The model parameters were calibrated using crop and soil data
    from the Irrigation Experiment Station of Northwest A&F University. Verification
    indices revealed good consistency with a normalized root mean square error (nRMSE)
    of around 25 %, indicating that the model was suitable for simulating summer maize
    growth in this region. The ensemble Kalman filter algorithm was utilized to assimilate
    the remote sensing observation data with the WOFOST model, and the results showed
    that assimilation improved the accuracy of the yield simulation for each treatment.

    during the flowering and grain-filling stages of summer maize could obtain better
    yield simulation results. By assimilating remote sensing observation data with

    modelUAV remote sensingEnsemble Kalman filterYield forecast 1. Introduction Crop
    growth and yield monitoring are crucial considerations for effective agricultural
    management. Social and environmental factors, such as population growth, the decrease
    in arable land, water scarcity, and extreme weather, can significantly impact
    agricultural production and jeopardize food security (Ge et al., 2022, Huang et
    al., 2019). Hence, it is essential to monitor crop growth accurately and estimate
    grain yield in a region to develop effective food policies and promote precision
    agriculture (Jin et al., 2018, Dhakar et al., 2022). In the field of agriculture,
    there are multiple methods available for yield estimation, and the selection of
    these methods depends on the crop type under study, available data and resources,
    and the required estimation accuracy. Common yield estimation methods include
    field-based experimental yield estimation, remote sensing-based yield estimation,
    and crop growth model-based yield estimation (Luo et al., 2023). Field experiments
    are arduous and time-intensive endeavors for yield estimation, presenting challenges
    in obtaining real-time crop yield data. Crop growth models, grounded in physiological
    processes, offer a viable alternative, capable of accurately simulating crop development
    and yield across the growing season through intrinsic physical processes and kinetic
    mechanisms. However, when these models are employed for regional yield estimation,
    they encounter limitations stemming from the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties,
    crop parameters, and meteorological conditions. This heterogeneity complicates
    the acquisition of macroscopic information and the regionalization of model parameters
    (Luo et al., 2023). Remote sensing technology utilizes satellite or UAV images
    to acquire farmland information. By analyzing parameters such as vegetation indices
    and LAI from the images, the health and growth status of vegetation can be inferred,
    enabling yield estimation (Wu et al., 2023). With the progress and development
    of modern information science and technology, the application of remote sensing
    technology is becoming increasingly widespread. Satellite remote sensing technology
    is widely used for large-scale agricultural monitoring and plays a critical role
    in the formulation of agricultural policies (Jamali et al., 2023). However, the
    practical application of satellite remote sensing is constrained by weather, cloud
    cover, low spatial or image resolution, and complex spectral information (Jay
    et al., 2019), which limits its practical utility to agricultural producers and
    operational management. Meanwhile, the development of UAV technology has made
    UAV remote sensing systems with multi-spectral cameras more convenient and flexible
    to use. They have advantages such as short response time, complete automation
    functions, high spatial, temporal, and ground resolution, reasonable spatial coverage,
    and low cost (Su et al., 2023). This technology can provide effective assistance
    to agricultural production managers. Numerous studies on LAI inversion using remote
    sensing data have been conducted by researchers both domestically and internationally.
    Caruso et al. (2023) determined that canopy volume derived from UAV imagery outperformed
    NDVI as a predictor of LAI, exhibiting superior temporal stability. This practical
    implication suggests that UAV geometric indices are effective for monitoring canopy
    biomass throughout the growing season, even under environmental stress conditions;
    Qiao et al. (2022) proposed an accurate monitoring and LAI estimation method for
    maize growth based on a UAV multispectral sensor. They found that morphological
    parameters and vegetation indices extracted from UAV images exhibit the same temporal
    distribution as LAI, enabling monitoring of crop LAI variation. However, using
    a single parameter for monitoring multiple growth stages has its limitations.
    Chen et al. (2020b) employed UAVs to obtain high-spectral images of wheat and
    found that spectral transformation significantly improved the correlation between
    spectral variables and LAI. The physical model method involves analyzing remote
    sensing data through the establishment of physical models, such as using vegetation
    radiative transfer models to estimate LAI. These models follow certain physical
    laws and quantitatively describe the relationship between canopy structural parameters
    and canopy reflectance, remaining unaffected by vegetation types (Wan et al.,
    2021). Remote sensing technology has enabled the estimation of crop yields through
    the establishment of statistical regression relationships between agricultural
    remote sensing information and crop yields (Zhang et al., 2019). However, this
    method lacks a mechanistic explanation for crop growth and yield formation, making
    it difficult to apply on a large scale (Ma et al., 2022). Furthermore, obtaining
    a vegetation index through remote sensing data proves challenging for meeting
    the requirements of crop modeling. Quantitative remote sensing faces several primary
    challenges, including directionality issues, scale effects and transformations,
    and retrieval strategies and methods (Jin et al., 2018), all of which impact the
    accuracy of estimating canopy state variables using remotely sensed data. To address
    the uncertainty inherent in remote sensing inversion of vegetation indices, previous
    studies have employed various approaches such as ground observation data validation,
    multi-source data fusion, model algorithm enhancement, uncertainty statistical
    analysis, and long-term observational series (Luo et al., 2023). In our study,
    we mitigate uncertainty in the inversion process by employing ground observation
    data validation and data assimilation techniques. Integrating crop models with
    remote sensing technology has been viewed as an effective tool for monitoring
    crop growth and estimating yields, as it leverages their respective strengths
    in time and space and accounts for the spatial heterogeneity of crops, resulting
    in more accurate crop growth status and yield estimation (Fattori Junior et al.,
    2022). Jin et al. (2024) utilized UAV to extract rice texture features from remote
    sensing images. They conducted rice field experiments with varying nitrogen fertilizer
    application rates and employed data assimilation methods to integrate UAV RGB
    image data, RiceGrows, and ground-based IoT meteorological data. This integration
    facilitated the generation of fertilizer application decisions and prescription
    maps for plant protection UAV operations, enabling precise rice fertilizer application;
    Ge et al. (2022) investigated the sensitivity of the assimilation process to the
    timing of UAV remotely sensed Plant Nutrient Concentration (PNC) data acquisition,
    covering the nutrient period, tasseling period, ripening period, and entire growing
    period. Their findings revealed that assimilating PNC data during the nutrient
    stage yielded a stronger relationship between estimated and measured PNC compared
    to other growth stages. Additionally, assimilating PNC data at the early growth
    stage better simulated PNC dynamics under nitrogen (N)-free stress conditions;
    Peng et al. (2021) utilized remote sensing data from UAVs and SAFY crop models
    for maize yield estimation, observing varying yield estimation accuracies under
    different moisture treatments. They concluded that incorporating UAV observations
    into crop data holds significant potential for monitoring crop yields and improving
    agricultural management; Yang et al. (2021) integrated UAV images into the WOFOST
    model, demonstrating improved estimation of growth and development for winter
    wheat in their study area. Their findings highlighted the enhanced accuracy of
    the winter wheat growth model simulation through UAV data integration, affirming
    the feasibility and efficacy of incorporating UAV data into crop modeling. The
    LAI assimilation in crop growth models significantly impacts the final yield estimation
    results. Process-based crop models often disregard Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)
    assumptions due to challenges in their model mechanism and parameterization, resulting
    in systematic errors. Discrepancies arise in the error between LAI and yield when
    the model generates a higher LAI value than the assimilated LAI value, coupled
    with negative yield-to-yield deviation in open-loop simulation. In such cases,
    post-assimilation, the simulation may underestimate yield due to further LAI reduction
    (Kang and Özdoğan, 2019). Conversely, when the correlation between assimilated
    LAI and crop yield is weak, EnKF also fails to enhance yield estimation (Nearing
    et al., 2012). Additionally, concerning LAI assimilation, phenological errors
    may lead to inconsistencies in the magnitude and peak values of simulated and
    observed LAI (Curnel et al., 2011). Fattori Junior et al. (2022) employed EnKF
    with DSSAT/SAMUCA for LAI assimilation and observed a reasonable enhancement in
    yield estimates compared to Open-Loop (OP) simulations. This improvement partly
    stemmed from a more detailed depiction of plant physiology and soil moisture processes
    in the model, facilitating simulations using EnKF. However, the inherent variability
    in agriculture (crop parameters, soil properties, and crop management practices)
    and uncertainty in meteorological data can seriously undermine the ability of
    crop models to predict crop yields (Han et al., 2022), so accurate meteorological
    forecasts over the reproductive period can help farmers better manage their farmland
    and reduce the risk of crop damage when applying crop growth models (Prakash et
    al., 2019). Long-term weather forecasts have lower accuracy, making short-term
    or mid-term weather forecasts crucial for improving the prediction accuracy of
    crop models (Ferrise et al., 2015). Some researchers generate multiple complete
    meteorological data series covering the entire growing season by combining historical
    and real-time meteorological data, enabling the prediction of crop growth and
    yield variations (Lawless and Semenov, 2005, Bannayan and Hoogenboom, 2008). In
    daily yield forecasting, weather data before the forecast date are obtained from
    local weather stations, while unknown data between the forecast date and harvest
    date are supplemented using multi-year continuous weather series for the corresponding
    period. Multiple crop yields are obtained for each forecast day, and the median
    value is calculated as the prediction for that day. As the growing season progresses,
    historical weather data gradually get replaced by actual weather data (Chen et
    al., 2020a). By combining local historical and daily acquired weather data, this
    approach can generate daily weather sequences during the growing season to predict
    crop growth status and yield variations associated with the actual weather conditions
    before harvest (Chen et al., 2017). This study integrates remote sensing data
    into the WOFOST model by employing the Kalman filtering algorithm to assimilate
    the LAI as the state variable. Additionally, historical meteorological data is
    utilized for predicting summer maize yield. The main objectives of this research
    are as follows: (1) Constructing a one-dimensional linear regression model using
    multispectral remote sensing data within each fertility period of summer maize
    and the corresponding field-measured leaf area to determine the optimal inverse
    model for summer maize LAI. (2) Assimilating the LAI derived from remote sensing
    into the model as a state variable using the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm.
    This investigation explores the influence of different LAI sizes on assimilation
    results and assesses the impact of assimilation frequency and periods on yield.
    (3) Generating a specific meteorological data sequence by incorporating historical
    meteorological data and unknown meteorological data during the assimilation period.
    This sequence is used to drive the model, which is assimilated with real-time
    remote sensing data to obtain accurate yield predictions. By combining remote
    sensing observations in space and model simulations in time, this study achieves
    precise yield estimation at the farm scale without geographical limitations 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The research was conducted at the irrigation
    experimental station of Northwest A&F University, located in the Yangling District
    of Shaanxi Province, China. The station''s coordinates are 108°24′ E longitude
    and 34°20′ N latitude, at an altitude of 521 m. The study area has a warm temperate
    climate with a humid monsoon, and the soil texture is loamy, with an average field
    water holding capacity ranging from 25 % to 30 %, and a wilting moisture content
    of 10.4 % (by mass moisture content). The average bulk density of the soil is
    1.44 g cm−3. The frost-free period at the station lasts 221 days per year, and
    the annual precipitation is 635.1 mm, mainly occurring between July and October.
    Groundwater level is relatively deep, and upward supply can be neglected. Fig.

    of study area in irrigation experiment station, Northwest Agriculture and Forestry
    University. Qinlong 18, a variety of corn, was manually planted in the experiment
    at a seeding rate of 52,000 plants per hectare with a row spacing of 60 cm and
    a plant spacing of 40 cm, and was not irrigated during the growth period. Before
    sowing, artificial tillage, land preparation, and fertilization were conducted.
    The phosphorus fertilizer application rate was 90 kg ha−1. The sowing and harvest
    occurred on June 13, 2019, and October 10, 2019, respectively. 2.2. Experimental
    design The study utilized a randomized block design, incorporating four nitrogen
    application levels: CK (no fertilizer), N1 (105 kg N ha−1), N2 (210 kg N ha−1),
    and N3 (315 kg N ha−1), which were administered as basal fertilizer before sowing.
    Each treatment was replicated six times, resulting in 24 plots, each with a 20
    m2 area, 5 m length, and 4 m width, with a 0.5 m buffer strip separating them.
    For a comprehensive outline of each treatment, please refer to Table 1. Table

    and chemical properties Before the experimental planting, soil profile samples
    were collected for each treatment using 5-point sampling. The samples were mixed,
    divided into four parts, and 1 kg was retained for analysis. The ring knife method
    was employed to measure bulk density, saturated water content, field water holding
    capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and wilting water content, which was
    measured using the pressure membrane method. The Mariotte bottle method was utilized
    to measure the saturated hydraulic conductivity. 2.3.2. Measurement of leaf area
    index Following the seedling stage, five representative maize plants were randomly
    chosen for each treatment and labeled to track the overall growth of the plot.
    On the day when an UAV remote sensing system was used to capture an image of the
    experimental area, the length and width of all green leaves of the plants were
    measured using a tape measure. The formula for calculating individual leaf area
    is: (1) where LA is the individual leaf area (cm2), Lk is the length of the k-th
    leaf from the leaf base to the leaf tip (cm), W is the maximum width of the k-th
    leaf (cm), and a is the maize leaf area regression coefficient, 0.75. The formula
    for calculating LAI is: (2) Where ρ is the planting density (plants m−2). 2.3.3.
    Determination of summer maize yield At maturity, 12 maize plants were randomly
    selected for each treatment and harvested. The weight of the harvested plants
    was measured and converted into yield per unit area (kg ha−1) after threshing.
    2.4. Model and data 2.4.1. WOFOST model The PCSE-WOFOST model was developed using
    Python3, which offers several advantages such as the simplicity and flexibility
    of the Python language. It is also more convenient for modification and batch
    processing. The model is capable of running with a specified time step and can
    read various parameters at any time (in days) during the simulation process. Additionally,
    the model provides the “set_variable()” method, which serves as an interface for
    data assimilation. The main data required for the PCSE-WOFOST model includes:
    (1) Meteorological data The meteorological data used in this study was obtained
    from the meteorological station located within the Irrigation Experimental Station
    of Northwest A&F University. The station provides meteorological data such as
    sunshine hours (h), daily minimum temperature (℃), daily maximum temperature (℃),
    water vapor pressure (kPa), wind speed (m/s), precipitation (mm d-1), among others.
    The station provides a sufficient amount of data that meets the requirements of
    the model. However, before running the model, it is necessary to convert the format
    of the meteorological data to a file format that can be recognized by the model.
    Since the model requires solar radiation data, the formula for calculating solar
    radiation based on sunshine hours at the experimental station is as follows: (3)
    (4) where empirical coefficients as and bs are set to 0.25 and 0.5 respectively,
    n is the sunshine duration (h), N is the maximum possible sunshine duration, Ra
    is the extraterrestrial radiation at the top of the atmosphere, and ωs is the
    solar hour angle. The formula for calculating Ra is: (5) (6) (7) (8) where dr
    is the distance coefficient between the sun and the earth, δ is the declination
    of the sun, J is the Julian date of the calculation date, and μ is the latitude
    of the measurement point. Due to the lack of direct observation data of water
    vapor pressure in historical meteorological data, it is necessary to calculate
    the daily water vapor pressure, with the formula: (9) (10) where ea is the water
    vapor pressure, e0(T) is the saturation vapor pressure, RH is the relative humidity,
    and t is the temperature (℃). The saturation vapor pressure e0(T) is calculated
    using the improved Magnus formula (Alduchov and Eskridge, 1996). (2) Soil data.
    The soil data used in this study were obtained from field measurements and pertained
    to loam soil with sand, silt, and clay mass fractions of 7 %, 72 %, and 21 %,
    respectively. The 0–1 m soil layer has an average field capacity of 30 % and a
    wilting coefficient of 10.4 %, both based on gravimetric water content. (3) Field
    management data. The management data for field operations mainly comprises information
    such as the starting time of the model, the type of simulation start (seeding
    or transplanting), the crop name and variety, and the simulation end time and
    type (harvest or maturity). 2.4.2. PEST optimization program To ensure accurate
    simulation results, it is essential to adjust the model parameters to match the
    measured data when applying the model to new locations, crop varieties, and growing
    environments. Once the model parameters have been calibrated, it is necessary
    to validate the model by evaluating its applicability using data other than parameter
    calibration. This study used PEST software to optimize model parameters by comparing
    and analyzing data from the model''s output files and the software''s input files.
    The core idea of PEST software is a nonlinear optimization algorithm based on
    the Newton and gradient descent methods, which iteratively minimizes the objective
    function constructed to achieve the effect of parameter optimization. A weighted
    least-squares difference function was constructed between multiple output variable
    values of the WOFOST model and actual observed values, ψ expressed as: (11) where
    F is the crop model parameter; M(ti) is the observed value on the i-th day; O(F,ti)
    is the simulated value of the model on the i-th day; ki is the coefficient for
    adjusting the weight of different observed values; and n is the number of observed
    values. The three types of observed values, including LAI, biomass, and yield,
    were used as the reference values for the optimization program in this study.
    Different weight coefficients correspond to different types of model output values,
    thereby controlling the simulation error proportions of LAI, biomass, and yield
    within a certain range. The relative error (RE), consistency index (d), and normalized
    root mean square error (nRMSE) were used to evaluate the calibration results of
    the model, all of which are dimensionless statistical quantities that can reflect
    the degree of relative differences between the simulated values and the measured
    values. The smaller the RE and nRMSE and the closer d is to 1, the higher the
    accuracy of the model simulation. The formulas for calculating the relative error,
    consistency index, and normalized root mean square error are: (12) (13) (14) where
    n is the sample size, Mi is the simulated value of the model, Oi is the field-measured
    value, and Mm and Om are the means of the simulated values and the measured values,
    respectively. 2.5. Remote-sensing data 2.5.1. Collection, stitching, and processing
    of remote sensing image data The UAV remote sensing system used in this study
    is carried by the DJI M600 Pro, with a maximum payload of 5 kg and a maximum endurance
    of 30 min. The system includes the American RedEdge multispectral camera, which
    has a camera focal length of 5.5 mm, a field of view angle of 47.2 deg, and a
    ground resolution of 0.02 m for the images. As shown in Fig. 2. The camera has
    5 bands (475 nm, 560 nm, 668 nm, 840 nm, and 717 nm) and a light intensity sensor
    that corrects the effect of light intensity changes during aerial photography
    on reflectivity. This correction helps to avoid errors in the subsequent extraction
    of vegetation indices. The spectral response function of the multispectral camera
    used in this study is shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (635KB)

    image Fig. 3. Spectral response function (Zhang et al., 2019). During each growth
    stage of summer corn, clear and cloudless weather conditions were chosen to acquire
    crown remote sensing images. Before the actual flight, several sets of remote
    sensing images obtained under different flight parameters were compared through
    pre-experiments, and the relevant flight parameters were finally determined. Among
    them, the flight altitude was 30 m, and the overlap rate and sidelap rate were
    both 80 %. After the flight operation was completed, multiple images obtained
    by the multispectral camera were imported into the PhotoScan 1.4.0 software developed
    by Agisoft LCC company. After point cloud and texture processing, a single-band
    orthophoto image was output after stitching. Since remote sensing imaging is easily
    affected by external environmental factors, radiometric correction is required
    before band operation, which is performed in ArcGIS 10.2, and the formula is:
    (15) where Ri is the reflectance of the i-th spectral band of the ground target,
    Di is the DN value of the i-th spectral band of the ground target, Dbi is the
    DN value of the i-th spectral band of the gray board, and Rbi is the reflectance
    of the i-th spectral band of the gray board. In order to eliminate the influence
    of soil and shadow on the calculation results of vegetation indices, this study
    determined a fixed threshold by visually interpreting the background environmental
    values in each vegetation index image, and used the raster calculator in ArcGIS
    10.2 to remove the background of the vegetation index image, as shown in Fig.
    4. At the same time, in order to make the DN values of the image correspond one-to-one
    with the sampled chlorophyll values at the plot level, the mean value of the vegetation
    index for each plot (indicated by the red box in Fig. 4) was calculated using
    the zoning tool in ArcGIS 10.2 as the vegetation index value of the plot. Download

    Threshold segmentation flowchart. By means of visual interpretation, the background
    environment value in each vegetation index image is counted to determine a fixed
    threshold, and the rejection of the environmental background of the vegetation
    index image is achieved by the raster calculator in ArcGIS 10.2. The mean value
    of the vegetation index in each plot (shown in the red box in the figure) was
    also counted as the vegetation index value of the plot using the partition statistics
    tool. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the
    reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 2.5.2. Extraction of vegetation
    indices Vegetation indices are useful for measuring crop conditions on the ground
    conveniently and efficiently. By performing band operation, these indices reduce
    the impact of background information on the spectral characteristics of vegetation
    and improve the accuracy of vegetation index inversion of remote sensing data.
    The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is capable of estimating vegetation
    physiological parameters. The Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) improves NDVI
    by incorporating a soil adjustment factor L, which ranges from 0 to 1 depending
    on the situation. An L value of 0 indicates no vegetation cover, while an L value
    of 1 indicates complete vegetation canopy coverage, and the influence of soil
    on spectral reflectance can be ignored. Other improved vegetation indices, such
    as OSAVI and MSAVI2, have also been developed. To reduce the impact of environmental

    model parameterization The simple structure of the univariate linear regression
    model allows for the establishment of a linear regression prediction method based
    on the correlation between independent and dependent variables, which can effectively
    invert the LAI of summer maize. Based on the leaf area index data measured in
    the field and the vegetation index data remotely sensed by UAV, the one-way linear
    regression models of vegetation index and leaf area index from the nodulation
    stage to the maturity stage under different treatments were established, in which
    there were 60 sample data for each treatment, and 40 of them were randomly selected
    as the modeling samples according to the allocation ratio of 2:1 and the remaining
    20 were used as the validation samples. The equation is shown as formula (16):
    (16) where y is the predicted value of LAI, x is the vegetation index obtained
    from remote sensing data, a is the coefficient, and b is the constant. The model
    accuracy evaluation is based on the root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient
    of determination (R2): (17) (18) where xi is the measured value of LAI, ‾x is
    the mean of the measured values, yi is the predicted value of LAI, ‾y is the mean
    of the predicted values, and n is the sample size for modeling. 2.6. Data assimilation
    Determining sources of uncertainty in model parameters is a crucial step in data
    assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm. The input parameters
    and initial conditions of the crop model restrict the growth and yield generation
    stages of crops. The initial total crop dry weight (TDWI) impacts the crop''s
    initial growth rate and the maximum value of the LAI, while the leaf lifespan
    at 35 ℃(SPAN) determines the aging rate and aging time of the leaves. Furthermore,
    De Wit et al. (2012) analyzed the initial total crop dry weight and the leaf lifespan
    at 35 ℃ using a joint distribution and found that these two parameters had no
    significant correlation. Therefore, TDWI and SPAN were selected in this study
    to illustrate the uncertainty of the WOFOST model. An assimilation ensemble size
    of 50 and an uncertainty of 10 % were employed for TDWI and SPAN, respectively.
    The standard analysis equation for Kalman filtering is (Huang et al., 2015): (19)
    (20) where Aa is the analysis matrix of the state variable ensemble, A is the
    forecast matrix of the state variable ensemble, D is the observation matrix, H
    is the observation operator, Pe is the covariance matrix of the forecast ensemble,
    Re is the covariance matrix of the observation ensemble, and K is the Kalman coefficient.
    In this study, the observation matrix is remote sensing LAI, the forecast matrix
    is modeled simulated LAI, A and D are the same variable, the observation operator
    does not need to convert the two variables, thus H is an identity matrix, and
    Eq. (19) and Eq. (20) can be rewritten as: (21) (22) A is the simulated LAI set
    of the model considering parameter uncertainty, D is a new remote sensing set
    generated by adding remote sensing LAI with Gaussian distribution probability
    using random perturbations, and Aa is the set used to rewrite the model LAI after
    assimilation. Based on the convenience of remotely sensing crop LAI, it serves
    as the state variable for data assimilation. The model parameters, TDWI and SPAN,
    are selected as sources of uncertainty, and random perturbations are added to
    them based on Gaussian distribution probability to create a parameter set, P,
    comprising 50 model parameters that conform to a Gaussian distribution. P is input
    into the model, and the model runs to time t, when observation values are available,
    to obtain a forecast set, Mt, consisting of simulated LAI state variables. The
    observed LAI data is randomly perturbed based on Gaussian distribution probability
    to obtain an observation set, Ot, with the same size as Mt. The best LAI value,
    referred to as updated LAI, at time t is calculated by Eq. (21), utilizing the
    LAI of the forecast set and the LAI of the observation set. The updated LAI set
    is incorporated into the model using the set_variable() method in the WOFOST model.
    The model continues running until the next observation time, and the aforementioned
    steps are repeated until all observation data is assimilated. Once the model runs
    to the end date, a yield set of size m is obtained, and the assimilated yield
    is the average value of this set. 3. Results 3.1. Summer maize LAI inversion model
    based on multispectral remote sensing data Five sets of remote sensing data were
    acquired on July 16, July 31, August 15, September 6, and September 21, 2019.
    The LAI data measured on the ground were also obtained for the same dates. Common
    vegetation indices were used for performing correlation analysis with the measured
    LAI. 3.1.1. Correlation analysis between LAI and vegetation indices Table 3 presents
    the correlation analysis results between LAI and four vegetation indices of maize
    under different treatments from the jointing stage to maturity. The results indicate
    that there are differences in correlation among the various treatments. For the
    CK treatment, all four vegetation indices exhibit a good correlation with LAI,
    with NDVI having the highest correlation and MSAVI2 showing a strong negative
    correlation with LAI. Of the various nitrogen treatments, LAI has the highest
    correlation with NDVI, which is 0.874 (N1), 0.865 (N2), and 0.871 (N3), and is
    significantly negatively correlated with MSAVI2, while exhibiting the smallest
    correlation with SAVI. Table 3. Correlation coefficient between vegetation index

    3.1.2. Regression model building The outcomes for predicting LAI based on different
    vegetation indices under various nitrogen treatments are presented in Table 4.
    The findings demonstrate that the LAI-NDVI regression model outperformed the other
    models, with R2 values of 0.84, 0.70, 0.63, and 0.79, all with significance probabilities
    less than 0.01, indicating highly significant fitted regression models. The order
    of performance for the other regression models was LAI-OSAV > LAI-MSAVI2 > LAI-SAVI.
    For each fertilizer treatment, the significance probability of the LAI-SAVI regression
    model was greater than 0.01, indicating that it was not significant. Table 4.

    of the model for estimating LAI and vegetation index of summer maize The results
    of the LAI-NDVI model for different treatments are presented in Fig. 5. While
    the LAI-SAVI model demonstrated low accuracy, the accuracy test results of the
    remaining three models were satisfactory. Specifically, the R2 values of the LAI-NDVI
    model were 0.90 (CK), 0.89 (N1), 0.91 (N2), and 0.91 (N3); the RMSE values were
    0.21 (CK), 0.29 (N1), 0.28 (N2), and 0.25 (N3); and the RE values were 11.04 %
    (CK), 13.75 % (N1), 8.98 % (N2), and 9.95 % (N3). The slope of the regression
    equation between the predicted and measured LAI values of the LAI-NDVI model was
    close to 1 for all treatments (0.88 for CK, 0.89 for N1, 0.83 for N2, and 0.83
    for N3), indicating that the accuracy test results of the LAI-NDVI model were
    superior. The R2 values of the LAI-MSAVI2 and LAI-OSAVI models were greater than
    0.73 and 0.81, respectively, and their accuracy test results were the second-best
    among the models. See the appendices for LAI-MSAVI2, LAI-OSAVI and SAVI models.

    The calibration of the WOFOST model The PEST software was utilized in this study
    to optimize the model parameters. The experimental data used for model calibration
    and verification were collected from field measurements taken at the Irrigation
    Test Station of Northwest A&F University, located in Yangling District, Shaanxi
    Province, between 2014 and 2016. The data encompassed a wide range of variables,
    including soil physical characteristics, field management practices, and field
    observations, spanning the summer maize growing season and covering aspects such
    as LAI, biomass, and yield. The 2014 experimental data were used for model calibration,
    whereas the 2015 to 2016 data were utilized for model verification, encompassing
    the entire growing period, from emergence to maturity, as well as LAI, biomass,
    and yield. The field management parameters, including sowing and harvesting dates,
    were set by the specific experimental timelines. The parameters in the WOFOST
    model can be classified into three categories: developmental parameters, growth
    parameters, and soil parameters, each with a distinct function. The developmental
    parameters include accumulated temperature from sowing date to emergence (TSUMEM),
    from emergence to flowering (TSUM1), and from flowering to maturity (TSUM2). Soil
    parameters encompass the soil moisture content at the wilting point (SMW), field
    capacity (SMFCF), and saturated soil moisture content (SM0), all of which influence
    the amount of soil water available for crop growth and development. In this study,
    ten parameters that were found to be sensitive to the growth and development of
    summer maize were selected and adjusted based on previous research, while the
    remaining parameters were left at the default values of the model. LAI and above-ground
    biomass (TAGP) were chosen as the evaluation indicators when optimizing the crop
    parameters using the PEST program. One thousand sets of parameters were generated
    through random sampling within the range of the ten selected parameters, and these
    sets were subsequently used to adjust the model with the PEST software. The results
    of the modification process are presented in Table 5. Table 5. Parameter adjustment

    and validation The accuracy and reliability of model simulations are typically
    evaluated by comparing simulated values with measured values. Two main methods
    are employed for this purpose: numerical comparison and graphical comparison.
    Table 6 presents the calibration results of parameters for the development stages
    of summer maize. During the years 2015 and 2016, the emergence dates'' simulated
    errors resulted in zero days, whereas the flowering dates'' simulated errors resulted
    in four and two days, respectively. Similarly, the maturity dates'' simulated
    errors yielded two and five days in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Table 6. Correction

    of verifying the summer maize LAI and dry matter are presented in Fig. 6. In 2015,
    the consistency index between the simulated and measured LAI was 0.94, whereas
    it was 0.95 in 2016. The standard root mean square error of LAI verification was
    found to be 24.73 % and 25.53 % in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The consistency
    indexes for simulated dry matter were 0.97 and 0.98 in 2015 and 2016, respectively,
    with standard root mean square errors of 28.41 % and 28.02 %, respectively. These
    values, which fall within the range of 20 % to 30 %, indicate good simulation
    performance. Additionally, there was little interannual variation in the verification
    results. In 2015 and 2016, the relative errors of simulated yield were 1.3 % and
    1.5 %, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (318KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Validation of WOFOST model summer maize LAI and aboveground
    biomass calibration results for 2015 and 2016. Based on the verification results
    of the simulation and measured values in 2015 and 2016, the errors for each growth
    stage were within 5 days, and the relative error of yield was less than 5 %. Additionally,
    the consistency indexes and standard root mean square errors of dry matter and
    LAI were within reasonable ranges. Consequently, the calibrated WOFOST model for
    summer corn in the Yangling area exhibited high applicability. Subsequently, the
    WOFOST model was built based on the four fertilization measures, and the ensemble
    Kalman filter algorithm was applied to assimilate the remotely observed LAI. 3.2.3.
    Assimilation experiment results Based on the remote sensing inversion LAI model
    in Section 3.1.3, remote sensing LAI values for data assimilation were determined
    under different treatments. Based on the actual remote sensing data sampling time,
    the WOFOST model LAI was updated on the 34th day (July 16, 2019), 49th day (July
    31, 2019), 64th day (August 15, 2019), 86th day (September 6, 2019), and 101st
    day (September 21, 2019) after sowing. The variations of LAI after assimilating
    remote sensing observations using an ensemble Kalman filter for each treatment
    are displayed in Fig. 7. The red line represents the initial LAI before the first
    assimilation, without remote sensing data assimilation. In the CK treatment, the
    initial LAI exceeded the remote sensing LAI at all growth stages. Conversely,
    for the N1 treatment, there was little disparity between the initial simulated
    LAI value and the remote sensing LAI value. Comparatively, for the N2 treatment,
    the remote sensing LAI values were consistently greater than the initial simulated
    LAI value for each stage and period. Lastly, for the N3 treatment, the remote
    sensing LAI value was lower than that of the N2 treatment, but higher than those
    of the CK and N1 treatments. Download : Download high-res image (420KB) Download

    different treatments. CK is no fertilizer application; N1 is 105 kg N ha−1; N2
    is 210 kg N ha−1; N3 is 315 kg N ha−1. After two or three data assimilation cycles,
    the LAI of the model ensemble in the CK treatment decreased and became lower than
    the non-assimilated LAI value. In the N1 treatment, 33 out of 50 model ensemble
    members had higher simulated LAI values than the initial LAI value. For the N2
    treatment, the majority of the model ensemble (45 out of 50) exhibited LAI values
    that were higher than the initial simulated LAI value, while some members of the
    ensemble showed a decline in LAI values as the model progressed. In the N3 treatment,
    there were significant variations in the simulated LAI values among the members
    of the model ensemble, with the majority of the simulated LAI values being greater
    than the initial simulated LAI value. In the CK treatment, the assimilated LAI
    values in the model ensemble decreased significantly after the fourth assimilation,
    with a greater magnitude of decrease than in the previous three assimilations.
    Although the decrease in LAI was smaller in the fifth assimilation than in the
    fourth, it was still greater than in the first three assimilations. After all
    five assimilations, most of the assimilated LAI values in the model ensemble were
    smaller than the initial LAI values without assimilation. In the N1 treatment,
    the simulated LAI values changed greatly after the fourth assimilation, with 40
    members of the model ensemble having higher simulated LAI values than the initial
    LAI value. After all five assimilations, there were still 40 members of the model
    ensemble with LAI values greater than the initial LAI value. After the fourth
    assimilation in the N2 treatment, the simulated LAI values were greatly improved,
    with only a small fraction (2/50) of LAI values lower than the initial simulated
    LAI value. Similarly, the fifth assimilation also significantly improved the LAI
    values in the model ensemble, with all simulated LAI values in the model ensemble
    higher than the initial simulated LAI value. In the later growth stages, most
    of the model ensemble members (48/50) showed higher simulated LAI values than
    the initial simulated LAI value, indicating that data assimilation can significantly
    affect the magnitude of LAI values. After the fourth assimilation in the N3 treatment,
    all simulated LAI values in the model ensemble were improved, and after the fifth
    assimilation, most members of the model ensemble had LAI values greater than the
    initial simulated LAI value. The assimilated LAI value in the N3 treatment was
    smaller than that in the N2 treatment due to the influence of the observed LAI
    value from remote sensing, but it was still greater than that in the CK and N1
    treatments. After five data assimilation cycles, the model ensemble''s average
    yield is close to the field measured yield, which are CK: 6608 kg ha−1 (6672 kg
    ha−1), N1: 7156 kg ha−1 (7224 kg ha−1), N2: 7469 kg ha−1 (7664 kg ha−1), and N3:
    7346 kg ha−1 (7325 kg ha−1), compared with the initial simulated yield of 7000
    kg ha−1, indicating high prediction ability of the assimilated model. The RMSE
    and RE values have significantly decreased after data assimilation. The RMSE values
    are CK: 109.0 kg ha−1 (339.7 kg ha−1), N1: 96.4 kg ha−1 (234.2 kg ha−1), N2: 206.5
    kg ha−1 (668.0 kg ha−1), and N3: 80.9 kg ha−1 (334.2 kg ha−1), respectively. The
    RE values are CK: 1.0 % (4.9 %), N1: 0.9 % (3.1 %), N2: 2.5 % (8.6 %), and N3:
    0.3 % (4.4 %), respectively. These values indicate that the difference between
    the simulated and measured yield after assimilation is small, and the simulation
    accuracy is significantly improved. Fig. 7 showed that the denser part of the
    black curve roughly represented the mean value of simulated LAI in the model ensemble.
    It was observed that the simulated LAI in the model ensemble was affected by the
    assimilation algorithm. In the case when the remote sensing observation LAI value
    was smaller than the initial simulated LAI value (CK), it caused the LAI value
    of the simulated ensemble to decrease, making the final mean value of simulated
    LAI smaller than the initial LAI value, and thus the simulated yield of the model
    ensemble was also smaller than the initial yield. When the remotely observed LAI
    was larger than the initial LAI (N1, N2, N3), the ensemble Kalman filtering algorithm
    could make the simulated LAI mean value within the model ensemble lie on top of
    the initial LAI value. At the same time, the magnitude of the remotely observed
    LAI value also influenced the magnitude of the final simulated LAI mean value
    of the ensemble, and the difference in the magnitude of the remotely observed
    LAI value also had a significant effect on the simulated LAI mean value within
    the final model ensemble. The difference in the size of the remotely sensed LAI
    values also affected the size of the simulated mean LAI values within the final
    model ensemble, and such an effect was transmitted to the simulated yield changes
    through the changes in LAI values. The simulated yield means of the final model
    ensemble also changed, and the yields of the simulated LAI values within the model
    ensemble that were smaller than the initial simulated LAI values were smaller
    than the initial simulated yields. The treatment N2 that had the largest remotely
    sensed LAI values had the largest simulated yields of the final assimilated simulations,
    and the remotely sensed LAI size corresponded to the size of the assimilated simulated
    yield, indicating that the application of the ensemble Kalman filtering algorithm
    could achieve the purpose of assimilating remote sensing data to improve the accuracy
    of yield simulation. 3.2.4. Sensitivity of assimilation timing on the yield after
    assimilation Through the analysis of the previous section''s assimilation results,
    it is apparent that data assimilation''s impact on the simulated LAI values of
    the model ensemble varies at different times. The first three data assimilations
    had little effect on the simulated LAI yield of the model ensemble, as reflected
    by the denser black curve in the figure. Conversely, the latter two assimilations
    had a more substantial impact on the simulated LAI value of the model ensemble,
    and the black curve had a more pronounced mutation. Therefore, this section aims
    to explore the sensitivity of assimilation at different times to the final yield.
    The five remote sensing observation data can be arranged and combined to produce
    31 assimilation methods that vary according to different assimilation times, as
    shown in Fig. 8. When only one data assimilation is considered, the relative errors
    of the yields obtained through the two assimilation methods on September 6 and
    September 21, 2019, are both low, with an RMSE of 344.1 kg ha−1 and 353.9 kg ha−1,
    respectively. For the methods that involve selecting two remote sensing observation
    data for data assimilation, the assimilation of the remote sensing observation
    data collected on September 6 and September 21, 2019 yields the smallest relative
    error among all the assimilation methods using two remote sensing data, with a
    value of only 2.91 %, and an RMSE of 233.2 kg ha−1. As for the methods that use
    three remote sensing observation data for data assimilation, the smallest RMSE
    of 199.8 kg ha−1 and a relative error of only 2.45 % were obtained through the
    assimilation of the remote sensing data collected on August 15, September 6, and
    September 21, 2019. Additionally, the simulated yield obtained by assimilating
    the remote sensing data of July 31, September 6, and September 21, 2019, also
    shows a small relative error of 2.62 % and an RMSE of 212.2 kg ha−1. When assimilating
    four remote sensing data, the simulated yields of the other three methods are
    close to the actual yields, except for the two methods involving data assimilation
    on September 6 and September 21, 2019. The results of the method that assimilates
    all five remote sensing data are consistent with the previous section and will

    based on historical meteorological data 3.3.1. Data assimilation of WOFOST model
    and remote sensing LAI inversion based on historical meteorological data The use
    of crop models for yield prediction faces a major challenge due to the absence
    of future meteorological data. To address this problem, this study selected historical
    years spanning from 1985 to 2017 and extracted meteorological data during the
    summer corn growing season for each year. Various data assimilation techniques
    were applied to combine the historical meteorological data with the real-time
    meteorological data and produce the meteorological input files required for the
    model. With an increase in the number of assimilation iterations, the proportion
    of real-time meteorological data in the synthesized meteorological data also increased.
    The synthetic meteorological data generated from the assimilation dates included
    the real-time meteorological data. For instance, in the Yangling district of Shaanxi
    Province where this study was conducted, the summer corn planting time in 2019
    was on June 13th, and the first remote sensing observation data was produced on
    July 16th. At this point, the meteorological data from June 13th to July 16th
    in the historical year was replaced with known meteorological data. The model
    commenced running from the planting date and went through the first data assimilation
    on July 16th. Subsequently, the model continued to run until the harvest period,
    with the necessary meteorological data being replaced by historical meteorological
    data, resulting in one assimilation prediction outcome. When the second remote
    sensing assimilation data became available (July 31st), the meteorological data
    from June 13th to July 31st was used to replace the corresponding meteorological
    data in the historical year, and the model went through two data assimilations
    on July 16th and July 31st respectively, running until the harvest period. This
    process continued until all observation data were assimilated. The historical
    meteorological data utilized in this study was collected from the Yangling Meteorological
    Station from 1985 to 2017 and encompassed 33 years, including sunshine duration,
    maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and water vapor pressure.
    The crop yield prediction scheme is based on the assimilation of summer maize
    LAI data obtained from remote sensing. The scheme involves five remote sensing
    observation data acquired from July 16 to September 21, which results in five
    predicted yield values. The yield predictions are obtained for each assimilation
    from July 16 until the end of the model, which occurs after the completion of
    all five assimilations. The synthetic meteorological data required for the model
    is generated by combining real-time meteorological data with 33 years of historical
    meteorological data. Each assimilation results in a set of yields consisting of
    33 values. Fig. 9 illustrates the process of generating synthetic meteorological
    data. Download : Download high-res image (149KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Flowchart of data assimilation of WOFOST model combined with historical
    meteorological data and remote sensing inversion of LAI. To allow batch operation
    of the model, five meteorological files were synthesized, each containing 33 years
    of data compiled based on the assimilation scheme. For specifying sowing dates
    for each year, this study utilized YAML-format field management files. As yield
    prediction was the objective, the actual maturity period of crops in each historical
    year determined the harvest date. To enhance the running efficiency of the code,
    two loops were embedded in the Python language environment of the model, implementing
    a double loop based on year and assimilation times. The yield of 33 years for
    different treatments and assimilation schemes was organized and outputted into
    an Excel file using the Pandas package after the model ran. Some code snippets
    are in the appendices. The most critical aspect of constructing the yield prediction
    program is to modify the field management code. In the original code, three placeholders
    {crop_start_date}, {crop_sowing_date}, and {crop_harvest_date} respectively represent
    the start date of crop simulation, the crop sowing date, and the crop harvest
    date. To obtain 33 years of field management parameters from 1985 to 2017, the
    simulation start date, crop sowing date, and crop harvest date for each year were
    set as June 1st, June 13th, and October 10th, respectively, using for loop statements.
    The print() statement was used to confirm the correctness of the field management
    data for each year. Finally, the field management data for each year was written
    into the model, and the field management section of the yield prediction program
    was constructed. 3.3.2. Yield forecast results Fig. 10(a) to 11(d) depict the
    predicted yield results of CK, N1, N2 and N3 treatments, respectively. The yield
    distribution in all treatments does not converge with increasing assimilation
    time. The predicted yield ensemble on August 15 exhibits the largest dispersion
    among all treatments, with the greatest difference between the upper and lower
    limits for the yield prediction ensemble on July 16. However, as assimilation
    time progresses, the predicted yield ensemble gradually converges after August
    15, and the predicted yield value on September 6 is the closest to the actual
    measurement. The final predicted yield ensemble exhibits a more concentrated distribution
    than before. Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download : Download full-size

    yield prediction results with data assimilation display a mean value that gradually

    yield prediction results without data assimilation exhibit no apparent pattern.
    Therefore, data assimilation can effectively rectify errors that occur when synthesized
    meteorological data is used to run the model, resulting in more precise yield
    predictions. Download : Download high-res image (154KB) Download : Download full-size

    in 2019. The coefficient of variation of yield ensembles and the relative error
    between predicted and actual yields for different assimilation schemes under each
    treatment are presented in Table 7. Under all treatments, the coefficient of variation
    is minimized after five assimilation cycles, followed by the coefficient of variation
    for the yield ensemble on September 6th, while the differences in the coefficient
    of variation for the yield ensembles among the other three assimilation schemes
    are not significant. The predicted yield of the five assimilation schemes with
    assimilation of LAI under the CK treatment is 6696, 6988, 6995, 6834, and 6398
    kg ha−1, and the prediction results with the smallest relative error is on September
    6th with an error of 2.44 %. For the N1 treatment with assimilation of LAI, the
    predicted yield of the five assimilation schemes is 7063, 7071, 7111, 7292, and
    6854 kg ha−1, and the prediction result with the smallest relative error is also
    on September 6th with an error of 0.94 %. Likewise, under the N2 treatment with
    assimilation, the predicted yield of the five assimilation schemes is 7105, 7138,

    error is also on September 6th with an error of 0.84 %. Finally, under the N3
    treatment with assimilation, the predicted yield of the five assimilation schemes
    is 7087, 7101, 7142, 7446, and 7034 kg ha−1, and the prediction result with the
    highest accuracy is on September 6th with an error of 1.93 %. Table 7. Coefficient

    CK, no fertilizer application; N1, 105 kg N ha−1; N2, 210 kg N ha−1; N3, 315 kg
    N ha−1. A comparison of the variation coefficients and relative errors for different
    assimilation times in Table 7 reveals a trend of decreasing variation coefficients
    for the yield prediction ensembles under each treatment as time progresses. Specifically,
    the variation coefficient of the yield prediction ensemble under the CK treatment
    decreases from 15.69 on July 16 to 6.90 on September 21, with the smallest variation
    coefficient among all treatments at the latter date. The N1, N2, and N3 treatments
    show similar patterns of gradually decreasing variation coefficients over time.
    The variation coefficients for the three times from July 16th to August 15th slightly
    decrease, while the variation coefficient for September 6th decreases the most
    compared to the previous time, followed by the variation coefficient for September
    21st. However, there are no significant differences in variation coefficients
    among the three treatments at each predicted time. The decrease in variation coefficients
    for the yield prediction ensembles implies that the yield prediction result on
    September 6 is relatively ideal, consistent with the analysis results mentioned
    above. 4. Discussion 4.1. Inversion of LAI using UAV multispectral remote sensing
    data The LAI inversion results under each treatment indicated a trend of increasing
    first and then decreasing during the entire observation period. The LAI reached
    its maximum value on August 15, 2019, as the growth and development process advanced.
    The N2 treatment showed the largest LAI among all treatments. During the late
    stage of growth, leaf senescence led to a gradual decrease in the LAI. An increase
    in nitrogen application rate led to an increase in the LAI for both the N1 and
    N2 treatments. The LAI was higher under the N3 treatment compared to the CK and
    N1 treatments, but lower than that under the N2 treatment. The CK treatment resulted
    in the smallest LAI, while the N2 treatment showed the most significant increase
    compared to the CK treatment. The study found that nitrogen application treatments
    can increase the LAI of summer maize, but excessive nitrogen fertilizer application
    cannot sustainably increase the LAI. This finding is consistent with previous
    studies (Lu et al., 2021), where excessive nitrogen fertilizer application reduced
    light transmittance in the canopy, resulting in premature senescence of the lower
    leaves, and ultimately decreasing the LAI content. Dandan et al. (2020) found
    that NDVI can be used to analyze the dynamics of LAI during crop growth by measuring
    the difference between the near-infrared band and the red band, further analysis
    revealed that the modeling and inversion results of the LAI-NDVI model were better
    in the CK, N1, and N3 treatments, but the R2 of the LAI-NDVI model decreased under
    the N2 treatment. This could be attributed to the larger LAI of summer corn under
    the N2 treatment, which increased vegetation cover and made the NDVI too sensitive
    to the red band. The strong absorption of chlorophyll resulted in the rapid saturation
    of the red band, which made the NDVI index insensitive to larger vegetation indices
    when the coverage reached a certain degree (Wan et al., 2020). Moreover, the predicted
    values of the LAI-NDVI model in each treatment were lower than the measured values,
    which may have been influenced by this factor. Additionally, the threshold segmentation
    method was employed to remove the environmental background in the remote sensing
    image, which may have resulted in poor modeling results of the other three indices
    compared to the LAI. It is known that the environmental background significantly
    affects the inversion of crop canopy information, and the soil-adjusted vegetation
    index and its derived vegetation indices (SAVI, MSAVI2, and OSAVI) were developed
    to reduce this impact. At the plot level, spectral information includes both vegetation
    and its environmental background, which arises from the interaction between the
    two. Removing the environmental background may affect the spectral information''s
    integrity and, thus, the relationship between vegetation indices and leaf area
    indices. 4.2. Evaluation at different assimilation time windows A literature review
    of 31 yield simulation methods showed that the assimilation of three remote sensing
    data points on August 15, September 6, and September 21, 2019, resulted in significant
    improvements in simulation accuracy and changes in simulated yield. Surprisingly,
    the accuracy of yield simulation even exceeded that of assimilating all remote
    sensing data. This could be attributed to the fact that these dates correspond
    to the critical stage of yield formation for summer maize, where an increase in
    the LAI leads to a direct increase in yield. Ge et al. (2022) found similar results
    in their study, indicating that assimilating LAI during the crop''s nutritional
    growth stage can improve yield estimation accuracy. Additionally, this study introduced
    nitrogen fertilizer gradients, and nitrogen fertilizer significantly contributes
    to crop growth and development during the early stages (De Souza et al., 2022),
    promoting maize to absorb more nutrients during the elongation stage. Furthermore,
    Xie et al. (2017) compared the yield estimation performance of different assimilation
    strategies during various growth stages of winter wheat, finding that assimilating
    remote sensing-derived LAI achieved the highest yield estimation accuracy during
    the jointing and heading stages. In the standard analytical equation of the ensemble
    Kalman filtering algorithm, the Kalman gain K was influenced by the size of the
    covariance matrix of the observation matrix as well as the forecast matrix. The
    size of K directly affected the size of the LAI ensemble of the input model after
    assimilation. It was observed from Fig. 8(f) that, in the absence of any assimilation,
    the size of the simulated LAI in the model ensemble reached its maximum value
    during the fertility period before the LAI reached its peak. At this point, the
    curve was more concentrated, indicating a smaller variance of the forecast matrix.
    Consequently, the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm, after comparing the variance
    of the observation matrix with that of the forecast matrix, produced an assimilated
    LAI ensemble that was more numerically biased toward the LAI of the forecast matrix
    (the simulated LAI of the model ensemble). As the model advanced to the point
    where the LAI reached its maximum value, the variance of the forecast matrix increased,
    surpassing that of the observation matrix. At this time, the assimilated LAI ensemble
    produced by the Kalman filter''s standard analytical equation became numerically
    more biased toward the LAI of the observation matrix. This phenomenon could be
    illustrated in Fig. 8(d) and 8(e), where the first three assimilations did not
    have much effect on the simulated LAI values of the model ensemble, and there
    was no obvious mutation of the black curves in the graphs. However, in the fourth
    and fifth assimilations, there was a significant change in the simulated LAI of
    the model ensemble, with the assimilated LAI being numerically closer to the remotely
    sensed LAI. The black curves in Fig. 8(a) to Fig. 8(e) showed a significant increase
    in the LAI value after the fourth and fifth assimilations. Therefore, to enhance
    yield estimation accuracy, it is crucial to incorporate crop parameters into the
    crop model during the optimal assimilation time window. The assimilation timing
    should prioritize remote sensing data during the flowering to filling stage of
    summer maize, as the assimilation effect of remote sensing data reduces during
    the maturation stage. If the remote sensing data is limited, the remote sensing
    data during the reproductive growth stage of summer maize should be given priority
    for assimilation. Additionally, remote sensing data with at least three assimilation
    times must be selected while choosing the assimilation number. 4.3. Summer maize
    yield prediction based on historical meteorological data and data assimilation
    In contrast, this study integrates historical meteorological data, UAV remote
    sensing, and crop models to predict yield. The historical meteorological data
    resolves the problem of unknown meteorological data in the future, while the remote
    sensing observation benefits are leveraged to dynamically correct the simulated
    values with the data assimilation method, bringing them closer to the observed
    values. Comparing the predicted yields of four different LAI assimilation methods,
    we found that all five assimilation methods produced good accuracy, with a relative
    error of less than 5 %. The yields obtained from the four assimilation methods
    were more accurate than those obtained from the first three methods, with the
    smallest relative error in predicted yield and a smaller coefficient of variation
    in yield ensemble. This indicated that prediction accuracy improves with an increase
    in the number of assimilation times, which aligns with the findings of Guo et
    al. (2019). This phenomenon occurred because the proportion of known meteorological
    data in the synthetic meteorological data increased with the number of assimilations,
    reducing the uncertainty caused by meteorological factors on crop growth and leading
    to more accurate predicted yields. The second aspect pertained to the remote sensing
    observations conducted during the summer maize filling period, characterized by
    more frequent occurrences of the four assimilations compared to the preceding
    three. This interval held paramount significance for the accumulation of grain
    material and the ultimate yield development in summer maize (Chen et al., 2023).
    During this phase, more than half of the organic matter synthesized by photosynthetic
    organs was directly channeled into storage organs. Subsequently, photosynthetic
    products were transported to the kernels, yielding improvements in kernel weight
    and resulting in increased yields (Zhang et al., 2022). At the same time, the
    leaf area of the summer maize population no longer changed significantly during
    this period, and the influence of meteorological factors on crop yield gradually
    diminished. As a result, following the fourth assimilation, the simulated LAI
    of the model exhibited a closer alignment with the actual crop growth LAI, leading
    to assimilated yield predictions that approached actual yields. Despite yielding
    the least coefficient of variation across the yield ensemble following five assimilation
    times under each treatment, the accuracy of yield prediction was lower compared
    to that observed after four assimilation times. This might be attributed to the
    fact that the period after the fifth assimilation was not the end of the simulation,
    and historical meteorological data was still used until the harvest. Due to interannual
    differences in meteorological data, the model''s simulations may deviate, leading
    to increased uncertainty in yield simulation and influencing agricultural decision-making
    (Chen and Tao, 2022). This also indicated that there may be limitations on the
    number of remote sensing assimilation times. To achieve more accurate yield predictions,
    further optimization of model structure and assimilation methods was required.
    Yield prediction results were accompanied by a certain probability due to the
    unknown nature of meteorological data, rather than a fixed value. However, we
    must also acknowledge that selecting historical meteorological data profoundly
    impacted crop model prediction results, and generating appropriate meteorological
    data was crucial for yield prediction accuracy. Meteorological data exhibited
    typical features in both time and space, leading to distinguishable climate conditions
    in different regions or the same region in different years. Using multi-year historical
    meteorological data as synthetic meteorological data for yield prediction, with
    years exhibiting large differences in annual patterns, can result in significant
    errors in yield prediction and uneven distribution of essential meteorological
    elements such as precipitation or sunshine hours during the summer corn growing
    period. To tackle this problem, some researchers have employed cluster analysis
    to select years with similar meteorological factors to the target year for meteorological
    data synthesis, resulting in improved yield prediction results (Chen et al., 2017).
    Nonetheless, known historical meteorological data was limited, and systematic
    meteorological observations began after 1953 in most locations, limiting the yield
    prediction results using this approach. 4.4. Prospect we employed an empirical
    approach to investigate the inversion of LAI from UAV remote sensing data. We
    constructed empirical LAI models based on empirical relationships between field-measured
    LAI observations and remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices. These observational
    LAI prediction models are significantly influenced by crop type. However, regional
    scales often encompass multiple crop species, making it challenging to adapt a
    single field-scale LAI-Vegetation Index (VI) relationship to diverse regions.
    To address this challenge, some researchers assimilated multiple variables (including
    crop phenology, vegetation temperature condition index, and solar radiation) by
    integrating them into the model (Manivasagam and Rozenstein, 2020). This increased
    the linkage between remotely sensed observations and mechanistic crop models,
    and corrected the model with the help of high-quality auxiliary information collected
    in situ (e.g., in situ LAI measurements). They used regression models to link
    remotely sensed data and field measurements to form a regional effectiveness model
    (Rozenstein et al., 2019). Furthermore, some researchers proposed using big data
    analysis to run a large number of model simulations simultaneously to account
    for a variety of scenarios. Lobell et al. (2015) proposed a scalable crop yield
    mapping (SCYM) algorithm that uses multiple crop model simulations to train a
    multiple regression model between yield and crop/weather variables. Through multiple
    simulations, SCYM takes into account various realistic combinations of weather
    conditions, soil types, and field operations (e.g., planting date, fertilizer
    application) for a given area. In this study, we combined a field crop model with
    UAV remote sensing technology and a sequential assimilation algorithm based on
    historical meteorological data to predict summer maize yields. However, acquiring
    crop yield information at the farmland scale presents challenges for sustainable
    agricultural management and national food security assessment. UAV remote sensing
    technology, though valuable, is constrained by limited coverage area, lack of
    regional-scale data availability, and high acquisition costs, impeding timely
    and accurate regional-scale yield data acquisition. To address this, upgrading
    crop yield prediction from the field scale to the regional scale can be achieved
    by adopting a regional division approach. This involves simulating regional division
    to divide and combine large areas into smaller regions with relatively consistent
    crop growth characteristics and environments. Researchers divided simulation zones
    based on soil properties, soil zoning maps, field measurements, and the spatial
    distribution of NDVI and yield data (Guo et al., 2018), using different models
    to simulate spatial crop yields. They found that simulation zoning can effectively
    address the spatialized use of crop growth models. We can join the Agricultural
    Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP; Rosenzweig et al., 2013)
    project for crop yield prediction after dividing the simulation zones. This involves
    comparing crop models at various scales accumulated in the AGMIP project and integrating
    related data and field-scale, high-precision remote sensing data acquired by UAVs.
    Selected crop models are calibrated, and the most suitable model is selected to
    simulate and predict crop yields in small regions based on assessment results.
    Ultimately, small-region yield data are integrated into large-region scales by
    determining the weights of the large region accounted for by small regions and
    using weighted averaging. This provides support for farmland management measures
    and optimized allocation of resources, as well as assessment of agricultural risks.
    5. Conclusions This study was based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral
    remote sensing data and the WOFOST model. UAV remote sensing-derived vegetation
    indices were used to invert the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of summer maize in the experimental
    area, and a high correlation was found between NDVI and LAI, with a good determination
    coefficient for the LAI-NDVI regression model. The measured values and predicted
    values obtained after validation showed a strong correlation. By calibrating the
    main parameters of the model using crop and soil data from the Northwest Agriculture
    and Forestry University Irrigation Experiment Station, the consistency index “d”
    for various validation indicators was greater than 0.9, and the normalized root
    mean square error “nRMSE” was less than 30 %, making the model suitable for simulating
    summer maize growth in the region. The ensemble Kalman filter algorithm was used
    to assimilate remote sensing data with the WOFOST model based on the differences
    in LAI under different treatments. Different LAI values had varying effects on
    the model''s final simulated yield, and the accuracy of yield simulation improved
    for all assimilation treatments, indicating that remote sensing data assimilation
    effectively corrected the model''s yield simulation results. The study also analyzed
    the influence of different assimilation frequencies and assimilation periods on
    yield simulation, revealing that the optimal assimilation frequency should be
    at least three times, and assimilating during the flowering to filling stage of
    summer maize resulted in better yield simulation results. Finally, the ensemble
    Kalman filter algorithm was used to assimilate current remote sensing observation
    data with 33 years of historical meteorological data from the Yangling Meteorological
    Station to predict crop yield. Under different treatments, the relative error
    between predicted and measured yield was less than 5 %. The yield prediction on
    September 6th showed higher accuracy compared to predictions from other dates,
    with N1 and N2 treatments having relative errors less than 1 %. As the prediction
    time progressed, the coefficient of variation of yield predictions gradually decreased,
    with the CK treatment on September 21st having the smallest coefficient of variation
    at 0.69. For further research on yield prediction, high-precision meteorological
    forecasts can be used to fill in unknown meteorological data, creating a three-part
    composite meteorological data, “measured data + short-term high-precision meteorological
    forecast + historical meteorological data,” to drive the crop model and improve
    the accuracy and timeliness of yield predictions. CRediT authorship contribution

    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    irrigation efficiency. Furrow and drip irrigation [75] Demonstrated AI modelling
    for optimizing green roof irrigation by adapting watering schedules based on evolving
    environmental conditions. Sprinkler irrigation [76] Utilized AI to estimate drip

    regulation of agro-hydrological systems using zone model predictive control. Proposed

    Things in smart irrigation IoT refers to the network of devices, sensors, and
    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation
    in sub-saharan africa Infrastructure limitations and access to technology One
    of the significant constraints in leveraging Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa is the limited infrastructure and lack
    of access to technology [111,112]. Many rural areas in the region lack reliable
    electricity supply, internet connectivity, and adequate communication networks
    necessary for the seamless functioning of smart irrigation systems. The absence
    of basic infrastructure hampers the deployment and operation of advanced technologies
    such as sensors, IoT devices, and cloud computing platforms. Additionally, the
    high cost of technology acquisition and maintenance further restricts the access
    and adoption of 4IR solutions for smart irrigation in the region. Governance and
    policy challenges Governance and policy challenges pose significant obstacles
    to the effective utilization of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation in sub-Saharan
    Africa [111,113,114]. Fragmented regulatory frameworks, and a lack of coordination
    among different stakeholders hinder the integration of these technologies into
    existing irrigation systems. The absence of clear guidelines on data management,
    privacy, and security also creates uncertainties and inhibits the widespread adoption
    of 4IR technologies. It is crucial to establish comprehensive governance frameworks
    and supportive policies that address data governance, privacy concerns, interoperability
    standards, and institutional coordination to facilitate the successful implementation
    of smart irrigation systems. Regulatory frameworks and safety Considerations regarding

    Explore all metrics Abstract Canopy temperature (Tc) measurements are increasingly
    being used to compute crop thermal indices for water stress estimation and improved
    irrigation management. Conventionally monitoring crop thermal response requires
    maintenance of a well-watered crop from which non-stressed canopy temperature
    (Tcns) is measured as a reference for thermal index computation. This study alternatively
    evaluated the performance of 36 weather data driven model combinations to predict
    peak time (12:00–17:00 h) Tcns in maize grown in semi-arid climates at the West
    Central Research, Extension, and Education Center (WCREEC) in North Platte, NE,
    and at the Limited Irrigation Research Farm (LIRF) in Greeley, CO. Data-driven
    models considered were multilinear regression (MLR), forward feed neural network
    (NN), recurrent neural network (RNN), multivariate adoptive regression splines
    (MARS), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN). For each of these models,
    the following weather data combinations were tested: average air temperature (Ta),
    average relative humidity (RH), wind speed (U2), and solar radiation (Rs) (combination

    systems in eastern Australia Article 11 March 2018 Introduction Maize (Zea mays
    L.) is a key global cash and food grain crop with over 1,137 million (M) metric
    tons grown on 202 M ha worldwide from 2010 to 2020 (FAOSTAT 2021). Since the crop
    is significantly utilized for human consumption, industrial biofuel production,
    and animal feed manufacturing (Ranum et al. 2014; Song et al. 2019), its global
    production from 2013 is required to rise by 60% to meet projected consumptive
    requirements in 2050 (Daryanto et al. 2016). Current uncertainties in global precipitation
    patterns as well dwindling surface and ground water resources are, however, straining
    crop grain production, maize inclusive (Tigchelaar et al. 2018). Specifically,
    peak season water stress in maize can result in reduced biomass, hamper photosynthetic
    activity, and reduce kernel weight (Ge et al. 2012; Song et al. 2019). Meeting
    the global water requirements for grain production, therefore, necessitates innovative
    and sustainable crop water management strategies which cater for continuity in
    produce supply while conserving the existing water resources and surrounding environment.
    Soil water deficit (SWD), i.e., the amount of water required to bring the soil
    water back to field capacity, and crop evapotranspiration (ET) demands are the
    main influencers of irrigation requirement and key indicators of crop water stress.
    Monitoring of these two parameters (SWD and ET) as well as directly measuring
    crop response to water deficits are a step forward in understanding and curbing
    water related crop stress. A variety of techniques exist to monitor and/or quantify
    water stress in plants. These crop water stress measurement techniques include
    soil moisture measurement to quantify SWD (Evett et al. 2012); quantification
    of ET (Allen et al. 2005); crop physiological responses to water deficits which
    includes sap flow (Han et al. 2018; Jones 2004), stem diameter (Corell et al.
    2014; Ginestar and Castel 1998), and crop canopy temperature measurement (CCTM)
    (DeJonge et al. 2015; Irmak et al. 2000; Lena et al. 2020; Nakabuye et al. 2022).
    With recent technological advancements, the CCTM is increasingly becoming a front
    runner in crop water stress measurement and management, especially since this
    non-destructive method can characterize the spatial and temporal aspects of measured
    crop areas of interest. Spatial representation by CCTM methods is possible when
    using satellite imagery or thermal sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles
    (Ihuoma and Madramootoo 2017; Panday et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2021), ground-based
    sensing platforms (Katimbo et al. 2022), as well as mounting sensors on mobile
    irrigation systems (Bhatti et al. 2022; Colaizzi et al. 2019; Stone et al. 2020).
    Additionally, continuous temporal data sets can be obtained from measurements
    made with stationary sensors (DeJonge et al. 2015; Katimbo et al. 2022) or using
    scaling techniques to characterize diurnal canopy temperature (Tc) patterns in
    areas of interest (Peters and Evett 2004). Crop thermal data are often translated
    into thermal indices which are indicators of the crop water stress level and are
    metrics used to define the irrigation watering schedule. Commonly used indices
    include the empirically computed crop water stress index (CWSI) (Jackson et al.
    1981; Idso et al. 1981) which normalizes the canopy temperature response to prevailing
    weather conditions. More recently, simplified thermal indices like the degrees
    above non-stressed (DANS) index and the Integrated Degrees Above Non-Stressed
    (IDANS) have also been utilized to characterize crop water stress (DeJonge et
    al. 2015; Kullberg et al. 2017; Nakabuye et al. 2022; Taghvaeian et al. 2014)
    However the computation of these CCTM-thermal indices requires the maintenance
    of a non-stressed canopy whose temperature measurements are utilized to empirically
    compute the indices (DeJonge et al. 2015; King et al. 2020; Kumar et al. 2020a,
    b; Nanda et al. 2018; Payero and Irmak 2005). This maintenance of a non-stressed
    canopy is in many ways impractical for producers and researcher alike due to production
    cost limitations of associated inputs as well as observational time and effort
    required to fully water a reference location for a given crop. Continued adoption
    of CCTM-based thermal indices for crop stress detection, therefore, necessitates
    alternative methods to quantify the non-stressed canopy temperature (Tcns). Payero
    and Irmak (2005) proposed computing of the empirical Tcns using a multilinear
    regression (MLR) with weather and plant input parameters reporting R2 values of
    0.84 and 0.69 for maize and soybean lower baselines, respectively. King and Shellie
    (2014) also utilized MLR models with weather input variables to estimate the Tcns
    in wine grape varieties which resulted in R2 values of 0.90 and 0.84 for Syrah
    and Malbec varieties, respectively. The application of MLR methods to estimate
    Tcns however assumes and limits the relation between Tcns and input variables
    to linearity. This assumption of linearity might not necessarily be the case given
    the complex nature of commonly used input weather parameter and plant canopy temperature
    responses. Alternative computational methods that can characterize complex non-linear
    responses of Tcns to input variables should be explored, such as machine learning
    models and algorithms. Additionally, identification of key weather-based model
    input parameters to quantify Tcns could contribute to monitoring of crop water
    stress in areas with limited access to comprehensive climate datasets. Ascertaining
    weather data combinations that are suitable for Tcns modeling requires assessment
    of model performance with selected inputs. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are
    able to accurately synthesize large sets of complex data and discern embedded
    patterns to identify trends within shorter timeframes in comparison to traditional
    programming techniques. Machine learning models have extensively been used to
    investigate and predict crop related parameters such as ET, soil water, yield,
    weed infestation, crop quality, and crop disease (Benos et al. 2021; Liakos et
    al. 2018; Meshram et al. 2021). King et al. (2021) and King et al. (2020) reported
    that a neural network (NN) model had better performance statistics (correlation
    coefficient = 0.88) when used to predict Tcns in sugar beet compared to linear
    regression modeling. In two wine grape varieties, King and Shellie (2016) also
    reported correlation coefficients of 0.93 and 0.89 for NN-based Tcns compared
    to correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.84 when Tcns was modeled using MLR.
    Exploration of alternative ML algorithms besides NNs particularly in maize Tcns
    computation could provide more computationally robust solutions that will reduce
    reliance in maintaining a physical non-stressed crop canopy. The objectives of
    this study were, therefore, to (i) evaluate field observed and conventional MLR
    technique of computing non-stressed canopy temperature against non-conventional
    data driven models (i.e., MARS, NN, RF, KNN and, RNN) with various weather data
    combinations across semi-arid climatic regions, (ii) identify key weather parameter
    combinations that drive modeled Tcns values under semi-arid climatic conditions
    in mid-western United States, and (iii) determine accuracy of Tcns prediction
    models when generalized across semi-arid regions in the mid-western United States.
    Materials and methods Experiment site design, data collection, and instrumentation
    WCREEC site details Maize (Zea mays L.) variety Pioneer 1197 AMT (Corteva Agriscience,
    Wilmington, Delaware, USA) was grown from 2018 to 2020 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s
    West Central Research, Extension, and Education Center (WCREEC) in North Platte,
    Nebraska, USA (latitude 41.1°N, longitude 100.8°W, at an elevation of 861 m above
    sea level). The soil type at the site is classified as a Cozad silt loam (Fluventic
    Haplustoll) while the experiment was setup as a randomized complete block design
    (RCBD) which comprised of four blocks. These experimental blocks consisted of
    nine treatments four of which were equipped with infrared thermometer (IRT) sensors
    namely: rainfed treatment (RFT), deficit irrigated treatment (DIT), fully irrigated
    treatment (FIT), and canopy temperature-based irrigation treatment (CTT). Each
    of the 9 m by 72 m experiment plots was irrigated by a subsurface drip (SDI) system
    drip tape (T-Tape, TSX 515-12-340) spaced at 1.52 m and installed at a depth of
    0.4 m in every other crop row. The planting and harvest dates, respectively, were
    April 27 and October 29 in 2018; May 13 and November 7 in 2019, and April 29 and
    October 30 in 2020. Urea–ammonia–nitrate (UAN 32%) was applied pre and post planting
    based on laboratory (Ward Laboratories, Kearney, NE, USA) measured soil residual
    nitrogen measurements (Shapiro et al. 2019). LIRF site details The plots at the
    USDA-ARS Limited Irrigation Research Farm (LIRF) in Greeley, Colorado, USA (latitude
    40°N, longitude 104°W, at an elevation of 1427 m above sea level) were 9 m by
    43 m designed under a RCBD with four replications. The plots consisted of 12 plant
    rows with 0.76 m spacing between the rows. Crop irrigation during the experiment
    years was done by a pressurized surface drip irrigation system which consisted
    of 16 mm tubing with in-line emitter spaced 30 cm apart. The LIRF experiment had
    12 treatments which were based on percentage of crop evapotranspiration (ET) requirements
    at key growth stages during vegetative and maturity crop phases. These irrigation
    application targeted combinations ranged from 40 to 100% of ET requirements at
    either the vegetative or maturity stages with the least amount of 40% maximum
    ET at both vegetative and maturity stages (40/40% treatment) and the maximum application
    of 100% maximum ET at both the vegetative and maturity stages (100/100% treatment).
    Maize at the LIRF site was planted on May 7, June 3, and May 5 in 2014, 2015,
    and 2016, respectively, and harvest was on November 4, November 30, and November
    1 in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The agronomic practices including fertilizer
    application were done uniformly on the study site following recommendations in
    literature and site history. Weather data The North Platte 3SW Beta weather station
    (Nebraska Mesonet network, https://mesonet.unl.edu) was used to measure weather
    variables at the WCREEC study site while at the LIRF study site weather data sets
    were collected from the GLY04 station (CoAgMet Weather Station Network, www.coagmet.com).
    The WCREEC site lies in the transition zone of humid to semi-arid climate and
    is classified as semi-arid, while the LIRF site lies in the transition zone from
    semi-arid to arid climate and is also classified as semi-arid based on historical
    climate data averages. The daily parameters measured at the study sites during
    the experiment years included maximum temperature (Tamax), minimum temperature
    (Tamin), average temperature (Ta), maximum relative humidity (RHmax), minimum
    relative humidity (RHmin), wind speed at 3 m height (U3) which was converted to
    wind speed at 2 m height (U2) (Allen et al. 1998), and solar radiation (Rs). Three
    year weather datasets from each study site were utilized in the analysis and the
    years were 2014, 2015, and 2016 at LIRF and 2018, 2019, and 2020 at WCREEC. Additionally,
    hourly weather data during the designated peak Rs period (12:00 to 17:00 central
    day time (CDT) or mountain time (MT) in North Platte and Greeley, respectively)
    were used as inputs in the selected predictive models to estimate Tcns and the
    hourly statistics of the selected variables across the two study sites are shown
    in Table 1. Table 1 The maximum, minimum, and mean ± standard deviation statistics

    SI-4HI and SI-1H1 model (Apogee Instruments Inc. UT, USA) infrared radiometer
    (IRT) sensors were installed in the RFT, DIT, FIT, and CTT treatment plots to
    measure canopy temperature (Tc) at the WCREEC site. Data from the IRT sensors
    were logged on CR1000 measurement and control data loggers (Campbell Scientific,
    Inc., UT) with readings taken every 6 s and averaged at 1 min time intervals.
    Three replications of IRT sensors were installed in the treatment plots in 2019
    and 2020, while in 2018 the CTT treatment had two IRT sensor replications. Data
    from the IRTs were utilized in computation after the crop canopy was at least
    80% of the full canopy and the sensors were installed 1 m from the sensed crop
    canopy, at a view angle of 45° relative to the plant canopies. Additionally, the
    IRT sensors were positioned in the northeast direction to optimally capture crop
    canopy that was lit by the sun. At the LIRF site, the canopy temperature measurements
    were taken using SI-121 model IRT sensors (Apogee Instruments, Inc., UT), which
    were logged using CR1000 measurement and control data loggers (Campbell Scientific,
    Inc., UT) and measurements were taken at 5 s intervals and averaged every 30 min.
    The LIRF IRT sensors were positioned at a viewing angle of 23° on the mounting
    posts and faced northeast towards the crop row (45°) to maximize viewing of the
    crop canopy. The IRT sensors were installed in all 12 treatments, with four replications
    each, and maintained at a height of 0.8 m above the crop canopy and measurements
    considered in analysis were taken after 80% canopy cover. The lowest hourly average
    temperature observed with in the peak Rs period, from the non-stressed irrigation
    water treatments were selected as the Tcns at both the WCREEC and LIRF sites and
    matched up with corresponding weather data. The datasets were filtered to remove
    cloudy days as these were assumed to not characterize thermal response under water
    stress conditions. Data driven models Continuous real-time measurement of Tcns
    for crop water stress management is cumbersome for both research and farm scenarios
    because it necessitates the constant maintenance of a well-watered crop throughout
    the growing season. In this study, six prediction models were used to predict
    Tcns as an alternative to field measurement of Tcns. The data driven prediction
    models were k-nearest neighbor (KNN), multivariate adoptive regression splines
    (MARS), multilinear regression model (MLR), forward feed neural network model
    (NN), random forest (RF), and recurrent neural network (RNN). Model details are
    explained below. The KNN is a memory-based learning algorithm which hypothesizes
    that comparable data points ought to have a similar classification system. The
    KNN algorithm, therefore, operates by computing the possibility that a data point
    belongs to a specified category by calculating the data point’s distance from
    neighbors, ‘k’ in the same input dataset (Ahmed et al. 2020; Mucherino et al.
    2009; Yamaç 2021). The method requires fewer hyperparameters to tune (k and the
    distance metric) and is therefore simple to apply for solving both classification
    and prediction problems. The MARS algorithm is non-parametric in nature and functions
    by fitting piecewise localized functions across non-linear dependent and independent
    model variables (Friedman 1991; Heddam 2021; Tramontana et al. 2016). The MARS
    model is able to select key predictor features from an input dataset by first
    creating an initial model with a large number of hinges and thereafter optimizing
    the model by reducing the number of unneeded hinges (Ferreira et al. 2019; Yang
    et al. 2003). The MLR algorithm is essentially an extension of a linear regression
    that utilizes more than one input predictor variable unlike traditional linear
    regression with a single independent input variable. The MLR algorithm assumes
    a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The NN
    algorithms mirror the operation of human brain neurons and function by calculating
    the weights of input variables and propagating the strong connections via the
    selected activated function to make predictions (Meyers et al. 2019). The general
    NN architecture consists a primary input layer corresponding to the number of
    input variables, followed by a hidden layer(s) and thereafter an output layer
    (Mucherino et al. 2009). Of the selected data-driven models, particularly NN algorithms
    have been utilized in the prediction of a variety of agriculture-related parameters
    such as ET (Kumar et al. 2020a, b; Zanetti et al. 2007). NN models have also been
    used to estimate crop thermal response indices such as crop water stress index
    (CWSI) for wine grapes (King and Shellie 2016) and Indian Mustard (Kumar et al.
    2020a, b) The RF model is a decision tree-based model in which prediction is based
    off weighted mean from the decision tree system predictions for a regression analysis
    problem (Heddam 2021; Yamaç 2021; Yang et al. 2021). The RNN model designs contain
    internal memory units for processing sequential data and utilizes previous memory
    of inputs to determine current input and output with increased prediction accuracies
    (Fente and Singh 2020). Model input data and model development Model input variables
    The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ) and the variance inflation factor
    (VIF) were computed to determine the monotonic and multicollinear relationships
    between weather variables as model input parameters, respectively. Figure 1 shows
    the ρ values of the selected weather parameters which include Ta, RH, U2, and
    Rs, while Table 2 shows the VIF values with selected parameter combinations that
    were tested against the data driven models. Fig. 1 Correlation matrix indicating
    Spearman’s rank coefficient between the weather variables and non-stressed canopy
    temperature (Tcns) at a the WCREEC site and b the LIRF site. In the diagrams,
    Ta is the average air temperature (°C), RH is the average relative humidity (%),
    U2 is the windspeed at 2 m height (m s−1), Rs is the solar radiation (W m−2),
    and Tcns is the non-stressed canopy temperature (°C) Full size image Table 2 Machine
    learning models and different weather variable input combinations Full size table
    The Spearman’s rank correlation results (Fig. 1) indicated that Ta had high positive
    correlation with Tcns with ρ = 0.89 and 0.83 at WCREEC and LIRF, respectively.
    RH had a stronger negative correlation with Tcns at LIRF (ρ = −0.59) and WCREEC
    (ρ = −0.37), while U2 had weak positive correlations with Tcns at both study sites.
    Additionally, Rs had a stronger positive correlation with Tcns at LIRF (ρ = 0.54)
    as compared to WCREEC (ρ = 0.17). Large absolute values of ρ and the existence
    of either positive or negative Spearman’s rank correlation values between the
    selected weather variables and Tcns suggested feasibility of utilizing these weather
    parameters (Ta, RH, U2, and Rs) in different model input combinations during analysis.
    Multicollinearity amongst input parameters can indicate high correlation amongst
    the variables which can result in model overfitting. VIF values were computed
    to determine the level of multicollinearity amongst the independent weather variable
    and establish their feasibility as model input variables. The resulting VIF values
    were 3.26, 3.19, 1.26, and 1.03 for Ta, RH, U2, and Rs, respectively, at the LIRF
    site, while the VIF values at WCREEC site were 1.65, 1.60, 1.07, and 1.10 for
    Ta, RH, U2, and Rs, respectively. With a selected VIF threshold of 10 (Praveen
    and Sharma 2020; Wei et al. 2011) the computed values indicated no significant
    collinearity between the weather variables at the two study sites. Six different
    weather data combinations (Table 2) were selected to assess versatility of models
    to predict Tcns given different inputs as well as identify key weather data combinations
    that drive the prediction accuracy of Tcns for maize grown in semi-arid climates
    in mid-west United States. Model development criteria Model development and performance
    analysis was done with Python programming language in the open source web integrated
    development environment Google Colaboratory (Google, CA, USA) which is a hosted
    Jupyter notebook service and the required libraries for model execution were used
    (Carneiro et al. 2018). The total number of data points used in the analysis was
    708 from the WCREEC site and 706 from the LIRF site. Since the weather datasets
    had different magnitudes, the datasets were normalized for consistency and better
    model development (Abyaneh et al. 2011; Andrade et al. 2018). Prior to model training,
    the weather data inputs were randomly split into 70% for the training set and
    30% for the model testing set. Additionally, repeated k-fold cross validation
    (with six subsets) was employed during model performance assessment and averaged
    across six repetitions (Yamaç and Todorovic 2020). For the NN, RNN, and MARS models
    the hyperparameter tuning was done by trial and error, while for the KNN and RF
    models, hyperparameter tuning was performed using the grid search technique with
    five folds in k-fold cross validation. In this study, data analysis was based
    on two scenarios. In the first instance each of the data driven models was trained
    individually at each study site with 70% of the available dataset and the remaining
    30% was utilized in model testing and prediction to achieve localized site-specific
    model scenarios. This site-specific model evaluation resulted in six model × six
    weather data combinations (i.e., 36 models) from which the best combination was
    selected at each site. In the second instance of data analysis, four cross site
    generalized model scenarios were achieved by training the two best model combinations
    with the data from one study site and then testing the model combinations with
    data sets from the second study site. These cross-site generalized models were
    denoted as GM1 and GM2 when the training data set was from WCREEC and GM3 and
    GM4 when the training dataset was from the LIRF site. Model evaluation criteria
    Frequently used performance metrics (Table 3, Eqs. 1.1 to 1.6) were used to evaluate
    the model type × weather data combinations and these included the adjusted correlation
    coefficient (\\(R_{{\\text{adj}}}^2\\)), coefficient of determination (R2), root
    mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Table 3 Equations of the performance metrics
    used to evaluate the model × weather data combinations across the WCREEC and LIRF
    study sites Full size table The R2 and \\(R_{{\\text{adj}}}^2\\) (Eqs. 1.1 and
    1.2, respectively) values were indicative of the goodness of model fit and range
    from 0 to 1 with higher values being considered as depictive of a good working
    model. The MSE (Eq. 1.4) values represented the mean value of squared difference
    between the predicted and observed dataset value, while the RMSE (Eq. 1.3) computed
    the square root of the MSE (Eq. 1.4) to evaluate the model error. MAE (Eq. 1.6)
    computed an average of the absolute differences between the actual values versus
    the predicted values and the MAPE (Eq. 1.5) statistic indicated the average difference
    between the predicted and measured Tcns values and lower MAPE values were preferred.
    Similarly, low values for MSE, RMSE, and MAE indicated good model performance.
    Following the computation of the model performance metrics, the six model × six
    weather data combinations were ranked to determine the specific model that approximated
    Tcns best as well as which weather data combinations were most suitable for the
    estimation of Tcns. Model ranking followed similar procedures by Elagib and Mansell
    (2000) and Zhang et al. (2020) in which each of the performance metrics was given
    a score with 1 being the highest performing and 36 being the least performing.
    Additionally, site specific Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) (Lundberg and
    Lee 2017) summary plots were made to determine importance of individual weather
    parameters on overall model prediction performance as well as the sequence of
    importance of input variable contributions. Results and Discussion Site specific
    model × weather data performance Localized site specific performance at WCREEC
    The site specific model performance results at WCREEC indicated that estimation
    of Tcns varied more as a result of the selected weather data combinations rather
    than the specific data driven model type (Table 4). King and Shellie (2014) also
    reported similarities in grape Tcns estimation results when NN models were compared
    to MLR for an input combination with Ta, RH, U2, and Rs. The values of\\(R_{{\\text{adj}}}^2\\),
    RMSE, R2, MSE, MAPE, and MAE for the 36 training and testing instances of model
    development ranged from 0.010 to 0.909, 0.671 to 2.251 °C, 0.013 to 0.910, 0.456
    to 4.818 °C, 0.002 to 0.066%, and 0.532 to 1.741 °C, respectively (Table 4). Generally,
    weather data combination 1 (Ta, RH, U2, and Rs) resulted in the best performance
    for the MARS, MLR, RF, and RNN models, while the KNN and NN models performed best
    with weather data combination 4 (Ta and RH) during the testing phase of model
    development. Additionally, the weather data combination 5 (RH and Rs) resulted
    in the least model performance across the statistics during model testing phase.
    Except for KNN model, which performed best with weather data combination 4 (Ta
    and RH), all remaining models had better overall performance with weather data
    combination 1 (Ta, RH, U2, and Rs) during model training. Table 4 Performance
    metrics of the training and testing scenarios across the 36 model × weather data
    combinations at the WCREEC study site Full size table The model × weather data
    performance ranking results for the WCREEC site are shown in Table 5. These performance
    ranks indicated that the MARS model with weather data combination 1 (Ta, RH, U2,
    and Rs) was the overall best performing model for both the training and testing
    phases of model development. Psichogios et al. (1992) compared the MARS model
    with NN across different test problems and found that although MARS model performance
    was higher and had faster computation times than NN for lower order models, NN
    model was a more robust predictor with outlier datasets. In this study the weather
    dataset was filtered to remove outlier data which likely contributed to similar
    performance across the models. Additionally, each combination’s rankings (Table
    5) were summed across all models to assess the performance of individual weather
    data combinations (Table 6). These frequency results indicated the combinations
    performed in the following descending order: combination 1 > combination 4 > combination
    > 3 > combination 6 > combination 5 > combination 2. Of the combinations, all
    but combination 1 had limited weather data sets. These limited data model scenarios
    provided an opportunity to identify key model input parameters that drive the
    prediction of Tcns in semi-arid environments. Overall, combinations 3 and 4 which
    both included Ta and RH had higher \\(R_{{\\text{adj}}}^2\\) and R2 values, and
    lower RMSE, MAPE, and MAE values in comparison to combinations 5 (RH and Rs) and
    6 (Ta and Rs). The findings suggested that in limited weather data scenarios under
    semi-arid climates, prioritizing the use of Ta and RH for prediction of Tcns would
    be reliable. For further assessment of cross site model performance, full data
    set combinations 1 and limited data set 4 were selected from the WCREEC study
    site. Table 5 Ranking scores of performance metrics and rank of score summation

    variation of performance statistics for the training and testing stages of model
    development at the LIRF study site (Table 7) ranged from 0.439 to 0.879 for \\(R_{{\\text{adj}}}^2\\),
    0.914 to 2.001 °C for RMSE, 0.441 to 0.880 for R2, 0.279 to 4.214 °C for MSE,
    0.005 to 0.069 for MAPE, and 0.724 to 1.642 °C for MAE. Table 7 Performance of
    metrics of the training and testing scenarios across the 36 model × weather data
    combinations at the LIRF study site Full size table During model training, weather
    data combination 1 (Ta, RH, U2, and Rs) performed best in estimating Tcns for
    all 6 models. Similarly, combination 1 performed best for the testing stage for
    all models, except for KNN which combination 6 had the best performance (Table
    8). Table 8 Ranking scores of performance metrics and rank of score summation
    across the 36 model × weather data weather combinations for the testing and training
    scenarios during site specific model development at the LIRF study site Full size
    table Similar to the localized site-specific results at WCREEC, the combined sum
    of the ranking scores across all performance metrics indicated that the MARS model
    with combination 1 of weather data parameters was the best predictor of Tcns during
    both the training and testing phase of model development. The frequency of weather
    data combinations to accurately estimate Tcns during model testing phase (Table
    9) indicated that weather combination 6 (Ta and Rs) was most suitable to predict
    Tcns compared to combinations 3, 4, and 5 in instances of limited weather data.
    Unlike the WCREEC study site, Rs and not RH was a key predictor of Tcns at the
    LIRF site. Table 9 Frequency of weather data combinations to predict Tcns during
    localized model testing phase at the LIRF study site based off the ranking scores
    in Table 8 Full size table Implication of localized model performance on irrigation
    management Advances in quantification of water stress using crop thermal signatures
    have increased potential for adoption in irrigation management. Ideally real-time
    field measurements of canopy temperature should be compared to a non-stressed
    reference baseline to quantify elevated crop canopy temperature and related stress
    proxies prior to making irrigation decisions. A variety of crop canopy thermal
    indices have been adopted for these computations. The availability of weather
    data on both public and private domains provides the opportunity for researchers,
    industry stakeholders, and farmers to model Tcns, which then avoids the time and
    resources required to maintain a well-watered crop. A possible practical adoption
    of modeled Tcns could be selecting region specific model × weather data combination(s)
    and incorporating their operation and predictions at the backend of local public
    or commercial weather stations, which would be similar to how reference crop evapotranspiration
    outputs are provided alongside daily weather parameters. Furthermore, with the
    growth of internet of things and cloud computing services at the farm level, it
    will be more plausible to collect field measurements of crop canopy and simultaneously,
    synthesize weather data for Tcns values prior to making infield, real-time irrigation
    decisions. Selection of region specific Tcns key weather predictors would improve
    model performance as suggested in the WCREEC versus LIRF scenarios. The heterogeneity
    of micro-climate variables between weather stations and producer fields (Hashmi
    et al. 1995), creates concerns of spatial representability of Tcns prediction
    models to single farmer fields. If individual field/farm scale stations are used,
    the weather data footprint could be field representative. Although the aforementioned
    concerns could be alleviated, the modeled Tcns would still be crop and possibly
    hybrid specific (Cárcova et al. 1998). Localized Tcns models are, therefore, recommended
    as well as investigations on the effect on crop hybrid would have on Tcns predictions.
    However, it is important to keep in mind that field/farm scale weather stations
    are often not subject to stringent maintenance protocols which could compromise
    the data quality output. It is hypothesized that the data driven models can still
    utilize such data to make predictions within a reasonable range of accuracy in
    comparison to conventional models. This hypothesis is recommended for further
    testing. It is, however, less concerning to match point in time (for example as
    measured by stationery IRTs) or period of time field measurements (for example
    as measured by remotely piloted aerial systems) of Tc with modeled Tcns since
    most weather data is provided at a fine time scale of up to one minute. The localized
    Tcns prediction results at WCREEC and LIRF also showed that limited weather data
    could be used to accurately estimate Tcns which makes it possible to adapt data
    driven modeling of Tcns in instances where full weather datasets are unavailable
    or missing. Impact of weather variables on T cns prediction The SHAP summary plot
    for the WCREEC site (Fig. 2) indicated that across all the selected models Ta
    had the strongest predictive influence on modeled Tcns values (y-axis). In contrast,
    U2 had the lowest influence as a predictor variable for Tcns in all models with
    exception of NN in which Rs was the least contributor to Tcns values. More specifically,
    the SHAP values of Tcns (x-axis) indicated that as Ta increased, the model’s ability
    to accurately predict Tcns was high while lower values of Ta greatly decreased
    the prediction accuracy of Tcns across all models. Conversely, increase in RH
    values only slightly contributed to the prediction of Tcns values especially in
    the NN, RNN, MLR, and MARS models. In the RNN, MLR, and MARS models the SHAP value
    for U2 was near zero indicating that U2 had minimal to no significant contribution
    to the model’s prediction of Tcns. Overall Rs had a smaller impact on Tcns prediction
    across all models, although low Rs values slightly decreased Tcns prediction accuracy
    in NN, MARS, and RF models. Fig. 2 Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) summary
    plots of feature contribution of combination 1 (Ta, RH, U2, and Rs) weather parameters
    to prediction of Tcns at WCREEC across the 6 selected models Full size image Like
    the findings at the WCREEC site, Ta was a primary predictor of Tcns across the
    6 models at the LIRF study site and high values of Ta positively influenced that
    prediction while low values of Ta negatively impacted modeled Tcns values (Fig.
    3). However, unlike at WCREEC site, in the semi-arid LIRF site, Rs ranked second
    in influencing all model predictions. U2 had the least influence on Tcns predictions
    in the NN and RNN, while RH had the least impact on the prediction of Tcns in
    the MLR, MARS, KNN, and RF models. The effect of wind speed was slightly more
    pronounced at the LIRF site with high values of U2 positively influencing the
    Tcns prediction in the NN, RNN, MLR, and KNN models. Fig. 3 Shapley additive explanations
    (SHAP) summary plots of feature contribution of combination 1 (Ta, RH, U2, and
    Rs) weather parameters to prediction of Tcns at LIRF across the 6 selected models
    Full size image The SHAP values across the two sites further reinforce that in
    situations where weather data is limited, parameter combination 4 (Ta and RH)
    and combination 6 (Ta and Rs) are suited for the prediction of Tcns in semi-arid
    WCREEC and LIRF, respectively. Generalized model performance across study sites
    Spatial transferability of weather data model combinations was examined by training
    the models with datasets from one study site and testing the model performance
    with data from the second site. The best performing model combinations with full
    (combination 1) and limited (combination 4 and 6) parameters were selected for
    the cross site comparison. This selection resulted in four scenarios of generalized
    models namely: GM1 and GM2 in which the training dataset was from the WCREEC site
    for combinations 1 (Ta, RH, U2, and Rs) and 4 (Ta and RH), respectively; and GM3
    and GM4 in which the training dataset was from the LIRF site for combinations
    1 (Ta, RH, U2, and Rs) and 6 (Ta and Rs), respectively. Thus, GM1 and GM2 were
    tested with the LIRF dataset while GM3 and GM4 were tested with the dataset from
    the WCREEC site. Generally, although the ranking of individual models in the generalized
    cross site scenarios was similar to localized model development results (Sections
    \"Localized site specific performance at WCREEC\" and \"Localized site specific
    performance at LIRF\"), localized performance metrics were better than in the
    generalized model testing scenarios. For instance, in GM1, the MARS model had
    better performance statistics in the training phase of model development with
    values of 0.905, 0.699 °C, and 0.564 °C for R2, RMSE, and MAE, respectively. However,
    there was a slight decline in performance and in model prediction statistics when
    the models trained at WCREEC predicted Tcns at LIRF with 17.18 and 10.77% increases
    in RMSE and MAE, respectively, for the MARS model during GM1 testing phase, compared
    to localized performance at LIRF. Similarly, GM2 (consisting of Ta and RH) had
    a poor prediction performance of Tcns in LIRF during the testing scenario (Fig.
    4), across all models in comparison to both the GM1 scenario and the localized
    performance of combination 4 at LIRF. Fig. 4 The box plots showing the range of
    performance metrics (R2, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE) of the cross site generalized models
    GM1, GM2, GM3, and GM4 across the six data driven models during the testing phase
    of model development. GM1 and GM2 are the scenario which the training dataset
    was from the WCREEC site for combinations 1 and 4, respectively, while GM3 and
    GM4 are the scenario in which the training dataset was from the LIRF site for
    combinations 1 and 6, respectively Full size image The comparison of generalized
    models with the full weather datasets in the GM1 and GM3 scenarios showed that
    models trained with the LIRF weather dataset in the GM3 scenario were more robust
    and were better estimators of Tcns at the WCREEC site. It is hypothesized that
    the improved performance of the GM3 over GM1 is due to a broader ranging dataset
    at the LIRF site which provided a better basis for supervised learning across
    the data driven models and therefore better generalization. The findings, therefore,
    suggested that prediction of Tcns across sites is possibly affected by the numerical
    data ranges of input parameters and locations with broad sets of data (both amount
    and range) could be utilized in exploratory Tcns prediction at other sites within
    similar agroclimatic zones. The overall performance of the prediction models in
    the GM2 and GM4 scenarios, where weather data were limited, also suggested that
    cross site prediction of Tcns was more dependent on weather data combination types
    than data driven model specificity. As such, identifying the key weather parameter
    predictors of Tcns and using them in model training could improve model performance
    across sites. The benefit of data driven models in limited data scenarios is that
    these models offer the flexibility in determination of key predictors as illustrated
    in \"Site specific model × weather data performance\" section, unlike other methods
    of estimating Tcns such as physical models (Jackson et al. 1981). Limitations
    in range of values of training datasets at one site could, however, contribute
    to statistical biases and inaccuracies in cross site modeled values at another
    site as discovered in the scenario GM1. Also, the variation of model performance
    across the GM1 to GM4 scenarios indicated that although limited data model scenarios
    GM2 and GM4 had poorer performance metrics, the variation of metrics across models
    was less compared to when GM1 or GM3 was used. Although the prediction accuracy
    of models run with limited data inputs seemed to be compromised, these models
    were on the overall more stable predictors of Tcns compared to those run with
    more weather data, in which bias and variability was compounded over with the
    increase in number of predictor variables. That said, not all the limited data
    combinations were feasible predictors of Tcns, and it is, therefore, important
    to identify the key predictor parameters prior to model deployment. Generalized
    model prediction accuracy Comparison of the generalized model Tcns prediction
    results to actual field measured Tcns was done using the Passing-Bablok regression
    procedure (Bilic-Zulle 2011). Here a 95% confidence interval (CI) was considered
    for the slope and intercept such that if the CI of the slope included 1 and the
    CI of intercept included 0, it implied that the two methods of Tcns measurement
    were comparable and interchangeable. The generalized model scenarios with all
    input data sets, GM1 and GM3 were selected for the analysis. Although the Tcns
    prediction results for GM1 (Fig. 5) indicated high values of Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient, the range of CI values (Table 10) for the slope across all the prediction
    models for GM1 did not include the value of one. Additionally, the range of CI
    values for the intercept did not include the value 0. This exclusion of 0 in the
    intercept CI indicated a systematic bias associated with under or overestimation
    of the predicted value of Tcns at the LIFR site based on models trained using
    the WCREEC site data. Similar to GM1 Tcns prediction results, the Pearson’s correlation
    coefficients between the observed field measured Tcns and predicted Tcns across
    the different data driven models was strong and ranged from 0.920 for the RNN1
    model to 0.847 in the KNN1 model in the GM3 scenario (Fig. 6). However, the CI
    interval of slope and intercept (Table 10) indicated that only the KNN1 and MLR1
    models had the values of 1 and 0 within the CI range of slope and intercept, respectively,
    which implied that no significant differences were present between modeled and
    measured Tcns under the GM3 scenario. Although the value of 1 was Included in
    the slope CI of MARS1, NN1, RF1, and RNN1 under the GM3 scenario, the absence
    of 0 in the intercept CI indicated a systematic bias that implied the prediction
    models were prone to over or underprediction of Tcns. Hence cross site generalized
    models from the LIRF site to the WCREEC site were possible but to a greater extent,
    prone to systematic modeling errors of over and under prediction. Fig. 5 Passing

    Implication of generalized model performance on irrigation management Generalized
    models for use across multiple sites are difficult to guarantee due to differences
    in site-specific characteristics that can influence predictor variable attributes
    and therefore generalizing models ought to ideally be normalized for site specificity.
    Due to the similarity in range of weather data predictors at the LIRF and WCREEC
    sites, GM3 scenario was comparable to measured Tcns in two model × weather data
    scenarios of the 12 tested instances. Mostly the predictions tended to under or
    overestimate Tcns by the data driven models under the generalized model scenarios
    as indicated by the CI of slope and intercept. The extent and/or magnitude of
    systematic model bias was beyond the scope of this study and was not investigated.
    Regardless, these Tcns resulting from generalized model scenarios can still be
    of use and provide insight for irrigation management. Crop canopy temperature
    measurements for water stress detection are more suited for deficit irrigation
    than full irrigation water management since thermal stress is often detected following
    crop water stress. Even though majority of the generalized model predictions were
    prone to errors, predicted Tcns values can still be utilized to provide a near
    estimate of non-water stressed conditions as well as for exploratory analysis.
    In an instance where Tcns is underestimated, and irrigation is triggered as a
    result it could provide an opportunity to bridge the gap between deficit and full
    irrigated scenarios in areas where water availability is not a concern. However,
    if Tcns is overestimated, required irrigation events would be missed and as such
    caution should be exercised when deploying modeled Tcns during water-sensitive
    growth stages to avoid unintended consequences of model bias. Utilization of modeled
    Tcns with other crop water stress indicators such as soil moisture monitoring
    to trigger irrigation in such scenarios is advisable as suggested in O’Shaughnessy
    et al. (2023). The study only tested Tcns generalized models across two agroclimatic
    zones with intersecting features, i.e., semi-arid climates. It is hypothesized
    that these Tcns generalized models would not be suitable for application beyond
    these semi-arid climate boundaries, for example, in humid or sub-humid environments
    due to differences in crop thermal response and weather parameter boundaries in
    such climates. It is, however, possible that generalized Tcns models between humid
    and sub-humid climates could provide comparable results, but it is yet to be explored.
    Conclusion Non-stressed canopy temperature is an important benchmark parameter
    in quantification of crop water stress based on crop canopy thermal signatures.
    Although field observation of Tcns is possible, it requires constant maintenance
    of a well-watered crop and the Tcns values may be spatially variable across crop
    fields. The purpose of this paper was to, therefore, evaluate the performance
    of six data driven models in estimation of Tcns in semi-arid climate zones. The
    data driven models included multiple linear regression model (MLR), forward feed
    neural network model (NN), recurrent neural network model (RNN), multivariate
    adoptive regression splines (MARS), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor
    (KNN). Weather datasets which included Ta, RH, U2, and Rs were used as input variables
    under six selected combinations and the analysis also tested scenarios with full
    versus limited weather data inputs as well as cross site generalization of models.
    The site-specific results at both the LIRF and WCREEC study sites indicated that
    Tcns estimation with data driven models was greatly influenced by selected weather
    data input combinations and not model specificity. Ranking of the performance
    metrics across the 36 model × weather data combinations indicated that combination
    1 which consisted of Ta, RH, U2, and Rs had better overall performance across
    training and testing scenarios at both LIRF and WCREEC study sites. However, in
    limited data scenarios combination 4 with Ta and RH was a better estimator of
    Tcns in the WCREEC site, while combination 6 with Ta and Rs performed better at
    the LIRF site. The site-specific Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values further
    reinforced that Ta greatly contributed to Tcns prediction by the models at both
    study sites, while RH was a better predictor of Tcns at WCREEC compared to LIRF
    where Rs contributed more to the Tcns prediction outcomes by the models. The contribution
    of U2 to model performance was low across both study sites. Four generalized model
    scenarios were tested for cross site model analysis. The results showed that although
    models with the full weather parameters in scenarios GM1 and GM3 outperformed
    models with limited weather data inputs in scenarios GM2 and GM4, the later scenarios
    resulted in less variability across the performance metrics. These differences
    across generalized models pointed at increased variability in prediction results
    with increased datasets albeit higher instance of estimation accuracy as deduced
    from the testing performance metrics. Further examination of the GM1 and GM3 Tcns
    prediction results revealed that although the GM1 scenario had reasonable performance
    metrics results across all models, the confidence interval ranges for the slope
    and intercept of predicted versus field measured Tcns for GM1 showed existing
    model biases coupled with under or over estimation of Tcns at LIRF. Only KNN1
    and MLR1 in scenario GM3, were interchangeably unbiased compared to field measured
    Tcns at WCREEC. GM3 scenario performed better than the GM1 scenario possibly because
    of a wider range of weather data parameters that catered for various instances
    at the WCREEC site. Overall, although a wide range of data driven models can be
    used to predict Tcns in both semi-arid environments, selection of key predictors
    weather parameters in limited weather data scenarios will increase model prediction
    performance. Additionally, the MARS1 model accurately predicted Tcns across all
    sites attesting to the model’s robustness and to predict Tcns in semi-arid conditions
    given similar weather parameters. Modeled Tcns based on weather datasets has a
    wide range of applications in irrigation management and for further research modeling
    of the upper boundary of Tc will be explored as well as alternative cross site
    model generalization in other agroclimatic zones. Data availability The data from
    this study will be made available on request. References Abyaneh HZ, Nia AM, Varkeshi

    controlPrecision irrigation 1. Introduction Agriculture is the base of our socio-economical
    model, and its development plays an essential role in the welfare of nations (Gollin
    et al., 2002). However, agriculture has a high environmental impact and can be
    considered one of the most important contributors to global environmental degradation
    (Mueller et al., 2012). Furthermore, as the global population continues to grow,
    there is an urgent need to increase food production. This already complex challenge
    is further intensified by accelerated environmental changes, characterized by
    significant shifts in precipitation patterns and an increase in extreme weather
    events such as heavy rains, heatwaves, and droughts (Bisbis et al., 2018). Consequently,
    it is critical to develop strategies to enhance agricultural production while
    mitigating its environmental impact. In this context, improvements in irrigation
    scheduling play an important role, not only because agriculture is the consumer
    of almost 70% of freshwater resources (Jalilvand et al., 2019), but also because
    appropriate irrigation scheduling can help to increase the yield production and
    minimize the leaching of nutrients, pesticides, and heavy metal to freshwater
    sources (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). Incorporating technological tools could be a
    viable solution to improve irrigation scheduling, where the aim is to make irrigation
    decisions based on the needs of the crops, establishing when the crops need water
    and how much water needs to be applied. Numerous studies have centered on developing
    tools that accurately detect plant water stress conditions to determine optimal
    irrigation. For instance, Torres et al. (2019) employed near-infrared spectroscopy
    to measure in-situ leaf relative water content. In parallel, other approaches
    assess plant water requirements using soil moisture sensors (SMS) positioned in
    the target zone. The use of SMS is the most adopted technology for irrigation
    scheduling in the USA (USDA, 2018, Taghvaeian et al., 2020), and in many scenarios,
    a common response to identified irrigation needs is implementing feedback threshold
    control by using SMS (Dukes et al., 2009, Zotarelli et al., 2010, Zhang et al.,
    2017, Li et al., 2018, Cayuela et al., 2022, Simionesei et al., 2020), or using
    fuzzy-based decision systems (Culman et al., 2019, Stone et al., 2020). Both strategies
    define levels based on measured stress conditions or soil moisture. However, the
    methodology for setting these threshold levels is not versatile enough to accommodate
    the diversity of crops, soils, and environmental conditions. Furthermore, these
    thresholds often remain static, not accounting for the evolving needs of crops
    influenced by environmental factors, intrinsic crop properties, and growth stages.
    Accurately determining the volume of water needed for irrigation entails a comprehensive
    understanding of plant water consumption concerning environmental variables, specific
    crop attributes, and growth stages (Lopez-Jimenez et al., 2022). Many decision
    support systems employ crop measurements coupled with AI to estimate and compensate
    for water losses from the evapotranspiration process (Katimbo et al., 2023). The
    works developed by Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et al. (2019) aim
    to bolster decision-support systems for agricultural irrigation by incorporating
    analytical models such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM). This comprehensive
    model features modules covering soil water balance, nutrient dynamics, equilibrium
    soil chemistry, potential evapotranspiration, surface energy balance, heat transfer,
    pesticide processes, and plant growth, relying on the Decision Support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). RZWQM has been widely utilized to simulate
    the impacts of agricultural management strategies on crop yields and soil and
    water quality (Ma et al., 2012). Gu et al., 2017, Li et al., 2019 and Chen et
    al. (2019) use RZWQM for computing irrigation scheduling based on measurable crop
    conditions, predefined threshold values, and numerical solutions generated by
    the model. Nonetheless, employing RZWQM to compute irrigation scheduling in a
    feedback scheme presents significant challenges due to its inherent complexity
    and rigidity. The model’s detailed structure complicates the straightforward analyses
    and inclusion of user-specified requirements and the adaptation to overcome discrepancies
    between the crop and the model. Furthermore, RZWQM is restricted to a predefined
    set of cultivars, limiting its versatility to diverse agricultural settings. The
    complexity also imposes computational constraints, making real-time feedback control
    based on the current soil moisture state and crop stages challenging. These limitations
    underscore the necessity for more versatile, adaptive, and computationally efficient
    irrigation scheduling strategies. To this end, some studies have explored advanced
    control theory as a systematic approach to the irrigation problem (Saleem et al.,
    2013, Delgoda et al., 2016, Shang et al., 2020). As mentioned by Romero et al.
    (2012) and Ding et al. (2018), using advanced control strategies in agriculture
    has a high potential to increase efficiency. However, tangible applications are
    sparse. Much of the documented research revolves around simulations (Romero et
    al., 2012). While comprehensive on paper, some models oversimplify real-world
    scenarios by presupposing fully instrumented crops. Contrarily, in practical settings,
    agricultural systems often struggle with control limitations. In many irrigation
    systems, manual intervention dominates, where operators activate or deactivate
    pumps, manage ditches, and manipulate valves or gates to regulate irrigation.
    In summary, we evidence a lack of irrigation strategies that balance efficiency,
    practicality, and real crop management considerations. Many current methods rely
    heavily on static thresholds or intricate models, which often do not adapt dynamically
    to changing environmental conditions, diverse crop needs, irrigation management
    practices, and different growth stages. Moreover, while advanced control theory
    holds promise, there is an absence of advanced control strategies that account
    for real-world complexities and manual human intervention in the operation of
    irrigation systems, where the timely human response to crop needs, actuation precision,
    and operational reliability are important elements that influence the controlled
    system. Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this research is to use
    control theory to enhance the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly in
    real agricultural scenarios that are often human-operated. We propose developing
    a novel control-based algorithm for a DSS for irrigation scheduling capable of
    computing practical irrigation instructions based on field measurements and weather
    forecasting, which is designed to be adaptable to the grower’s or irrigation manager’s
    operational limitations, preferences, and experience and must compensate for uncertainties
    introduced by human intervention. We have formulated our DSS around a simplified
    proposed control-oriented model (COM), which describes the soil moisture dynamics;
    a data processing stage, which makes the measured data compatible with the COM;
    a parameter estimation stage, which guarantees an optimal adjustment of the COM
    parameters based on measured information from the crop; and a control stage, which
    uses the parametrized COM, measured information from the crop, and information
    from weather forecasting to compute the appropriate irrigation instructions that
    maintain the soil moisture close to a desired level. We evaluated our algorithm
    using collected data from a seepage-irrigated commercial sweetcorn field in South
    Florida. Our evaluations covered each component of our system, from model validation
    to overall system performance. As a principal outcome, the proposed algorithm
    presents the potential to save 30% of water in this type of irrigation system.
    This water-saving is facilitated through effective and achievable computed irrigation
    scheduling that maintains soil moisture within a targeted range. Such control
    preserves optimal growing conditions and minimizes environmental risks by preventing
    runoff, percolation, and the leaching of hazardous agricultural chemicals into
    the surrounding ecosystem. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 starts with an overview of soil moisture and irrigation scheduling,
    establishes the problem of formulating a control-oriented DSS for irrigation scheduling,
    and offers a detailed description of the proposed DSS algorithm. Section 3 describes
    the process following to validate the proposed algorithm. In Section 4, the results
    of the validation are presented and discussed. Finally, in Section 5, some conclusions
    are drawn. 2. Methods 2.1. Process description and problem formulation The relationship
    between irrigation, soil, plants, and the environment constitutes a complex system
    that requires practical concepts and analogies to formulate optimal irrigation
    strategies. As delineated in Eisenhauer et al. (2021), soil can be conceptualized
    as a reservoir, with different levels representing the amount of water available
    for plant uptake. We adopt this conceptual framework to simplify a complex problem
    that involves agriculture, control theory, and human interaction and to formulate
    the control problem on a DSS for irrigation management. Within this context, we
    identify key input and output variables, delineate desired conditions or set points,
    and specify agricultural constraints and human limitations. Download : Download

    of soil moisture states significant for plant-water relations and irrigation control
    based on Eisenhauer et al. (2021). The Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) delineates
    the lower threshold of soil water content at which plants cannot recover from
    water stress, marking the limiting boundary for plant survivability. The Maximum
    Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical reference, as soil moisture levels
    below this point result in sub-optimal physiological responses in plants. The
    soil moisture range between MADP and Field Capacity (FC) is optimal for plant
    growth, balancing water availability and stress prevention. Surpassing FC leads
    to inefficient water use, soil structural degradation, anaerobic root conditions,
    nutrient leaching, and the potential for surface water pollution. Beyond the Saturation
    Point (SP), the soil reaches its hydraulic limit, becoming incapable of retaining
    additional moisture. Fig. 1 illustrates this analogy: the base level, or the Permanent
    Wilting Point (PWP), indicates that below this threshold level, plants cannot
    extract water from the soil, leading to irreversible wilting. The next critical
    point is the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP); if the soil moisture drops
    below this level, the plants undergo water stress, potentially reducing yield.
    Consequently, MADP often serves as a guideline for irrigation decisions as the
    lower limit. However, its precise value, i.e., the percentage of MADP as the lower
    limit, can vary based on the crop, its growth stage, and prevailing climatic conditions.
    For instance, Bayabil et al. (2023) demonstrated that using only 75% of the expected
    MADP saved 25% of water consumption, with no reduction in sweet corn yield. Similarly,
    strategic deficit irrigation during certain growth stages of wine grapes enhances
    fruit quality for winemaking (Kang et al., 2023). From a control systems perspective,
    the Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) is a critical set-point or lower-bound
    constraint that must be maintained. Failure to uphold soil moisture levels at
    or above this threshold can lead to suboptimal plant physiological responses and
    yield reduction. The Field Capacity (FC) is defined as the soil water content
    threshold beyond which the gravitational drainage is negligible and is considered
    the upper limit. Below FC, the capillary actions keep the water stored in the
    soil pores. Irrigating until reaching FC and avoiding exceeding field capacity
    prevents the leaching of nutrients and pesticides applied to the crops. The saturation
    point (SP) is attained when the soil can no longer retain water, leading to runoff
    on the surface, which poses significant environmental concerns. Soil texture significantly
    influences key hydraulic characteristics such as the PWP, FC, and SP. Saxton and
    Rawls (2006) provide detailed hydraulic characteristics across various soil textures,
    as illustrated in Fig. 2. From this figure, it becomes evident that managing irrigation
    in sandy soil is notably challenging. A simple 5% fluctuation in water content
    in such soil can either lead to plant wilting or result in water wastage. In contrast,
    silt soils offer better flexibility: water content can vary by as much as 24%
    without triggering any adverse agricultural or ecological consequences. Therefore,
    the soil’s proportion of sand, silt, and clay plays an important role in the control
    problem definition and for specific irrigation decisions. Conceptually, for control
    purposes, soil can be viewed as a storage unit, where the area depends on the
    soil texture, the control input is irrigation, and the control objective is maintaining
    the volumetric water content to a desired level. However, additional considerations
    must also be included in the case of a DSS for irrigation control. Download :

    Maximum Allowable Depletion Point (MADP) of 50% of the available water for each
    soil class. Points over each bar denote the specific values. This figure is based
    on the hydraulic characteristics reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006). 2.1.1. Control
    challenges on a decision support system for irrigation scheduling A DSS for irrigation
    scheduling is particularly useful in farm systems with no automatic control elements,
    where the grower or irrigation manager carries out irrigation actions. In our
    proposed DSS, the control problem is to use available information from crops and
    weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions that help the user minimize
    the error between desired and measured soil moisture. Below, we discuss some considerations
    that must be addressed. Timely Human Response: The grower or irrigation manager
    cannot execute irrigation instructions quickly and suddenly. For that, even if
    sensors and computational capabilities can offer periodic information with sampling
    periods of minutes or seconds, this information will be unhelpful and might overwhelm
    or confuse the operator. Moreover, if an irrigation instruction suddenly appears
    when the operator is unavailable to make an irrigation action, it might not generate
    the expected result. Actuation Precision: Many conventional irrigation systems
    rely on actuators that operate more as binary switches than precision instruments.
    In agriculture, it is common to find devices such as on–off pumps, gates, weirs,
    and valves, which are unsuited for precise operation. Hence, recommendations should
    be straightforward and actionable, such as suggesting irrigation during a time
    rather than maintaining a specific flow rate. Human Reliability: Even with precise
    recommendations from the DSS, human behavior introduces variability. External
    influences can alter the final action taken, introducing a layer of uncertainty.
    Considered Measurable Variables: In most agricultural practices, rain ( ), irrigation
    ( ), and temperature ( ) are the main measurable variables affecting root zone
    soil moisture ( ). While capillary effects from the deep soil also influence root
    zone soil moisture, quantifying these effects necessitates more elaborated measurement
    techniques compared to the direct measurement of the aforementioned variables.
    Integration of Weather Forecasts: Meteorological advancements have made weather
    predictions increasingly accurate. Governments worldwide are making concerted
    efforts to provide weather forecasts as part of impact-based decision-support
    services. These forecasts, especially regarding expected rainfall and temperature,
    are crucial for making informed irrigation decisions, ensuring optimal water use,
    and supporting crop health. 2.2. Proposed approach We address the control challenges
    by proposing a DSS presented in Fig. 3, which integrates measured information
    from the crop and weather forecasting to compute irrigation instructions. The
    DSS integrates control theory and accommodates timely human response by working
    periodically and allowing the grower to determine the irrigation period1 for these
    executions. Furthermore, the DSS provides practical and realizable irrigation
    instructions, given in units of volume per irrigation period or irrigation time
    per irrigation period. For instance, if the grower selects a two-day irrigation
    period, the DSS will calculate the necessary volume of water or irrigation time
    that must be applied for each two-day interval. Download : Download high-res image

    proposed Decision Support System (DSS) for irrigation scheduling. The description
    illustrates the measured variables, where represents the instant time when the
    data is obtained, indicates the temperature, rain, soil moisture, and irrigation.
    The DSS is formulated with four main components: (i) the control-oriented model
    (COM), used as a base of the control algorithm; (ii) the data processing stage
    for aligning multi-temporal sensor data with algorithmic components; (iii) a parameter
    estimation stage for updating model parameters ( ); and (iv) a control algorithm
    that utilizes the COM, estimated parameters, processed measurements, and weather
    forecasts to calculate irrigation instructions ( ). The DSS uses measured variables
    from the crop, where rain and temperature can be obtained from a weather station,
    and volumetric water content can be obtained from soil moisture sensors. To address
    the system’s robustness against human variability in irrigation execution, our
    DSS additionally considers measuring this execution, i.e., obtaining measurements
    of irrigation time per irrigation period or volume of water per irrigation period.
    This measurement can be obtained from flowmeters or sensors for flow detection.
    The proposed approach (Fig. 3) is supported by (i) a COM of the SM, (ii) a data
    processing stage, (iii) a parameter estimation stage, and (iv) a control algorithm.
    In this approach, the COM serves as a parametrizable model that characterizes
    soil moisture as a function of processed measured variables and parameters to
    be estimated. At each irrigation period, the estimation stage calculates and updates
    the parameters. Then, the control stage uses the COM, the estimated parameters,
    soil moisture measurements, and weather forecasting data to determine the appropriate
    irrigation action that maintains the soil moisture at the desired value. A detailed
    breakdown of each component of the DSS is provided below. 2.2.1. Proposed control-oriented
    model for soil moisture The most important element of the proposed strategy is
    the COM. In agriculture, traditional models often focus on capturing the complexity
    of various biophysical processes. Although accurate, these models are often computationally
    expensive and not straightforwardly applicable for control design. We have derived
    the COM from a simplified water balance, as Fig. 4 describes. This model considers
    the soil a storage unit, where a linear combination of adaptable parameters and
    measured variables performs a water balance with inputs, including rain, irrigation,
    and upward capillarity. On the other hand, outputs include evapotranspiration,
    deep percolation, and runoff. The choice of a simplified model inevitably raises
    concerns about the sacrifice of modeling accuracy. However, in our DSS algorithm,
    this drawback is mitigated by continual parameter estimation based on real-time
    data and by incorporating feedback in the control equation. Our COM is formulated
    based on three assumptions: Download : Download high-res image (550KB) Download

    dynamics, where , and are outputs associated with evapotranspiration, and deep
    percolation; , , and are inputs associated to rain, irrigation, and capillary
    rise. Assumption 1 Model Sampling Period The COM is formulated with a fixed time
    step, denoted by , corresponding to the irrigation period. This fixed period allows
    for the discretization of soil moisture dynamics, indexed by the variable . Our
    DSS algorithm is based on the COM, which is discrete and will describe the soil
    moisture dynamics according to the irrigation period ( ). The grower or irrigation
    manager can configure to suit their operational preferences. Consequently, the
    COM and, by extension, the DSS algorithm are adaptable to those preferences. For
    instance, if a two-day irrigation period is selected, the COM will effectively
    model soil moisture dynamics under this discrete time interval. It is highlighted
    that, in practice, sensors often provide data at multiple sampling frequencies.
    We have designed specific data management techniques to reconcile this multiplicity
    of data with the user-defined irrigation period . These techniques are detailed
    in Section 2.2.2. Assumption 2 Soil Moisture Average During an appropriate irrigation
    period, it is reasonable to presume that the available water for the plants within
    the root zone is closely around an average soil moisture value, denoted as . This
    assumption enables us to formulate the control objective as maintaining this average
    soil moisture close to a desired level . This assumption simplifies both the model
    and the DSS algorithm. However, we clarify that choosing a lengthy irrigation
    period might be comfortable for the irrigation manager but can be risky for the
    plant’s health. Conversely, opting for shorter irrigation periods can mitigate
    potential water deficit issues during this period, but at the expense of demand
    for more managerial time. The optimal irrigation period depends on the crop type,
    environmental conditions, and highly on soil type. For instance, sandy soils,
    characterized by low water retention capacities, necessitate shorter irrigation
    periods than silt soils, which can retain almost six times more water (see Fig.
    2). It is pertinent to note that the temporal resolution of the COM is directly
    correlated with the chosen irrigation period . A shorter irrigation period effectively
    enhances the temporal resolution, allowing the model to capture more rapid fluctuations
    in soil moisture and other variables. However, this comes at the expense of increased
    computational and managerial demands. The adaptability in selecting allows for
    a trade-off between temporal resolution and operational convenience. Assumption
    3 Linear Relation Soil moisture operates as a causal system. The future average
    soil moisture is influenced by its prior water content and the inputs and outputs
    during this irrigation period. We are considering average soil moisture variation
    between successive irrigation periods, which is represented as , as a linear relation
    of the water balance during such irrigation period. We are formulating that in
    the upcoming irrigation period, the soil moisture average will depend on the actual
    soil moisture average and a linear combination between parameters (rates of change)
    and accumulated amounts of water inputs and outputs during the current irrigation
    period. In this form, we denote water input as the accumulated amount of rain
    during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change between and
    . Note that the rain units are commonly expressed in units of the water depth
    accumulated in the area under study. Since is a summation of measurements, it
    retains the same depth units, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture
    per unit of depth. Similarly, we denote the input as the accumulated amount of
    irrigation during the irrigation period and the parameter as the rate of change
    between and . Irrigation can be measured in units of depth, volume, or, in our
    case, for simplifying sensor instrumentation and data acquisition, irrigation
    time. reflects the total time that the crop is irrigated during the irrigation
    period, resulting in being dimensioned as soil moisture per unit of time. To streamline
    the electronic instrumentation, we are not considering measured variables corresponding
    to the capillary rise input, as this capillary rise comes from the water table.
    Instead, the input associated with capillary rise will be treated as an unknown
    parameter, denoted by . As discussed in the process description (Section 2.1),
    the infiltration and runoff are directly related to the soil moisture. For that,
    we are associating this output to the combination between the soil moisture average
    and the parameter , which is adimensional and represents the rate of change between
    and . The most adopted method to evaluate evapotranspiration is the FAO-56. This
    method requires the measurement of multiple environmental variables beyond the
    scope of our DSS, such as net radiation, soil heat flux, wind speed, saturation
    vapor pressure, and actual vapor pressure. Inspired by simpler models such as
    the Hargreaves Method (Gao et al., 2017), we overcome this issue by relating evapotranspiration
    directly to the temperature average ( ) via the estimated parameter , which has
    soil moisture per temperature units and describes the rate of change between and
    . Therefore, according to the assumptions and the proposed linear combinations
    that describe the system inputs and outputs, our parametrizable COM is formulated
    as (1) where , , , , and are positive parameters to be estimated, and the variables
    , , , and are obtained in the data processing stage from measured raw data. 2.2.2.
    Data processing stage The primary objective of this stage is to utilize measured
    data to compute the average soil moisture, total rainfall, total irrigation, and
    average temperature over the duration of the irrigation period. In that form,
    knowing a fixed irrigation period spanning from the time instant to and considering
    the sampling period of the respective sensor as , the number of samples within
    an irrigation period can be defined as: (2) With this, the average soil moisture
    is determined by: (3) Similarly, the average temperature is given by: (4) The
    accumulated rainfall over the period is computed as follows: (5) The accumulated
    irrigation is: (6) In Fig. 3, the data processing stage also processes rain and
    temperature forecast data. This data process uses the same methods followed in
    Eqs. (5), (4), considering the sampling time used for the forecasting provider.
    The expected accumulated rainfall for the next irrigation period is noted as ,
    and the expected temperature average is noted as . 2.2.3. Parameter estimation
    stage We aim to estimate the parameters inherent to the COM, namely , , , , .
    Our strategy hinges on maintaining a record of processed data, from which we derive
    an optimization-based approach for parameter estimation. This method is a variation
    of the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) technique (Rao et al., 2001). Our variation
    comprises an expanding estimation window, and this is slightly different from
    the conventional MHE, where a fixed-size window is used. Moreover, we propose
    to ensure the estimated parameters’ optimality by formulating a two-step estimator.
    The decision to use an expanding window arises from the unique characteristics
    of seasonal crops and the observed irrigation practices by growers. Notably, some
    crops can be ready for harvest just 30 days post-planting. Additionally, the irrigation
    schedules set by growers can fluctuate significantly, ranging anywhere from one
    to more than five days. Given these dynamics, valuing and utilizing every data
    collected from the crop throughout its growth cycle is imperative. Moreover, with
    a fixed-size estimation window, we risk encountering data windows without rain
    events or irrigation events, which can impact the estimation of parameters related
    to rain and irrigation. We use an expanding estimation window to mitigate this,
    ensuring the algorithm always has access to a sufficient data set. For permanent
    crops, the analysis might benefit from a moving window with a fixed size long
    enough to guarantee optimal parameter estimation. For data aggregation within
    this expanding window, we consider vectors of processed data from the instant
    to the instant . Hence, the processed data for soil moisture, rainfall, irrigation,
    and temperature within each estimation window is defined as: with . In that form,
    according to the corresponding estimation window, the parameters , , , , and are
    estimated at each irrigation period, given adaptive characteristics to the COM.
    We employ a two-step estimation strategy to guarantee the optimality of our estimated
    parameters: the first step estimates parameters in association with measured variables.
    In contrast, the subsequent step estimates the parameter linked to the water table.
    Prior estimation step At this step, we assume a water table’s slow dynamic variation
    in seepage irrigation and general water table elevation. For that, has a low incidence
    in the variation of the soil moisture. Consequently, we exclude in the first estimation
    step. This step estimates the parameters that minimize the quadratic error between
    the soil moisture variation and the linear combination between the measured variables
    and the parameters associated with the measured variables. In this estimation
    step, we are including a constraint to ensure that all the parameters must be
    positive to conserve the proposed physical relation of the mass balance. The proposed
    optimization problem is formulated as follows: Download : Download high-res image
    (40KB) Download : Download full-size image where is the vector of parameters that
    are associated with measured variables , and is the quadratic error described
    as (8) with , and . For the optimization problem (Eq. (7)), the linear constraints
    imply that an optimal solution is achievable if is convex. The convexity of this
    cost function can be established if its Hessian matrix respect to is positive
    definite (Bhatia, 2015), which in turn depends on the linear independence of the
    columns in . Variability in soil moisture and temperature can generally be assumed,
    ensuring the linear independence of corresponding columns in . However, given
    that rainfall and irrigation can exhibit extended periods of invariability, the
    algorithm is designed to commence only when observed variability in and is confirmed.
    Subsequent estimation step After estimating the parameters associated with the
    measured variables, is estimated. As we consider this parameter directly related
    to the soil moisture, we propose to find the parameter that minimizes the quadratic
    error between the measured soil moisture and the estimated soil moisture with
    initial conditions given by . Where the estimated soil moisture is obtained from
    the water balance in Eq. (1), and the numerical solution of the model (Eq. (1)),
    which is described as (9) In that form, we propose a subsequent optimization problem
    described as Download : Download high-res image (40KB) Download : Download full-size
    image where is the quadratic cost function given by (11) with . In this optimization
    problem, the constraints are also linear. In Appendix, it is shown that by appropriate
    substitutions, appear as a linear combination into the numerical solution given
    by , confirming the convexity of the cost function and that optimal solutions
    of also can be guarantee. 2.2.4. Control stage In the control stage, the COM,
    the estimated parameters, the processed measured variables, and the forecasted
    variables are integrated to calculate the amount of water that must be applied
    during the irrigation period. This stage is an adaptive, predictive, and feedback-plus
    feedforward control strategy. The main objective is to use measured and forecast
    information to estimate the appropriate irrigation ( ) that maintains the soil
    moisture close to a desired value. We explain the control strategy in four steps,
    where first, the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the estimated parameters obtained
    in Eqs. (7), and (10), and the processed measured data (Eqs. (3), (4), (5), and
    (6)) are used to predict (or forecast) the soil moisture one step ahead ( ) as
    follows: (12) Second, we use the control-oriented model (Eq. (1)), the predicted
    soil moisture , forecast rain and temperature data ( , and , and we assume that
    in the next irrigation period, the estimated parameter variation can be neglected
    or in other words that . With this information, we predict the soil moisture two
    steps ahead ( ) as follows: (13) Third, we establish the objective to deduce the
    irrigation amount to be applied, such as two steps ahead, the predicted soil moisture
    will be equal to the desired soil moisture. Therefore, by replacing in Eq. (13)
    and obtaining , we deduce the irrigation amount equation as follows: (14) Fourth,
    to analyze and understand the elements of the irrigation amount equation, we define
    the expected error between the desired soil moisture and the expected soil moisture
    as . Therefore, Eq. (14) can be rewritten as follows: (15) where the elements
    of the irrigation control equation can be described as components of the water
    balance that equilibrates the soil moisture around the desired value as follows:
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate for the difference
    between the desired moisture and the expected average of the soil moisture; is
    the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that, during
    the irrigation period, was lost due infiltration; is the volume of irrigation
    water that can be hold based on the expected rain during the irrigation period;
    is the amount of irrigation that must be applied to compensate the water that
    is expected to be lost due evapotranspiration; is the amount of water the crop
    will receive from capillary rise. Note that this control action is a case of adaptive
    control, knows a self-tuning regulator, where the stability of the controlled
    system is conditioned to the accuracy of the estimated parameters and the grade
    of uncertainty between the controlled system and the estimated system (Åström
    and Wittenmark, 2008). 3. Experimental verification The algorithm was validated
    using on-field measurements from a commercial sweetcorn field in South Florida.
    This data was initially collected as part of an integrated research and extension
    project focused on improving farmers’ adoption of soil moisture sensors for irrigation
    scheduling in vegetable farms. We evaluated our DSS algorithm using readings from
    soil moisture probes, a weather station, and a pressure transducer deployed in
    the commercial field. In this section, we describe the data collection process
    and the algorithm evaluation towards establishing the potential benefits of the
    algorithm in comparison with the information obtained from the grower irrigation
    practices. As shown in Fig. 5, we installed sensors to measure soil moisture,
    precipitation, environmental temperature, and irrigation management from December
    21, 2022, to January 11, 2023. Due to confidentiality agreements, the precise
    location of the commercial field remains undisclosed in this study. The soil in
    this field is classified as waveland and lawnwood fine sands. Following the hydraulic
    properties reported by Saxton and Rawls (2006) (Fig. 2), this soil is characterized
    by a permanent wilting point of 5%, a field capacity of 10%, and a saturation
    point of 46%. The field water movement and location of the sensors are described
    in Fig. 5, where the field is surrounded by a channel supplied by a pump drawing
    from a natural water source. Water is distributed from this surrounding channel
    to the crops via pipes. This water is then dispersed into ditches across the field.
    These ditches feature interconnected silts that facilitate water transport to
    the plant beds. Irrigation is accomplished by increasing the water level in the
    channel. It is important to note that this system operates under the assumption
    of homogeneous water distribution, with the water supply pump serving as the unique
    control element. Download : Download high-res image (568KB) Download : Download

    deployment of a weather station, a soil moisture sensor, and a pressure transducer.
    The blue lines delineate the water distribution inflow utilized for irrigating
    the agricultural field under study. Under the homogeneous water distribution consideration,
    moisture measurements were taken in the root zone at a depth of 0.3 m, using a
    Sentek Drill & Drop 60 cm soil moisture probe, which is capable of measuring soil
    moisture, temperature, and salinity at uniformly spaced depths every 0.1 m, providing
    a profile up to 0.6 m depth (Sentek, 2018). The sampling time was 1800 s. Rain
    and temperature data were obtained using a Davis Vantage Pro2 GroWeather 6820c
    weather station (Davis, 2023). The sampling time was 900 s. Irrigation measurements
    were taken by installing a KPSI 700 pressure sensor at the bottom of the channel.
    This sensor has a range of 0.7–210 m, an accuracy of 1% with analog output from
    0 to 10 V. The objective was to identify sudden increases related to pump activation
    to establish the irrigation time during the irrigation period. The pressure sensor
    was connected to a CR1000X datalogger of Cambell Scientific (Campbell, 2023) with
    a sampling time of 300 s, and the irrigation management was established by analyzing
    this information. The proposed DSS algorithm was tested using Matlab software
    version R2022a (Matlab, 2022). The irrigation period was selected by analyzing
    the irrigation management given by the grower. We observed that the management
    given by the grower was in function of soil and crop appearance, irrigating when
    required, and turning the pump on and off with an elapsed time between 1 and 6
    days. Given this information, our algorithm testing incorporated an irrigation
    period of two days ( ). We consider that with this period, we can provide reasonable
    timing actions from the grower. We added normally distributed random noise to
    the measured data to simulate the inherent stochasticity in weather forecasts.
    Specifically, the magnitude of this noise was set at 10% of the standard deviation
    of the actual measured data. In the context of rainfall predictions, any resultant
    negative values post-noise addition were truncated to zero. The maximum allowable
    depletion for sweet corn was considered 50% (Bayabil et al., 2023). We determined
    the desired soil moisture between 7.5% and 10%. We selected a desired soil moisture
    of 9% to stay far from the maximum allowable depletion point and accommodate uncertainties
    in soil characteristics. Before initializing the algorithm, we converted missing
    data entries to zeros. Soil moisture and irrigation data underwent homogenization
    through interpolation to match the 900 s rain and temperature data sampling interval.
    In the prior estimation step, the optimization problem was formulated as a quadratic
    programming problem and iteratively solved using the “quadprog” tool in Matlab.
    In the subsequent estimation stage, the optimization problem was iteratively addressed
    using a sequential quadratic programming method with the “fmincon” tool in Matlab.
    Then, in the test, the data is processed at each irrigation period to obtain the
    corresponding averages of the temperature and soil moisture and the corresponding
    amounts of accumulated rain and accumulated irrigation applied by the grower.
    Moreover, the model’s parameters are estimated at each irrigation period, and
    the recommended irrigation is computed. We evaluated the overall DSS algorithm
    by applying the computed control action to the parametrized COM. We are addressing
    the uncertainties related to assuming negligible estimated parameter changes between
    consecutive irrigation periods by adding stochastic variability, which was obtained
    by analyzing the variation of the estimated parameters and adding a randomized
    normal distributed disturbance with a standard deviation equal to the observed
    standard deviation of . In that form, the stochastic soil moisture prediction
    is given by (16) where , , , , and are the corresponding disturbances. In consequence,
    the evaluated control action is also disturbed by including the stochastic soil
    moisture prediction as (17) Below, we present the outcomes of our analysis. 4.
    Results and discussion Fig. 6 shows the results of the data processing stage.
    Note how the temperature ( ) shows a periodic component related to day and night
    patterns, also presented in the soil moisture ( ). However, this periodic component
    is removed in both the processed temperature ( ) and soil moisture ( ). In the
    case of accumulated rain ( ), the processed data is presented as the cumulative
    sum for each irrigation period. The grower irrigation decision represents the
    accumulated hours the grower irrigated during each irrigation period. The data
    processing stage is pivotal in aligning the measured data with the model and significantly
    mitigating uncertainties from the measured parameters of soil moisture, temperature,
    rain, and irrigation. As described, this stage computes the average soil moisture,
    total rainfall, total irrigation, and average temperature over the duration of
    each irrigation period. This computation aids in filtering out uncertainties and
    undesired data anomalies provided by sensors and forecasting methods. By averaging
    soil moisture over an irrigation period, the impact of incorrect measurements
    and transient spikes not contemplated in the model and random fluctuations are
    reduced, leading to more representative information on the available water for
    the plants. For example, in Fig. 6, an anomalous temperature measurement close
    to −20 °C is observed on Jan-08-23. This incorrect measurement was filtered out
    in the processed temperature data, thus attenuating its influence. Furthermore,
    considering accumulated rain and irrigation data in the data processing stage
    notably enhances the DSS robustness by minimizing the influence of uncertainty
    in both the measurement and prediction processes. It is essential to emphasize
    that uncertainties in measured rainfall and irrigation data, sampled every 900
    s, have a diminished impact on the estimation and control stages as the duration
    of the irrigation period increases. This reduction in the influence of data uncertainty
    is pivotal for the robustness, accuracy, and reliability of the entire DSS algorithm.

    The lowest recorded correlation and values are 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. In
    addition, the -value starts at and decreases as the estimation window expands,
    reaching a minimum of . The consistently high correlation and values across all
    estimation windows suggest that the estimation algorithm performs well in describing
    the dynamics of the soil moisture average. The lowest value of 0.84 indicates
    that, in the worst-case scenario, the COM can explain an 84% of the variability
    in the soil moisture average. On the other hand, the lowest correlation value
    of 0.92 indicates that we are reaching a strong linear relationship between the
    proposed COM and the observed soil moisture averages. The low and decreasing -value
    describes a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the estimations, which
    increases as the estimation window increases. Download : Download high-res image

    The results indicate that the average estimation error across all estimation windows
    is around zero, with maximum standard deviations of . The prediction error is
    similarly centered around zero, exhibiting maximum and minimum errors of . As
    the estimation window increases, the prediction error decreases. However, an increase
    in the prediction error is evidenced on Feb-05. This problem is also observed
    in the estimation analyses, with a decrease in the and correlation. On this particular
    estimation, the commercial sweetcorn field experienced an intense rainfall of
    26.67 mm within 24 h. This led to a substantial change in soil moisture levels,
    which the algorithm failed to estimate accurately, resulting in a peak error of
    3.29%. This behavior shows that close to the desired operation region (between
    the MADP and FC), the soil–water relation can be described as a linear model,
    where our COM can accurately describe the dynamics. However, the COM accuracy
    reduces in extreme events that move the SM content away from the desired operation
    region. Our proposed approach overcomes the uncertainties associated with using
    a simplified modeling approach by considering a recursive parameters estimation
    strategy that lets the model adapt to changing crop and environmental conditions.
    The modeling and estimation approach is capable of accurately describing the soil
    moisture dynamics close to the operation region, overcoming associated uncertainties,
    and can be used as a baseline for making irrigation decisions. To delve deeper
    into the validation and performance of our modeling and estimation approach, a
    comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the estimated parameters is subsequently
    provided. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the parameters and the incidence of
    the estimated parameters in the COM. It can be observed that the parameters associated
    with moisture ( ), irrigation ( ), rain ( ), and temperature ( ) exhibits a low
    dispersion in contrast with the parameter associated to the capillary rise ( ).
    A sensitivity analysis of the estimated parameters can be performed by multiplying
    the obtained parameters by the maximum reported value per respective variable,
    obtaining how much the soil moisture can increase or decrease according to the
    parameter dispersion and the maximum values reported for each variable. The results
    show that during an irrigation period, the soil moisture could (i) decrease a
    1.5% concerning maximum soil moisture of 13.6%; (ii) increase around 3.6% with
    48 h of continuous irrigation; (iii) increase around a 3.7% in relation with 26
    (mm) of rain on a period of 48 h; (iv) decrease around 0.3% with a maximum temperature
    average of 23.3 (°C); and (v) increase around 0.06% in relation with the capillary
    rise. Note that the parameter that shows the high dispersion in the estimation
    process is . However, gives the most significant influence. Moreover, it is observed
    that soil water losses from leaching and runoff could be five times higher than
    the amount lost due to high temperature, which is related to the evapotranspiration
    process. Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Distribution of the parameters and incidence of their distribution
    in the model. Fig. 10 shows that the variations of the estimated parameters are
    distributed close to zero. This dispersion accounts for the expected variation
    that the parameters could present between irrigation periods. For example, in
    the case of rain, from Fig. 9, we have that the parameter associated ( ) is close
    to 0.11. From the standard deviation of , we can expect that this parameter could
    be different around in the next irrigation period. This uncertainty is reflected
    in the prediction of the soil moisture Eq. (16) and in the control action, which
    is taken based on that prediction. For that, the standard deviations of the variation
    of the parameters shown in Fig. 10 are used to add uncertainty and perform a realistic
    simulation in the presence of such uncertainty. The results of the controlled
    system are shown in Fig. 11, where we compare the system’s measured data with
    the expected data if the proposed algorithm is used to manage irrigation. Download

    data is filtered in the process stage. This is important because a similar result
    can be expected by using data from the corresponding weather forecasting services,
    highlighting the importance of the data processing stage in enhancing the algorithm’s
    robustness. On the other hand, it is observed that due to the processing stage,
    rain presents more sensitivity to the added random data. That is because, in the
    case of rain, the limitation to zero of the applied noise affects his distribution.

    how the controlled moisture tries to be around this value. It is important to
    mention that the computation of starts on January 02, when the first prediction
    data is available (see Fig. 7); before that, and are the same. The most notable
    difference between the irrigation scheduling given by the grower and the irrigation
    scheduling computed by the algorithm is that the algorithm does not generate saturated
    irrigation actions of 48 h. The algorithm aims to uphold an average irrigation
    duration of 10 h every two days. This duration fluctuates proportionally with
    forecasted temperature changes (as seen on January 18) and inversely in response
    to anticipated rain events (as evidenced on January 24). On the other hand, the
    decisions taken by the grower show that he is reacting to extreme events. For
    example, on January 18, the irrigation was turned off when the average soil moisture
    reached a maximum of 13.85% (percolation). Also, it is observed that the irrigation
    is turned on on February 01, when the soil moisture is close to reaching the allowable
    depletion point of 7.5%. In contrast, the controlled moisture is close to 9, avoiding
    the environmental impact of percolation and also avoiding the crop risk of reaching
    an allowable depletion point. However, it is important to mention that the decisions
    taken by the grower show expertise in dealing with this complex process on the
    most difficult type of soil (see Fig. 2), avoiding the allowable depletion point
    and maintaining the soil moisture close to the available water region. Fig. 12
    compares the cumulative irrigation hours applied by the grower with those used
    for the proposed algorithm. On February 09, the grower reported a total of 367
    h of irrigation, while the algorithm used a total of 258 h. This result demonstrates
    the potential of our algorithm to save 30% of the water typically used in seepage-irrigated
    crops in Florida. Notably, seepage irrigation systems are known for their low
    efficiency, often falling below 40% (Dukes et al., 2010). Despite this inefficiency,
    they remain prevalent in Florida. According to the current grower records (personal
    communication), a single hectare of seepage-irrigated sweet corn can consume around
    1500 m3 of water per season. Using this volume consumption as a baseline, our
    proposed algorithm has the capacity to increase water use efficiency up to 450
    m3 per hectare per season. This finding underscores the substantial water-saving
    potential of our DSS, highlighting its significance for sustainable agriculture
    if it is adopted in the state of Florida. Download : Download high-res image (176KB)

    of irrigation hours between the grower technique and the recommendations provided
    by the proposed decision support system. Our study demonstrates significant advancements
    in irrigation management, particularly in incorporating information from weather
    forecasting services to optimize irrigation scheduling. Our approach has shown
    reduced irrigation time in response to anticipated rainfall events. This predictive
    capability offers a distinct improvement over fully automated systems as those
    reported by Domínguez-Niño et al. (2020) and approaches that at the beginning
    of the season precalculate irrigation management based on crop models as reported
    by Hodges et al. (2022), where a consistent reduction in irrigation corresponding
    to rainfall is not evident. We also highlight that the proposed strategy integrates
    multiple information sources for optimal irrigation management based on soil moisture
    and water balance. This is an advancement over the traditional approach presented
    by El-Naggar et al. (2020), where the use of soil moisture sensors and soil water
    balances are seen as independent control techniques, which are compared to elucidate
    the most suitable irrigation practices. While the modernization of irrigation
    systems, as discussed by Çetin et al. (2023), is crucial for sustainable agriculture
    and water conservation, it often involves significant initial investments. This
    can be a major barrier in regions still reliant on traditional irrigation methods
    such as seepage. Our research addresses this challenge by demonstrating that substantial
    water savings can be achieved without full-scale modernization and automation
    of irrigation systems. Our study’s results highlight our approach’s environmental
    benefits, presenting it as a cost-effective alternative for enhancing the sustainability
    of irrigation practices in diverse agricultural settings. Future studies involve
    evaluating the algorithm across varied agricultural settings, encompassing different
    soil types, irrigation methods, different regions, and crops. This is crucial
    for assessing its adaptability and efficacy in water conservation. Concurrently,
    efforts will be directed towards integrating this adaptive decision support system
    (DSS) into accessible digital platforms such as smartphone applications and websites,
    simplifying irrigation decision-making for farmers. Enhancing the DSS algorithm
    will involve developing advanced modeling and estimation techniques to accurately
    estimate and forecast soil moisture dynamics under extreme environmental conditions,
    considering their random and complex nature. The enhancement also includes refining
    predictive models and automated control strategies for more precise irrigation
    scheduling. A key aspect is the creation of control algorithms with mixed objectives,
    such as minimizing irrigation while ensuring optimal crop yield. The implementation
    of Kalman filters and stochastic model predictive control techniques to manage
    forecast uncertainty must be explored. 5. Conclusions In this study, we introduced
    a technological solution to enhance the sustainability of water management in
    agriculture. We developed a decision support system algorithm for irrigation scheduling
    using principles from control theory. This algorithm encompasses modeling, processing,
    estimation, and control stages, ensuring the optimality of the model that describes
    the system. During the evaluation, the estimation stage achieved minimum correlation
    coefficients and values of 0.92 and 0.84, respectively. The algorithm integrates
    the parametrized model, processed data, weather forecasting, and human limitations
    to conform an adaptive feedback plus feedforward irrigation predictive control
    strategy that considers human action in the control loop. The algorithm can consistently
    regulate soil moisture, ensuring it remains at desired levels. This approach reduced
    the risks associated with leaching and runoff and offered the potential for water
    savings of up to 30% in seepage irrigated crops on sandy soils. Looking forward,
    we plan to move towards end-user implementation to promote wider adoption and
    benefits of this technological solution. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: Accurate and timely information on evapotranspiration (ET0) is essential
    for multiple agricultural applications, including irrigation scheduling, studying

    forecasting drought conditions. This study aims to examine the spatiotemporal
    patterns of ET0 and facilitate the monitoring of crop water demand, optimize irrigation
    water usage, and enhance agricultural advisory services. This paper estimates
    regional-level daily ET0 gridded data with a spatial resolution of 12.5 km by
    integrating observed weather data, IMD GFS-T1534 reanalysis data, and INSAT-3D
    satellite-based insolation product using the standard FAO56 Penman–Monteith empirical
    equation. The estimated monthly mean of ET0 across India ranged from 10 to 400 mm.
    ET0 exhibited an increasing trend from January to May, reaching its maximum values
    in May. In June, ET0 significantly decreased as the monsoon arrived, coinciding
    with the movement of rainfall patterns. The month of December exhibited the lowest
    ET0 values. The estimated daily gridded ET0 was compared with station-based ET0,
    resulting in daily correlation coefficient R2 and daily maximum absolute percentage
    errors ranging from 0.34 to 0.90 and 10% to 27% respectively. However, these errors
    decreased to a large extent when considering multiday accumulated values. A comparison
    was conducted between the GLDAS model ET0 and the station-estimated values, revealing
    an overestimation of ET0 by the GLDAS model. Additionally, significant variations
    were observed among the meteorological subdivisions. This highlights the necessity
    for proper calibration of the GLDAS model ET0 or its effective agricultural application.

    Variation of Evapotranspiration Derived from Multi-temporal Landsat Datasets using
    FAO-56 Penman-Monteith Method Chapter © 2021 Introduction Agriculture holds significant
    importance in driving the socio-economic growth of developing countries such as
    India, serving as the primary source of livelihood for a substantial portion of
    the population. As per the 2011 Census, the agricultural and allied sector activities
    engage 54.6% of the total workforce (Annual Report 2020–21, 2021). Adequate water
    availability at the right time is crucial for agriculture as it directly influences
    crop yields. However, the impact of climate change has resulted in irregular precipitation
    patterns (Soni et al. 2023), leading to adverse effects on agricultural productivity
    in the country (Abeysekara et al. 2023; Jha et al. 2023; Ondrasek 2014; Zhang
    et al. 2023; Zizinga et al. 2022). Various meteorological and agriculture departments
    actively engage in providing agricultural advisories to farmers. Among these advisories,
    information on when to irrigate and how much to irrigate holds great significance
    for farmers (Cahn and Johnson 2017; Lorite et al. 2012). It not only helps farmers
    to save money and enhance crop productivity but also reduces excessive water usage
    in irrigation. Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a significant role in soil water
    balance models and various crop water requirement-based models, following precipitation.
    These models are instrumental in obtaining accurate estimates for irrigation scheduling
    (Zhang et al. 2011), optimizing irrigation practices, understanding crop water
    requirements, and predicting yields (Attia et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2023; Lee
    et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2022). The availability of daily or weekly ET data, along
    with current soil moisture conditions and weather forecasts, is invaluable in
    accurately determining crop water requirements and helpful in providing timely
    irrigation advisories. This integrated approach enhances the effectiveness of
    water resource management and aids in optimizing agricultural practices (Vuolo
    et al. 2015). Evapotranspiration (ET) encompasses the combined water loss from
    the Earth''s surface through soil evaporation and plant transpiration (Allen et
    al. 1998a; Kite 2000). Evapotranspiration (ET) includes various terms, namely
    potential evapotranspiration (PET), reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and actual
    evapotranspiration (AET). PET represents the maximum amount of water that could
    evaporate and be transpired under optimal conditions, assuming an adequate water
    supply without considering soil moisture constraints. ET0 serves as a benchmark,
    representing the evaporative demand for a reference crop, such as well-watered
    grass, considering sufficient water availability. It helps estimate crop water
    requirements in diverse regions and crops. On the other hand, AET refers to the
    measured or estimated water loss (evaporation and transpiration) specific to a
    particular crop. AET can be derived from ET0 by multiplying it with the crop coefficient
    (kc) (Allen et al. 1998b; Pereira et al. 1999). The estimation of evapotranspiration
    relies on various techniques that utilizes meteorological and satellite data inputs.
    Several empirical equations have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration;
    however, these methods have limitations in terms of data availability and adaptability
    at the local scale (Hargreaves and Samani 1985; Priestley and Taylor 1972; Thornthwaite
    1948; Zhang et al. 2008). Empirical method Penman may require wind calibration
    (Malek 1994), the radiation method performs well in humid conditions where aerodynamic
    influence contribution is comparatively small (Tabari et al. 2013; Vishwakarma
    et al. 2022) and temperature based empirical methods require local calibration
    (Lee 2010). These empirical methods are suitable to estimate the water demand
    at low spatial resolution and monthly time scale. Among the available methods
    FAO-56 Penman Monteith (PM) empirical method estimates evapotranspiration relatively
    accurately and performs consistently for arid, semi-arid, and humid conditions
    at a global scale (Abdollahnejad et al. 2018; Allen et al. 1998a; Subedi and Chávez
    2015) as it includes both thermodynamics and aerodynamic aspects. FAO 56 Penman
    Monteith, a globally accepted empirical equation for estimating evapotranspiration,
    requires multiple inputs such as air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed,
    and relative humidity. However, these inputs are often scarce and rarely available
    across space, making it challenging to accurately estimate water demand. In developing
    countries like India, most of the studies have predominantly focused on the point
    scale due to limited weather station coverage and inconsistent data, which are
    insufficient for capturing precise spatial variability and translate this information
    in agriculture advisories. Choudhury 1997 estimated the monthly global PET from
    the satellite data in which satellite-derived solar radiation, fractional cloud
    cover, air temperature, and vapour pressure were used. Polar and geostationary
    satellite derived near surface air temperature and insolation were used to estimate
    PET estimation in most of the studies (Bois et al. 2008; Cruz-Blanco et al. 2014).
    Baik and Choi 2015 estimated geostationary satellite-based Priestley-Taylor PET
    which was compared with high quality, global land surface model GLDAS (25 km)
    based PET and found significantly overestimated. Rao et al. 2012, estimated station-based
    PET for 51 stations using 8 different empirical methods and found that the modified
    Penman Monteith overestimated mostly during summer and Hargreaves method performed
    better during the northeast monsoon season compared to the other three season.
    Over the past three decades, numerous researchers have dedicated their efforts
    to estimating evapotranspiration using various approaches such as satellite data,
    meteorological data, or a combination of both (Bhattarai et al. 2016; Huerta et
    al. 2022; Ha et al. 2020; Singer et al. 2021; Vyas et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016).
    However, despite these advancements, the full utilization of these methods and
    datasets is hindered by several challenges. One of the main hurdles is the scarcity
    of calibration and validation of datasets, which affects the accuracy and reliability
    of the estimations. Evapotranspiration estimation is significantly influenced
    by solar radiation, as it is directly proportional to it. Even small uncertainties
    in solar radiation measurements can introduce considerable errors in evapotranspiration
    estimation (Heck et al. 2020). However, due to limitations in the availability
    and consistency of solar radiation data, an alternative solution for estimating
    evapotranspiration can be found in satellite-derived high spatial and temporal
    remote-sensed meteorological data. To address the uncertainties in solar radiation,
    this study developed and discussed a data integration approach that combines remotely
    sensed insolation products with observed daily meteorological data. This integration
    enables the estimation of near real-time evapotranspiration at a spatial resolution
    of 12.5 km and a daily temporal scale for the entire country of India. Although
    models such as the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) also provide daily
    evapotranspiration estimates, these models tend to overestimate evapotranspiration
    and cannot be directly used without proper calibration and validation at the regional
    scale. This paper focuses on the discussion and validation of the estimated regional
    evapotranspiration (ET0) specifically in the context of its application in agriculture
    advisory services. The paper is organized as follows: Section \"Material and methods\",
    the paper comprehensively addressed the various components of the study. This
    encompassed discussions about the station observational data covering the 34 meteorological
    sub-divisions, the INSAT 3D insolation product, the gridded observed temperature
    product, and the GLDAS-based evapotranspiration. Moreover, the paper also provided
    insights into the process of deriving the estimated evapotranspiration, outlined
    the statistical methods utilized for error computation, and described the calibration
    procedure employed for result comparison. Section \"Results and discussions\"  focused
    on the patterns of monthly evapotranspiration throughout the region, scrutinizing
    its 3 days to monthly and sub-divisional variations. The calibration coefficients
    for both proposed derived ET0 and GLDAS model-based ET0 were presented, alongside
    statistical comparisons, accuracy assessments, and an exploration of the daily
    temporal variation at the sub-division level. Finally, in the Summary and Conclusion
    section, paper discussed the potential use of satellite data in enhancing the
    quality of agriculture advisories in India and improving various models through
    the utilization of calibrated proposed evapotranspiration. Material and methods
    Study Area This study primarily centers on the Indian subcontinent, encompassing
    a geographical range of latitude 7.5° to 37.5° N and longitude 67.5° to 97.5°
    E. The vast size and diverse topography of India contribute to its remarkably
    varied climate. The agricultural sector and water resources in India greatly rely
    on the southwest monsoon season. This period holds significant importance as certain
    regions receive as much as 75% of their annual rainfall during this time, making
    it a crucial determinant of the country''s overall annual precipitation where
    annual rainfall ranges from 1100 to 2000 mm per year and distribution of rainfall
    over land mass varies widely. From 1901–2020 the monthly mean of average temperature
    varies between 18° C to 29° C with annual mean average of 24° C. The climate of
    India can be categorized into different regions, including tropical, subtropical,
    and arid/semi-arid regions. The tropical regions are predominantly located in
    the southern and eastern parts of the country and are characterized by consistently
    high temperatures throughout the year. Subtropical regions, located in the northern
    and central parts of India, experience seasonal variations in temperature with
    hot summers and cold winters. These regions receive rainfall primarily during
    the monsoon season, although in lesser amounts compared to the tropical regions.
    Arid or semi-arid regions are primarily situated in the northwest and western
    parts of India. These regions face low and erratic rainfall throughout the year,
    resulting in drought conditions and water scarcity (Rajeevan and Nayak 2017; Soni
    et al. 2023). India is divided into 36 meteorological subdivisions based on the
    unique rainfall patterns observed across the country (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 SRTM DEM
    and spatial distribution of IMD Agromet stations in meteorological subdivisions
    of India as follows (1. Andaman & Nicobar, 2. Arunachal Pradesh, 3. Assam and
    Meghalaya, 4. Nagaland-Manipur-Mizoram-Tripura (NMMT), 5. Sub Himalayan West Bengal

    study, we selected 34 Agrometeorological observatories (Table 1) to ensure representation
    from each meteorological subdivision (Fig. 1). This strategic selection facilitated
    effective validation and calibration of the estimated evapotranspiration (ET0).
    The Agromet observatories are equipped with sensors to measure various weather
    variables including maximum and minimum temperature, maximum and minimum relative
    humidity, rainfall, bright sunshine hours, and evaporation. These stations cover
    a wide range of conditions, including rainfed and irrigated areas, diverse weather
    patterns, topography, and soil types. Consequently, the impact of weather and
    other physical variables was thoroughly investigated. Ground observations from
    agricultural fields were collected for the years 2017 and 2018. Table 1 Details
    of IMD Agromet observatories and data used Full size table IMD gridded temperature
    data Temperature is a critical parameter in the estimation of evapotranspiration,
    and the use of accurate data is of utmost importance. In this study, we utilized
    gridded maximum and minimum temperature data obtained from the National Climate
    Centre (NCC) of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) (https://www.imdpune.gov.in/lrfindex.php,
    accessed on August 24th, 2021). This dataset is available at a daily frequency
    with a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° (approximately 2500 km2). It has been
    found to be highly reliable compared to other datasets available for the Indian
    region, exhibiting an error of less than 0.5 °C during cross-validation. Moreover,
    this dataset successfully captures the mean frequency of cold and heat waves,
    as well as temperature anomalies associated with monsoon breaks (Srivastava et
    al. 2009). SRTM DEM data SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital
    Elevation Model) data provides elevation information for nearly the entire Earth’s
    surface, covering approximately 80% of the globe. It is a joint collaboration
    between National Aeronautic Space Administration (NASA), National Geospatial Intelligence
    Agency (NGA), and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It has been widely used in
    various applications such as geology, hydrology, cartography, and terrain analysis.
    In this study, we utilized SRTM 90 m (3 Arc second) spatial resolution DEM data
    (Version 4). This dataset can be accessed through platforms like the United States
    Geological Survey (USGS), NASA''s Earthdata Search, and the CGIAR-CSI SRTM 90
    m Database (https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ accessed on 28th August 2021). SRTM radar
    used C and X bands for the preparation of DEM data which has been further processed
    to fill data voids. (Jarvis et al. 2008). Satellite derived insolation data INSAT
    3D (Indian Geostationary satellite) insolation product, 3DIMG_L2C_INS, provides
    data with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 30 min over
    the Asia Mercator region. This region spans from 44.5°E to 105.5°E longitude and
    10.0°S to 45.5°N latitude. Insolation refers to the total amount of solar radiation
    flux or irradiance in the shortwave range of 0.3 to 3 µm, which reaches the ground
    and consists of a combination of direct and diffuse components of solar radiation
    fluxes. In the retrieval of insolation data from INSAT 3D, two approaches are
    primarily utilized: statistical or empirical methods (Tarpley 1979) and physical
    or radiative transfer methods (Tanahashi et al. 2001). These approaches estimate
    surface insolation by making use of visible and thermal bands. The estimation
    of instantaneous and daily insolation is achieved through the implementation of
    a spectrally integrated irradiance model and a three-layer cloudy model, using
    the INSAT 3D visible (VIS), water vapor (WV), and thermal infrared (IR) bands
    (Bhattacharya et al. 2013). A trapezoidal integration was applied to construct
    the daily value from the instantaneous global irradiances in MJm−2. The INSAT
    3D insolation product exhibits significantly higher accuracy compared to other
    available products, such as Heliosat SARAH-E and the NASA MERRA-2 reanalysis product,
    with improvements of approximately 42.5% and 43.8% respectively (Kamath and Srinivasan
    2020). Weather forecast model GFS T1534 reanalysis products IMD runs weather forecast
    model GFS T1534 twice daily (00 and 12 UTC) on a horizontal spatial scale of 12.5
    km and on a vertical scale of 64 hybrid sigma-pressure layers with a top layer
    centered around 0.27 hPa (~ 55 km) to generate 10 days’ deterministic forecast
    in advance on MIHIR HPCS (Sridevi et al. 2020). The model gives the post-processed
    output parameters at 25 km and 12.5 km spatial resolution. The atmospheric forecast
    model used in GFS is a global spectral model (GSM) with spherical harmonic functions.
    The IMD GFS T1534 operational model’s dynamical core is based on two-time level
    semi-implicit Lagrangian discretization with three dimensional Hermite interpolation
    (Sela 2010). The initial conditions are prepared at BHASKARA HPCS, NCMRWF to run
    the IMD-GFS model using NCEP Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) based hybrid Global
    Data Assimilation System (GDAS) (Buehner et al. 2013). The model is based on the
    usual expressions of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy at T1534 spectral
    truncation 12.5 km physics Gaussian grid and 64 levels in a hybrid sigma-pressure
    vertical grid (Kumar et al. 2019). The detailed structure and physics of the Global
    Forecast System (GFS) are available at http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/GFS/doc.php.
    Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) The GLDAS model integrates satellite
    and ground-based information using advanced land surface modelling and data assimilation
    techniques to produce the optimal field of land surface states and fluxes (Rodell
    et al. 2004). The reanalysed datasets through the common land model (CLM), variable
    infiltration capacity model (VIC), and Noah LSM are available at GLDAS websites
    (http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/) at various spatial scales (0.25° and 1°) and
    temporal scale (3 h and monthly). In this study, the GLDAS 0.25° (GLDAS_NOAH025_3H
    2.1) has been used. Methodology The FAO-56 Penman–Monteith empirical method is
    widely employed for accurately estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0).
    However, this method necessitates a significant number of weather inputs, including
    radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed, and vapor pressure.
    Unfortunately, these inputs are often not readily available at a suitable spatial
    and temporal scale in standard weather observatories. To address this issue of
    data scarcity from ground stations, we utilized a derived insolation product from
    the geostationary satellite INSAT-3D to estimate net radiation. Additionally,
    we incorporated observed India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded temperature
    data, IMD GFS model-based reanalysed data for relative humidity and wind speed,
    and SRTM DEM elevation data. The inclusion of observed and analysed inputs in
    the model yielded comparatively more accurate results in comparison to utilizing
    a general model for estimating ET0. FAO-56 Penman–Monteith empirical reference
    ET 0 framework In 1948, Penman developed an empirical equation to estimate evaporation
    from an open water surface (Penman 1948). This equation takes into account meteorological
    parameters such as sunshine, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, utilizing
    an approach based on energy balance and mass transfer (see Fig. 2 and Table 2).
    Subsequently, this method was expanded to include cropped surfaces by incorporating
    factors such as aerodynamic resistance and surface resistance. The FAO proposed
    a standard parameterization of the Penman–Monteith empirical method (Monteith
    1981) for the estimation of daily grass reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from
    a well-irrigated, homogenous, 0.12 m grass crop height, a fixed surface resistance
    of 70 s m-1, and an albedo of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a). This empirical method,
    hereafter referred to as PM, is a standard worldwide acceptable method to compute
    the daily reference ET0 in mm and calculated as follows: $${ET}_{0}=\\frac{0.408\\Delta
    \\left({R}_{n}-G\\right)+\\gamma \\frac{900}{T+273}{u}_{2}({e}_{s}-{e}_{a})}{\\Delta
    +\\gamma (1+0.34{u}_{2})}$$ (1) where ET0 is the grass-reference evapotranspiration
    in mm day−1, Rn is net solar radiance at crop surface in MJ m−2 day−1, G is solar
    heat flux density in MJ m−2 day−1, T is the air temperature at 2 m height in °C,
    u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height in m s−1, es is saturation vapour pressure
    in kPa, ea is actual vapour pressure in kPa, (es—ea) is saturation vapour pressure
    deficit in kPa, ∆ is slope vapour pressure curve in kPa °C−1, γ is psychrometric
    constant equivalent to 0.665 × 10–3 P in kPa °C−1. Fig. 2 Flow chart to estimate
    daily ET0 using FAO-56 Penman Monteith empirical framework Full size image Table
    2 Data used Full size table Saturation vapour pressure eo(T) kPa at temperature
    T °C is computed using below empirical equation $${e}^{o}\\left(T\\right)=0.6108{\\text{exp}}\\left[\\frac{17.27{\\text{T}}}{{\\text{T}}+237.3}\\right]$$
    (2) Due to the nonlinearity of Eq. 2, the mean saturation vapour pressure for
    a day should be computed as the mean between the saturation vapour pressure at
    the mean daily maximum and minimum air temperature for that period. $${e}_{s}=\\frac{{e}^{o}({T}_{max})+{e}^{o}({T}_{min})}{2}$$
    (3) Actual vapour pressure (ea) computed from the relative humidity and saturation
    vapour pressure using below empirical equation $${e}_{a}=\\frac{{e}^{o}\\left({T}_{min}\\right)*\\frac{{RH}_{max}}{100}+{e}^{o}\\left({T}_{max}\\right)*\\frac{{RH}_{min}}{100}}{2}$$
    (4) The slope vapour pressure curve (∆) [kPa °C-1] at a given ait temperature
    T°C is computed by $$\\Delta =\\frac{4098 [0.6108exp\\left(\\frac{17.27T}{T+237.3}\\right)]}{{(T+237.2)}^{2}}$$
    (5) The psychrometric constant (γ) is computed using P daily mean atmospheric
    pressure (kPa), λ the latent heat of vaporization (2.45 MJ kg−1), Cp the specific
    heat at constant pressure (1.013 × 10–3 MJ kg−1 °C−1), ε ratio molecular weight
    of water vapor/ dry air (0.622) given by $$\\gamma =\\frac{{C}_{p}P}{\\varepsilon
    \\lambda }=0.000665 P$$ (6) where mean atmospheric pressure P (kPa) can be computed
    from the elevation in meters z by using the below equation $$P=101.3 (\\frac{293-0.0065
    z}{293}{)}^{5.26}$$ (7) Wind speed at 2 m height is required to compute ET0. Generally,
    in meteorology operations anemometers are placed at 10 m height and in agrometeorology
    it is placed at the 2 m or 3 m height. To adjust the wind speed data a logarithmic
    wind speed profile is used for measurement above a short-grassed surface $${u}_{2}={u}_{z}
    \\frac{4.87}{{\\text{ln}}(67.8 z-5.42)}$$ (8) The soil heat flux (G) is the energy
    that is used in heating the soil. The positive value of G shows that the soil
    is warming and negative value of G shows the soil is cooling. In the estimation
    of ET0, soil heat flux is negligible compared to Rn when the surface is fully
    covered with vegetation $$G\\approx 0$$ (9) Net solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1)
    is the difference between net shortwave solar radiation and net longwave solar
    radiation. $${R}_{n}={R}_{net\\;shortwave}-{R}_{net\\;longwave}$$ (10) $${R}_{net\\;shortwave}=\\left(1-\\alpha
    \\right) {R}_{Surface\\;insolation}$$ (11) where α is the albedo of a hypothetical
    grass reference crop with a value of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a). The earth absorbs
    the solar radiation and converts it to heat energy. Some of the longwave radiation
    is absorbed by the atmosphere and some of loses into space. Net longwave solar
    radiation (Rnl) is computed using the empirical equation $${R}_{nl}=\\sigma \\left[\\frac{{T}_{max,
    k}^{4}+{T}_{min, k}^{4}}{2}\\right]\\left(0.34-0.14\\sqrt{{e}_{a}}\\right)\\left(1.35\\frac{{R}_{s}}{{R}_{so}}-0.35\\right)$$
    (12) where Rnl is net outgoing longwave radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), σ is Stefan-Boltzmann
    constant (4.903 X 10–9 MJ K−2 m−2 day−1), Tmax, k is the maximum absolute temperature
    during 24 h period in Kelvin, Tmin, k is minimum absolute temperature during 24
    h period in Kelvin, ea is actual vapour pressure (kPa), Rs is solar radiation
    (MJ m−2 day−1), Rso is clear sky radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), and Rs/Rso is relative
    shortwave radiation (limited to ≤ 1.0). Clear sky radiation can be computed $${R}_{so}=\\left(0.75+2
    X {10}^{-5} Z\\right) {R}_{a}$$ (13) where Z is the station elevation above sea
    level (m) and Ra is the extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). The extraterrestrial
    radiation can be computed $${R}_{a}=\\frac{24 \\left(60\\right)}{\\Pi }{G}_{sc}{d}_{r}\\left[{\\omega
    }_{s}{\\text{sin}}\\left(\\phi \\right){\\text{sin}}\\left(\\delta \\right)+{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\phi
    \\right){\\text{cos}}\\left(\\delta \\right){\\text{sin}}\\left({\\omega }_{s}\\right)\\right]$$
    (14) where Ra is extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), Gsc is solar constant
    equal to 0.0820 MJ m−2 min−1, dr is inverse relative distance between Earth and
    Sun, ωs is sunset hour angle in radian, ϕ is latitude in radian, δ is solar decimation
    in radian. $${d}_{r}=1+0.033\\;cos\\;\\left(\\frac{2\\Pi J}{365}\\right)$$ (15)
    $$\\delta =0.409\\;{\\text{sin}}\\;\\left(\\frac{2\\Pi J}{365}-1.39\\right)$$
    (16) where dr is inverse distance between the earth and the sun, δ is the solar
    decimation angle, and J is the number of days between 1 to 365 or 366 in Julian
    date. $${\\omega }_{s}=arccos\\left(-{\\text{tan}}(\\phi ){\\text{tan}}(\\delta
    )\\right)$$ (17) where ωs is sunset hour angle and ranges between -1 to 1. Daylight
    hours are calculated from the sunset angle in radians $$N = \\frac{24 {\\omega
    }_{s}}{\\pi }$$ (18) Solar radiation is derived from the station measured bright
    sunshine hours (BSSH) and day light hours (N) using an empirical equation. $$Solar\\;Radiation=a+\\left(\\frac{b*BSSH}{N}\\right)*
    {R}_{a}$$ (19) where a = 0.25 and b = 0.5 are constants, Ra is extraterrestrial
    radiation and N is daylight hours. Statistical analysis used for error estimation
    A statistical analysis was conducted to compare the estimates from weather stations
    with the estimated gridded reference evapotranspiration (ET0) data. Evaluation
    metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error
    (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE)
    were calculated at both daily and monthly temporal scales. Mean Absolute Percentage
    Error (MAPE) MAPE is a measure of prediction accuracy in the percentage of predicted
    (P) with respect to observed data (O). It is calculated using the below empirical
    equation $$MAPE=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left|\\frac{{O}_{i}-{P}_{i}}{{O}_{i}}\\right|}{n}
    X 100$$ (20) Coefficient of determination (R2) The coefficient of determination
    (R-squared) is basically “goodness of fit” and is the proportion of the fluctuations
    in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. R2
    values varyvary between 0 to 1, where 1 represents a perfect fit and 0 represents
    that the model fails. $${R}^{2}= {\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}({O}_{i} - \\overline{O
    })({P}_{i} - \\overline{P })}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({O}_{i} - \\overline{O })}^{2}}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({P}_{i}
    - \\overline{P })}^{2}}}\\right]}^{2}$$ (21) where Oi is daily observed ET0 and
    Pi is daily estimated gridded ET0. Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE)
    The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) is a normalized statistic that determines
    the relative magnitude of the residual variance (“noise”) compared to the measured
    data variance (“information”) (Nash and Sutcliffe 1970). The NSE varies between
    1 (perfect fit) to -∞. The NSE less than 0 indicates that the mean value of observed
    time series data would have been a better predicator than the simulated model
    time series data. $$NSE=1- \\left[\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({O}_{i} - {P}_{i}
    \\right)}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({O}_{i} - \\overline{O }\\right)}^{2}}\\right]$$
    (22) where Oi is daily observed ET0 and Pi is daily estimated gridded ET0. Bias
    correction In this study, we utilized the simple and data-efficient linear bias
    correction statistical method. To accurately capture weather conditions and ET0,
    we computed a yearly scale factor (α) based on a time series of station-estimated
    ET0 and gridded-estimated ET0 data (Eq. 23). To overcome the limitations arising
    from limited data availability, we considered meteorological subdivisions, which
    group regions exhibiting similar weather patterns. For each subdivision, we determined
    a bias scale factor by leveraging ground station data. This approach effectively
    encompasses the wide spectrum of weather conditions and evapotranspiration patterns

    (23) Probability of Detection (POD) The performance diagram (Roebber 2009) is
    a valuable tool for comparing the probability of detection (POD) and success ratio
    (SR) between two datasets: estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS model ET0. It utilizes
    a contingency table (Table 3) to assess hits, false alarms, misses, and missing
    rejections when comparing observed values to derived products. This diagram enables
    a comprehensive evaluation of these metrics, providing insights into the performance
    and agreement of the datasets. The comparison was conducted between the gridded
    estimated ET0, GLDAS ET0, and station-estimated ET0 for the period 2017–2018.
    ET0 values were categorized as low (0–5 mm), medium (5–10 mm), and high (10–15
    mm), allowing for a thorough analysis of dataset performance within different
    ET0 ranges. Table 3 Contingency table Full size table $$Probability\\;of\\;Detection\\;(POD)=

    (26) Results and discussions Spatiotemporal distribution of ET 0 over the Indian
    region Evapotranspiration varies throughout the year in response to seasonal changes,
    as it is influenced by factors such as radiation and temperature. Figure 3 illustrates
    the spatiotemporal variations of monthly ET0. From January to May, ET0 gradually
    increases due to rising in surface temperatures. However, from June to September,
    ET0 decreases as the southwest monsoon arrives and progresses. During October
    to December, ET0 further decreases due to declining surface temperatures. Notably,
    in January and February, certain regions such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Central Maharashtra,
    Karnataka, Telangana, West Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu exhibit comparatively
    high ET0 values to other regions. These elevated ET0 values during the Rabi season
    may necessitate field-level interventions for risk management, especially if they
    coincide with critical stages of Rabi crops like wheat. Fig. 3 Spatiotemporal
    distribution of monthly ET0 over the Indian region Full size image From March
    onwards until the onset of the monsoon, ET0 rapidly increases over India, except
    in extreme north and northeast regions, due to the rise in temperature and solar
    radiation. As the monsoon arrives and progresses, ET0 values decrease. However,
    in rainfed regions, where Kharif crops depend on rainfall, it is essential to
    regularly monitor water stress in plants to address the high evapotranspiration
    demand and provide timely irrigation. The regular monitoring of evapotranspiration
    under the present climate variability and erratic monsoon behaviour is crucial
    for effective climate risk management. The North-eastern and Western Ghats region
    of India exhibited minimal annual variability in ET0 values, primarily due to
    consistently low temperatures throughout the year. On the other hand, the northwestern,
    central, and certain areas of the northern plains (Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya
    Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh) experienced the highest annual variability
    in ET0. The monthly sub-division wise heatmap (Fig. 4) clearly illustrates that
    these regions, including East and West Rajasthan, N. I. Karnataka, Coastal A.
    P., Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Rayalaseema, Marathwada, and Madhya Pradesh, consistently
    show high ET0 values throughout most months of the year. As these regions are
    predominantly rainfed and prone to drought (Soni et al. 2023), accurate ET0 values
    are crucial for planning appropriate crop types and cropping patterns to maximize
    agricultural productivity. Fig. 4 Sub-division wise monthly temporal variation
    of ET0 Full size image Daily temporal variation of ET 0 at meteorological subdivision
    level Regions such as hilly and coastal areas exhibit relatively low temporal
    variation in ET0 (Fig. 4), ranging from 0.8 mm to 6.5 mm. On the other hand, the
    northern plains, central and southern parts of India (excluding the coastal region)
    display high temporal variation, with values ranging from 0.8 mm to 12.14 mm throughout
    the year. These rainfed regions, characterized by significant variations in the
    southwest monsoon, are susceptible to drought, highlighting the need for timely
    information to assess and manage irrigation scheduling and other agricultural
    operations. In the time series (Fig. 5), it is clear that the ET0 is following
    the same pattern and temporal variation for years 2017 and 2018. Central and few
    areas of the Northern plains of India (Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar,
    and Uttar Pradesh) shows high standard deviation with variation of 1.44 to 2.23
    mm, North-eastern region shows a low standard deviation with a variation 0.9 to
    1.0 mm, northern hilly region varies 1.26 to 1.85 mm, coastal region varies 0.8
    to 1.68 mm, and south region except coastal varies 1.1 to 1.68 mm. Spatial analysis
    of ET0 carried out (Rao et al. 2012) also reflects the low ET0 value over hilly
    and coastal regions whereas comparatively high values over arid regions and central
    India due to high advective energy and high atmospheric demand over the area.

    ET0 with station estimated ET0 for the year 2017 and 2018 Full size image Calibration
    of satellite based ET 0 estimates The calibration and validation of estimated
    gridded ET0 at the sub-divisional level provide greater confidence in the agricultural
    scientific community when issuing advisories to farmers and planners. A linear
    bias correction method was employed to estimate the bias correction factor (α)
    for the years 2017 and 2018. Figure 6 depicts that the bias factor remains relatively
    stable for both years, except in Himachal Pradesh where there was limited data
    available for the year 2018. In this study, the bias correction factor (α) was
    derived from the 2017 data and applied as a correction factor to the daily estimated
    gridded ET0 for 2018. Different seasons are influenced by various parameters impacting
    ET0, as evidenced by the sensitivity analysis of the PM empirical equation (Bois
    et al. 2008). For example, wind speed exhibits the highest sensitivity during
    winters, while net solar radiation holds greater influence during the summer season.
    The study also suggests conducting seasonal calibration to minimize errors introduced
    by input parameters. The estimated gridded ET0 generally tends to be overestimated
    across all meteorological subdivisions, but it exhibits a strong correlation with
    the station estimates. Figure 7 demonstrates a significant reduction (ranging
    from 60 to 80%) in MAPE error in subdivisions like Himachal Pradesh and Punjab,
    both at daily and monthly scales. The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) statistics
    (Fig. 8) generally indicate values below 0.5, except for Chhattisgarh, Coastal
    AP, East MP, Kerala, Rayalaseema, and Saurashtra. However, after applying bias
    correction calibration, the ET0 of 79% of the meteorological subdivisions showed
    improvement, with values exceeding 0.5. Fig. 6 Bias correction factor (α)comparison

    and calibrated gridded ET0 Full size image Fig. 8 NSE comparison of non–calibrated
    and calibrated gridded ET0 Full size image Statistical comparison of estimated
    gridded ET 0 with station ET 0 Stations were carefully chosen to cover every meteorological
    subdivision, ensuring comprehensive coverage. The evaluation of the estimated
    gridded ET0 performance was conducted at different temporal scales, ranging from
    daily to monthly, using statistical parameters such as R2, NSE, and MAPE. Substantial
    variations in the statistical parameters were observed among the meteorological
    subdivisions at the daily scale, but the accuracy significantly improved when
    comparing the datasets at higher temporal scales. The daily coefficient of correlation
    (R2) values between the datasets of station estimates and nearest grid estimates
    of gridded ET0 varied from 0.34 to 0.9. A notable improvement was observed at
    the 3-day accumulated temporal scale, where R2 values ranged from 0.68 to 0.94.
    Subsequently, further improvement in accuracy was observed at higher temporal
    scales (Fig. 9). The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) score, comparing station
    estimates and nearest grid estimates of gridded ET0, exhibited a similar trend
    (ranging from 0.16 to 0.88) to the coefficient of correlation (R2), with a low
    NSE value in subdivisions such as Coastal Karnataka, S. I. Karnataka, and N.I.
    Karnataka (Fig. 10). Since NSE measures the relative accuracy of the model estimates
    compared to the average observed value, it is evident that accuracy improves with
    a higher temporal scale, highlighting the quantitative improvement in accuracy.
    The Maximum Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) ranged from 10 to 27% on the daily
    scale, and a notable reduction in error was observed as the temporal scale increased
    (Fig. 11). High MAPE (> 20%) values over the Arunachal Pradesh. Bihar, Concan
    and Goa, Gangetic WB, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, SHWB, Uttarakhand, and
    West UP meteorological subdivisions and low MAPE (< 15%) values over East MP,
    Kerala, Odisha, Rayalaseema, Sourashtra, Telangana, and West MP. Fig. 9 R2 comparison
    between the estimated station and gridded ET0 at various temporal scales Full

    regions (Coastal Karnataka, Gangetic WB, Odisha, Kerala, Konkan & Goa, N. I. Karnataka,
    S. I. Karnataka, and Tamilnadu) and certain hilly regions (Arunachal Pradesh,
    Assam & Meghalaya, and NMMT) display higher MAPE errors and lower values of R2
    and NSE. These differences can be primarily due to the uncertainty in wind data
    in coastal areas and temperature variations in hilly regions. Considering the
    inherent variations in daily ET0, its practicality in agriculture advisory may
    be somewhat limited when compared to the more reliable multiday accumulated ET0
    values. The multiday accumulated ET0 values demonstrate a significant enhancement
    in accuracy and can be harnessed effectively for diverse agricultural planning
    purposes such as water budgeting, irrigation scheduling, and more. Statistical
    comparison of GLDAS model ET 0 with station ET 0 The Global Land Data Assimilation
    System (GLDAS) provides a 3-hourly ET0 product that can be accumulated over different
    time intervals, ranging from daily to monthly, for comparison with station-estimated
    ET0. When assessing ET0 at a daily scale, the GLDAS model-based ET0 exhibited
    satisfactory agreement in most of the meteorological subdivisions, with correlation
    coefficients ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 and NSE coefficients ranging from -1.3 to
    0.8 (Fig. 12). Without calibration, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
    varied from 74 to 233%, but after calibration, it decreased to a range of 12%
    to 52% (Fig. 13). In summary, it can be concluded that the GLDAS ET0 tends to
    significantly overestimate values and, therefore, requires calibration before
    practical use. Fig. 12 NSE comparison of non–calibrated and calibrated GLDAS ET0
    Full size image Fig. 13 MAPE comparison of Non calibrated and calibrated GLDAS
    ET0 Full size image The meteorological subdivisions of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam
    & Meghalaya, Coastal Karnataka, Gangetic WB, N. I. Karnataka, NMMT, Odisha, S.
    I. Karnataka, and SHWB displayed a weak correlation (R2 less than 0.5) at the
    daily scale. Furthermore, there was no observed improvement in the North Eastern
    subdivisions of Arunachal Pradesh, NMMT, and SHWB even at the monthly time scale.
    The NSE score also indicated a poor relationship between the datasets in most
    of the subdivisions, with negative values observed for Arunachal Pradesh, Assam
    and Meghalaya, Coastal Karnataka, NMMT, Odisha, SHWB, and Tamil Nadu. Although
    some subdivisions like Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Jharkhand, Gangetic WB, and Assam and
    Meghalaya showed good agreement (R2), the NSE score clearly indicates poor relative
    accuracy of the model estimates compared to the average observed value (Figs.
    14 and 15). Fig. 14 R2 comparison between the estimated station and GLDAS ET0
    at various temporal scale Full size image Fig. 15 NSE comparison between the estimated
    station and GLDAS ET0 at various temporal scales Full size image Statistical comparison
    of GLDAS ET 0 with estimated gridded ET 0 GLDAS ET0 estimates are valuable but
    they have certain limitations. The model relies on input data and has certain
    assumptions that may introduce uncertainties. Local calibration and validation
    are necessary to improve the accuracy in a specific region. As mentioned in the
    earlier section, it was observed that the GLDAS model overestimated ET0, indicating
    that the overall ET0 values are reduced by approximately 54% after bias correction
    (Fig. 16). Season-wise analysis was conducted for both calibrated estimated gridded
    ET0 and calibrated GLDAS ET0. As shown in Fig. 17, the RMSE error was found to
    be higher during the Monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons across most subdivisions.
    In contrast, it was lower during the post-monsoon and winter seasons, which can
    be attributed to the lower temperatures and solar radiation during those periods.
    A similar pattern was observed in GLDAS ET0, although with a higher standard deviation
    and RMSE, as depicted in Fig. 18. In the winter and post-monsoon seasons, the
    estimated gridded ET0 exhibits a low RMSE, with most stations recording values
    below 0.5 mm. Furthermore, there is a strong correlation agreement ranging from
    0.6 to 0.9 among all stations, except for Jharkhand. However, in the case of GLDAS
    ET0, the RMSE values for most stations range from 0.4 to 1 mm, with a correlation
    agreement ranging from 0.2 to 0.9, except for Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu, and SHWB.
    During the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, the estimated gridded ET0 shows an
    RMSE ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm, with approximately 80% of stations displaying a
    correlation greater than 0.6. On the other hand, GLDAS ET0 exhibits an RMSE ranging
    from 0.5 to 1.5 mm, with around 60% of stations correlating greater than 0.6.
    The accuracy of both datasets is relatively lower during the monsoon season, and
    they demonstrate similar behaviour to the pre-monsoon period. The findings of
    the study indicate that GLDAS ET0 can be reliably utilized during the post-monsoon
    and winter seasons. However, for the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, further
    investigation and calibration of the GLDAS model ET0 are recommended to enhance
    its accuracy in those periods. Fig. 16 Bias correction factor comparison between
    GLDAS ET0 and estimated gridded ET0 Full size image Fig. 17 Season wise comparison
    between Station ET0 and estimated gridded ET0 Full size image Fig. 18 Season wise
    comparison between Station ET0 and GLDAS ET0 Full size image Probability of detection
    (POD) The estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS ET0 were compared to ground observations
    for the period 2017–2018. The datasets were divided into three categories based
    on ET0 values: low (0–5 mm), medium (5–10 mm), and high (10–15 mm). In Fig. 19,
    the performance of the two datasets is represented by POD and SR scores for the
    low (red) and medium range ET0 (black) categories, which show good agreement.
    However, the performance of GLDAS ET0 in the medium range (5–10 mm) is not as
    good. In the case of the high ET0 (10–15 mm) category, both datasets exhibit degraded
    performance, but the estimated gridded ET0 shows a relatively higher probability
    of detection with a POD of 0.4 and SR of 0.9 than the GLDAS ET0. Fig. 19 Performance
    plot of estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS ET0 Full size image Summary and conclusions
    This paper examines the spatiotemporal distribution of reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) patterns across various meteorological regions of India. The study proposed
    a gridded ET0 dataset which is generated through the integration of observed gridded
    data, model reanalysis products, and satellite data. Furthermore, the study includes
    a comprehensive statistical comparison with station estimates and other available
    sources as well, such as the GLDAS model ET0. The analysis highlights the importance
    of monitoring evapotranspiration, especially in rainfed regions and during climate
    variability, for effective climate risk management and agricultural planning.
    Different regions of India show varying levels of annual and temporal variability
    in ET0 values, with coastal and hilly areas showing lower variability compared
    to regions like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh.
    Calibration of various model based ET0 is crucial for precise advisories to farmers
    and planners. The study employs a linear bias correction method and suggests conducting
    seasonal calibration to minimize errors introduced by input parameters. The analysis
    demonstrates improvements in accuracy and correlation between estimated gridded
    ET0 and station ET0 values after calibration. However, discrepancies still exist,
    particularly in coastal and hilly regions, indicating the need for further improvement
    in those areas. The study also compares the GLDAS model-based ET0 with station-estimated
    ET0. GLDAS ET0 tends to overestimate values and requires calibration for practical
    use. The analysis shows varying levels of agreement and accuracy between GLDAS
    ET0 and station ET0 across different meteorological subdivisions and seasons.
    Probability of detection (POD) analysis is also performed to assess the performance
    of estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS ET0 in different ET0 value categories. The
    estimated gridded ET0 demonstrates better performance, particularly in the high
    ET0 range, compared to GLDAS ET0. The findings of this study can also contribute
    to the global model datasets to calibrate the models at the regional level. In
    developing countries like India, establishing and maintaining a dense network
    of observatories for reliable and accurate weather data is challenging. However,
    leveraging satellite data and high-resolution models in the current era allows
    for capturing spatial variability and identifying vulnerable areas, enabling prompt
    advisories and solutions. In summary, this study highlights the significance of
    precise ET0 estimation for agricultural planning, risk management, and irrigation
    scheduling, while emphasizing the regional and seasonal variations in ET0 patterns
    across India. Data availability The data that support the findings of this study

  description: In the field management of oil crops such as soybean and peanut, the
    supply and demand of water and fertilizer are not synchronized, and the decision-making
    of water and fertilizer application is not accurate, which seriously affects the
    yield and quality of oil crops. Therefore, a precise irrigation method based on-demand
    for oil crops has been proposed to achieve dynamic water and fertilizer regulation
    during the growth process of oil crops. An estimation model for soil relative
    moisture content at different depths of regional plots was constructed. Through
    real-time monitoring of meteorological data and combined with each irrigation
    data, daily estimation of soil relative moisture content at different depths of
    regional plots was achieved. Taking peanuts as an example, based on the daily
    relative soil moisture content, weather forecasts and historical meteorological
    data were integrated to dynamically develop irrigation and fertilization plans
    for future oil crop growth processes. The results showed that the constructed
    model for estimating the relative soil moisture content solved the problem of
    single monitoring point being difficult to represent the soil moisture content
    of regional plots, and improved the accuracy of irrigation decisions based on
    the relative soil moisture content of regional plots. Based on the estimation

    of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download conference paper PDF 1 Introduction Oil crops, as
    an important source of edible vegetable oil and plant protein in China, are currently
    highly dependent on foreign countries. There are some problems in the field management
    of domestic oil crops such as soybean and peanut, such as the unsynchronized supply
    and demand of water and fertilizer, and the inaccurate decision-making of water
    and fertilizer application [3], which have seriously affected the yield and quality
    of oil crops. The integrated technology of water and fertilizer, such as drip
    irrigation under mulch [4], provides a reliable technical means for improving
    the quality and efficiency of oil crops. However, how to achieve dynamic regulation
    of water and fertilizer during the growth process of oil crops through precise
    irrigation according to demand is a technical challenge. After literature exploration
    of existing technologies, it was found that Wang Dong et al. [5] disclosed a method
    of on-demand supplementary irrigation for crops, with the goal of water-saving
    and high-yield crops. Through the on-demand supplementary irrigation model for
    crops, precise water-saving irrigation was implemented. However, the establishment
    of the model in the article did not consider the impact of future crop evapotranspiration
    loss on soil water storage, and how to plan topdressing during the supplementary
    irrigation process were not involved. Yuan Jin et al. [6] disclosed an integrated
    intelligent control system and method for field water and fertilizer based on
    multi-source information fusion. Taking into account factors such as weather forecasting,
    cloud computing platforms, real-time meteorological data collection, and crop
    growth during the growth process, corresponding irrigation and fertilization decisions
    were made. However, in the article, the weather forecast only considers data from
    the next three days for irrigation decision-making, and global water and fertilizer
    regulation optimization during crop growth were not involved. Huo Junli et al.
    [7] disclosed a cloud computing method, cloud computing platform, and irrigation
    terminal for irrigation decision-making based on maximizing rainfall utilization.
    The irrigation cloud was a water balance calculation based on maximizing rainfall
    utilization, and the calculation process relied on data detected by soil moisture
    sensors embedded in advance at a predetermined depth. However, relying solely
    on point measurement was difficult to accurately represent the soil moisture content
    between regional plots. Moreover, the formulation of irrigation strategies did
    not involve how to apply fertilizer. Therefore, in response to the above issues,
    a precise irrigation method based on-demand for oil crops has been proposed to
    achieve dynamic water and fertilizer regulation during the growth process of oil
    crops. 2 Establishing an Estimation Model for Relative Soil Moisture Content at
    Different Depths of Regional Plots At present, the regional plots are affected
    by factors such as inconsistent rainfall and drainage differences [8], differences
    in root water absorption capacity due to different crop growth [9], and uneven
    irrigation [10], resulting in differences in soil relative water content at different
    locations and depths on the same plane of the regional plot. Therefore, a single
    monitoring point is difficult to represent the soil moisture content of a regional
    plot. Although setting up multiple sensor nodes can compensate for the errors
    caused by a single monitoring point [11], the cost increases accordingly, and
    the selection of deployment points still has randomness. Therefore, through theoretical
    derivation, a model for estimating the relative soil moisture content at different
    depths of regional plots is established to improve the accuracy of irrigation
    decisions based on the relative soil moisture content of regional plots (Fig.
    1). Fig. 1. Schematic diagram for estimating relative soil moisture content Full
    size image Assuming that field water capacity of the oil crop planting plot is
    \\(\\theta_{fc}\\), soil bulk density is \\(\\rho_{soil}\\), and water density
    is \\(\\rho_{water}\\), the model establishment process is as follows: ① The underground
    soil of the regional plot is divided into n layers, each with a height of h1,
    h2,…, hn (Fig. 2). Multiple sampling points are selected in the middle of each
    layer to measure the soil mass moisture content using the drying method, and the
    average value is taken to represent the soil mass moisture content of this layer.
    The soil mass moisture content of the corresponding h1 layer, h2 layer, …, hn
    layer is \\(\\theta_{m1} ,\\theta_{m2} ,...,\\theta_{mn}\\), and \\(\\theta_{mc}\\)
    is the corresponding mass moisture content when the soil reaches the field water
    capacity. The soil mass moisture content of layer h1 is \\(\\theta_{m1}\\), which
    is equivalent to an equivalent irrigation height of \\(\\theta_{m1} \\times (\\rho_{soil}
    /\\rho_{water} ) \\times h_{1}\\). The minimum irrigation height of layer h1 soil
    from \\(\\theta_{m1}\\) to \\(\\theta_{mc}\\) is \\(h_{m1} = (\\theta_{mc} - \\theta_{m1}
    ) \\times (\\rho_{soil} /\\rho_{water} ) \\times h_{1}\\). The soil mass moisture
    content of layer h2 is \\(\\theta_{m2}\\), which is equivalent to an equivalent
    irrigation height of \\(\\theta_{m2} \\times (\\rho_{soil} /\\rho_{water} ) \\times
    h_{2}\\). The minimum irrigation height of layer h2 soil from \\(\\theta_{m2}\\)
    to \\(\\theta_{mc}\\) is \\(h_{m2} = (\\theta_{mc} - \\theta_{m2} ) \\times (\\rho_{soil}
    /\\rho_{water} ) \\times h_{2}\\). By analogy, the soil mass moisture content
    of layer hn is \\(\\theta_{mn}\\), which is equivalent to an equivalent irrigation
    height of \\(\\theta_{mn} \\times (\\rho_{soil} /\\rho_{water} ) \\times h_{n}\\).
    The minimum irrigation height of layer h2 soil from \\(\\theta_{mn}\\) to \\(\\theta_{mc}\\)
    is \\(h_{mn} = (\\theta_{mc} - \\theta_{mn} ) \\times (\\rho_{soil} /\\rho_{water}
    ) \\times h_{n}\\). The formula for calculating the relative moisture content
    of soil with a ground depth of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{k} {h_{i} }\\) is as
    follows: $$ \\theta _{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{k} {h_{i} } }} =
    \\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{k} {(\\theta _{{mi}} *h_{i} } )/\\sum\\nolimits_{{i
    = 1}}^{k} {(h_{i} } )} \\right]/\\theta _{{fc}} \\quad k = 1,2,...,n $$ (1) Fig.

    image ② Assuming the daily irrigation amount is \\(h_{irrigation}\\), rainfall
    is \\(h_{rain - j}\\), and crop evapotranspiration is \\(ET_{0}\\), the formula
    for calculating the cumulative equivalent irrigation height on day t is as follows:
    $$ h_{equal - t} = \\sum\\nolimits_{j = 1}^{t} {(h_{irrigation - j} + h_{rain
    - j} - ET_{0 - j} )} \\quad t = 1,2,...,m $$ (2) where \\(h_{equal - t} < \\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{1} {h_{i} }\\), the formula for calculating the relative soil moisture content
    is as follows: $$ \\theta _{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{k} {h_{i} }
    }} = \\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{k} {(\\theta _{{mi}} *h_{i} + h_{{equal
    - t}} } *\\rho _{{water}} /\\rho _{{soil}} )/\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{k} {(h_{i}
    } )} \\right]/\\theta _{{fc}} \\quad k = 1,2,...,n $$ (3) where \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{1} {h_{i} } \\le h_{equal - t} < \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{2} {h_{i} }\\),
    the formula for calculating the relative soil moisture content is as follows:
    $$ \\begin{gathered} \\theta _{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{k} {h_{i}
    } }} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {100\\% } \\hfill & {k = 1} \\hfill \\\\

    \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{2} {h_{i} } \\le h_{equal - m} < \\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{3} {h_{i} }\\), the formula for calculating the relative soil moisture content
    is as follows: $$ \\theta _{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{k} {h_{i} }
    }} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {100\\% } \\hfill & {k = 1,2} \\hfill \\\\
    {\\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{n} {(\\theta _{{mi}} \\times h_{i} + h_{{equal

    {(h_{i} } )} \\right]/\\theta _{{fc}} {\\text{ }}} \\hfill & {k = 3,4,...,n} \\hfill
    \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (5) By analogy, when \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n
    - 1} {h_{i} } \\le h_{equal - m} < \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {h_{i} }\\), the
    formula for calculating the relative soil moisture content is as follows: $$ \\theta
    _{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{k} {h_{i} } }} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l}
    {100\\% } \\hfill & {k = 1,2,...,n - 1} \\hfill \\\\ {\\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i

    \\(h_{equal - m} \\ge \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {h_{i} }\\), the formula for
    calculating the relative soil moisture content is as follows: $$ \\theta_{{relative
    - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{k} {h_{i} } }} = 100\\% \\,\\,\\, k = 1,2,...,n $$
    (7) After the moisture content of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} {h_{i} }\\)-layer
    soil reaches saturation, excess water will seep into deeper soil layers. Therefore,
    by initially measuring the soil mass moisture content at different depths and
    combining irrigation volume, rainfall, and crop evapotranspiration, the relative
    soil moisture content at different depths of the regional plot can be accurately
    estimated. 3 Development of Irrigation and Fertilization Plans Fig. 3. Irrigation
    and fertilization process diagram Full size image As shown in Fig. 3, it is the
    irrigation and fertilization process. Firstly, based on the measured soil physicochemical
    parameters and target yield, the total amount of fertilization in each period
    is determined, and the relative soil moisture content is monitored to determine
    whether to irrigate. If irrigation is carried out, the irrigation water content
    is calculated based on the target soil moisture content to determine whether to
    fertilize. If fertilization is carried out, the fertilizer amount is calculated
    and irrigation begins. If fertilization is not carried out, irrigation begins
    directly without fertilization. After the end of this irrigation, the relative
    soil moisture content is continued to be monitored and circulated in sequence.
    Assuming that the growth of oil crops is divided into p stages, where \\(2 < p
    \\le n\\), \\(\\Delta h_{rain - pre}\\) is the future daily rainfall, and \\(ET_{0
    - pre}\\) is the crop evapotranspiration. The formula for equivalent irrigation
    height on the tt-th day in the future is as follows: $$ \\Delta h_{equal - pre(tt)}
    = \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{tt} {(\\Delta h_{rain - pre(i)} - ET_{0 - pre(i)} )}
    \\,\\,\\, tt = 1,2,... $$ (8) Assuming that the minimum soil relative moisture
    content to ensure the growth of oil crops is \\(\\theta_{\\min }\\), the suitable
    lower limit of soil relative moisture content is \\(\\theta_{shiyi\\_\\min }\\),
    the suitable upper limit of soil relative moisture content is \\(\\theta_{shiyi\\_\\max
    }\\), where \\(\\theta_{\\min } < \\theta_{shiyi\\_\\min } < \\theta_{shiyi\\_\\max
    }\\). Taking peanuts as an example, as shown in Table 1, the growth period of
    peanuts is divided into seedling stage, seedling stage, flowering stage, podding
    stage, and mature stage. In order to facilitate the formulation of irrigation
    and fertilization plans, the seedling and emergence stages are defined as the
    early stage, the flowering and podding stages are defined as the middle stage,
    and the mature stage is defined as the late stage. At this point, p = 3. Table
    1. Comparison table of peanut growth period and stage Full size table ① Assuming
    that the first stage absorbs water from the soil at depth of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{{p_{1} }} {h_{i} }\\), and the relative water content of the soil at depth
    of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{1} }} {h_{i} }\\) is \\(\\theta_{{relative
    - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{{_{1} }} }} {h_{i} } }}\\), this stage only irrigates
    without fertilization where \\(p_{{_{1} }} \\ge 1\\). If \\(\\theta_{{relative
    - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{{_{1} }} }} {h_{i} } }} < \\theta_{\\min }\\),
    \\(h_{irrigation\\_1}\\) meets the following equation: $$ \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l}
    {\\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{{p_{1} }} {(\\theta _{{mi}} \\times h_{i}
    + h_{{irrigation\\_1}} } \\times \\rho _{{water}} /\\rho _{{soil}} )/\\sum\\nolimits_{{i
    = 1}}^{{p_{1} }} {h_{i} } } \\right]/\\theta _{{fc}} \\ge \\theta _{{\\min }}
    } \\hfill \\\\ {\\left\\{ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{{p_{1} }} {[\\theta _{{mi}}
    \\times h_{i} + (h_{{irrigation\\_1}} + \\Delta h_{{equal - pre(t)}} ) \\times
    \\rho _{{water}} /\\rho _{{soil}} ]/\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{{p_{1} }} {h_{i}
    } } } \\right\\}/\\theta _{{fc}} \\le \\theta _{{shiyi\\_\\max }} } \\hfill \\\\
    \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (9) If \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i =
    1}^{{p_{{_{1} }} }} {h_{i} } }} \\ge \\theta_{\\min }\\), \\(h_{irrigation\\_1}
    = 0\\). ② Assuming that the second stage absorbs water from the soil at depth
    of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{2} }} {h_{i} }\\), and the relative water content
    of the soil at depth of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{2} }} {h_{i} }\\) is \\(\\theta_{{relative
    - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{{_{2} }} }} {h_{i} } }}\\) where \\(p_{2} \\ge
    1\\). Assuming that irrigation is carried out while fertilization is applied at
    this stage, there is a large amount of irrigation at this stage, if it is not
    enough to fully apply the fertilizer at the same time as supplementary irrigation
    where \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{{_{2} }} }} {h_{i}
    } }} < \\theta_{\\min }\\), it is considered to supplement irrigation and fertilization
    at the same time to ensure that all the fertilizer is applied to the soil at this
    stage where \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{{_{2} }} }} {h_{i}
    } }} \\ge \\theta_{\\min }\\). If \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i =
    1}^{{p_{{_{2} }} }} {h_{i} } }} < \\theta_{\\min }\\), fertilization will be applied
    simultaneously during this irrigation, and \\(h_{irrigation\\_2}\\) meets the
    following equation: $$ \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i
    = 1}}^{{p_{2} }} {(\\theta _{{mi}} \\times h_{i} + h_{{irrigation\\_2}} } \\times
    \\rho _{{water}} /\\rho _{{soil}} )/\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{{p_{2} }} {(h_{i}

    + \\Delta h_{{equal - pre(t)}} ) \\times \\rho _{{water}} /\\rho _{{soil}} ]/\\sum\\nolimits_{{i
    = 1}}^{{p_{2} }} {h_{i} } } } \\right\\}/\\theta _{{fc}} \\le 100\\% } \\hfill
    \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (10) Assuming that the total amount of fertilizer
    to be applied at this stage is \\(Q\\). Where \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{{p_{{_{2} }} }} {h_{i} } }} < \\theta_{\\min }\\), if the amount of fertilizer
    to be applied is \\(Q_{1}\\), the amount of fertilizer not applied is (\\(Q -
    Q_{1}\\)). Where \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{{_{2} }}
    }} {h_{i} } }} \\ge \\theta_{\\min }\\), (\\(Q - Q_{1}\\)) are divided into r
    parts and one portion of fertilizer is applied with irrigation each time. Assuming
    that the corresponding relative soil moisture content is \\(\\theta_{r}\\), the
    corresponding irrigation height for each time is \\(h_{r}\\), the fertilizer concentration
    for each supplementary irrigation is \\(k_{r}\\), and the irrigation area is s,
    the above variables follow the following formula: $$ \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l}
    {\\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{{p_{2} }} {(\\theta _{r} \\times h_{i} +
    h_{r} \\times \\rho _{{water}} /\\rho _{{soil}} )/\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{{p_{2}
    }} {(h_{i} } )} } \\right]/\\theta _{{fc}} \\le 100\\% } \\hfill \\\\ {Q - Q_{1}
    = \\sum\\limits_{{s = 1}}^{r} {h_{s} s\\rho _{{water}} k_{s} } } \\hfill \\\\
    \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (11) ③ By analogy, assuming that the p-th stage absorbs
    water from the soil at depth of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{p} }} {h_{i} }\\),
    and the relative water content of the soil at depth of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_{i =
    1}^{{p_{p} }} {h_{i} }\\) is \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{p}
    }} {h_{i} } }}\\) where \\(p_{p} \\ge 1\\). Assuming that irrigation and fertilization
    are carried out at this stage, and the amount of fertilizer applied is not large,
    the fertilizer can be fully applied to the soil with irrigation at \\(\\theta_{{relative
    - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{{_{p} }} }} {h_{i} } }} < \\theta_{\\min }\\).
    If \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i = 1}^{{p_{{_{p} }} }} {h_{i} } }}
    < \\theta_{\\min }\\), fertilization will be applied simultaneously during this
    irrigation, and \\(h_{irrigation\\_p}\\) for this irrigation meets the following
    formula $$ \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\\left[ {\\sum\\nolimits_{{i = 1}}^{{p_{p}

    \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (12) If \\(\\theta_{{relative - \\sum\\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{{p_{p} }} {h_{i} } }} \\ge \\theta_{\\min }\\), \\(h_{irrigation\\_p} =
    0\\). 4 Conclusions This article proposes a precise irrigation method for oil
    crops based on-demand, which achieves dynamic water and fertilizer regulation
    during the growth process of oil crops. A model for estimating the relative soil
    moisture content at different depths of regional plots has been constructed, achieving
    daily estimation of the relative soil moisture content at different depths of
    regional plots. Based on the daily relative soil moisture content, integrate weather
    forecasts and historical meteorological data to dynamically develop irrigation
    and fertilization plans for future oil crop growth processes. The results indicate
    that the constructed model for estimating the relative soil moisture content solves
    the problem of single monitoring point being difficult to represent the soil moisture
    content of regional plots, and improves the accuracy of irrigation decisions based
    on the relative soil moisture content of regional plots. Based on the estimation
    model of relative soil moisture content, this paper proposes a precise irrigation
    method for oil crops according to demand, which provides theoretical support and
    technical means for the precise application of water and fertilizer in field management
    of oil crops. References Zhang, X., Xie, X.Y.: Studies on identification indexes

  description: Soil moisture prediction is a technique for predicting soil moisture
    content. It is used in agriculture and hydrology to design irrigation systems,
    predict crop yields, monitor the impact of weather on crops, etc. The main purpose
    of soil moisture prediction (SPM) based on past data and climate information.
    SPM uses machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, k-means clustering,
    support vector machines, etc., to predict soil moisture at different time points
    in the growing season. The purpose of this technique is to classify soils into
    specific categories at an accurate and high-precision rate. It provides us with
    information about the moisture content of various soils, which is helpful to understand
    their characteristics and applicability for different purposes such as agriculture,
    engineering and construction. We can find that there are many methods that can
    be used to predict soil moisture, such as mathematical models, but they cannot
    provide accurate results samples from different locations.

    in Electrical Engineering ((LNEE,volume 1132)) Abstract Soil moisture prediction
    is a technique for predicting soil moisture content. It is used in agriculture
    and hydrology to design irrigation systems, predict crop yields, monitor the impact
    of weather on crops, etc. The main purpose of soil moisture prediction (SPM) based
    on past data and climate information. SPM uses machine learning techniques, such
    as neural networks, k-means clustering, support vector machines, etc., to predict
    soil moisture at different time points in the growing season. The purpose of this
    technique is to classify soils into specific categories at an accurate and high-precision
    rate. It provides us with information about the moisture content of various soils,
    which is helpful to understand their characteristics and applicability for different
    purposes such as agriculture, engineering and construction. We can find that there
    are many methods that can be used to predict soil moisture, such as mathematical
    models, but they cannot provide accurate results samples from different locations.

    the measurement methods for obtaining soil moisture mainly include soil drying
    method, neutron method, resistivity method, satellite remote sensing inversion
    and other methods, but these methods usually have a series of problems. For example,
    neutron method is a soil moisture measurement method based on the radiation principle[1].
    Although it has the advantages of high accuracy and speed, it has been gradually
    abandoned by some countries in recent years due to its harm to human health; As
    the most accurate method for measuring soil moisture content, the drying method
    has a long history and has gradually become the comparison value of various measurement
    methods. However, because it needs to destroy the soil structure and consumes
    a lot of manpower and material resources, it has the shortcomings of wasting resources
    and inconvenient operation for large-scale measurement; The resistivity method
    has been gradually eliminated because it needs to be calibrated in advance, its
    operation is complex and its results change with time[2]; Satellite remote sensing
    technology has the ability to provide spatial information, but its scale for measuring
    water content is large (usually averaging the area of hundreds of square meters
    on the ground). For reclaimed collapsed farmland, it cannot meet the precision
    and scale requirements of reclamation quality detection. Generally speaking, these
    methods cannot meet the requirements of rapid, nondestructive, accurate and large
    area measurement required in reclaimed farmland, and their costs are high[3].
    Therefore, it is urgent to study a mesoscale accurate, efficient and non-destructive
    water content detection technology. Based on this, this paper studies the soil
    moisture prediction method based on machine learning algorithm.. 2 Related Work
    2.1 Overview of Machine Learning Non natural heuristic algorithms and natural
    heuristic algorithms are two major categories of meta heuristic algorithms, adaptive
    search and iterative local search, many meta heuristic algorithms are naturally
    inspired. Figure 1 below shows the machine learning framework. Fig. 1. Machine
    Learning Framework Full size image Meta heuristics have different classification
    and description methods. One method is to distinguish their origins. It can be
    divided into two categories, unnatural heuristics and natural heuristics. As a
    traditional local search algorithm, the tabu strategy stores the information of
    the solution that has been accessed in the past through the enhancement of memory
    structure. When it does not allow to return to the recently accessed solution,
    it can promote diversification. 2.2 Prediction of Soil Moisture In practical application,
    valuable soil moisture data must meet the following conditions: 1. The data must
    come from the same plot and multiple monitoring points. The practical experience
    of continuous monitoring shows that under the same agricultural plot and the same
    irrigation conditions, the difference of soil moisture can still reach 3% - 5%,
    even if the distance between the two monitoring points is only 0.5m. Therefore,
    valuable soil moisture data must be obtained from continuous monitoring of multiple
    monitoring points in the same plot with statistical significance. 2. The data
    must come from the monitoring of the same monitoring point and multiple soil depths.
    We know that there are obvious differences in soil water content at the same monitoring
    point and different monitoring depths; The depth distribution of active root system
    in different growth stages of crops is obviously different[4]. Therefore, in actual
    production, it is necessary to dynamically monitor the soil moisture data of the
    soil layer where the main water absorbing roots of crops are located, rather than
    the soil moisture data of the fixed depth soil layer. At the same time, we also
    have certain requirements for the quality of data, which must be stable and accurate.
    To sum up, the soil moisture data with the same location, multiple depths, stability
    and continuity are valuable and can guide the actual production. 3 Soil Moisture
    Prediction Method Based on Machine Learning Algorithm In the existing prediction
    methods of site soil moisture, the original soil moisture series collected from
    the site are often used as experimental data. Integrated empirical mode decomposition
    is a signal decomposition method. After integrated empirical mode decomposition
    of soil moisture series, multiple modal sequences will be obtained, and the dimension
    of experimental data will also be improved. Compared with a single original sequence,
    these decomposed sequences can reflect more soil moisture changes. Convolutional
    neural network is one of the representative algorithms of deep learning. Because
    it can capture the spatial relationship of data, it is a machine learning model
    more suitable for processing high-dimensional data. This chapter will integrate
    empirical mode decomposition and convolutional neural network to predict the soil
    moisture of the site, and through experimental comparison has better prediction
    performance. The collected soil samples are divided into three parts on average,
    one for soil water content data, one for soil hyperspectral data and one for soil
    organic matter data. The samples used for soil hyperspectral data collection are
    divided into two parts on average, one for wet soil spectroscopy and the other
    for dry soil spectroscopy. The soil sample used to determine the wet soil spectrum
    does not need any pretreatment, and the spectral data is obtained directly. For
    the soil sample used to determine the air dried spectrum, the spectral data is
    obtained after the soil is air dried, ground and sieved. The median value of organic
    matter content in study area 1 is less than the average value, indicating that
    there are some soil samples with high organic matter value in the area. The variation
    coefficients of organic matter in study area 1 and study area 2 are 44.40% and
    20.14% respectively, which belong to medium variation. The maximum value of soil
    moisture content in study area 1 is 311.68 g-kg-1, the minimum value is 80.49
    g-kg-1, the average value is 178.60 g-kg-1, and the median value is 172.23 g-kg-1;
    The maximum value of soil water content in study area 2 is 272.41. The variation
    of soil water content in study area 1 is 22.30%, which belongs to medium variation,
    while the coefficient of variation of soil water content in study area 2 is 9.46%,
    which belongs to weak variation. 4 Simulation Analysis From the data of each evaluation
    index after training, it can be seen that EEMD-CNN has the best performance in
    predicting soil temperature at different depths and at different time delays.
    This result is due to that the convolution nuclear energy used in the convolutional
    neural network can better obtain the hidden information in the multimodal data
    after the integrated empirical mode decomposition. As the shallow soil temperature
    is more susceptible to the impact of atmospheric environmental factors, the deep
    soil temperature will change more smoothly. It can be seen from the statistical
    characteristics of the data at each site that the variance of the data at each
    depth decreases with the increase of the depth, so the data of soil temperature
    at 5CM depth has more obvious fluctuations. When the data is processed by EEMD,
    the multimodal data obtained can reduce the impact of the original data fluctuations
    on the prediction results. Therefore, EEMD-CNN and EEMD-LSTM combined with integrated
    empirical mode decomposition are not vulnerable to the impact of data fluctuations
    when predicting low depth soil temperature, while BPNN and LSTM using the original
    data as input are more vulnerable to the impact of fluctuations. The full connection
    layer is used in BPNN, which is a common layer structure in the artificial neural
    network structure. This structure is neither like the convolution layer, which
    can obtain the spatial correlation of data, nor like the cyclic neural network
    node, which can obtain the sequence characteristics of data in time series. In
    LSTM and EEMD-LSTM using circulating neurons, the circulating neurons can connect
    the neurons of each time step sequentially along the time line, and the circulating
    neurons enable the model to inherit some previous states during the training process,
    so that the model can perform better in processing continuous time series data.
    LSTM is an improvement of recurrent neural network. LSTM adds the record of long-term
    memory state in the previous training process to the traditional recurrent neural
    network, so LSTM can be better applied to continuous time series, and has better
    prediction performance than BPNN. As shown in Fig. 2 below, the depth soil moisture
    prediction map is shown. Fig. 2. Deep Soil Moisture Prediction Map Full size image
    With the real data only in the local area, while the model with integrated. With
    the increase of time delay, the overall goodness of fit of each model prediction
    value is declining, but the decline of the model without integrated empirical
    mode decomposition is more obvious, especially in the area with large data standard
    deviation. Under each specific delay condition, each model combined with the integrated
    empirical mode decomposition has a better fitting degree. Among these models,
    EEMD Conv3D has a better fitting degree, which indicates that it has a better
    prediction performance in spatio-temporal soil temperature prediction. After calculation,
    the best evaluation index is obtained, which shows the best prediction ability
    of spatio-temporal soil temperature. It is the most suitable prediction method
    for spatio-temporal soil temperature in all models. 5 Conclusion Soil moisture
    prediction method is a machine learning algorithm. It uses soil moisture and temperature
    data to predict future soil moisture. Today, it is one of the most widely used
    methods in many fields such as agriculture, forestry, hydrology and engineering.
    It uses the soil moisture observation data set to determine the best model to
    predict the next observation. In turn, AI models use a combination of these observations
    and various inputs, such as climate models, to predict future soil moisture. References

    Predictive weather-based models are widely used to schedule irrigation through
    the estimation of crop evapotranspiration. However, perceiving real-time crop
    water requirements remains a challenge. This research aims at field validating

    it covers 71% of the planet, only 2.5% is fresh water, out of which only 1% is
    accessible [1]. Thus, mismanagement is a luxury that cannot be afforded. Moreover,
    the combination of population growth and climate change is placing additional
    stress on the already limited water resources, particularly in the Mediterranean
    region and Eurasia. This is affecting livelihoods, food security, economic development,
    and even social stability [2]. On a global scale, 70% of freshwater consumption
    is attributed to irrigated agriculture, which serves as the main cause and causality
    of water scarcity [3,4]. Consequently, there is a significant need to prioritize
    and improve on-farm irrigation management to effectively address such challenges.
    Precision irrigation stands as a cornerstone for advancing agricultural sustainability.
    By leveraging technologies like soil moisture sensors, weather data, and automated
    irrigation systems, it enables farmers to deliver water precisely where and when
    it is needed [5]. This targeted approach conserves water resources and mitigates
    the strain on increasingly scarce water supplies. Furthermore, precision irrigation
    allows for the optimization of nutrient delivery, thus reducing excess runoff
    and minimizing the risk of water pollution. This practice not only enhances crop
    health and yields but also supports the long-term resilience of the soil, which
    is crucial for sustainable agriculture [6]. Overall, precision irrigation is a
    key strategy for promoting agricultural sustainability, ensuring that agriculture
    can meet the growing global demand for food while minimizing its environmental
    impact. Yet, the lack of affordable and dependable data monitoring systems poses
    a major barrier to such potential enhancements [7]. Considering the spatially
    variable and stochastic nature of agricultural systems, it becomes imperative
    to have access to cost-effective and energy-efficient data acquisition systems.
    Such systems could play a major role in more accurate scheduling, monitoring,
    and assessment of irrigation activities [8]. This research work aims to (i) field
    validate a low-cost prototype DIY soil moisture tensiometer and (ii) exploit its
    use by comparing soil moisture-based irrigation management to weather-based irrigation
    management in terms of yield and water productivity. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Irrigation Scheduling Irrigation scheduling directly impacts water use efficiency
    as it involves making decisions regarding the timing and quantity of water application
    to the field [9]. To efficiently schedule irrigation events, one must comprehend
    the dynamics of the plant water continuum, which is influenced by the interaction
    between weather conditions, soil characteristics, and plant physiology, usually
    referred to as SPAC (Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Continuum) [10]. Hence, the criteria
    on which irrigation scheduling approaches are based are divided into (i) weather-based
    scheduling, (ii) soil moisture-based scheduling, and (iii) plant status-based
    scheduling. Coupled with the rapid development of solid-state sensors and cloud
    platform-based services, monitoring systems could be integrated into the three
    aforementioned approaches. In the next section, the first two main approaches
    and their comparisons in relation to monitoring systems will be briefly presented.
    It is worth mentioning that other factors could impact the actual implementation
    of an irrigation schedule outside the SPAC [11], such as the water supply routine,
    existing irrigation infrastructure, irrigator preferences based on social behavior
    patterns, fertigation and leaching requirements, … etc. Yet, this study is based
    on on-farm irrigation events that target the full satisfaction of plant water
    requirements using an on-demand, supplied drip irrigation system. 2.1.1. Weather
    Conditions Based Scheduling It implies estimating reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) using measured weather parameters for a well-irrigated theoretical Alfalfa
    grass with a height of 12 cm, settled and immovable plane resistance of 70 s m−1
    and an albedo of 0.23, vigorously rising, effectively watered, and entirely covering
    the land [12]. Several models were developed to estimate ETc. One of the most
    used models is the FAO 56—Penman–Monteith [12,13,14] (Equation (1)). 𝐸𝑇 0 = 0.408𝛥(
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+𝛾  900 𝑇+273  𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) 𝛥+𝛾 (1+0.34 𝑢 2 ) 𝜋 𝑟 2 (1) where 𝐸𝑇 0
    is the reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), 𝑅 𝑛 is the net radiation at the
    crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), 𝐺 is the soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), 𝑇
    is the air temperature at 2 m height (°C), 𝑢 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height
    (m s−1), 𝑒 𝑠 is the saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapor pressure
    (kPa), 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 is the saturation vapor pressure deficit (kPa), 𝛥 is the slope
    vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1), and 𝛾 is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1).
    Once ET0 is estimated, it must be corrected using an empirical factor to represent
    the crop evapotranspiration ( ET c ) (mm day−1) relative to 𝐸𝑇 0 at each growth
    stage (crop coefficient Kc) where: ET c = 𝐸𝑇 0 . 𝐾 𝑐 (2) ET c represents the potential
    crop evapotranspiration, i.e., the crop water requirement. The objective of an
    efficient irrigation schedule based on this model is to replenish ET c as readily
    available water (RAW) to be taken by the plant’s effective root zone while minimizing
    the water losses that may occur along the distribution system. This could be represented
    by Equation (3) [15]: 𝑅𝐴𝑊=𝑀𝐴𝐷 . ( 𝜃 𝑓𝑐 − 𝜃 𝑝𝑤𝑝 ) .  𝐷 𝑟  . 10 (3) where MAD is
    the management allowed depletion (the fraction of total available water that is
    allowed to be depleted before the next event), θfc is volumetric water content
    at field capacity (cm3 · cm−3), θpwp is volumetric water content at the permanent
    wilting point (cm3 · cm−3), and Dr is the effective root zone depth in cm. RAW
    is expressed in mm. Automated weather monitoring was one of the earliest systems
    to be integrated into irrigation management [16]. Currently, wireless weather
    stations are commercially available and equipped with sensors capable of measuring
    all the parameters mentioned in Equation (1) and automating ET0 calculations using
    variable transmission protocols. Yet, the main uncertainty of this method stems
    from the agronomic inputs needed to simulate crop evapotranspiration, mainly the
    estimation of Kc and yield response to stresses represented by the stress coefficient
    Ks [17]. Estimating Kc for crops is a complicated process that requires estimating
    the crop’s ETc using well-irrigated lysimeters and back-calculating Kc relative
    to ET0 [18]. As it is not a feasible task for the majority of irrigators, Kc is
    usually assumed from pre-defined values that could be found in the literature
    for similar climatic zones and various crops [12,19,20]. Another significant challenge
    arises from the daily variation of Kc values, which can change as crops grow and
    their leaf area expands [21,22]. An additional important point to consider when
    scheduling irrigation based on weather conditions is the time frame of the weather
    data used to estimate ET0. Two main methods are found in the literature: Predictive
    weather-based models that use a probabilistic approach to generate a representative
    set from historical recorded data for the targeted period consider dry years re-occurrence
    with a certain predefined probability. In this case, the generated schedule should
    be adjusted while being implemented based on daily data, especially rain fall
    events [23,24,25,26]. Near-real-time weather-based models that use short forecasting
    for daily estimations of ET0 to automate irrigation events accordingly [27]. In
    conclusion, accurate implementation of ET-based irrigation scheduling on a commercial
    basis can prove challenging for growers, even if a more accurate estimation of
    Kc is provided. The process involves retrieving daily ET0 values from a representative
    weather station installed in a location with certain standard specifications [28].
    Such limitations drive farmers towards using publicly available ET0 coupled with
    predefined Kc from the literature, usually leading to overirrigation [21]. 2.1.2.
    Soil Moisture Based Scheduling When managing irrigation events, farmers tend to
    rely on experience by sensing the soil using their bare hands to judge its moisture
    condition based on its texture, structure, and wetness. This judgment intuition
    could be described scientifically by two main terms: (i) soil moisture content
    and (ii) soil water matric potential [29]. The first describes the amount of water
    stored in the soil relative to its dry mass in volumetric or gravimetric terms.
    The second is the energy that plant roots need to exert to draw water from the
    soil, or the forces exerted by the soil matrix to hold the water, usually measured
    by tensiometers [30]. Soil moisture condition sensors are commercially available
    for measuring both soil volumetric water content and soil water matrix potential.
    A comprehensive review of the most commonly used sensors and their working concepts
    can be found in [31]. Monitoring soil water potential is crucial for effective
    irrigation management as it provides more accurate information about the availability
    of water to plants and their ability to extract it from the soil. While soil water
    content indicates the amount of water present in the soil, regardless of the plant’s
    ability to access that water [32]. Soil moisture tensiometers are one of the earliest
    and most widely adopted devices for measuring soil water potential. They consist
    of a porous cup and a vacuum gauge for measuring the equivalent negative pressure
    or water tension in unsaturated soils [33]. Unlike soil water content sensors,
    tensiometers are not sensitive to variations in soil texture [34], so they do
    not require prior calibration to be used for determining the matric potential
    at the current moment. Yet, it is important to couple soil water content readings
    with soil water potential monitoring to avoid over-irrigation, as tensiometers
    are inaccurate under high tensions (−80 to −100 kPa), especially in fine-textured
    soils [30]. Soil water potential (SWP) could be described as follows: ψ= ψ m +
    ψ o + ψ p + ψ g (4) where ψ (kPa) is the potential energy per unit mass, volume,
    or weight of water and the sub-scripts m, o, p, and g are the matric, osmotic,
    pressure, and gravitational potentials, respectively [35]. Irrigation scheduling
    based on soil water potential, typically obtained through soil moisture tensiometers,
    is a practical and profound approach to ensuring efficient and rational use of
    water resources in irrigated agriculture [36,37]. It implies defining a soil water
    potential threshold—or a comfortable zone—for a specific crop below which the
    plant begins to suffer [38]. A lot of predefined thresholds could be found in
    the literature for various crops [30,35,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48]. Several
    studies reported potential improvements in water productivity when switching to
    soil water-based irrigation compared to other irrigation approaches [49]. However,
    few have compared soil water potential-based irrigation to the FAO method of estimating
    crop water requirements [12] or any other weather-based irrigation approach. Smajstrla
    and Locascio [50] Smajstrla and Locascio compared irrigation scheduling based
    on pan evaporation to soil water potential-based scheduling using tensiometers
    under tomato drip cultivation. Water productivity increased by 40 and 50% when
    soil water potential was kept at −10 and −15 kPa, respectively, compared to the
    pan-evaporation-based field. Also, in a tomato drip-irrigated field, [51] compared
    soil water potential-based irrigation management using two thresholds (−10 kPa
    and −15 kPa) to conventional farmer practices. The results showed up to 73% of
    potential water reduction when irrigation was based on the soil water potential
    with minimal impact on yield. In Green houses, Buttaro, et al. [52] reported water
    savings of 35% and 45% for tomato and cucumber, respectively, when setting an
    irrigation schedule based on tension threshold ranges of −10 to −40 kPa for tomato
    and −10 to −30 kPa for cucumber. Yang, et al. [53] reported an improvement of
    43.1% to 50.3% in water productivity when switching to soil water potential-based
    irrigation management under rice cultivation, where the SWP was kept at −15 kPa.
    2.2. Experimental Layout The experiment was conducted in CIHEAM Bari’s experimental
    field located in Valenzano, Puglia region, South of Italy (41°2′40.3872″ N, 16°53′3.8364″
    E), during the period April–June 2023, under transplanted Romaine lettuce (Lactuca
    sativa L.). The designed area was 15 m × 9 m divided into two plots, 7.5 m × 9
    m each. Both plots were equipped with a drip irrigation system where the distance
    between lines was 1 m and the distance between the drippers (plants) was 0.25
    m. Drippers were self-compensating with a designed flow rate of 2 L/h. All 16
    mm laterals feeding the drippers were equipped with small butterfly valves to
    ensure precise control of each dripper line, an important design feature as the
    irrigation schedule will be different from one plot to the next. Figure 1 shows
    the experimental layout. Figure 1. Layout of the irrigation network and the experimental
    field. The first plot (Control) was irrigated according to the potential evapotranspiration
    derived from a weather station adjacent to the field using Penman–Monteith (Equation
    (1)) and adjusted using crop coefficients at variable growth stages based on FAO
    56 [12] to calculate the potential crop water requirement as explained in Equation
    (2). Other agronomic and soil parameters are needed to simulate lettuce growth
    in the identified location. Table 1 summarizes all parameters used to generate
    the irrigation schedule, along with their sources and whether they were estimated
    or lab-measured. To facilitate the calculation process, Aquacrop [54] was used
    to generate the irrigation schedule. Table 1. Climate, crop, management, and soil
    parameters are used to generate the weather-based irrigation schedule. Irrigation
    management for this plot was implemented according to the generated irrigation
    schedule; however, the daily gross irrigation requirement was adjusted according
    to the measured daily rainfall during the season to avoid over-irrigation. All
    amounts of water supplied to the plot during the season were recorded using the
    water flowmeter installed upstream of the network. On the other hand, the second
    plot was irrigated on demand using the data feed from three IoT soil moisture
    tensiometers developed by CIHEAMs Bari digital agriculture lab [33]. They measure
    the soil moisture and plot it on a cloud service platform (ThingSpeak™). ThingSpeak
    is a cloud-based IoT analytics platform service that enables the aggregation,
    visualization, and analysis of real-time data streams [56]. It was integrated
    into the IoT prototypes to visualize the data by linking a designated channel
    as a client using its identification number (ID) to receive strings from the devices
    (IoT tensiometers) identified by their internet protocol (Ips). The three IoT
    prototypes were placed diagonally in rows no. 2, 5, and 8 at 15 cm depth (Figure
    1). This depth was identified according to [57], as the ceramic cup was placed
    at half of the expected root zone during the season. In each measuring point,
    another conventional tensiometer with a mechanical manometer (JET FILL 2725) was
    added alongside the IoT one at the same depth (Figure 2). This was carried out
    to validate the developed IoT prototype and ensure its reliability. Figure 2.
    IoT and mechanical tensiometers as installed in the field. Irrigation was managed
    according to the soil water potential in the root zoon. The comfortable range
    thresholds for the Romaine lettuce were investigated in previous studies. Michael
    and Barry [58] recommended −15 to −25 kPa in the establish phase and −25 to −35
    kPa in the post-establish phase. Within the same range, Dessureault-Rompré, et
    al. [59] stated that −20 to −30 kPa is the ideal range. In this study, the threshold
    for initiating an irrigation event was set to −25 kPa, and the threshold to consider
    the field well irrigated was set to −15 kPa. This range was chosen based on literature
    and previous experience with soil water retention curves. The feed from the three
    tensiometers was received daily through the ThingSpeak platform. Once any of the
    three tensiometer readings exceeded −25 kPa, an irrigation event was triggered.
    The objective is to return that tensiometer within the comfortable zone. As the
    feedback from the tensiometers is not instant, continuous monitoring (each two
    hours) of the readings of the tensiometers was required in the initial events
    to ensure the return to the comfortable zone. During the irrigation season, the
    relationship between the amount of water needed and the tensiometer reading above
    the triggering threshold (−25 kPa) could be established, as shown in Table 2.
    All amounts of water supplied to the plot were recorded using the water flowmeter
    installed upstream of the network. Table 2. Above-threshold tensiometer readings
    and the relative amount of water required and allocated to set back the reading.
    2.3. Design and Development of the IoT Soil Moisture Tensiometer Prototype The
    IoT-tensiometer integrates an isolated BMP180 barometric pressure sensor positioned
    near the top of the tensiometer tube, just beneath the closing cap. This sensor
    is linked to an ESP32 microcontroller through four slender wires (measuring 0.55
    mm in diameter) utilizing an Inter-Integrated Circuit interface (I2C). The BMP180
    operates on a logic voltage of 3.3 V and boosts the capability to detect barometric
    pressure up to 110 kPa with exceptional precision (2 Pa), making it well-suited
    for discerning even slight fluctuations in the tensiometer’s vacuum. Serving as
    the prototype’s central processing unit is the ESP32-WROOM MCU, a cost-effective
    and potent microcontroller module featuring integrated WiFi and dual-mode Bluetooth
    capabilities. The detailed blueprints and description of the prototype can be
    found in [33]. In this study, the ESP32s deep sleep functionality was exploited
    to conserve power and ensure the prototype’s self-sufficient operation. Figure
    3 shows the algorithm flowchart. It works as follows: The ESP32 rouses itself
    every six hours (referred to as the “time slot” in the flowchart) to gauge the
    tension within the tensiometer’s vacuum via the BMP180 sensors, then it transmits
    three data points to the ThingSpeak cloud service and reverts back to sleep mode.
    Figure 3. Algorithm Flowchart. If the MCU is unable to locate an accessible network
    within 30 s (as denoted by the “threshold” on the flowchart), it returns to sleep
    mode. Similarly, if the MCU manages to establish a connection but is unable to
    detect the sensors, it subsequently returns to sleep mode, awaiting the next designated
    time slot. Figure 3 provides a visual representation of the code algorithm, scripted
    in the C++ language within the Arduino IDE environment. The prototype is powered
    by two 3.7 V Li-Ion batteries connected in series, providing a combined voltage
    of 7.4 V. These batteries are recharged using a 1.1 W solar panel through an MT3608
    DC-DC voltage regulator, which stabilizes the incoming charging voltage from the
    panels to 9 V. The MT3608 is a compact, cost-effective step-up booster converter
    module designed to elevate voltage from as low as 2 V up to a maximum of 28 V
    DC. All components have been affixed to a designed platform and printed using
    Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol material (PTEG). The design prioritized durability
    under outdoor conditions by minimizing openings or holes. The mounted electronic
    components are enclosed within an elongated sleeve-like box with two securely
    fitted side ducts (like a drawer), with the solar panel positioned on top as depicted
    in Figure 4. Figure 4. The IoT tensiometer prototype: (a) The components; (b)
    the sealed prototype [33]. 3. Results The data feed from the three IoT prototyped
    tensiometers was compared to the readings of the mechanical tensiometers with
    a daily step along the season. Figure 5 shows the format of the data received
    on the ThingSpeak platform on a daily basis. The tool allowed for online and continuous
    soil water potential visualization and tracking, was easily accessed through personal
    devices, and could be downloaded as a .CSV file if needed. Figure 5. Data visualization
    is conducted on a daily basis, as shown on the ThingSpeak platform. The deep sleep
    feature enabled the prototype to achieve a high degree of autonomy. It draws (0.8
    µA) while in sleep mode and peaks at 50 mA for a duration of 5 s when uploading
    data. On days with ample sunlight, the solar panel generates a charging current
    ranging between 100 and 120 milliamperes. Thus, a 2400 mAh Li-ion battery was
    more than sufficient to supply the prototype on dim, cloudy days or at night during
    the test period (29 days from the 24th of May to the 21st of June in Valenzano,
    south Italy, 2023). The deployed prototypes were able to detect the variation
    in soil water potential during the reported period. Figure 6 shows a high correlation
    between the three tested prototypes and their accompanied mechanical manometers,
    with an average R2 of 0.8 while the root mean square error (RMSE) was insignificant,
    ranging from = 2.87 to 5.38. As the prototype was previously lab validated using
    bare soil pots [33], it is interesting to discuss how repeating the validation
    process in the open field impacted the prototype’s accuracy. Compared to the lab
    validation, R2 is reduced from 0.99 to 0.8, while the RMSE range increased from
    0.7–1.1 Kpa in the lab to 2.87–5.38 Kpa in the open field. Such results could
    be interpreted mainly as follows: (i) The medium scale: compared to large-scale
    open field soil structures, the soil pots (30 × 28 cm) provided a more confined
    environment, thus permitting the validation setup to be less prone to vertical
    and horizontal soil water movement and redistribution; (ii) The plant’s effective
    root zone: unlike bare soil pots, the plant’s roots (in this case Lettuce) were
    introduced in this validation setup. Despite considering the tensiometer placement
    to be as close as possible to the transplants (10–15 cm), it is not feasible to
    predict the effective root zone development and its impact on the prototype accuracy,
    yet it is an inevitable consequence. Figure 6. Validation of the three prototype
    sensors as compared to the mechanical manometers. In terms of water productivity,
    fresh and dry yield were both weighed, while the amount of water allocated was
    registered using mechanical flowmeters. The fresh yield was almost the same: 149.7
    kg in the weather-based plot and 146.9 kg in the soil-based one. On the other
    hand, the total amount of water allocated to the plots was 18.218 m3 and 13.103
    m3 in the weather-based and soil-based plots, respectively, registering a reduction
    of 28%. Thus, the water productivity was higher by 36.44%, as shown in Figure
    7. Figure 7. Water productivity as a result of irrigation scheduling based on
    weather and soil moisture using IoT tensiometers. Another result worth mentioning
    is the frequency of irrigation events. Figure 8 shows a comparison between the
    applied irrigation schedules. In the initial stage, both approaches were almost
    the same in terms of timing and quantity. However, after the initial stage (first
    week), the IoT soil-based plot maintained a soil water potential between −15 and
    −25 kPa, reducing the number of mandated irrigation events and spacing them apart.
    On the other hand, the gross irrigation requirements based on the simulated evapotranspiration
    from the adjacent weather station necessitated more irrigation events to meet
    the consumptive use. Overall, the weather-based plot required 32 irrigation events
    with a total of 26.7 irrigation hours. While the soil-based plot required only
    22 irrigation events with 21.4 irrigation hours, a 28% reduction in the amount
    of water allocated. Although energy consumption was not measured in this study,
    the irrigation time implies that potential energy savings could be achieved. Figure
    8. Applied irrigation schedules in both plots along the season. One of the main
    advantages of the introduced prototype is its low cost, which does not only consider
    the initial cost of its components (82.20$) shown in Table 3 and compared to the
    readily available commercial versions (2023), whose costs range between 117 USD
    (Embsys Technologies Private Limited, Soil moisture tensiometer, Guindy, Chennai,
    Tamil Nadu, India) and 481 USD (METER, TEROS 32 Soil moisture tensiometer, 2365
    NE Hopkins Ct. Pullamn, WA 99163, The United States of America). An important
    consideration instead is the subscription fee requested by the service provider
    to access data through the service provider platform. Open source DIY prototypes—such
    as the one in hand—facilitate access to low-cost innovative solutions while overcoming
    the burden of data handling fees and service providers’ ownership over data. Table
    3. Breakdown of the cost of the prototype. 4. Conclusions Progress in electronic
    technologies has granted researchers affordable access to solid-state sensors
    and programmable microcontroller-based circuits. Coupled with 3D printing potentials,
    prototyping for automating data collection has become much more feasible. In this
    study, an easy-to-assemble, cost-effective, energy-autonomous prototype of an
    IoT tensiometer was field-validated. The IoT tensiometer proved to be reliable
    and was able to track the variation in the soil water potential with an average
    R2 = 0.8 and RMSE ranging from 4.25 to 7.1. It was then used to compare weather-based
    to soil-based irrigation management under drip-irrigated lettuce cultivation.
    In consistency with previous studies, irrigation scheduling based on soil water
    tension proved potential water savings when compared to a weather-based approach.
    Water productivity was improved by 36.44% when irrigation was based on the IoT
    tensiometer prototype, setting a threshold of (−15 to −25 kPa) relative to the
    FAO 56 weather-based approach [12]. Such a low-cost prototype (82.20$) contributes
    to an affordable, easy-to-access soil moisture monitoring system, which is an
    inherent problem when addressing soil moisture-based irrigation management. It
    is worth mentioning that the field deployment of the sensors lasted for approximately
    2 months, along with the whole cropping season of lettuce. This period served
    the objective of this study and allowed for soil-based on-farm irrigation management;
    however, it still remains a short period to test the sensors’ durability and their
    long-term reliability. For the latter purpose, further investigation is needed,
    especially to set technical maintenance/replacement, and periodic recalibration
    requirements. The same applies for assessing the improvements in terms of energy
    consumption that accompany the irrigation time reduction. Author Contributions

    forecastsBias correctionReservoir moduleForecasting 1. Introduction As the world''s
    population rises and water supplies become more scarce and unpredictable due to
    climate change, water demands have become more pressing than ever (De Fraiture
    et al., 2010; Thomas and Nanteza, 2023). Managing and distributing water resources
    to satisfy water demands is challenging for decision-makers and experts. The inflow
    and water demand forecasts are essential to provide crucial information for optimising
    water allocation, storage, and release strategies, ensuring efficient and sustainable
    management of water resources (Gharib et al., 2023). Reservoir inflow forecasts
    in advance are essential for effective reservoir management, particularly during
    hydrological extremes (Apaydin et al., 2020; Sushanth et al., 2023a). Machine
    Learning (ML) models have been employed extensively in reservoir inflow forecasting
    in recent years because they are more precise than conventional techniques (Bai
    et al., 2016). Compared to other ML models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    model is frequently used to predict streamflows as it performs well (Apaydin et
    al., 2020; Latif et al., 2021; Luppichini et al., 2022). Forecasting streamflows,
    however, is challenging in a river basin with reservoir regulation because of
    the reservoirs'' storage effects upstream. In this context, Sushanth et al. (2023a)
    proposed a novel hybrid approach for forecasting streamflows by integrating the
    LSTM model with a conceptual reservoir module. However, the study assumed constant
    water demand forecasts in the analysis, as the upstream reservoirs were primarily
    designed to meet domestic and industrial water demands that do not vary significantly
    during the year. This assumption does not hold for the irrigation purpose reservoirs
    as the irrigation demands exhibit significant temporal variation compared to other
    water demands. Considering these variations in demand is crucial for effective
    reservoir management in real-time to optimise water resource utilisation and make
    informed decisions regarding water conservation (Kang et al., 2017). Precise irrigation
    demand forecasting is also essential for sustainable agricultural practices with
    the increasing need for efficient water use amidst the growing challenges of climate
    change (Guzman et al., 2018). Forecasting irrigation demands involves estimating
    future crop water requirements based on historical data, weather patterns, crop
    characteristics, and other relevant factors. The variability of the weather factors
    governing the irrigation demand, e.g., evapotranspiration, temperature, and precipitation,
    makes forecasting difficult (Meempatta et al., 2019). The modelling plays a crucial
    part in this process, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the
    complex interactions between rainfall, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture dynamics
    to estimate and predict irrigation demands (McNider et al., 2015). Many modelling
    techniques have been employed recently to simulate irrigation demands (Perera
    et al., 2016; Perea et al., 2019; Zanfei et al., 2022). The three basic categories
    of these models are conceptual, physically-based, and data-driven. Each category
    represents a distinct modelling approach with its advantages and limitations.
    Conceptual models are simplified representations of the hydrological system and
    are often used when data availability is limited or a quick assessment is required
    (Beven, 2002). These models are relatively easy to implement and interpret but
    may sacrifice accuracy due to the simplifications made. Sushanth et al. (2023b)
    developed and implemented a conceptual irrigation demand module in a National
    Hydrological Model – India (NHM-I). They effectively analysed the variations of
    the irrigation demands in the Damodar River basin, India, under different allowable
    moisture deficit conditions. Short-term weather forecasts are crucial in accurately
    forecasting the inflows and irrigation demands, enabling farmers and water managers
    to make informed decisions regarding irrigation scheduling and water allocation
    (Cai et al., 2011; Forouhar et al., 2022). The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology
    (IITM), Pune, has successfully developed a deterministic Global Forecast System
    (GFS) tailored for short-term weather forecasts. This system can provide precise
    predictions for up to 10 days ahead, with a high resolution of 12 km (Mukhopadhyay
    et al., 2019). The accuracy of the inflow and irrigation demand forecasts may
    be impacted by the GFS data''s potential for inherent bias (Tiwari et al., 2022).
    Applying statistical post-processing techniques enhances the accuracy and skill
    of meteorological variable forecasts. This process aids in refining the predictions
    by reducing errors and improving the overall quality of the forecasted outcomes
    (Tiwari et al., 2022). Numerous bias correction techniques are available to enhance
    the forecast data by removing systemic errors. These methods have advantages and
    limitations (Ringard et al., 2017). Among these methods, the quantile trend-preserving
    method, like Scaled Distribution Mapping (SDM) approach, is more efficient for
    correcting the bias of forecast data (Casanueva et al., 2020). A novel bias correction
    technique, the SDM method, was developed by Switanek et al. (2017), considering
    the rainy day''s frequency and probability of events. Sushanth et al. (2023a)
    bias-corrected the GFS forecasts and used them in reservoir inflow forecasting
    up to 5 days lead. However, no study has applied GFS forecasts in irrigation demand
    forecasting. In the context of real-time reservoir operation, numerous studies
    solely utilise inflow forecasts (Yang et al., 2019; Meema et al., 2021; He et
    al., 2022). Gorguner and Kavvas (2020) used the projected long-term inflows and
    demands under climate change in a water balance model to forecast the reservoir''s
    water supply on a monthly time scale. However, no study has been conducted on
    utilising the daily inflow and demand forecasts for real-time reservoir operation.
    This study''s novelty lies in two aspects: (1) Application of GFS forecasts for
    real-time forecasting of irrigation demands with a conceptual irrigation demand
    module; (2) Real-time reservoir operation considering the daily inflows and irrigation
    demand forecasts. Therefore, we first forecast the reservoir inflows using the
    LSTM model and bias-corrected GFS forecasts. Concurrently, we forecast irrigation
    demands using the irrigation demand module and bias-corrected GFS data. Subsequently,
    we utilise the inflow and water demand forecasts in the reservoir module for effective
    reservoir operation in real-time. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The
    Damodar river basin is located in eastern India, spanning from 22°45′N to 24°30′N
    latitude and 84°45′E to 88°00′E longitude with a catchment area of 19,673 km2
    (Fig. 1). The monsoon season accounts for 80 % of the total average annual rainfall
    (1250 mm) in this basin from June to September. The basin experiences average
    temperatures of 30 °C, with peak temperatures of 48 °C and occasional winter lows
    of −2 °C. The Damodar river basin consists of five main reservoirs: Tenughat (4480.7
    km2), Konar (997.1 km2), and Panchet (10,966 km2) on the main Damodar river, and
    Tilaya (984.2 km2) and Maithon (6293.7 km2) reservoirs on the Barakar river, a
    tributary to the Damodar. The Damodar river is perennial, while the Barakar river
    is intermittent or seasonal. Tenughat, Konar, and Tilaya reservoirs do not have
    an irrigation command area, and their primary purpose is to satisfy domestic and
    industrial demands. In contrast, the Panchet and Maithon reservoirs, besides satisfying
    the domestic and industrial demands, are responsible for satisfying the irrigation
    demands of the Durgapur barrage command area. Download : Download high-res image

    basin and Durgapur barrage command area. The Durgapur barrage is a major irrigation
    infrastructure project built downstream of the Panchet and Maithon, across the
    Damodar river, in Durgapur of West Bengal state (Fig. 1). Geographically, it lies
    between latitudes 23°25′N and 23°50′N and longitudes 87°15′E and 87°30′E. The
    Durgapur Barrage''s total command area is 5690 km2, of which 4560 km2 is served
    by the left bank canal and the remainder 1130 km2 by the right bank canal. The
    culturable command area is 3940 km2. The terrain is predominantly flat, with fertile
    alluvial soil. During the Kharif season (June to October), the main crop in the
    study area is paddy. In addition to paddy, seasonal vegetables and maize are also
    grown. The main crops during the Rabi season (November to February) are potatoes,
    millets, and pulses. In addition, Boro paddy cultivation (January to May) is a
    significant agricultural practice in the Durgapur barrage command area during
    the dry season due to the availability of irrigation water from the Durgapur barrage.
    The presence of the barrage has facilitated the creation of an extensive canal
    network (2730 km), which serves as the primary means of irrigation in the region.
    The barrage and the associated irrigation facilities have significantly contributed
    to agricultural productivity and the livelihoods of the local population. 2.2.
    Data used The LSTM model is set up using observed meteorological data (2000 to
    2018), including precipitation (P), maximum temperature (Tmax), and minimum temperature
    (Tmin). The observed P data with a resolution of 0.25° and the Tmax and Tmin data
    with a resolution of 1° were provided by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
    To ensure consistency, Tmax and Tmin values are interpolated to a 0.25° resolution,
    matching the P data. The observed reservoir inflows, outflows, and additional
    inputs such as water demand, seepage rate, and bathymetric information are collected
    from the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC). Table 1 presents the reservoirs'' elevations
    of dead storage, conservation, flood control, and full/maximum zones (Hd, Hc,
    Hf, Ht). For forecasting reservoir inflows and water demands, the GFS data, sourced
    from IITM, Pune, is utilised in this study. It accurately predicts extreme P magnitudes
    with minimal systematic bias up to a 5-day lead (Sridevi et al., 2020). Similarly,
    the GFS can predict temperatures reliably with a 7-day advance for Tmax and Tmin
    (Johny and Prasad, 2020). Consequently, this study utilises GFS data with a lead
    time of 1–5 days for forecasting purposes. Table 1. Elevations of dead storage,

    (2023a) used a hybrid approach (reservoir module with LSTM model) for forecasting
    streamflows in a reservoir-regulated river basin (i.e., Panchet catchment). The
    same approach was used to forecast streamflows in the Maithon catchment. Fig.
    2 presents the steps involved in forecasting inflows to Panchet and Maithon reservoirs.
    The reservoir inflows were predicted using the LSTM model (Section 2.3.1). Initially,
    separate LSTM models were established for the catchments of Tenughat, Konar, Panchet,
    Tilaya, and Maithon reservoirs, with the observed data (P, Tmax, and Tmin) and
    their time lags as input. However, for the Panchet and Maithon catchments, additional
    input variables like upstream reservoir outflows (Tenughat and Konar for Panchet
    and Tilaya for Maithon) were considered while developing the LSTM model. While
    the mean catchment P was computed using a weighted average of gridded data, the
    means of Tmax and Tmin were estimated using simple averages. After subtracting
    the Tenughat and Konar catchments from the Panchet catchment, mean values were
    calculated for the remaining region. Similarly, mean values for the remaining
    area in the Maithon catchment were determined after subtracting the Tilaya catchment.

    time lags of the outputs from their time series. In contrast, the cross-correlation
    function was used to calculate the time lags of P, Tmax, Tmin, and upstream reservoir
    outflows. The hydrometeorological dataset was normalised using the Min-Max Scalar.
    Following normalisation, the dataset was separated into training data (2000–2014)
    and testing data (2015–2018). The LSTM models were trained using the training
    data and adjusting hyperparameters through trial and error. Once the model was
    effectively trained, the testing data was used to assess the performance of the
    LSTM model in predicting reservoir inflows. The GFS forecasts (P, Tmax, and Tmin)
    with a lead time of 1–5 days were bias-corrected using the observed IMD data and
    the SDM method (Switanek et al., 2017; Sushanth et al., 2023a). Subsequently,
    the corresponding trained LSTM models and the bias-corrected GFS data were used
    to forecast inflows to Tenughat, Konar, and Tilaya reservoirs for 2017 and 2018
    (Fig. 2). The forecasted inflows were then used as input to the reservoir module
    (Section 2.3.2) together with the relevant reservoir-specific information. The
    Hargreaves-Samani equation (Eq. (2)) calculated the evaporation rate with the
    Tmax and Tmin forecasts as inputs. The P forecasts provided the necessary rainfall
    data for the Reservoir module. When predicting the inflows to the Panchet and
    Maithon reservoirs using their respective trained LSTM models, the upstream reservoirs''
    outflow forecasts were used as inputs along with the bias-corrected GFS forecasts.
    2.3.1. LSTM model The LSTM model is a type of RNN that is highly effective in
    capturing long-term dependencies and sequential patterns in time series data (Hochreiter
    and Schmidhuber, 1997). It is particularly well-suited for time series forecasting
    and natural language processing tasks. One key advantage of LSTM is its ability
    to retain and utilise information over extended periods, which helps overcome
    the vanishing gradient problem commonly encountered in traditional RNNs. The LSTM
    model''s architecture, as depicted in Fig. 3, comprises memory cells responsible
    for storing and manipulating information over time, along with gates that control
    the information flow within the network. The input, forget, and output gates determine
    how the memory cells are updated and reset, allowing the model to retain important
    information and discard irrelevant or redundant data. By learning from historical
    patterns, the LSTM model can generate predictions for the future by processing
    input sequences incrementally and updating its internal state at each step. When
    training the LSTM model, several critical parameters need to be considered, including
    the number of epochs, the batch size, the learning rate, the number of neurons
    in each hidden layer, and the number of hidden layers (Xiang et al., 2020). Determining
    the optimal values for these hyperparameters involves a trial-and-error approach.
    Additionally, selecting the best optimiser and activation function is crucial
    for achieving optimal model training. The Keras library is used here to implement
    the LSTM model in Python, and Tensorflow is used as the backend. Download : Download

    2.3.2. Reservoir module The study conducted by Sushanth et al. (2023a) thoroughly
    explained the conceptual reservoir module. The daily water balance equation and
    the concept of storage zoning (CSZ) are the bases on which the reservoir module
    is developed. The CSZ method involves categorising the storage of the reservoir
    into various zones: the flood control zone, conservation zone, and dead storage
    zone (Fig. 4). The user must enter the reservoir storage level from the previous
    day (Ht-1), which determines the corresponding storage volume (St-1) based on
    the reservoir''s elevation-storage relationship. The present-day outflows (Ot)
    are determined based on the objective of each zone and the current storage (Sr
    = St-1 + Inflows (It)) (Fig. 4). No water is allowed to be withdrawn if Sr is
    lower than the dead storage (Sd), which results in Ot being zero. If Sr is below
    the conservation storage (Sc), Ot is equal to the water demand (D) if the available
    storage (Sr – Sd) exceeds the water demand; otherwise, Ot is equal to Sr – Sd.
    Surplus water can be released as Ot in the flood control zone, but the downstream
    channel capacity (Qc) constrains the releases. If the actual outflow (Q) is less
    than Qc, Ot is equal to the available storage (Sr – Sc); otherwise, Ot is equal
    to the downstream channel storage (Qc × Δt). Any excess water over the flood control
    level is released when Sr surpasses the flood control level. Download : Download
    high-res image (68KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Schematic representation
    of CSZ. After determining the O, current storage (St) is estimated by using the
    daily water balance equation: (1) where St is the present day''s storage volume,
    Pt is the current precipitation on the reservoir''s water surface, and Et and
    Set are the evaporation and seepage losses in the present day (all units are in
    m3). The volumes of Pt, Et, and Set are obtained by multiplying the respective
    rates with the area of the water surface. Calculating the reservoir surface areas
    corresponding to the storage levels requires employing the elevation-area relationship.
    Based on the estimated storage (St), the corresponding reservoir storage level
    (Ht) is calculated and is carried over to the next day as Ht-1. Up until the end
    of the simulation time, this procedure continues. 2.4. Forecasting irrigation
    demands Generally, the reservoir water demands include domestic, industrial, hydropower,
    and irrigation demands. The remaining water demands are constant with time except
    for the irrigation demands. When soil moisture conditions are not restrictive,
    irrigation demand is the water required to irrigate crops and meet their evapotranspiration
    requirements (ETc). Moreover, the demand for irrigation fluctuates with seasons
    and is directly influenced by P patterns in agricultural areas. In this study,
    the irrigation demands of the Durgapur barrage command area are forecasted using
    a conceptual irrigation demand module (Section 2.4.1) and GFS forecasts. As in
    reservoir inflow forecasting, the Durgapur barrage command area''s GFS forecasts
    are bias-corrected using the SDM method. After the bias correction, the mean P,
    Tmax, and Tmin of GFS forecasts were determined in the command area. Subsequently,
    the mean GFS forecasts were given as input to the irrigation demand module for
    real-time forecasting of the irrigation demands. 2.4.1. Irrigation demand module
    Sushanth et al. (2023b) developed a conceptual irrigation demand module and embedded
    it in the National Hydrological Model – India (NHM-I). The same conceptual irrigation
    demand module was used in this study. The irrigation demand module estimates irrigation
    requirements based on daily calculations of ETc and the soil moisture or water
    level depletion over time. The ETc is determined by multiplying the crop coefficient
    (Kc) specific to each crop and obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) data, with the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The ETo is calculated
    using the Hargreaves-Samani equation (Eq. (2)), a commonly used method in data-scarce
    conditions that is known for its simplicity and effectiveness. This method requires
    minimal data inputs while yielding satisfactory results. (2) where Ra is the amount
    of extraterrestrial solar radiation (MJ/m2), Tmax and Tmin are the daily maximum
    and minimum temperatures (°C), respectively, and T is the average daily air temperature
    (°C). Fig. 5 shows a conceptual depiction of estimating irrigation demand. Major
    growing crops are divided into irrigated dry crops and paddy. The estimation of
    irrigation demands for these two categories is explained below. Download : Download
    high-res image (87KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Conceptual representation
    of estimating irrigation demand. 2.4.1.1. Paddy The irrigation demands of paddy
    are simulated based on the daily water balance of standing water (Fig. 5). The
    irrigation demand module considers an initial water level (WL1) of 50 mm at the
    start of each day. Based on the particular soil type, percolation losses (PL),
    a crucial factor in the water balance of paddy fields, are considered. The PL
    values for different soils are derived from the literature. The following equation
    is then used to determine the paddy irrigation demand (DP, in mm) and the daily
    final water level (WL2, in mm): (3) The following conditions help determine DP,
    i.e., the irrigation water depth required to keep the water level at 50 mm. (4)
    The WL2 is updated to its maximum capacity following the estimation of the irrigation
    demand and turns into WL1 for the next time step. The volume of irrigation needed
    for paddy (IDP, m3) is calculated by multiplying the area under the paddy (AP)
    by DP. 2.4.1.2. Irrigated dry crops For the water balance simulation of irrigated
    dry crops, the root zone''s soil moisture is used (Fig. 5). The following equation
    is used for the soil moisture balance: (5) where SM1 and SM2 represent the initial
    and final soil moisture (mm) on a day, respectively. The first day''s SM1 is taken
    to be fully saturated (SM1 = d × AW), where d is the crop''s root zone depth (mm),
    and AW is the amount of available water in the soil determined by subtracting
    the permanent wilting point from the field capacity. FAO soil data helps calculate
    the d and AW for each soil type. Irrigation is provided when the soil moisture
    level (SM2) reaches a certain percentage (a) of FC, specifically 50 %. The amount
    of water needed to maintain the soil at the desired FC is determined as the irrigation
    demand (DO, in mm), taking into account the following conditions: (6) Following
    the estimation of the irrigation demand, SM2 is updated to its maximum capacity
    and transformed into SM1 for the next time step. The volume of irrigation required
    for irrigated dry crops (IDO, m3) is calculated by multiplying the area under
    irrigated dry crops (AO) by DO. Total net irrigation demand for a given day is
    calculated by adding the IDP and IDO of that day. 2.5. Real-time reservoir operation
    with inflow and demand forecasts As stated earlier, the Panchet and Maithon reservoirs
    release the water to satisfy the water demands of the Durgapur barrage command
    area. The Durgapur barrage command area consists of an extensive canal network
    spreading over the command area. Therefore, the gross irrigation demand forecasts
    were determined after dividing the net irrigation demand forecasts by the canal
    system''s conveyance efficiency. The overall conveyance efficiency (75 %) of the
    canal network is collected from the Irrigation and Waterways Department, West
    Bengal, India. After determining the inflow forecasts for the Panchet and Maithon
    reservoirs and gross irrigation demand forecasts from the Durgapur barrage command
    area, the inflow and demand forecasts were fed into the reservoir module for real-time
    assessment of effective reservoir operation. In this assessment, we made the following
    assumptions: • The water demands of the Durgapur barrage command area are allocated
    proportionally to the Panchet and Maithon reservoirs according to their storage
    capacity. • In the monsoon season (June to September), water in the flood control
    zone will be released through the spillway to reduce the flood risk. In the remaining
    seasons, the water in the flood control zone will not be released and stored to
    meet the non-monsoon water demands. • The reservoirs'' water levels should reach
    the dead storage level before the monsoon season to facilitate enough storage
    for monsoon inflows. The Panchet reservoir storage capacity is 135,808 ha-m, whereas
    the Maithon reservoir storage capacity is 109,354 ha-m. Therefore, 55 % (135,808
    / (135,808 + 109,354) = 0.55) of water demands are allocated to the Panchet reservoir,
    and 45 % (109,354 / (135,808 + 109,354) = 0.45) of water demands are allocated
    to the Maithon reservoir. For the second assumption, the reservoir module is modified
    by introducing a decision-based parameter (α) in the CSZ that indicates how much
    water should be discharged through the spillway''s gates (α(Sr – Sc)). The α varies
    between 0 and 1, with α = 1 meaning that the entire water in the flood control
    zone (Sr – Sc) will be released through the spillway (subject to the Qc value),
    and α = 0 meaning that no water will be released through the spillway. 2.6. Performance
    evaluation Performance indicators such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe
    efficiency (NSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2) are used to assess how
    well the LSTM model performs. The R2 evaluates the model''s ability to predict
    streamflows in a linear regression format, with values between 0 and 1. The R2
    value is determined as: (7) where Qo is the observed streamflow, is the average
    observed streamflow, N is the number of observations, Qp is the predicted streamflow,
    is the average predicted streamflow, and Qo is the observed streamflow. Every
    unit is in m3/s. The NSE is calculated as the difference between 1 and the predicted
    inflow error variance ratio to the observed inflow variance (Moriasi et al., 2007).
    The NSE value ranges from -∞ to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect model fit. The
    NSE value is calculated as, (8) The RMSE, or standard deviation of prediction
    errors, accounts for the volumetric discrepancy between predicted and actual values
    (Moriasi et al., 2007). The RMSE value is determined as follows: (9) 3. Results
    3.1. LSTM model performance Sushanth et al. (2023a) investigated the effectiveness
    of LSTM models in forecasting the inflows to the Tenughat, Konar, and Panchet
    reservoirs. Thus, this study focused on training and testing the LSTM models specifically
    for the remaining reservoirs of the Damodar river basin, i.e., the Tilaya and
    Maithon reservoirs. The input variables for the LSTM models in both catchments
    were chosen based on the variables'' correlation with the model output, i.e.,
    inflows, I(t). In the Maithon catchment, variables P, Tmin, and I showed a high
    correlation up to a 4-day lag, while in the Tilaya catchment, the correlation
    was high up to a 2-day lag. In Contrast, Tmax showed a negative correlation in
    both catchments and was excluded from the input variables, except for Tmax(t).
    Additionally, in the Maithon catchment, the outflows from the Tilaya reservoir
    demonstrated a high correlation up to a lag of 3 days. As stated earlier, the
    hyperparameters of the LSTM models were fine-tuned using a trial-and-error approach
    to achieve reasonably good performance during both the training and testing periods.
    Fig. 6, Fig. 7 present the time series and scatter plots comparing the actual
    and predicted reservoir inflows for the Tilaya and Maithon catchments, respectively.
    In the training period, the LSTM model exhibited good performance for the Tilaya
    reservoir, as indicated by the metrics: R2 = 0.89, NSE = 0.88, RMSE = 19.79 m3/s.
    However, during the testing period, the model''s performance deteriorated slightly
    compared to the training period, with metrics of R2 = 0.85, NSE = 0.84, and RMSE
    = 16.13 m3/s. It is evident from Fig. 6 that the LSTM model successfully predicted
    high inflows into the Tilaya reservoir. However, there were some differences for
    low and medium flows during both the training and testing phases. Elements like
    a smaller catchment area and estimation uncertainty in the inputs could explain
    these inconsistencies. On the other hand, the LSTM model performed well in both
    the training (R2 = 0.93, NSE = 0.92, RMSE = 57.19 m3/s) and testing (R2 = 0.93,
    NSE = 0.93, RMSE = 41.47 m3/s) periods in the Maithon catchment. Fig. 7 demonstrates
    that, with only a few exceptions, the model successfully predicted most of the
    inflows. Unlike the Tilaya catchment, the LSTM model performed well in predicting
    low to medium inflows in the Panchet catchment. Including upstream reservoir outflows
    and their corresponding time lags as input variables may be responsible for this
    improved performance. Download : Download high-res image (342KB) Download : Download

    testing period for the Tilaya and Maithon catchments, along with the performance
    in the three remaining catchments of the Damodar river basin presented in Sushanth
    et al. (2023a). The results show that the performance metrics obtained for all
    the reservoirs were highly satisfactory. The values of the performance metrics
    suggest strong correlations between the predicted and observed inflows data, indicating
    that the LSTM models effectively captured the inflow variations in all the reservoirs.
    However, the model performance varied across the catchments. A noticeable trend
    emerged while comparing the LSTM model performance across the catchments (Section
    2.1). The catchments with larger areas exhibited better model performance than
    those with smaller areas. Table 2. Comparison of LSTM model performance in five

    reservoir inflows Sushanth et al. (2023a) performed real-time forecasting of inflows
    to the Panchet reservoir from the catchment, which included the Tenughat and Konar
    reservoirs, using a hybrid approach (LSTM model + conceptual reservoir module).
    This study replicates the earlier study for forecasting inflows to the Maithon
    reservoir. First, the GFS forecasts at 1–5 day lead times were bias-corrected
    using the SDM method. Before bias correction, the RMSE in the P forecasts ranged
    from 4.2 mm to 5.3 mm. However, after applying the bias correction, the RMSE decreased
    and ranged from 3.3 mm to 4.3 mm. Similarly, for Tmax and Tmin forecasts, the
    RMSE before bias correction varied between 1.7 °C and 2.5 °C, and 2.3 °C and 2.9
    °C, respectively, which improved to 1.3–1.8 °C and 1.3–1.5 °C after bias correction.
    These results show that the SDM method significantly improved the forecast skill
    of the GFS forecasts, and the bias in forecasts increased with the lead time.
    Using bias-corrected mean GFS data (2017–2018), the reservoir inflows of the Tilaya
    reservoir were forecasted with the trained LSTM model. These inflow forecasts
    and the other necessary input data were then fed into the reservoir module. The
    reservoir module''s outflow forecasts were subsequently used as input to the trained
    LSTM model of the Maithon catchment for forecasting inflows to the Maithon reservoir.
    Table 3 displays the performance indices for predicting the inflows to the Tilaya
    and Maithon reservoirs with a lead time of 1 to 5 days. As evident from Table
    3, the LSTM model performs excellently in forecasting inflows to the Tilaya and
    Maithon reservoirs at a 1-day lead time. The LSTM model''s efficacy, however,
    declined as lead time increased. The performance decline could be due to an increased
    bias in GFS forecast data. Fig. 8, Fig. 9 present the scatter plots of the observed
    and forecasted inflows to the Tilaya and Maithon reservoirs, respectively, at
    1–5 day lead times. The LSTM model demonstrated effective forecasting of high
    inflows to the Tilaya reservoir at a 1-day lead, with good alignment between observed
    and predicted values (Fig. 8). However, discrepancies were observed for some low
    to medium-range inflows. At a 2-day lead, the model continued to predict high
    inflows accurately, but there was an increased gap between forecasted and observed
    values for certain medium inflows. The 3-day lead showed under-prediction of peak
    flow and further scattering of medium inflows away from the 1:1 line. Forecasting
    low to medium-range inflows at 4-day and 5-day leads showed significant discrepancies.

    Maithon reservoir, the LSTM model exhibited well-aligned forecasts of peak inflows
    at the 1-day lead, as depicted in the scatter plots of Fig. 9. High inflows were
    correctly forecasted at a 2-day lead time; however, some medium inflows were dispersed
    outside the 1:1 line. The scattering of medium-range inflows increased at a 3-day
    lead compared to a 2-day lead. Further scattering was observed for medium-range
    inflows, and peak flows at 4-day and 5-day leads. Based on the performance indices,
    the LSTM model performed well in both catchments for 1–5 day lead times. However,
    a closer examination of the scatter plots revealed that the model performed considerably
    well for medium and high inflows at 1–3 day lead times. Higher discrepancies were
    noticed for medium-range inflows at longer lead times. The LSTM model performance
    in forecasting the inflows to the Panchet reservoir (Sushanth et al., 2023a) is
    also included in Table 3 for comparison. Table 3 shows that the Panchet reservoir
    consistently outperformed the Maithon reservoir in terms of R2 and NSE values,
    indicating stronger correlations between the forecasted and observed inflow data.
    Nevertheless, the RMSE values were higher for the Panchet reservoir, indicating
    more significant errors in the absolute magnitude of the predicted inflow values.
    These findings suggest that this hybrid approach performed better in forecasting
    Panchet reservoir inflows than the Maithon reservoir. 3.3. Forecasting irrigation
    demands Using the observed IMD data (2009–2018), the irrigation demand module
    simulated the daily net irrigation demands in the study area. These daily net
    irrigation demands were used to determine the seasonal irrigation demands of the
    Kharif, Rabi, and Boro seasons for the entire command area during 2009–2018 (Fig.
    10). The monsoon rainfall variability influenced the Kharif irrigation demand,
    which varies annually (949–2486 MCM). In contrast, the Rabi demand (88–104 MCM)
    did not change appreciably due to reduced or no rainfall in the season (Fig. 10).
    However, the Boro irrigation demands (211–755 MCM) varied considerably due to
    the variations in the cultivated area during the season (Fig. 10). As evident,
    the Kharif irrigation demands are significantly high compared to Rabi and Boro
    in all years due to the large area of command cultivated during the Kharif season.
    The Boro irrigation demands are high compared to the Rabi due to extensive paddy
    cultivation in the Boro season. Download : Download high-res image (141KB) Download

    Boro during 2009–2018. Fig. 11 presents the net irrigation demand forecasts for
    1–5 day lead times for the Kharif and Rabi + Boro seasons of 2017–18. The time
    periods of Rabi and Boro crops coincide, necessitating their representation as
    a combined category referred to as Rabi + Boro. Fig. 11 shows that although there
    is not much difference between actual irrigation demands (with IMD data) and irrigation
    demand forecasts in terms of magnitude, there are significant temporal variations
    between actual demands and demand forecasts. These variations are due to the bias
    in forecast data and its increased nature with the lead time. The temporal variations
    are prominent in the Kharif season compared to the Rabi and Boro seasons due to
    the high variability in the bias of P forecasts of GFS data (Mukhopadhyay et al.,
    2019; Sridevi et al., 2020). The total forecasted net irrigation demands (1–5
    day lead times) in the Kharif, Rabi, and Boro seasons of 2017–18 are compared
    with actual net irrigation demands (Table 4). Table 4 shows that the irrigation
    demands in the Kharif season are over-predicted at a 1-day lead and under-predicted
    in the remaining lead times, with a significant deviation from the actual demand.
    In the Rabi season, the irrigation demand forecasts remained relatively stable
    across 1 to 5-day lead times, indicating a slight variation with actual irrigation
    demand. In the case of the Boro season, the irrigation demand forecasts differ
    slightly from the actual demand and exhibit a slightly increasing trend with the
    lead time. Table 5 presents the percentage forecast errors in the net irrigation
    demand forecasts. For the Kharif season, the positive and negative forecast errors
    show the overestimation and underestimation of the forecasted irrigation demands
    (Table 5). In the Rabi season, the positive forecast errors indicate a slight
    overestimation of the irrigation demands compared to the actual values (Table
    5). For the Boro season, the positive forecast errors indicate a moderate overestimation
    of the forecasted irrigation demands (Table 5). Overall, the forecasts tended
    to underestimate the irrigation demands in the Kharif season, while in the Rabi
    and Boro seasons, the forecasts showed a slight overestimation. Download : Download

    reservoir module simulated the Panchet reservoir operation with inflow and demand
    forecasts from 2017 to 2018. Fig. 12 compares forecasted storage levels up to
    5-day lead with actual storage levels. The figure shows that the forecasted storage
    levels reached dead storage by the end of May 2017, which was not the case with
    the actual levels. The storage level forecasts of 1–5 days lead followed the same
    pattern during the monsoon season; however, there are considerable time lags among
    the storage level forecasts. In the 2017 monsoon season, the forecasted storage
    levels reached the conservation level around the same time (end of July 2017)
    as the actual levels (Fig. 12). Since it is assumed that the water above the conservation
    level will be released through the spillway to reduce the flood risk, the storage
    level forecasts remained around the conservation level up to September 2017, with
    some depressions (Fig. 12). After the monsoon season, the forecasted storage levels
    followed the same pattern as the actual levels. However, the magnitude of the
    forecasted storage levels except 1-day lead was much higher than the actual levels
    (due to the assumption that the water in the flood control zone will not be released
    through the spillway from October to May). The high rainfall forecasts of 2–5
    day lead at the end of the monsoon season serve as the primary source for reservoir
    inflows, leading to heightened storage levels in October. The forecasted storage
    levels for a 1-day lead were lower than the 2–5 day leads due to the variability
    among the inflow forecasts. The forecast storage levels at a 1-day lead reached
    a maximum level of 129 m compared to 130–132 m for the remaining lead times, with
    the maximum level of the Panchet reservoir being 135.64 m. At the start of May
    2018, the forecasted storage levels at a 1-day lead reached the dead storage level,
    while the 2–5 days storage level forecasts had a higher level. Like in the 2017
    monsoon, the forecasted storage levels in the 2018 monsoon reached the conservation
    level around the same time as the actual levels. However, unlike in 2017, the
    forecasted storage levels after the 2018 monsoon did not increase but decreased
    significantly due to lower inflows during the post-monsoon season. Download :

    1-day lead with actual withdrawals in the Kharif and Rabi + Boro seasons of 2017–18.
    From Fig. 13(a), it is evident that most of the demands from the Kharif season
    were fully satisfied by the forecasted withdrawals due to the high inflows, except
    for the early demands in June. During the Kharif season, the forecasted demands
    were estimated at 1118 MCM, while the forecasted withdrawals were projected at
    971 MCM. However, the actual withdrawals during this season amounted to 596 MCM,
    i.e., lower than the forecasted withdrawals. In the Rabi + Boro season, all the
    demands were satisfied with the forecasted withdrawals up to the end of March,
    while demands of the April and May were not met (Fig. 13(b)). This result may
    be due to the storage level forecasts for the 1-day lead reaching the dead storage
    level (Fig. 12). In the Rabi + Boro season, the forecasted demands and withdrawals
    were 666 MCM and 518 MCM, respectively. However, the actual withdrawals for this
    season were significantly lower (353 MCM) than the forecasted withdrawals. Also,
    the temporal pattern of actual withdrawals did not match the forecasted demands.
    Fig. 14 compares the forecasted and actual outflows of the Panchet reservoir in
    the 2017 flood event (21st July to 02nd August). It is evident from the figure
    that the forecasted outflows from the reservoir followed the same pattern as the
    actual outflows. The forecasts were initially higher than the actual outflows,
    but the actual peak outflows (27th and 28th July) were high, causing downstream
    floods. The forecasted outflows were restricted to the maximum downstream channel
    capacity (3115 m3/s) to avoid floods downstream. Therefore, this approach is also
    helpful in controlling the floods downstream. Download : Download high-res image

    The conceptual reservoir module also simulated the Maithon reservoir operation
    with inflow and demand forecasts from 2017 to 2018. Fig. 15 compares forecasted
    storage levels up to 5-day lead with actual storage levels. The figure shows that
    the forecasted storage levels decreased until June 2017, with the actual levels
    being lower than the forecasted levels. In June 2017, the forecasted levels were
    drastically lower than the actual levels due to high demand and low inflow forecasts.
    The storage level forecasts of 1–5 days lead followed the same pattern during
    the monsoon season; however, there were considerable time lags among the storage
    level forecasts. During the 2017 monsoon season, the forecasted and actual storage
    levels reached the conservation level around the same time (end of July 2017).
    Subsequently, the storage level forecasts remained at the conservation level with
    occasional depressions up to October 2017. After the monsoon season, the forecasted
    storage levels followed the same pattern as the actual levels. However, the magnitude
    of the forecasted storage levels of 1-day lead was lower than the actual levels.
    It was also observed that the forecasted storage levels for 2–5 day lead times
    were higher than the 1-day lead forecasts due to the variability among the inflow
    forecasts. The forecast storage levels at a 1-day lead reached a maximum level
    of 148.5 m compared to 150 m for the remaining lead times, with the maximum level
    of the Panchet reservoir being 152.64 m. At the end of March 2018, the 2–5 day
    lead forecasted storage levels reached the conservation storage level but declined
    significantly afterwards. The forecasted storage levels reached the dead storage
    level by the end of June 2018. During the 2018 monsoon season, the forecasted
    storage levels reached the conservation level around the same time as the actual
    levels, except for the 1-day and 4-day lead forecasts. In contrast to 2017, the
    forecasted storage levels after the 2018 monsoon did not increase but experienced
    a significant decrease due to lower inflow forecasts during the post-monsoon season.

    level of Maithon reservoir. Fig. 16 compares the forecasted demand and withdrawals
    at the 1-day lead with actual withdrawals in the Kharif and Rabi + Boro seasons
    of 2017–18. From Fig. 13(a), it is evident that the demands from the Kharif season
    were fully satisfied by the forecasted withdrawals due to the high inflows. During
    the Kharif season, the forecasted withdrawals were estimated at 856 MCM, which
    were lower than the forecasted demands of 914 MCM. However, the actual withdrawals
    during this season amounted to 628 MCM, i.e., lower than the forecasted withdrawals.
    In the Rabi + Boro season, almost all the demands were satisfied with the forecasted
    withdrawals (Fig. 13(b)), which may be due to the excess storage available in
    the reservoir (Fig. 15). In the Rabi + Boro season, the forecasted demands and
    withdrawals were 588 MCM and 556 MCM, respectively. However, the actual withdrawals
    for this season were lower (495 MCM) than the forecasted withdrawals. Also, the
    temporal pattern of actual withdrawals did not match the forecasted demands. Fig.
    17 compares the forecasted and actual outflows of the Maithon reservoir in the
    2017 flood event (21st July to 02nd August). At the time of peak flood (27th July),
    the water from the Maithon reservoir was not released as the outflows from the
    Panchet reservoir were already high. Actual outflows from the reservoir were more
    on 31st July and 1st August in this period. There were no outflow forecasts in
    this period as the reservoir was not completely full, except for the 4-day lead
    forecast on July 30 and the 5-day lead forecast on August 1. However, the outflow
    forecast of 4-day lead was slightly more than the actual outflow, but lower than
    the maximum downstream channel capacity. Therefore, there was no flood risk in
    downstream of Maithon reservoir. Download : Download high-res image (372KB) Download

    managed with the inflow and irrigation demand forecasts to satisfy the demands
    and control downstream floods. The LSTM model offers excellent potential for forecasting
    reservoir inflows in the Damodar river basin. These findings agree with Lin et
    al. (2021), Rahimzad et al. (2021), and He et al. (2022). The catchments with
    larger areas exhibited better LSTM model performance than those with smaller areas.
    This correlation may be attributed to the smoothening effect of input data in
    larger catchments, resulting in more accurate predictions and better model performance.
    Using bias-corrected GFS data in the Maithon and Tilaya reservoirs, the LSTM model
    achieved accurate streamflow predictions for up to a 5-day lead. However, the
    forecasting error was more for longer lead times, mainly over three days. The
    increase in the error could be attributed to a significant bias in extreme precipitation
    events in the GFS data beyond the 3-day lead (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2019). Moreover,
    the medium-range inflows in both reservoirs exhibited over-prediction and under-prediction,
    which may be explained by the variation in P bias across lead times (Sridevi et
    al., 2020). The LSTM model performance in forecasting the Panchet reservoir''s
    inflows is superior to that of the Maithon reservoir. The Panchet reservoir is
    built on the perennial Damodar river, while the Maithon reservoir is built on
    the intermittent Barakar river. As the streamflow''s magnitudes and rates are
    high in the Damodar river, we can expect better model performance for the Panchet
    reservoir. The irrigation demand forecasts based on the GFS weather forecasts
    provide valuable insights into the anticipated water requirements for different
    cropping seasons and lead times. Several recent studies have focused on the development
    and application of ML models for irrigation demand forecasting using short-term
    weather forecasts (Pulido-Calvo and Gutiérrez-Estrada, 2009; Ticlavilca et al.,
    2013; Perera et al., 2016; Perea et al., 2019; Zanfei et al., 2022). However,
    the data requirement, generalisation of the ML model to a specific dataset, and
    limited feature representation are the main limitations of the ML models in irrigation
    demand forecasting (Bergen et al., 2019). Many authors have used short-term weather
    forecasts to estimate the irrigation demand forecasts conceptually to use in irrigation
    scheduling or scenario-based assessments (Wang and Cai, 2009; Cao et al., 2019;
    Anupoju et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Roy et al., 2021; Gedam et al., 2023).
    Li et al. (2018) proposed a similar method that uses a single-crop coefficient
    methodology and weather forecasts to forecast ETc up to seven days lead with reasonable
    accuracy. However, while simulating and predicting the irrigation demands, these
    studies do not consider the dynamics of soil moisture. Forouhar et al. (2022)
    used a hybrid approach (conceptual and data-driven models) for forecasting irrigation
    demand. The daily crop water requirements were estimated in the conceptual module,
    and the data-driven module was then trained using the residuals between the conceptual
    module''s outputs and the observed pumped volumes. However, that study did not
    account for the uncertainty associated with weather variables and forecasts. In
    order to produce daily irrigation demand forecasts with lead times of up to five
    days, our study is the first to assess the reliability of GFS forecasts. These
    forecasts assist farmers and reservoir operators in making informed decisions
    regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and resource management. The
    reservoir operations, considering inflow and demand forecasts, help control the
    floods and effectively satisfy downstream water demands. There are many studies
    available on effective reservoir operation considering the inflow forecasts only
    (Jain et al., 1999; Sivapragasam et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2019; Tegegne and
    Kim, 2020; Meema et al., 2021; He et al., 2022). However, in regions of irrigated
    agriculture, the irrigation demand forecasts will play a significant role in the
    effective operation of reservoirs due to the temporal variations of irrigation
    demands. Gorguner and Kavvas (2020) used a similar approach of using projected
    long-term inflows and demands under climate change in a dynamic water balance
    model. The inflows and water demands were projected using a physically-based hydrological
    model and the FAO-56 method, respectively. However, the inflow forecasting using
    the ML model gives an accurate and efficient forecast, and irrigation demand estimation
    considering soil moisture dynamics gives a reasonable forecast under data-restricting
    conditions. Although our study is on real-time forecasting of reservoir operation,
    our approach is superior to their approach in the effective operation of reservoirs.
    Our study is original in examining the impact of inflows and irrigation demand
    forecasts on optimising reservoir operations for up to 5 days. One of the key
    benefits of integrating inflow and irrigation demand forecasts into reservoir
    operations is that the reservoir operators can adjust release strategies and reservoir
    storage levels in advance to meet anticipated irrigation demands while ensuring
    flood control downstream. This proactive approach enhances water use efficiency,
    reduces water shortages, and minimises the risk of over- or under-allocation of
    water resources. While integrating inflow and irrigation demand forecasts into
    reservoir operations offers advantages, certain limitations must be considered.
    One fundamental limitation is the inherent uncertainty associated with weather
    forecasts. It is important to note that the accuracy of the inflows and irrigation
    demand forecasts mainly relies on the quality and reliability of the weather forecasts
    generated by the GFS model. Inaccurate or unreliable forecasts can lead to suboptimal
    water allocation decisions and potentially increase the risk of water shortages
    or excessive releases. Therefore, continuous evaluation and improvement of forecast
    models, real-time data assimilation, and uncertainty information integration are
    essential to enhance forecast reliability. Another challenge is the spatial and
    temporal resolution of the forecasts. Reservoirs often serve multiple irrigation
    districts or water users, each with distinct spatial and temporal water demands.
    It is necessary to ensure that the forecasts adequately capture the spatial and
    temporal variations in irrigation demands and inflows to meet the specific needs
    of different water users. Also, data limitations, model uncertainties, limited
    consideration of socio-economic factors, and lack of stakeholder involvement are
    the possible limitations of this approach. 5. Conclusions We have presented a
    comprehensive study on effective reservoir operation using inflows and irrigation
    demand forecasts. This study aimed at forecasting reservoir inflows and irrigation
    demands using bias-corrected GFS forecasts in a hybrid approach (LSTM + reservoir
    module) and irrigation demand module, respectively. These forecasts are embedded
    with a reservoir module to forecast the reservoir outflows and storage levels
    in the context of effective reservoir operation. Our study concludes that the
    hybrid approach significantly impacts accurately forecasting inflows to the Panchet
    and Maithon reservoirs 1–5 days ahead. Our study''s results also demonstrate the
    integrated approach''s effectiveness in accurately forecasting irrigation demands.
    The findings also highlight the potential of incorporating these forecasts into
    reservoir management practices to enhance operational decision-making. By considering
    inflow and irrigation demand forecasts, reservoir operators can optimise water
    allocation, storage, and release strategies, improving water resource management
    and increasing system efficiency. It is essential to highlight that the accuracy
    of the inflows and irrigation demand forecasts relies on the quality and reliability
    of the GFS weather forecasts. Considering the uncertainties associated with weather
    forecasts, it is crucial to continually evaluate and improve the accuracy of the
    forecasting models through ongoing monitoring and validation. Furthermore, ongoing
    research and development are necessary to refine the irrigation demand module,
    considering additional factors influencing irrigation demands, such as specific
    crop characteristics and localised soil conditions. It is important to note that
    this study focused on the effective operation of reservoirs within a 5-day timeframe
    in only two years, and future research could explore longer forecasting horizons
    over a long period and incorporate additional factors such as climate change projections
    to enhance reservoir management practices further. The operational rule curves
    may also be added to the reservoir module to accommodate site-specific requirements.

    Abstract Real-time irrigation schedules have been shown to outperform predetermined
    irrigation schedules that do not consider the present state and requirements.
    However, implementing real-time irrigation scheduling requires reliable present
    soil-crop-atmosphere dynamics and weather predictions; moreover, enabling farmers

    irrigation scheduling tool Human-computer interaction facilitates practical application
    of the tool through farmer''s engagement Using the tool leads to more accurate
    state estimations and higher profits in comparison to traditional techniques and
    practices 1 Introduction Agriculture is the largest water resources consumer,
    as irrigation constitutes 70% of the world''s freshwater withdrawals; even though,
    more regions will face water scarcity due to environmental and economic limitations
    (Jeong et al., 2020; Michelon et al., 2020). Therefore, farmers need to make optimal
    decisions on irrigation scheduling, that is, determining the irrigation timing
    and amount for both water saving and crop yield increase. As more field-specific
    data are revealed along the crop growing season, real-time irrigation schedules
    have been shown to outperform predetermined irrigation schedules that do not consider
    the present water requirement and water availability for a crop (Jamal et al.,
    2018, 2019). However, a main challenge of implementing real-time irrigation scheduling
    is to represent the soil-crop-atmosphere dynamics at present and/or future predictions
    (Hejazi et al., 2014). Reliable employment of the dynamics via accurate simulation
    with consideration of uncertainty is crucial for real-time irrigation scheduling.
    Meanwhile, how to incorporate farmers'' experience and knowledge in irrigation
    schedule development is also crucial for the acceptance and utilization of a model-recommended
    irrigation schedule. By resolving these critical issues, this paper addresses
    the feasibility of a real-time irrigation scheduling tool (RTIST) based on weather
    forecasts, field observations, and human-machine interactions. Relevant studies
    on the optimality, accuracy, and applicability of an irrigation schedule to real-world
    practices are reviewed as follows. 1.1 Optimality Various studies employ real-time
    irrigation scheduling using rule-based approaches, in which the irrigation is
    determined according to the current field conditions and a set of predetermined
    rules. For instance, Hashemi and Decker (1969) derived irrigation scheduling rules
    that helped keep the soil moisture above 50%. Meanwhile, several studies showed
    that incorporating weather forecasts in irrigation scheduling could increase the
    profitability of irrigated agriculture (Allen & Lambert, 1971; Cai et al., 2011;
    D. Wang & Cai, 2009). The superiority of weather forecasts in irrigation scheduling
    lies in applying current decisions while exploiting the information from the upcoming
    weather (e.g., by waiting for a forthcoming rain event rather than applying the
    whole amount currently needed for irrigation). For example, D. Wang and Cai (2009)
    showed superior profits from using weather forecasts within rule-based irrigation
    scheduling in comparison to only using current soil moisture in corn fields in
    Illinois. The irrigation was applied when a set of condition on the soil moisture
    and the probability of rain on the forecast period is met. When the irrigation
    was applied, the soil moisture was bringed to the field capacity. In particular,
    weather forecasts are incorporated into irrigation scheduling via stochastic optimization
    techniques, which showed the advantage over rule-based techniques and conventional
    methods in terms of profit maximization (Bergez et al., 2002; Jamal et al., 2018;
    D. Wang & Cai, 2009). 1.2 Accuracy Irrigation scheduling is mostly based on an
    agro-hydrological simulation model to evaluate the impacts of different irrigation
    application plans. The simulation approach includes models of soil water balance
    (Mateos et al., 2002), water dynamics (Shang et al., 2004), and crop simulation
    (Bergez et al., 2002). These models are able to describe in detail the crop growth,
    which enables the evaluation of user-defined irrigation schedules by comparing
    simulation results of evapotranspiration, crop yield, as well as water consumption.
    Recent studies employed coupled simulation-optimization models to address the
    irrigation scheduling problem (Allam et al., 2016; Jamal et al., 2019; Linker,
    2021; Singh, 2012). Within this approach, the coupled models are used to determine
    the optimal irrigation scheduling under given objectives (e.g., maximizing profits)
    and constraints (e.g., limiting irrigation amounts). However, the limited accuracy
    of these simulation models presents a barrier to the use of the models for real-world
    irrigation scheduling practice. With growing data availability at the crop field
    scale from various sources such as remote sensing and in-situ sensing, using field
    observations of the environment (e.g., soil moisture) and the crop status (e.g.,
    leaf area index [LAI]) has been shown to improve the modeling accuracy of crop
    water requirement and availability, crop growth, and the soil-crop-atmosphere
    dynamics (Hu et al., 2019). In particular, data assimilation (DA) is an efficient
    approach to improving state estimation by combining information from field observations
    and simulation models in a real-time manner (Reichle, 2008). While remote sensing
    and satellite data can work successfully in DA of LAI (Charoenhirunyingyos et
    al., 2011; Ines et al., 2013), soil moisture remote sensing has some limitations
    in terms of temporal and spatial resolution (Jamal & Linker, 2020). In addition,
    remote sensing does not provide data on deep soil layers along the root zone,
    which is important for crop growth simulations. Furthermore, remote sensing cannot
    penetrate through dense vegetation (Ines et al., 2013). Therefore, direct pointwise
    sensor observations installed at several depths (e.g., Dong et al., 2015; Lü et
    al., 2011) are complementary to remote sensing data for crop and environment modeling
    at the field scale. 1.3 Applicability Last but not least, despite numerous trials
    to improve its applicability, real-time irrigation scheduling studies are rarely
    applied in real life. One of the main reasons is that farmers do not like to be
    replaced but like to be involved (Rose et al., 2018). In addition, the experience
    of farmers implicitly includes many factors which are difficult to include in
    computer-based models, such as responses to policies (Bontemps & Couture, 2002)
    and various impacts of farmers'' age, education, attitude, and knowledge toward
    the irrigation scheduling problem (Karami, 2006). Therefore, the involvement of
    farmers is necessary for not only improving computer-based tools in terms of reality
    but also for the final acceptance for use (Yohannes et al., 2019). However, farmers''
    suggestions as feedback to the computer-based tools are usually not incorporated
    into a real-time modeling procedure (Rose et al., 2016; Tapsuwan et al., 2015).
    In general, despite the existing efforts to reduce the gap between farmers and
    computers in irrigation scheduling (Pande & Savenije, 2016; van Emmerik et al.,
    2014), incorporating farmers'' insights and experiences into computer models is
    still limited (Bierkens, 2015). Therefore, the direct incorporation of the farmers''
    insights and experiences into an irrigation scheduling decision support model
    can contribute to the realism of the model (O''Keeffe et al., 2018). At each decision
    point, the farmers'' involvement with computer-based tools that provide estimations
    of current and predicted variables (e.g., crop yield) can profoundly contribute
    to the implementation of such tools in real life (Linker, 2021). As adopted by
    several works on agriculture (Rose et al., 2018), reservoir operation systems
    (Zhang et al., 2020), and others, in this work, a real-time irrigation scheduling
    model based on “online” human-computer interaction between the model and the user
    is presented. This study integrates a simulation & optimization model, a DA technique,
    and a human-computer interaction method to generate a RTIST. This integration
    enables providing the daily optimal irrigation amounts based on weather forecasts.
    This framework will be based on crop and environment simulation models improved
    by assimilating field observations. The framework will involve farmers in day-by-day
    irrigation decision-making crossing the crop growth season to assure the applicability
    of the tool. The uniqueness of the framework is thus expressed in its optimality,
    accuracy, and applicability. The performance of the framework is examined by an
    interactive workshop with a group of farmers and in a real-world case study in
    corn fields in Eastern Nebraska, US. 2 Methodology 2.1 Overview The proposed RTIST
    framework consists of four sub-models: (a) stochastic optimization, (b) soil-crop
    simulation, (c) DA, and (d) human-computer interaction. Daily irrigation amounts
    are inferred in real-time, based on probabilistic weather forecasts, current field
    conditions, and crop growth predicted by Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model
    (Kroes et al., 2017). However, the recommended irrigation amounts by the simulation-optimization
    model are not assumed to be used by default; instead, the actually applied irrigation
    amounts are decided day-by-day via a human-computed interactive method, which
    combines the computer optimality and farmers'' experience, knowledge, and behavior.
    In this paper, farmers are directly interacting with the computer by accepting
    or modifying the recommended irrigation. The ultimately applied irrigation amount
    (after the interaction with the farmer and his final decision) is used as input
    for the simulation model enhanced by the DA module within a “closed-loop.” This
    module aims to update the current states, the soil hydraulic parameters and LAI
    related crop parameters of the simulation model as detailed in the remainder.
    The RTIST framework is illustrated in Figure 1. The computer model (simulation-optimization)
    runs by rolling daily time windows. In each of the time windows (t), it assimilates
    the observation of LAI and soil moisture at several depths, and adopts the actual
    irrigation application taken by farmers (which can be the same or different from
    the model''s recommended optimal value at time window t) at the end of the time
    window, and then moves to next time window (t + 1) to generate a new recommended
    irrigation based on the updated soil moisture and crop growth status and the weather
    forecast with a certain length of forecast horizon (e.g., a 3-day period is tested
    in this study). Meanwhile, farmers check the recommended application from the
    model during each time window and decide to take it or use a different one based
    on their justification. This procedure is continued over all time windows till
    the end of the crop growing season. In this framework, observed data, irrigation
    farmers'' choices, and computer models are coupled in the human-computer interactions
    (Figure 1), and the framework directly links framers with a real-time optimization-simulation
    model. This kind of “online” and “closed-loop” interaction between the model and
    users rolls over the time windows during the irrigation season. Figure 1 Open

    optimization, soil-crop simulation, data assimilation, and human-computer interaction.
    The proposed method is characterized by several advantages. First, using stochastic
    optimization rather than deterministic optimization takes into account the uncertainty
    involved in the weather forecast. Second, including Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant
    (SWAP) model in the irrigation scheduling as a well-validated hydro-agronomic
    model provides a solid physical basis for the decision process; in particular,
    including DA adjusts the modeled states from time to time to ensure the reliability
    of the simulated state variables. Third, farmer intervention is crucial for the
    practical application of the tool. Some existing works include stochastic weather
    forecasts (e.g., Jamal et al., 2018; Linker, 2021); some include DA for irrigation
    scheduling modeling (e.g., Han et al., 2012; Ines et al., 2013); some include
    DA, deterministic optimization, and farmer intervention together with simple simulation
    models (X. Li et al., 2023). The uniqueness of the proposed method of this work
    lies in the inclusivity of all the mentioned advantages in one holistic framework,
    as shown in Figure 1. 2.2 Real-Time Simulation-Optimization Model Weather forecasts
    play an important role in irrigation scheduling, especially the forecasts that
    extend to more than a few days (Cai et al., 2011; Jamal et al., 2018, 2019). However,
    since the forecasted weather might differ from actual weather, a probabilistic
    weather forecast can help handle this problem in the context of stochastic optimization
    with multiple scenarios characterized by probabilities of occurrence. The scenarios
    can be obtained based on probabilistic forecasts (e.g., National Oceanic and Atmospheric
    Administration probabilistic forecasts; D. Wang & Cai, 2009; Cai et al., 2011).
    In this study, the probabilistic forecasts were generated by a mean of Weather
    Research Forecast (WRF; J. Wang et al., 2022) and a standard deviation that was
    heuristically calculated based on historical calculation of the error of WRF forecast.
    Gaussian distribution was used for sampling the scenarios of the variables except
    for the rain where Gamma distribution was used. More details are in Section 10.
    Optimization methods and algorithms are used to infer the optimal irrigation amounts
    based on a predefined objective function and constraints (Cai & Rosegrant, 2004;
    J. Li et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2017). In this study, the SWAP model is used as
    a simulation model, which simulates physical processes at a field level related
    to soil heat flow, solute flow, soil water flow, crop growth, macropore flow,
    and interaction with groundwater and/or surface water system. Within the simulation-optimization
    framework, SWAP is coupled with an optimization algorithm in which several irrigation
    amounts are examined by employing simulations based on current field status and
    future forecasts (Cai et al., 2011; Jamal et al., 2018, 2019). A detailed description
    of the SWAP model can be found in van Dam (2000). SWAP is run using several irrigation
    amounts on day t under each weather scenario and the expected profit is calculated
    using the model outputs, as follows: (1) where Pt(Ik) is the expected profit at
    time step t with irrigation amount Ik, Prn is the probability of occurrence of
    the nth weather ensemble member, tf is the weather forecast length, is the expected
    yield when running the SWAP model from time t until t + tf using the nth weather
    ensemble member and Ik irrigation, st is the state variable at time t (e.g., soil
    moisture, LAI, and yield), pt is the model parameters set at time t, is the nth
    weather ensemble member at time step t, Yp is the yield price, PWRt is the water
    price, and N is the size of the weather forecast ensemble. The recommended irrigation
    amount results in the highest profits: (2) where is the optimal (recommended)
    irrigation amount at time t (day). t is basically run from the beginning of the
    growing season (t = 0) until the end of the growing season. Figure 2 describes
    the simulation-optimization framework. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    The simulation-optimization framework. The framework is composed of three loops
    with time (t, crossing the irrigation season), weather forecast scenarios (n),
    and water applications (k). 2.3 Data Assimilation Data assimilation techniques
    can help estimate the states and model parameters of a complex system using observations
    to adjust the modeled state variable value, as well as refining associated parameters.
    Particle Filter (PF) has shown several advantages over other widely used techniques
    such as ensemble Karman Filter in different studies on nonlinear dynamic systems.
    PF estimates states and parameters based on running an ensemble of models (or
    particles) in parallel, and each particle is associated with a weight that indicates
    for its probability to represent the posterior distribution (Douc & Cappé, 2005;
    Moradkhani et al., 2012). Nonlinear dynamic systems in a discrete formation are
    described as follows: (3) where f(·) denotes the model, h(·) denotes the operator
    of the observations, xt denotes the state variable at time t, ut is the forcing
    data at time t, θt is the vector of the model parameters at time t, and yt is
    the vector of the observations at time t. ωt and νt are the process and observations
    noises, which are usually assumed to be white noises with covariance Qt and Rt,
    respectively. When observations become available, the posterior of the states
    and parameters are calculated based on the Bayesian theorem as follows: (4) An
    analytical solution for the posterior is only feasible for specific cases such
    as a linear process with Gaussian noise and therefore the need for posterior approximation.
    PFs estimate the posterior based on the ensemble of particles and their corresponding
    weights. The weights are calculated based on the Bayesian theorem as follows:
    (5) where is the weight of the ith particle in the prior distribution, and is
    the likelihood. The prior weights are equal to the posterior weights from the
    previous time step. When applying resampling the weights are set to be equal.
    Well-known problem of PFs are filter degeneracy and sampling impoverishment, in
    which low weights of the particles and low sample diversity occur, respectively
    (Abbaszadeh et al., 2018; Moradkhani et al., 2012). Among the newest versions
    of PF that alleviate these problems is the version provided by Jamal and Linker
    (2020). This method consists of a PF combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
    and evolutionary operators of crossover and mutation with the PF. Integrating
    MCMC with PF helps eliminate the low weights particles and maintain particles
    that have higher weights and probabilities of survival. This operation can help
    solve the problem of filter degeneracy. However, this method only eliminates particles
    with low weights without generating new particles with high weights. Therefore,
    evolutionary operators are used to ensure the sampling of new particles based
    on the high weights particles. As shown in Jamal and Linker (2020), this integration
    can alleviate the impoverishment problem. In this study, DA is applied on daily
    basis to improve the estimations of the current states and the model parameters,
    which leads to improved future predictions. At each time step (daily), soil moisture
    at several depths and crop LAI (from sensors) are used to update the field-level
    state and the model parameters. The updated state and parameters are related to
    the soil and crop that are highly correlated to the observations. The soil parameters
    are the van Genuchten–Mualem model parameters, and the crop parameters are the
    maximum relative increase in LAI, lower threshold temperature for the aging of
    leaves, light use efficiency for real leaf, and efficiency of conversion into
    leaves. More details are in Section 10. Note that LAI and soil moisture play an
    important role in the crop yield estimation by controlling several processes such
    as plant canopy interception and evapotranspiration, and by linking soil, atmosphere,
    and plant together (Bai and He, 2015; Charoenhirunyingyos et al., 2011; De Wit
    & Van Diepen, 2007). DA will not only connect field observation and modeling but
    also close the loop between the simulation-optimization model and farmers'' decisions
    by assimilating new field observations of soil moisture and LAI that are updated
    with farmers'' actual irrigation application at the present day to the model for
    updating the water and crop simulation, as detailed in the following. 2.4 Human-Computer
    Interaction: Graphical User Interface and Experiments The essential difference
    between the method presented in this work and the direct use of optimization lies
    in the “online” incorporation of farmers'' choices, which brings in farmers''
    experiences, knowledge, and behaviors on irrigation. Farmers'' irrigation decision
    and their willingness to follow the model-suggested solution vary by person, crop,
    and area. To address this issue, some studies used machine learning methods and
    historical records to train a “mental model” that attempts to mimic irrigation
    scheduling decisions (Sun et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2020); however, limited understanding
    and representation of farmers'' behaviors hinder the effective use of such a computer-based
    mental model. The construction of a computer-based human mental model to mimic
    irrigation farmers'' behaviors is not the purpose of this paper. Instead, RTIST
    provides a framework for farmers to interact with a computer model directly. RTIST
    allows farmers to decide if they want to adopt the model-recommended water application
    or use their choice based on their experiences and priorities with consideration
    of the model recommendation. Framers'' choices can involve multiple factors, including
    crop types, personal experiences, and responses to policies and regulations. The
    human-machine interaction is designed for a specific irrigated crop in a particular
    area, with consideration of farmers'' experiences on the land. A Graphical User
    Interface (GUI) is designed to facilitate the human-machine interaction, as shown
    in Figure 3. At the beginning, farmers are asked to provide some inputs such as
    if they conduct irrigation with fertilization at the beginning of the season,
    what are the variable and constant water application costs, and how much is the
    seasonal irrigation amount limit if existing. Following that, at the interaction
    for a particular day, farmers are provided with several pieces of information
    based on observation, forecast and model simulation, including the status of the
    field, irrigation application up to the day, rain in the past several days, and
    weather forecast in the next several days. Following reviewing these information
    pieces, farmers are given the model-recommended irrigation amount for the day;
    they decide whether to accept the recommendation or do something different by
    choosing different amount of irrigation application (including no irrigation on
    that day). Whenever irrigation is applied, farmers provide other inputs such as
    current variable water cost, which will enable more realistic cost assessment
    of an irrigation application. At the end of an interaction, farmers can choose
    to have a no-irrigation period (a number of days following the current day), in
    which the tool assumes no-irrigation and no farmers'' intervention. The computer
    model keeps simulating the water and crop states based on observation and forecast
    during the period and interacting with farmers in some days chosen by farmers.
    For any day with farmer-computer interaction, farmers will be asked to choose
    the “no-irrigation period” after the current day, and the interaction will come
    back at the end of the no-irrigation period. Such interactions continue to the
    end of the irrigation season. The final window shows farmers the total amount
    of water application, crop yield, and profit. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    The flowchart of the Graphical User Interface designed for the human-machine interaction.
    The window number at each stage is shown in bold red. Thus, the human-computer
    interaction enables farmers to learn and make their choices based on the information
    and recommendation provided by the model. DA plays a key linkage between farmers''
    decisions on irrigation applications and the simulation-optimization model. Via
    the DA, the state variables (soil moisture and LAI) and parameters of the SWAP
    simulation model are updated using the real-time field observation of soil and
    crop, as well as daily updated weather forecast, which provides more reliable
    support for generating the optimal irrigation application in a specific day crossing
    the entire irrigation season. Furthermore, it is assumed that farmers have some
    recapitulation about their choices during the interactions with the computer model
    and bring some learning to the next irrigation season. This learning process is
    further discussed in the following. Experiments are designed to test RTIST with
    irrigation farmers to have their feedback about the usefulness of the tool and
    the improvement needed. This can be conducted via a “fire drill” of a virtual
    irrigation exercise (VIE). In a workshop set up for the experiments, RTIST modelers
    and invited farmers go over the interactions described above through a hypothetical,
    computer-generated VIE. Being analogy to the so-called virtual drought exercises
    (VDEs, Loucks and van Beek, 2005), a good VIE will raise important issues and
    provide experiences that can be applied in real irrigation practices. The VIE
    follows the three stages of VDE as described in Loucks and van Beek (2005)—briefing,
    gaming and debriefing. The briefing will define the objectives of the exercise
    and provide a brief tutorial about the interaction process including some explanation
    of the windows (Figure 3). The gaming portion of VIE allows participants (modelers
    and irrigation farmers) to play a “dry run” of the modeling tool. A single farmer
    or a small group of farmers can participate in one experiment, where the groups
    can discuss their responses to the model outputs and make a choice together. The
    same experiment will be conducted simultaneously with multiple individual farmers
    or farmer groups so that the results from different farmers can be compared. Through
    this gaming stage, it is important for participants to perform “self-observation,”
    that is, knowing the consequence of their decisions (e.g., no-irrigation may end
    with soil dryness; an irrigation application may coincide with a major rainfall
    event in the next few days). Such self-observation will contribute to the final
    debriefing stage that translates participants'' actions and perceptions into “lessons
    learned” via some recapitulation of their choices during the experiments. In addition,
    for modelers to refine RTIST, a survey can be conducted at the end of the workshop,
    asking for users'' feedback on the experiments including their experiences in
    irrigation scheduling decisions and suggestions to improve RTIST (see Appendix
    for the survey questions and responses). 3 Case Study RTIST was tested on two
    maize fields located in east Nebraska (98.22°W, 42.02°N; 98.2°W, 41.95°N) in the
    crop season of 2019. Current weather was collected daily from Elgin station of
    the Automated Weather Data Network operated by the High Plains Regional Climate
    Center, located at 98.19°W, 41.94°N. The real-time weather forecast was made using
    the Weather Research and Forecast model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem, Fast et al.,
    2006; Grell et al., 2005), which provides 72-hr prediction of meteorology and
    air quality for the study domain at 4 km resolution, four times per day. The WRF-Chem
    configuration we have here followed our past studies (Ge et al., 2014, 2017; J.
    Wang et al., 2013, 2022; Zhang et al., 2020). The 1° × 1° National Center for
    Environmental Prediction Final Analysis data at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC
    were used in real time for initializing and specifying the temporally evolving
    lateral boundary conditions. For each model run (i.e., four times per day), the
    prediction was made for the following 72 hr, and the hourly outputs were archived.
    Therefore, for a given hour on a given day, there are multiple realizations of
    the forecasts made in the past 72 hr at the interval of every 6 hr (J. Wang et
    al., 2022). Assuming equal weights for all the simulations, the average value
    for all the simulated minimum temperature, maximum temperature, relative humidity,
    and wind speed and the summation of the simulated precipitation and the radiation
    were calculated and used as the mean of the WRF forecast. A standard deviation
    of the WRF was calculated as the difference between the forecasted values (from
    WRF) and the observed values in 2018. The obtained standard deviations are 0.31
    mm, 0.54 mJ m−2, 0.23°, 0.14°, 0.12%, 0.37 m s−1 for the rain, minimum temperature,
    maximum temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. Then, 10 scenarios were
    sampled from Gaussian distribution for all the weather variables, except for rain
    where Gamma distribution was used. Daily soil water content and LAI observations
    were assessed at the field. The soil water content observations were collected
    directly from the study fields using three time-domain reflectometry probes and
    data loggers that were installed at three sampling zones at each of the testing
    fields. On each of the sampling locations, three probes were vertically installed
    at soil depths of 10 and 18 inches. The probes were installed at the location
    with the lightest soil type (and therefore the lowest water content in the field),
    so that the irrigation amounts at these locations would be sufficient for other
    locations. Data loggers were automated to constantly collect soil moisture data
    at a temporal resolution of 30 s, which are aggregated to a daily time period.
    The LAI observations were collected using a remote sensing product iLAI-2200C
    plant canopy analyzer (model LAI-2270, LICOR Bioscience, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA),
    which are updated every 2 weeks. Each field was divided to three sampling zones,
    and five samples were collected from each zone. The average of all samples is
    used as the final LAI measurement. Polynomials with a degree of six were fitted
    to the available LAI observations in three periods with an equal length to interpolate
    the daily observations. The three periods were chosen as corresponding periods
    of the time from emergence to the full canopy, full canopy to the beginning of
    leaf senescence, and leaf senescence to maturity (about 40 days each). The observations
    of soil moisture and LAI are used in the DA to update the crop and soil state
    and parameters that are highly correlated to the observations. The state includes
    several variables such as LAI, soil moisture at the whole soil profile, and root
    depth. The soil parameters are the van Genuchten–Mualem model parameters, and
    the crop parameters are the maximum relative increase in LAI, lower threshold
    temperature for the aging of leaves, light use efficiency for real leaf, and efficiency
    of conversion into leaves. According to the reports of California Soil Resource
    Lab at UC Davis and UC-ANR (Walkinshaw et al., 2021), the soils of the test fields
    are sandy-loam to loamy-sand soils of seven layers, with less than 6% slopes with
    any of the soil layers. The soil hydraulic parameters in the SWAP model were initialized
    according to the soil reports, and the soil slopes were assumed as 0%. The crop
    parameters were used as the default parameter set provided in the SWAP model.
    The planting date is 25 April 2019. The fields are irrigated with sprinklers.
    The average water price is 40 USD/in-acre and the crop price is 3 USD/Bushel.
    Using these test fields, the tool performance was assessed. A workshop for the
    model experiments was organized by the Agriculture Extension of the University
    of Nebraska at Lincoln to test the interactions with farmers. Ten farmers from
    Nebraska attended the workshop (Table A1). A survey was conducted during the workshop
    to seek feedback from farmer participants (Table B1). 4 Results This section first
    discusses the RTIST performance by comparing the optimized irrigation schedule
    (without human intervention) to the actual applications, with detailed result
    analysis on the influence of the DA on soil moisture and LAI. Following that,
    the results from the RTIST experiment workshop are presented and the influence
    of human-machine interactions are discussed. 4.1 Tool Performance 4.1.1 Data Assimilation
    Here the effectiveness of DA is shown by comparing the estimations of LAI and
    soil moisture with and without using DA. In this test, the actual field irrigation
    schedule and the actual observations were used. The irrigation schedules together
    with the precipitation amounts are presented in Figure C1 in Appendix C. The error
    difference is used as a comparison indicator, which constitutes of the difference
    between the error with and without using DA under each of the two cases. For LAI,
    the error difference is calculated according to the difference between the absolute
    error of estimation of LAI (the absolute difference between the estimated LAI
    and the measured LAI) with DA and without DA; for soil moisture, the error difference
    is calculated as the absolute difference between the average (over the number
    of observations) error of the estimation of soil moisture (the absolute difference
    between the estimated soil moisture and the measured soil moisture) with DA and
    without DA. The results of the current state estimations are presented in Figure
    4. Values below 0 indicate a lower error with the tool with DA than the case without.
    The results are shown only after the LAI assimilation has begun (i.e., after the
    crop emergence), as leaves do not exist in the early days and the assimilation
    process did not commence. The improvement of the estimations of both LAI and soil
    moisture over time is clearly shown. At most of the time steps, both LAI and soil
    moisture are better estimated with DA. The results of soil moisture are similar
    on both fields, while better LAI estimations were observed on Field A using DA.
    This is due to the lower LAI in early periods (days 50–60) in Field A and the
    lower errors of DA, which led to a better convergence of DA with more accurate
    estimations in comparison to Field B (see Figure D1 in Appendix D). However, the
    convergence of LAI is more consistent than soil moisture due to two reasons. First,
    the negligible LAI correlation with other measured state variables. For example,
    a slight modification of LAI within the assimilation process can lead to a direct
    change of the estimated LAI which can easily match the estimated LAI with the
    measured LAI. On the other hand, the state of measured soil moisture at one depth
    has a high correlation with the state of measured soil moisture at other depths.
    Due to this correlation, the correction of the soil moisture at one depth using
    DA is accompanied with changing the value of correlated soil moisture at other
    depths. Therefore, an improvement in the estimation of the state of soil moisture
    at one depth might be accompanied by a degradation at other depths which may result
    in no improvement in the whole soil moisture estimation (see Figure D2 in Appendix
    D). Hence, in general, estimating soil moisture on the whole soil profile can
    be more challenging than LAI. Second, soil moisture improvement is highly dependent
    on the changing dynamics with the changing irrigation amounts and precipitation.
    For example, when low irrigation amount and precipitation occur (as the case in
    days 90–110), new (low, in comparison to past periods) dynamics exist and no information
    is available for improving the estimations. A sufficiently long period for DA
    is required to improve the accuracy of the simulation model and converge to satisfactory
    estimations. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The error difference for
    (a) soil moisture and (b) leaf area index estimated at the current time step.
    Since the SWAP model is used for predictions within RTIST, it is important to
    examine the accuracy of the predictions provided by the simulation model. The
    prediction capability of both soil moisture and LAI state in a future period (i.e.,
    3 days ahead, as used in this study) using the DA enhanced SWAP modeling is examined,
    where the daily average error difference is also used. Overall, using DA, the
    estimations in most of the growing period are superior to the method with no assimilation
    in both fields (as shown in Figure 5, all error differences are below 1.0). The
    results of the predictions follow the results of the current state estimations
    as shown in Figure 4 to some extent. For LAI, the current estimation was better
    than the prediction at the beginning, as the direct influence of the modification
    of the current LAI using crossover and mutation can be higher than the influence
    of modifying the crop parameters on LAI during the assimilation process. This
    direct LAI modification, as the driver of the improvement in LAI, might hinder
    the parameter estimations. This can be alleviated by lowering the amplitude of
    the crossover and mutation parameters applied to LAI (Jamal & Linker, 2020). The
    values of soil moisture at different depths and the LAI are presented in Figures
    D3 and D4 in Appendix D. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The error difference
    for (a) soil moisture and (b) leaf area index, predicted for the future time periods.
    4.1.2 Optimization The RTIST was tested on two fields (namely field A and field
    B) in east Nebraska and the optimized irrigation schedules from the simulation-optimization
    model are compared to the actual schedules which were applied by farmers in the
    real fields, as shown in Figure 6 together with the rain during the crop growing
    season. In both fields, the optimized and the actual schedules both have irrigation
    applications mainly in the second part of the growing season, as the evapotranspiration
    increases. However, the optimized applications occur over a relatively narrow
    range with especially low rainfall. This emphasizes the importance of exploiting
    the rainfall possibilities from some incoming days using weather forecasts. This
    also indicates that in the real world, farmers'' decisions might not be well informed
    by weather forecasts. In addition, the low amplitude of the optimized irrigation
    applications shows that an accurate timing might substitute for applying large
    irrigation amounts (Table 1). Increasing the crop yield while decreasing the water
    usage with the optimized schedule shows the possibility to improve the actual
    schedule. However, it is not realistic for farmers to fully accept the optimized
    schedule due to the impacts of farmers'' behaviors, policies, as well as incomplete
    knowledge and limited knowledge delivery to farmers (Rose et al., 2018). Figure

    3.4 373 983 It should be noted that a 3-day probability-based weather forecast
    is used for the current simulation-optimization model. The stochastic optimization
    approach is compared with a deterministic approach, in which a single-scenario
    weather forecast, rather than multiple probabilistic WRF forecasts, is used. No
    improvement is observed between the two approaches, owing to the low uncertainty
    of the forecasts with a short period of 3 days. The importance of the stochastic
    approach is manifested by longer forecast periods and higher uncertain conditions
    (Cai et al., 2011; Hejazi et al., 2014). A future work may include forecasts that
    have heading time of up to 2 weeks, as suggested by Cai et al. (2011) and Hejazi
    et al. (2014). 4.2 Human-Machine Interaction Multiple runs of RTIST and the GUI
    were conducted with invited farmers via a VIE that took place at the University
    of Nebraska-Lincoln with farmers from different sites in Nebraska. In this workshop
    the farmers interacted with the tool through the GUI by running a test field case
    study from the site in east Nebraska (the same site as Field A and Field B, but
    a different field). The experimental results, discussions between modelers and
    farmers during the human-machine interactions, and the survey at the end of the
    experiments show the interest, involvement, learning, and feedback for the tool
    improvement from the farmer participants. Each of the VIE took about 1 hr. 4.2.1
    Farmers Intervention The test field was run in the workshop with two groups of
    farmers, with each group including 4 farmers. Here the final irrigation schedules
    from two groups (named Group 1 and Group 2) are compared to the schedule without
    any intervention (i.e., assuming farmers accept all model recommendations), and
    shown in Figure 7. Furthermore, the irrigation schedule that was applied in the
    real field is presented. Group 1''s choices were closer to the model recommendations
    than Group 2, but both groups modified the recommendations. Both groups chose
    to irrigate toward the end of the growing season. Group 2 started to irrigate
    earlier than the model and Group 2. In addition, both groups decided to irrigate
    in the first week, which differs from the model recommendation of no-irrigation.
    This is because both groups of farmers have experience of combined fertilizer
    and water application during the seed stage. Based on this result, RTIST was modified
    to add a choice of applying water and fertilizer in the seed stage (see more about
    the tool modification based on farmers'' feedback in Section 16). Figure 7 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Irrigation schedules based on the model recommendations
    (without interactions), human-machine interactions with two groups of farmers,
    and field records. The total irrigation amounts, crop dry matters, and profits,
    together with the average no-irrigation period lengths, total no-irrigation days
    and the number of rejections are presented in Table 2. Overall, the results of
    the modeled schedule (without interaction) and of the human-machine interactions
    with Group 1 and Group 2 is better than that of the actual field practices, in
    terms of saving water, increasing dry matter, and increasing profits. However,
    Group 1 tended to be more conservative and used less water than the model, while
    Group 2 used more water. When the human-machine interaction is finished for a
    particular day, farmers are asked to tell how many days they will wait for considering
    the next irrigation application. It is found that both groups chose periods of
    less than a week (6.4 days for Group 1 and 4.1 days for Group 2), with a close
    total no-irrigation days in the entire season (76 days for Group 1 and 86 days
    for Group 2). Both groups showed high agreement with the tool (less than 10% rejections);
    yet one group rejected three times more than the other group. However, similar
    dry matter was obtained from all the cases; the highest profit was achieved for
    Group 1 due to less water application and cost than the model and Group 2. The
    difference in the choices of the two groups indicates the complexity of anticipating
    farmer behavior, which emphasizes the necessity of involving farmers in the decision-making
    process. Table 2. Seasonal Irrigation Amount, Dry Matter, and Profit Resulting

    (i.e., the human-machine interactions), farmers and modelers discussed the experiments.
    In general, the participating farmers thought the tool was informative, encouraging,
    exciting, and conceptually great. They expressed the willingness to use the tool,
    after it is finalized, as a decision assistance tool, especially in the form of
    as mobile phone app. They also provided very helpful suggestions based on their
    experiences and expectation to refine the tool shown in the VIEs. Some suggestions
    are highlighted below to show the diverse requirements from irrigation farmers.
    Some farmers said they were challenged by the water use permit and the timing
    of applications, which often enforces constraints on their irrigation scheduling.
    Water cost is also a concern for some farmers since it varies with the energy
    market. The tool in the experiment assumed farmers made a decision for the current
    day but some farmers sometimes also like to make a decision in a number of consecutive
    days (e.g., 5 days). A specific discussion between the farmers and modelers is
    about the late irrigation applications appearing in the model recommended schedule
    (Figure 7). The model determines an irrigation application on a particular day
    according to the current soil moisture, crop growth status, and the weather forecast.
    In particular, the threshold soil moisture plays a critical role. In the real
    world, this threshold varies by farmers. Some farmers in the workshop said they
    tried to keep the soil close to saturated status all time, however, this wastes
    water and may not be necessary for crop growth either. For both modelers and farmers,
    adjusting the threshold soil moisture is a trial-and-error learning process that
    will be supported by real-world practices. In addition, some farmers may only
    consider the current soil and crop status and not the weather forecast, and they
    may irrigate right before a rainfall event. Thus, farmers may build their trust
    to the weather forecast via the human-machine interactions over a number of consecutive
    seasons. At the end of a dry run, some farmers told the modelers that they might
    do it differently regarding the model recommendations if they took the experiment
    again; farmers from different groups exchanged their choices and thoughts during
    the VIEs. In future real-world use of the established tool, farmers are expected
    to learn from the interactions season by season so that their decisions can be
    more informed, especially whether to accept the model recommended application
    at a particular time; if they decide to apply amount of water different from the
    model recommended, how different it should be, etc. The survey conducted at the
    end of the VIE workshop provides some feedback from farmer participants, as presented
    in Table B2 in Appendix B. Most of the farmers grow corn and other crops, with
    a wide range of farm scales, which makes the farmers good representatives of the
    (especially corn) farmers in Nebraska. Most of the farmers rely basically on current
    weather conditions. This highlights the importance of the current information
    in the field (D. Wang & Cai, 2009). In particular, one farmer mentioned that his
    decision was based on soil moisture probes (PREC University of Nebraska - Lincoln).
    However, most farmers still showed interest in using forecasts. They suggested
    showing them the actual weather in the past 3 days to 1 week so that they could
    have a sense of how reliable the forecasts were and to what extent they should
    trust the forecast (Shafiee-Jood et al., 2021); they also wondered about the effectiveness
    of relatively long weather forecast up to one to 2 weeks (Hejazi et al., 2014).
    In general, the debriefing results indicate the readiness of farmers to accept
    scientifically-based tools in irrigation scheduling and their excitement to get
    involved in human-machine interactions to obtain support in their decisions. In
    particular, RTIST was demonstrated for corn/maize only during the workshop, and
    the participants expected to see the tool for other major crops. Meanwhile for
    the RTIST modelers, farmers'' feedback led to a more realistic and more effective
    tool, as discussed in the following. 4.2.3 Tool Modifications Based on Farmers''
    Feedback Some comments from the VIEs are related to the threshold soil moisture,
    which the model uses to decide an irrigation application, variable water cost,
    maximum applicable water in an application, seasonal and monthly water use permit,
    relevance of soil moisture to crop stress, and joint fertilization and water applications.
    These comments are constructive for technical improvement and led to modification
    of RTIST right after the workshop, as summarized in Table B2, Appendix B. Some
    comments are related to the provided information, as the farmers showed interest
    in more information from the model such as water stress, weather forecast reliability,
    crop growth stages, seasonal results, and excessive water events. Part of the
    required information is not easily measured (e.g., water stress and growth stage)
    and can be estimated by the simulation model. Even so, the farmers still thought
    the information was valuable after the VIE workshop. This highlights the importance
    of the human-machine interaction in terms of the learning for both the modelers
    and the participating farmers. RTIST is under further refinement and modification.
    As some farmers in the VIEs expected, the final goal is to deliver a smart phone
    app based on RTIST that is accessible for farmers during the irrigation season.
    5 Conclusions In this study, a simulation model, a DA technique, and a human-computer
    interaction method are integrated into an optimization framework to support real-time
    irrigation scheduling regarding optimality, accuracy, and applicability of the
    RTIST. The principle of the RTIST is to engage farmers directly into computer
    modeling and support farmers'' irrigation scheduling decisions jointly based on
    model provided information and their own justification. This is different from
    many existing studies that try to mimic farmer''s behaviors and decision processes,
    which is however not realistic for real world applications. RTIST does not propose
    an “automatic” tool to replace irrigation farmers to conduct irrigation scheduling
    decisions, but to provide model-based information to support farmers to make the
    decisions themselves. Meanwhile, in the human-computer interaction framework,
    farmers'' feedback improves the computer model of crop growth with real world
    irrigation applications. This integration can help track optimal crop profits
    based on probabilistic weather forecasts while involving field observations to
    assure reliable environment and crop simulations in the optimization process.
    In particular, it is shown that human-computer interaction is important for facilitating
    the practical application of the tool through farmer''s engagements. The tool
    was tested on maize fields in east Nebraska via VIEs with real world farmers.
    The accuracy of present estimation and future prediction of soil moisture and
    LAI is improved by field observation and DA, and the optimization and assimilation
    procedures are validated with increased crop yield, profit, and water saving.
    The human-computer interaction of the tool was tested on one field via a workshop
    with invited farmers. High interest in applying the tool was shown by the farmers,
    to a large extent due to the informativity of the tool, for example, about the
    status of crop and field environment. The VIEs show that RTIST with farmers''
    direct engagement results in increased crop yield, profit, and water saving in
    comparison to traditional practices. In addition, farmers'' feedback from the
    debriefing stage of the VIEs provides meaningful suggestions to improve the tool
    (especially the GUIs) for real-world application. The VIEs highlight the necessity
    for the direct intervention of the farmers in the irrigation scheduling modeling
    process. The proposed decision support tool can be affected by non-accurate information
    due to possible systematic errors with both the model structure and parameterization.
    However, several features of the proposed framework could help alleviate this
    issue. First, a reliable and widely used simulation model (i.e., SWAP) was used
    to simulate soil moisture and crop growth in a real crop field, enhanced by assimilating
    field observations to reduce modeling errors. Furthermore, the interactions with
    farmers enable the link between the computer model and the real field condition,
    which ultimately reflects farmers'' actual decisions based on both model recommendation
    and farmers'' experience and justification. Future work should include using more
    data to validate the crop model simulation (e.g., dry matter) and conduct more
    interactive experiments with farmers for various crops at various sites. Acknowledgments

    Keywords PrecipitationEvapotranspirationWater resourcesSAFERSEALBA 1. Introduction
    Observations and modellings have been demonstrated evidence of changes in the
    climatic systems worldwide, which are connected to human activities (IPCC et al.,
    2023). In addition to these climate changes, the expansion of agriculture over
    the natural ecosystems has caused large alterations in the river flows and ground
    tables, what can, with bad agricultural managements, contribute to environmental
    degradation, affecting the water fluxes between the surfaces and the low atmosphere
    and water qualities (Akhtar et al., 2021; Oliveira-Júnior et al., 2022; Silva
    et al., 2023). Considering these scenarios, the use of remote sensing with satellite
    images together with meteorological data is highlighted for monitoring these impacts
    when aiming a sustainable development (Teixeira et al., 2020; 2021; Jardim et
    al., 2022). Climate, land use, and land cover (LULC) changes has affected the
    water balance in several hydrological basins bringing importance of accounting
    the component of this balance for rational water resources managements (Yang et
    al., 2016; Zhang and Zhang, 2019). The Brazilian biomes Atlantic Forest (AF) and
    Caatinga (CT) inside the agricultural growing region in the coast of Northeast
    Brazil (NEB), limited by the states of Sergipe (SE), Alagoas (AL), and Bahia (BA),
    called SEALBA, for example, are suffering several impacts upon these resources,
    as consequence of deforestations, burnings, water pollution, and intensive agriculture,
    demanding large-scale water balance studies to support the sustainable consumptions
    of the water resources (Leivas et al., 2017; Araujo et al., 2019; Santos et al.,
    2020; Teixeira et al., 2021; Jardim et al., 2022; Oliveira-Júnior et al., 2022;
    Silva et al., 2023). Local measurements of the water balance components are not
    suitable for large-scale analyses, due to variations on the environmental conditions,
    mainly under climate and land use changes scenarios. Because of these limitations,
    remote sensing from satellites together with geographic information systems have
    been used for these analyses through algorithm applications in distinct agroecosystems
    (Kamble et al., 2013; Wagle et al., 2017; Nyolei et al., 2019; Santos et al.,
    2020; Teixeira et al., 2021; Silva et al., 2023). These algorithms are very useful
    for quantifying the impacts from human activities upon natural resources (Sandre
    Osorio and Murilo, 2008), due to the efficiencies for quantification of water
    and vegetation parameters at different spatial and temporal resolutions (Asokan
    et al., 2020). The variables which affect the soil moisture levels in the root-zones
    are precipitation, irrigation, surface runoff, deep percolation, capillarity rise,
    evapotranspiration, and the change in soil water storage (Raes et al., 2009).
    Although evapotranspiration is related to crop production, increases on its rates
    mean lower water availability for ecological and human consumptions. Crop production
    under the environmental conditions of SEALBA has gained room in economy over the
    last years. In the portion much closer to the coastline, predominate the AF biome
    and more to the west side is the CT biome. In both biomes, climate and land use
    changes are occurring. The AF has humid tropical climate, but its microclimates
    are contrasting mixtures of natural vegetation and anthropized areas (Ribeiro
    et al., 2009) while the species from Caatinga suffer of more drought periods along
    the year, developing resilience with the aridity increases (Jardim et al., 2022).
    Despite their suitability of the climate for agriculture, the fast replacement
    of the natural ecosystems, coupled with climate changes, have been contributing
    to the environmental instabilities, worsening the water resources competitions
    among distinct water users (Teixeira et al., 2020). The delimitation of the agricultural
    potential for SEALBA was based on the average precipitation range from 450 to
    1400 mm, from April to September. According to Procópio et al. (2019), this precipitation
    range could supply water for several grain crops (corn, bean, sorghum, rice etc.),
    with potential for rational expansion of other crops. However, to know the real
    water availabilities for agriculture, besides precipitation as input of water,
    the output, represented by evapotranspiration, must be also accounted (Filho et
    al., 2021). Some local water balance studies were carried out throughout local
    measurements in the biomes Atlantic Forest (Pereira et al., 2010; Rodrigues et
    al., 2021) and Caatinga (Silva et al., 2017; Marques et al., 2020), but few efforts
    have been done with the use of remote sensing for comparisons of the water balance
    components between these biomes inside the SEALBA region. In addition, local measurements
    are not suitable for comparisons of water parameters in this region, due to large
    variations of the environmental conditions making it difficult the implementation
    of a monitoring system using of long-term series of data (Silva et al., 2023).
    To support the rational expansion of crops in areas with agricultural aptitude,
    as in the case of SEALBA, one can apply methods with the joint use of remote sensing
    and weather data though algorithms. Because its operationality, the Penman-Monteith
    (PM) equations has been inserted inside these algorithms for quantification of
    the water balance components in distinct ecosystems (Cleugh et al., 2007; Nagler
    et al., 2013; Consoli and Vanella, 2014; Consoli et al., 2016; Olivera-Guerra
    et al., 2018). When applied together with gridded weather data, the Penman-Monteith
    equation is suitable for using with low spatial resolution satellite images (Mateos
    et al., 2013; Vanella et al., 2019). Considering these aspects, the SAFER (Simple
    Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm was developed for estimations
    of the water balance components, with simultaneous field and remote sensing measurements
    in NEB (Teixeira, 2010). The reason for the SAFER''s choice in the current research
    is that besides its applicability, other important advantage, regarding other
    approaches, is that in its newer version there is no need of the satellite thermal
    bands, being possible to be used only the visible and the near infrared bands,
    more easily available than the thermal ones (Consoli and Vanella, 2014). In addition,
    the thermal bands of the MODIS Terra (EOS AM-1) sensor have a spatial resolution
    of 1 km, meaning that with their use, the images will cover more pixels with mixed
    surface types, when comparing with the red and near infrared bands with a 250
    m of spatial resolution. Aiming to implement an operational water balance monitoring
    system in agricultural growing regions, taking SEALBA as a reference, we tested
    the last version of the SAFER algorithm with the use of the reflectance MODIS
    MOD13Q1 product together with long term meteorological data in a period of 15
    years (2007–2021). The research, besides contributing by making available water
    information at the spatial and temporal resolutions of 250 m and 16 days, respectively,
    will subsidize knowledge of the average water balance conditions and the implementation,
    refinement and expansion of water resources monitoring systems in the region.
    The authors believe that the success of these applications in this specific region
    of NEB will encourage replications of the methods in other environmental conditions
    of the country and even in other regions of the world, with simple calibrations
    of the modelling equations. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area and meteorological
    stations The study area involves the agricultural growing region of the coastal
    region in NEB, limited by the states Sergipe (SE), Alagoas (AL), and Bahia (BA),
    called SEALBA, an acronym formed by the initials of these three Brazilian states.
    Fig. 1 shows the location of SEALBA and its borders, biomes according the Geographic
    and Statistical Brazilian Institute (IBGE ˗ www.ibge.gov.br), and altitudes, together
    with the 17 meteorological stations used from the National Meteorological Institute
    (INMET ˗ https://www.gov.br/agricultura/pt-br/assuntos/inmet). The data gaps for
    some stations in their time series were overcome by covering them with regression
    equations using the nearest station where data are missed and by geostatistical
    interpolations applying the moving average method. Download : Download high-res

    region in Northeast Brazil (NEB) involving the states of Sergipe (SE), Alagoas
    (AL), and Sergipe (SE), with details for the biomes, altitudes, and meteorological
    stations used in the water balance modelling. Accounting up the MODIS pixels with
    spatial resolution of 250 m, 33% of SEALBA is in Sergipe – SE (2.0 Mha), 37% is
    in Alagoas – AL (2.3 Mha), and 30% is in Bahia – BA (1.9 Mha), totalizing 6.2
    Mha. The region involves the biomes AF and CT. Most areas in the AF, with 3.9
    Mha accounted, mostly below 275 m of altitude, occupies 63% of the SEALBA region,
    in a portion closer to the coastline. This biome is characterized by forest vegetation,
    prevailing the rain forest dense and open, the semi-decidual season forest, and
    ecosystems associated to the coastal lowland. The climate is humid tropical, occasioned
    by moist air masses coming from the Atlantic Ocean, with high both average air
    temperature and air humidity and well distributed rainfall along the year (Francisquini
    et al., 2020). The CT areas, with 2.3 Mha accounted, being the majority above
    275 m of altitude, represents 37% of the SEALBA region, presenting species composed
    by trees and bushes with characteristics that allow climate adaptations. The biome
    is under high air temperatures but low air humidity with irregular rainfall, associated
    to long drought periods along the year (Beuchle et al., 2015). Both biomes are
    suffering by fast replacement of their natural vegetation by crops as fruits,
    sugar cane, grains, forestry, and pasture (Beuchle et al., 2015; Procopio et al.,
    2019). The input meteorological data for the large-scale water balance modelling
    were incident global solar radiation (RG); air temperature (Ta), air relative
    humidity (RH), and wind speed (u); for the calculation of reference (ET0) and
    actual (ET) evapotranspiration. To account the water balance, precipitation (P)
    data were also used together with the modeled ET (Teixeira et al., 2020; 2021).
    With a geographic information system (GIS) these data were layered with the remote
    sensing parameters by using the geostatistical interpolation method of “moving
    average”, contributing to a better spatial characterization of the water balance
    components. 2.2. Characteristics of the MODIS images For large-scale modelling
    the water balance components in the SEALBA region, it was used the bands 1 and
    2 from the MODIS sensor (MOD13Q1 reflectance product) downloaded from the site
    of EARTHDATA Aρρ EEARS (https://lpdaacsvc.cr.usgs.gov/appeears/), together with
    the meteorological stations from INMET. Table 1 presents the characteristics of
    the MODIS bands 1 (B1) and 2 (B2) from the MOD13Q1 reflectance product with the
    respective spectral ranges, sweep length, and spatial/temporal resolutions. Table

    bands between 0.405 and 14,385 μm, which collects data at three spatial resolutions
    (250, 500 and 1000 m). The MODIS MOD13Q1 reflectance product, has spatial and
    temporal resolutions of 250 m and 16 days, respectively, giving 23 free-cloud
    images of along a year, which together with meteorological data, allowed to model
    the dynamics of water balance components with the newest version of the SAFER
    algorithm, without thermal bands. In the current paper, the 16-day reflectance
    values from the MODIS Terra (EOS AM-1) sensor were grouped and coupled with time
    up scaled gridded weather data for quarter and annual water balance analyses in
    the AF and CT biomes inside the SEALBA region. 2.3. Water balance modelling Fig.

    of the SAFER algorithm with the MODIS MOD13Q1 reflectance product and meteorological
    data, to assess the water balance components in the SEALBA region, ran from 2007
    to 2021. All the regression coefficients of the equations for the parameters decribed
    in Fig. 2 were determined by simultaneous satellite and field measurents in the
    NEB involving natural vegetation and irrigated crops under strongly contrasting
    thermohydrological conditions (Teixeira, 2010; Teixeira et al., 2008; 2013). After
    elaboration, the SAFER algorithm has been validated in several Brazilian agroecosystems
    of the NEB (Araujo et al., 2019; Leivas et al., 2017; Silva et al., 2019; Teixeira
    et al., 2020; 2021). Besides these validations, the main equation for evaporative
    fraction (ETf) values were satisfactorily checked with literature. Thus, one can
    expect enough accuracy for our objective of testing an operational monitoring
    system, with comparisons among the AF and CT biomes being replaced by crops, giving
    a first insight of the spatial and temporal dynamics for the water balance components,
    being not strictly necessary new expensive simultaneous field and satellite measurements
    in the SEALBA region. Following Fig. 2, the surface albedo (α0) pixel values were
    calculated as: (1) where ρ1 e ρ2 are respectively the MODIS reflectance from bands
    1 (red) and 2 (near infra-red); a, b, and c are regression coefficients. In NEB,
    the coefficients a, b, and c were 0.08, 0.41, and 0.14, involving irrigated crops
    and natural vegetation under contrasting hydrological conditions, which can be
    calibrated for specific environments if more accuracy for α0 is desirable (Teixeira
    et al., 2008; 2013). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used
    as a surface cover and root-zone moisture conditions remote-sensing parameter:
    (2) Net radiation (Rn) was estimated through the Slob equation (de Bruin 1987):
    (3) where τsw is the short-wave atmospheric transmissivity and aL is a regression
    coefficient up scaled throughout the mean air temperature (Ta) pixel values. (4)
    and the regression coefficients aT and bT for NEB were found to be 6.8 and −40,
    respectively, but they can be adjusted for specific environmental conditions with
    field radiation balance measurements (Teixeira et al., 2008; Teixeira, 2010).
    The atmospheric emissivity (ϵA) was calculated according to Teixeira et al. (2020,
    2021): (5) where aA and bA are regression coefficients, which are reported as
    0.94 and 0.11, respectively, for NEB, but they can be calibrated with field radiation
    balance measurements for specific environmental conditions (Teixeira et al., 2008,
    2013). The surface emissivity (ϵ0) was estimated according to Rampazo et al. (2020)
    and Silva et al. (2019): (6) where a0 and b0 are regression coefficients, which
    were reported as 0.06 and 1.00 for NEB, but they can be acquired for specific
    environmental conditions by simultaneous field radiation balance and NDVI remote
    sensing measurements (Teixeira et al., 2008; Teixeira, 2010). By the residual
    method, following the physical principle of the Stefan-Boltzmann’ low, T0 was
    estimated as: (7) where σ = 5.67 10−8 W m−2 K−4 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
    To estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ET), its ratio to the reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0), i.e., the evapotranspiration fraction at the satellite overpass time (
    ), was modeled: (8) where the regression coefficients asf and bsf found for NEB
    were 1.90 and −0.008 (Teixeira et al., 2008; Teixeira, 2010), being possible to
    be calibrated through field measurements of ET and ET0 and the remote sensing
    parameters α0, NDVI e T0 in contrasting hydrological surfaces (Safre et al., 2022;
    Venâncio et al., 2021). Eq. (8) does not work for water bodies or mixture of land
    and water (NDVI <0), thus, the concept of equilibrium evapotranspiration - ETeq
    (Raupasch, 2001) is used in the SAFER algorithm under these circumstances: (9)
    where Δ is the inclination of the curve relating the saturation vapor pressure
    (es) and Ta, γ is the psychrometric constant, and G is the ground heat fluxes
    estimated according: (10) being aG and bG regression coefficients, found to be
    3.98 and −25.47, respectively, for the NEB, but can be calibrated with simultaneous
    field energy balance measurements for other environmental conditions (Teixeira
    et al., 2008, 2013). Considering that the satellite overpass values of the evapotranspiration
    fraction does not differ so much from the daily ones (Allen et al., 2007), throughout
    conditional functions applied to the NDVI values, the daily ET pixel values were
    estimated as: (11) being ET0 calculated by using the gridded daily weather data
    on incident global solar radiation (RG), mean air temperature (Ta), relative humidity
    (RH), and wind speed (u) (Allen et al., 1998). After retrieving ET on large scale,
    including water bodies, the daily values of was acquired: (12) Similarly, to what
    was done in Australia (Cleugh et al., 2007) and in Southeast Brazil (Teixeira
    et al., 2017), the water balance (WB) was computed as: (13) where P is the gridded
    precipitation values from the net of weather stations. To relate the water parameters,
    precipitation (P), actual evapotranspiration (ET), water balance (WB), and evaporative
    fraction (ETf) in the Atlantic Forest (AF) and Caatinga (CT), the Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) was used. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Spatial and temporal

    biomes Atlantic Forest (AF) and Caatinga (CT), in terms of Day of the Year (DOY).
    In general, for both biomes, AF and CT, inside the SEALBA region, the rainfall
    distributions along the year are spatially and temporally irregular, however lower
    P values are for CT when compared with those for AF, mainly from April to July
    (DOY 097–192), when the 16-day average difference between these biomes was above
    12 mm. During this period occur the P maximums, with 16-day average total above
    60 mm in AF and higher than 50 mm in CT. The lowest P values, with 16-day average
    total bellow 15 mm in both biomes, are in December (DOY 321–336). Regarding the
    annual scale, the mean total in CT, with 772 mm yr−1, is 83% of that for AF (927
    mm yr−1). According to the standard deviations (SD) along the year, it is noticed
    higher spatial variations for AF than for CT, with SD representing 17 and 14%
    of the average pixel values, respectively. According to Filho et al. (2019) anthropogenic
    processes and natural variability interfere with the forms of rain interception
    in these biomes inside NEB and hence in their rainfall patterns. Accounting the
    MODIS pixels of 250 × 250 m in the AF and CT biomes inside the states of Sergipe
    (SE), Alagoas (AL) and Bahia (BA) limited by the SEALBA region (see Fig. 1), the
    areas with AF account for 62, 78, and 46% of these states, respectively. Regarding
    the CT biome, the corresponding percentages are 38, 22, 54%. Larger areas with
    AF biome than for the CT one inside the SEALBA region promote higher P rates in
    the Alagoas, followed by Sergipe and Bahia. From water balance measurements in
    the AF biome during 2008, Pereira et al. (2010), reported an annual P value of
    1313 mm yr−1. According to Silva et al. (2023) AF in the coastal zone of NEB,
    with the availability of moisture from the Atlantic, presents a total annual rainfall
    ranging from 1000 to 2400 mm yr−1. These values are a little higher than our annual
    average total of 997 mm yr−1. Silva et al. (2017) found a P annual value in the
    CT biome of 430 mm yr−1 from 2014 to 2015, lower than our long-term value of 772
    mm yr−1. However, also in the CT biome, Oliveira et al. (2022) reported an average
    annual P value of 783 mm yr−1, very close to our annual value for this biome.
    As P values of the current study for AF and CT biomes are averages over 15 years,
    it is observed that the rainfall amounts for specific years should vary to above
    or below regarding their long-term values. Analyzing the dynamics of rainfall
    at 16-day periods along the year, both the AF and CT biomes inside the SEALBA
    region present two defined seasons, one drier and the other rainier, with the
    highest amounts concentrated in the middle of the year. 3.2. Spatial and temporal
    dynamics of actual evapotranspiration Fig. 4 shows the spatial distributions of
    the mean daily rates of actual evapotranspiration (ET) for some of the MODIS 16-day
    periods along the year in the SEALBA region, together with the average pixel values

    2007 to 2021 for the biomes Atlantic Forest (AF) and Caatinga (CT), in terms of
    day of the year (DOY). As for P, large spatial and temporal variations on ET values
    are observed along the year inside the SEALBA region. The highest values happen
    between July and September (DOY 193–256), when the 16-day average surpass 2.70
    mm d−1 for the AF biome and 2.90 mm d−1 in the CT biome. The lowest ET rates occur
    from January to February, when the 16-day averages in AF are lower than 1.50 mm
    d−1 and bellow 1.00 mm d−1 in CT. At the annual scale the mean totals are 760
    and 601 mm yr−1 for respectively AF and CT, with the rates in CT being 79% of
    those for AF. Trough the soil water balance method in the AF biome, at the annual
    scale, Pereira et al. (2010) reported a daily average ET of 3.20 mm d−1, a little
    higher than our one of 2.08 ± 0.59 mm d−1 for this biome. However, with the same
    water balance techniques between 2013 and 2018 in AF, Rodrigues et al. (2021)
    found ET average values ranging from 1.40 a 1.80 mm d−1 under drought conditions,
    like our values under the driest periods at the beginning and at the end of the
    year. From energy balance measurements from 2014 to 2015, using the eddy covariance
    method in the CT biome, Silva et al. (2017) found daily ET average values ranging
    from 0.98 mm d−1 during the dry season to 1.96 mm d−1 in the rainy season. Also,
    with eddy covariance measurements in CT from 2014 to 2015, Marques et al. (2020)
    reported daily average ET rates from 0.20 to 0.30 mm d−1, during the dry season
    till the range from 1.70 to 2.60 mm d−1 in the rainy season. These rates involve
    our ones considering the average pixel values and standard deviations, with an
    annual average value of 1.65 ± 0.54 mm d−1. The rainfall amounts are the main
    evapotranspiration driving forcing in both biomes inside the SEALBA region, explaining
    the different ET rates between the AF and CT biomes. However, one must consider
    that other important reason for these differences can be related to differences
    on the soil cover by vegetation, affecting the absorbed solar radiation and the
    ET partition into transpiration and soil evaporation (Villalobos et al., 2013).
    On the other hand, Filho et al. (2021), pointed out that air temperature, air
    humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation influence the ET rates in NEB. In general,
    the ET ranges for the AF and CT biomes inside the SEALBA region found in the current
    study, are reasonably comparable to those from literature, even under different
    rainfall conditions for specific periods. 3.3. Large-scale water balance For the
    water balance – WB (Eq. (13)), the daily average ET values were up scaled to 16-day
    average totals. Fig. 5 presents the average WB pixel values together with the
    standard deviations (SD) at this temporal scale along the year, for the AF and
    CT biomes, inside the SEABA region, from 2007 to 2021, in terms of day of the
    year (DOY). Download : Download high-res image (266KB) Download : Download full-size

    (CT) inside the SEALBA region, from 2007 to 2021, in terms of day of the year
    (DOY). For the AF biome, the highest 16-day positive WB of 61 mm, occur under
    the largest P of 92 mm at a corresponding ET of 31 mm in May (DOY 129–144). The
    most negative WB, with a 16-day value of −21 mm happen in September (DOY 257–272),
    with P of 21 mm under a high ET of 42 mm. At the annual scale, in the AF biome
    WB was 164 mm. The periods with maximum and minimum WB for CT are also respectively
    in May (DOY 129–144), with WB of 55 mm at P of 80 mm and ET of 25 mm, and September
    (DOY 257–272), when WB is −16 mm at P of 18 mm and ET of 34 mm. The largest positive16-day
    value in CT was 55 mm, under conditions of high P of 80 mm and low ET of 25 mm,
    while the most negative one was −16 mm under P of 18 mm at a high ET of 34 mm.
    At the annual scale, CT with WB of 168 mm, has a slightly higher rainfall water
    availability than that for AF, with a difference of 2%, because even the AF having
    higher rainfall amounts, its higher water fluxes reduce WB when comparing with
    the CT biome. One must also to consider that the CT covering more dry conditions
    is much larger than the areas inside the SEALBA region which involve transitions
    between this biome and AF. High rainfall amounts together with low water vapor
    transfer concentrates the positive WB from March to August (DOY 081–224) for both
    biomes, AF and CT, inside the SEALBA region, what is favorable for the rainfed
    agriculture. However, from the end of July to the second half of December (DOY
    209–265) occur the negative WB values, indicating the need of irrigation for critical
    crop stages. The respective lowest and highest ET rates, are explained by the
    lowest and highest rainfall amounts, respectively, but when the root-zone moisture
    is not a limiting factor, as in the middle of the year, when there is high rainfall
    water availability, the largest ET rates for CT in some occasions can be due to
    higher available energy when comparing with AF (Seneviratne et al., 2010), since
    none of these biomes are under rainfall water scarcity during this period inside
    the SEALBA region. To infer the root-zone moisture conditions in the water balance
    along the year, Fig. 6 shows the daily average values of the evaporative fraction
    ( ) at the MODIS 16-day interval along the year, together with the standard deviations
    (SD) for the biomes AF and CT, inside the SEALBA region, from 2007 to 2021, in

    day of the year (DOY). The highest values for the AF biome, above 0.50. Happen
    from the April to October (DOY 113–288), while for the CT these high values occur
    from May to September (DOY 129–272). Although at the annual scale the average
    value for AF is 21% larger than that for CT (  = 0.44), comparing the maximums
    between these biomes during the rainy season from July to August (DOY 209–224),
    it is observed an value of 0.93 for CT while in the AF biome it is 0.85, a difference
    of 9%. The lowest values for AF, bellow 0.40, are from November to March (DOY
    001–080 and DOY 321–365), while for CT the minimums ones, lower than 0.30, are
    from October to April (DOY 001–096 and DOY 321–365). The lowest values happen
    are in the beginning of the year, in January (DOY 001–016), for both biomes, however
    the average for AF of 0.30 is 76% higher than those for CT, which presents a mean
    value of 0.17 during this period. In well-irrigated crops, the values are called
    crop coefficients (Kc) and can be used for crop water requirements estimations
    (Teixeira et al., 2018). On the other hand, under condition of non-optimum root-zone
    moisture, it can characterize the degree of water stress (Lu et al., 2011). According
    to Mateos et al. (2013), the values in plants under water scarcity conditions
    are most influenced by the stomata aperture, what is the case of the CT species
    under the driest conditions. Thus, considering agricultural growing areas in the
    SEALBA region, the values found in the current study from April to September,
    indicate this period as the most favorable for rainfed crops, and in some cases,
    with better conditions for CT when compared to the AF biome. However, from October
    to April, the lower values in CT are directly related to drops on the root-zone
    water availability for plants, because of lower rainfall amounts associated to
    high atmosphere demand. In pastures from Florida (USA), Sumner and Jacobs (2005)
    reported values ranging from 0.47 to 0.92 under irrigation conditions, while in
    steppes under desertic conditions of Mongolia, China, Zhang et al. (2012) found
    a range from 0.16 to 0.75. These values are similar in several situations depicted
    in Fig. 6, for both AF and CT biomes. According to Zhou and Zhou (2009), the climate
    variables which most affect are air temperature, air humidity, and the available
    energy, as they affect both ET and ET0 (Filho et al., 2021). However, the values
    of this root-zone moisture indicator will also depend on the stomata aperture
    and adaptation of species to water scarcity (Mata-González et al., 2005), what
    is much visible for the CT than for AF biome inside the SEALBA region. Comparing
    the WB values (Fig. 5) with those for (Fig. 6), and considering both biomes, AF
    and CT, inside the SEALBA region, it is noticed that while the highest root-zone
    moisture conditions, with values (above 0.50) occur from the end of April to October
    (DOY 113–288). Regarding the water balance, the highest WB values (above 14 mm)
    are from March to August (DOY 081–240). Therefore, there is a delay till two months
    between the moment in which rainfall attend evapotranspiration with that in which
    the root-zone moisture recovers its optimum level after a dry period. 3.4. Statistical
    analyses Table 2 shows the results for the Pearson correlation coefficients, relating
    the values for precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), water balance (WB),
    and evaporative fraction (ETf) values in Atlantic Forest versus those for Caatinga.
    Also, it presents the correlation between P and ET, and BH and ETf for each biome.
    Table 2. Pearson correlation coefficients between precipitation (P), actual evapotranspiration
    (ET), water balance (WB), and evaporative fraction (ETf) in the Atlantic Forest
    (AF) and Caatinga (CT) biomes. Variables/Coefficient r 0.99 0.93 0.22 0.43 Variables/Coefficient
    r 0.94 0.99 0.41 0.09 Water variables: Precipitation (P), Actual Evapotranspiration
    (ET), Water Balance (WB), and Evaporative Fraction. Biomes: Atlantic Forest (AF)
    and Caatinga (CT). According to Table 2, all water parameters in Atlantic Forest
    (AF) had strong positive correlations with those in Caatinga (CT). However, when
    relating P with ET in both biomes with the correlations weak in AF and moderate
    in CT. The same behavior was for WB and ETf between biomes, being the correlations
    moderate when relating WB with ETf in AF and weak comparing these water parameters
    in CT. However, the relationships P with ET and WB with ETf n AF, and WB with
    ETf in CT were not statistically significant at p > 0.05. The reasons for the
    low correlations in Table 2 may be explained by a gap between P and ET values
    along the year, which could be related to the time needed for recovering good
    soil moisture after rainfalls, but also because of some rainfall water is lost
    by runoff and percolation. 4. Conclusions It was demonstrated that the SAFER algorithm
    is feasible to be applied with the MODIS MOD13Q1 reflectance product and gridded
    meteorological data to monitor water balance components in agricultural growing
    regions with different biomes and agricultural consortium, as in the case of SEALBA.
    Inferring the root-zone moisture conditions through the evaporative fraction,
    it noticed by its highest values, that the best moisture levels for plants are
    from April to September, being this period suitable for rainfed agriculture, with
    some cases happening better conditions in the driest Caatinga biome than those
    for the wettest Atlantic Forest biome. The lowest values of the evaporative fraction
    in the biome Caatinga, from October to April, are directly related to less availability
    of root-zone moisture when comparing with Atlantic Forest. According to Pearson
    correlation coefficient, all analyzed water parameters in Atlantic Forest (AF)
    had strong positive correlations with those in Caatinga (CT). However, when relating
    precipitation (P) with actual evapotranspiration in both biomes the correlations
    were weak in AF and moderate in CT. The same behavior was for water balance (WB)
    and evaporative fraction (ETf) between biomes, being the correlations moderate
    when relating their relation in AF and weak in CT. However, the relationships
    P with ET and WB with ETf n AF, and also WB with ETf in CT were not statistically
    significant at p > 0.05. The reasons for the low correlations in Table 2 may be
    explained by a gap between P and ET values along the year, which could be related
    to the time needed for recovering good soil moisture after rainfalls, but also
    because of some rainfall water is lost by runoff and percolation. Although we
    tested the models for a specific region in the coast of Northeast Brazil, the
    applicability of the joint use of the MODIS MOD13Q1 reflectance product with gridded
    weather data presents strong potential for implementation of an operational system
    to monitor the water balance components in any environmental conditions. Future
    research can focus on detecting of water balance anomalies for specific years
    comparing with long-term conditions, subsidizing public policies regarding the
    management and conservation of water resources, mainly under the actual scenarios
    of climate and land use changes. Limitations for applications of the methods in
    other environments could be lack of meteorological data on large-scales and the
    possible need of calibration of the equations which demand simultaneous field
    and satellite measurements. Funding This research did not receive any specific
    grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

    2022 1 Introduction Agriculture [1] is essential to the economy in many ways,
    including providing food, raw materials, and fibers and maintaining economic autonomy.
    Agriculture has significant challenges in irrigation, fertilization, and crop
    rotation. Farmers have been experimenting with their crops ever since the dawn
    of agriculture [2]. This practice dates back to the earliest days of human history.
    The search is on to find plants with desired characteristics, such as resistance
    to drought or pests. As a result of an increase in population, urban regions are
    experiencing an increasing amount of difficulty dealing with water scarcity. Agriculture
    already has several challenges, and environmental issues such as soil erosion
    and inappropriate irrigation only complicate the situation. The consequences of
    global warming on changes in temperature, weather, and precipitation patterns
    may also hurt agricultural productivity. IoT and machine learning are essential
    components of an agro-environment monitoring system. All crucial information about
    crop production forecasts, fertilizer management, smart irrigation, crop monitoring,
    crop disease diagnosis, and pest control is provided by IoT-employing sensors
    [3, 4]. Applications of Agriculture environment monitoring using IoT is shown
    in Fig. 1 below. Fig. 1 Applications of agriculture environment monitoring Full
    size image Many businesses today consider agriculture a significant part of their
    production activities. Businesses operating in the agriculture industry [5] often
    attempt to maximize the revenues generated by production. Over the last ten years,
    farmers have depended on soil characteristics to identify seasonal crops based
    on field variations. As a result of a lack of appropriate technology, this information
    could have been more successful in targeting and optimizing agricultural inputs,
    especially in farming on a big scale [6]. Since the industrial revolution, manufacturers
    have modelled their manufacturing processes after agricultural practices. When
    it comes to agricultural practices, the majority of companies are only concerned
    with one thing: maximizing their profits. Over the last ten years, farmers have
    depended on soil characteristics to identify seasonal crops based on field variations.
    On the other hand, given the absence of the appropriate instruments, it was impossible
    to put this knowledge to good use to locate and optimize agricultural inputs,
    particularly on a large scale [7]. Precision agriculture [8] contributes to the
    resolution of these issues by cutting down on the amount of water consumed during
    agricultural production and increasing crop yields through the ongoing monitoring
    of soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and pH. Because precision agriculture
    can prescribe the appropriate ratio of water to fertilizer to paste, it may be
    possible to link increased crop yields to this technique [9]. In many industrialized
    countries, precision farming relies heavily on the use of equipment that is connected
    to the Internet of Things (IoT). Smart farming is represented in Figs. 2 and 3
    [Source: https://www.renkeer.com/agricultural-environment-monitoring/]. Fig. 2
    IoT enabled smart farming Full size image Fig. 3 Agricultural environment monitoring
    system Full size image Machine learning [10] refers to the capability of gaining
    knowledge via experience. In order for the algorithms to learn from the input
    datasets, progressively train the samples, and increase their performance, the
    equations need to be modified. The use of ML approaches has been deemed preferable
    by industry professionals for the purpose of addressing nonlinear problems that
    are based on data from sensors or other sources. By modelling hypothetical outcomes
    on real ones, it provides individuals with the ability to make judgments with
    little input from other humans. Machine learning-based algorithms are increasingly
    being used in every sector of the economy. However, the accuracy is impacted by
    the data quality, which is described below. As a direct consequence of this, the
    techniques of machine learning substantially depend not only on the representations
    of datasets but also on target variables. A number of plant diseases, as well
    as the lack of a pesticide control mechanism that is both effective and efficient,
    have a substantial influence on crop yield. The Internet of Things enabled sensors
    to take a picture of diseased plants and provide a solution that was both appropriate
    and timely for the purpose of protecting the plant''s existence. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) and image preprocessing come together to provide plant pathologists
    with the assistance they need to make precise diagnoses of disease [11, 12]. The
    amount of fertilizer that is applied to a crop throughout the growing process
    has a significant bearing on the final product. When determining when and how
    to apply pesticides on their crops, growers of all types need to take into consideration
    the specific qualities of the plants they are cultivating. Despite the fact that
    they have a detrimental impact on plant nutrition, chemical fertilizers continue
    to play a key part in the development of a wide variety of illnesses that were
    not predicted [13]. The quality of the soil is believed to be of the utmost importance
    to farmers since it directly impacts the yield of their crops. As part of the
    process of precision agriculture, the detection and monitoring of soil moisture
    is done automatically. For the purpose of keeping track of the condition of the
    soil, some of the most cutting-edge examples of Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    agricultural monitoring equipment now available on the market are gamma-radiometric
    soil sensors, a soil moisture sensor, and an electrical conductivity sensor. In
    addition to recording the weather, the additional sensors that are used to monitor
    the environment also record the physiological state of the crops [14]. Multi linear
    regression along with feature selection is quite good in classification as far
    as accuracy and precision is concerned. The farmer has to determine as soon as
    possible the rough estimate of the quantity of water that will be required for
    cultivation. The amount of water that a region gets is influenced by a vast number
    of factors, some of which include the climate, the season, the kind of soil, the
    variety of crops grown, and the stage of development. When a crop is being cultivated,
    water can frequently be lost from it due to processes such as transpiration and
    evaporation. The implementation of innovative practices led to improvements in
    both the quantity and quality of the food that was made available. The practices
    that have been considered acceptable for years, decades, or even centuries. It
    is vital to focus on inputs like fertilizers, seeds, and other such things in
    order to increase agricultural yields. It is necessary to develop a new approach
    because there is a need to fill a hole that cannot be filled by using old techniques.
    Food insecurity has been related to a broad variety of unfavorable health effects,
    including infertility, human health problems, hastened ageing, improper insulin
    management, and more. The societal acceptance of such technology leads to the
    creation of bioorganic food products. Traditional agricultural practices have
    been refined over the course of decades of research, resulting in improvements
    that have almost little impact on output. In order to overcome these obstacles
    and make progress toward cultural and urban farming, it is now necessary to make
    use of cutting-edge methods that are based on sensing technology. This article
    presents IOT based smart fertilizer recommendation system for precision agriculture.
    This framework uses IoT devices and sensor to acquire agriculture related data,
    and then machine learning is applied to suggest fertilizer in correct quantity
    and at appropriate time. Data Acquisition phase collects input data including
    soil temperature, soil moisture, soil humidity, regions weather data, crop details.
    Features are selected using Sequential Forward Floating Selection algorithm. Data
    classification is performed by Multi linear Regression. Performance of SFSS-MLR
    is compared to Random Forest, C4.5, Naïve Bayes algorithm. Performance of SFSS
    MLR is better in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1. 2 Literature survey
    The nutrients that plants need in order to flourish may be found in the soil.
    If any of these minerals in the soil are missing, growth will be significantly
    hampered. Regular testing of the soil''s composition is essential in order to
    guarantee that plants are receiving the nutrients they need. If and when a nutrient
    deficiency is discovered in the soil, the problem may be corrected by applying
    a fertilizer that is high in the nutrient to the soil. Fertilizers have had a
    considerable positive influence on agricultural output, but their extensive usage
    has had a negative effect that has been destructive to the ecology. Because of
    this, soil nutrient testing is an important instrument in the field of agriculture.
    The conventional methods of soil testing, despite the fact that they provide accurate
    data, are not suitable for use in precision agriculture owing to the high costs
    involved and the protracted amount of time required for results to be obtained.
    Traditional testing is restricted in its ability to measure the geographic heterogeneity
    of a field since the expense increases with an increase in the number of samples
    that are tested. For this reason, it is essential to have access to methods that
    are not only fast and portable, but also economical and capable of producing results
    with a high degree of precision. A wide variety of sensors, such as those that
    measure moisture levels, plant vitality, soil texture, and so on, are used in
    the process of gathering information about crops and soil. One of the most prevalent
    applications of distant and proximal sensing technologies is the collection of
    high-density data that provides information about an area. In contrast, remote
    sensing technologies utilize sensors that are installed on aerial systems or spacecrafts
    to collect data from a field; proximal sensing technologies receive data from
    a field by situating sensors at close range or in direct contact with the surface
    of the field. The use of nonrenewable resources, such as soil, is essential to
    the maintenance of agricultural output. The soil is a highly dynamic and complex
    system that varies substantially in both space and time. These changes may be
    observed in a number of different ways. The condition of the soil is an essential
    component to the practice of sustainable agriculture. When soils have reached
    ecological balance, they are able to sustain plant and animal production, maintain
    and enhance the quality of air and water, and nurture the well-being of both plants
    and animals. The presence of soil is necessary for the development of plants,
    which are then used in the production of food for humans and animals, textiles,
    and fossil fuels. The quality of the soil may either deteriorate over time or
    improve as a result of a mix of natural and human-caused causes. Agriculture is
    a vital industry that requires careful management in conjunction with expanding
    people. The authors [15] state that the modern agricultural system is highly mechanized
    but still significantly depends on human labor. As an example, between the years
    1920 and 1970, a thirty percent investment generated a one hundred eighty percent
    return. In addition, the increase in productivity was not the result of an increase
    in the amount of data sources that were utilized; rather, it was the result of
    advancements in productive farming. Researchers have recently shown that elements
    such as sifting machines, mechanical innovation, and synthetic manures all have
    a role in determining agricultural profitability. Farmers have been more reliant
    on different types of technological communication and information storage over
    the course of the last decade. This has allowed them to better monitor their interactions
    with third parties and monitor their financial data. These days, having access
    to information is often seen as essential to normal life. As a result, the horticulture
    industry makes it easier for farmers to compile data and conduct statistical analyses
    based on field observations. Accurate information may be effectively disseminated
    via the use of a wide variety of sensors, as well as agricultural and meteorological
    machinery. Authors [16] presented a number of proprietary approaches as potential
    ways to enhance agricultural monitoring. Researchers uncovered more complex frameworks
    in their research on the subject of keeping track of geographical regions and
    climatic fluctuations. Farm Management Information Systems, often known as FMIS,
    have developed throughout time to concentrate on the specific activities and needs
    that are typical of farms. At the moment, these frameworks are working their way
    into the contemporary age of the Internet by making use of established systems
    administration and replies to strengthen agricultural structures. In spite of
    this, it is a commonly held belief that the Internet has a number of flaws, most
    notably in the area of managing the enormous number of linked devices, whether
    they be devices associated with the internet of things (IoT) or devices used by
    stakeholders (stakeholder devices). At the same time, there is not a standardized
    solution that can guarantee reliable interoperability between the relevant authorities
    and interested parties. Since that time, people have been relying on the frameworks
    provided by Future Internet (FI) to fill up these gaps. Farmers may at long last
    get a hold on their agricultural yield with the assistance of sensors, allowing
    them to adopt the type of thorough control that has been urged for a very long
    time. Researchers have outlined the fundamental purpose of sensor technology as
    well as its significant contributions to the field of agriculture. The sensor
    developed by Shining Li et al. is put to use in the Precision Agriculture Monitor
    System (PAMS) in order to keep an eye on how farming is being carried out. To
    increase production by means of reinforcing socioeconomic elements, it is advised
    that farmers adopt the IFarm Framework system for monitoring and regulating water
    consumption. This system may help farmers monitor and regulate how much water
    they use. Anisi M.H. et al. [17] categorized the sensor technology by determining
    how well it performed based on a number of different characteristics. Million.
    According to Csoto [18], the key sources of precision agricultural information
    for 14 cotton-growing southern states in the United States include farm-based
    equipment, crop consultants, university extension, the media, and government organizations.
    The proliferation of precision agriculture technology is influenced in a variety
    of different ways by data coming from a wide variety of sources. One such example
    is the widespread utilization of yield monitors that come pre-fitted with both
    global positioning system (GPS) and soil survey map technology. However, input
    from dealers has a significant effect on the degree to which technologies such
    as zone soil sampling and soil survey maps are implemented. In a great number
    of emerging countries, the availability of agricultural water is decreasing. Even
    the sections of the booming economy that use the least amount of water nonetheless
    need a substantial amount of it. For this reason, it is vital to create effective
    techniques of agricultural production, generate the required amounts of food,
    and execute critical plans for collecting and distributing rainfall, as well as
    making arrangements for the use of artificial irrigation systems. Rainwater collection
    and efficient irrigation techniques need to get more attention if we are to preserve
    our available water supplies. The quantity of water that is used by each industry
    has been continuously growing throughout the course of time. The length of time
    rain continues to fall is mostly dependent on sporadic climate shifts and other
    factors, such as evaporation and transpiration [19]. It is very necessary to evaluate
    the climatic factors that are associated to the production of agricultural goods
    in order to prevent global water shortages and food shortages. For a Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) [20] scenario, ZigBee [21] and [22] deploy multiple sensor
    nodes in a restricted location. Authors also proposed a hybrid heuristic approach
    that combines genetic algorithms with decision trees in order to find the optimum
    decision tree for modelling farmer behavior and predicting irrigation events.
    This technique combines Decision Trees with Genetic Algorithms. The strategy was
    used over a whole irrigation area. According to the findings, the best models
    developed were able to accurately predict between 68 and 100% of the observed
    irrigation events, while also predicting between 93 and 100% of the unexpected
    ones. Fertilizer use during crop growth affects the end result. All producers
    must consider the plant''s characteristics while applying pesticides. Chemical
    fertilizers contribute to the development of several unexpected diseases notwithstanding
    their negative effects on plant nutrition. Farmers value soil quality because
    it affects agricultural output. Precision agriculture automatically monitors soil
    moisture. Gamma-radiometric soil sensors, soil moisture sensors, and electrical
    conductivity sensors are some of the latest IoT-based agricultural monitoring
    equipment for soil monitoring. The environment sensors also capture crop physiological
    status. Multi linear regression and feature selection classify well. 3 Methodology
    This section introduces an IOT-based system for smart fertilizer recommendation
    system. This platform collects data on agriculture using IoT devices and sensors,
    and then applies machine learning to recommend fertilizer in the right amount
    and at the right time. The data collection phase gathers input data such as crop
    information, soil temperature, soil wetness, and soil humidity. Data is acquired
    using moisture and humidity sensors. The Sequential Forward Floating Selection
    method is used to choose the features. Multi linear Regression is used for data
    categorization. SFSS-MLR''s performance is contrasted with that of Random Forest,
    C4.5, and the Naive Bayes method. Methodology is presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 IOT
    based smart fertilizer recommendation system Full size image In order to accelerate
    the process of generating models and to increase the accuracy of detection and
    classification, a significant number of researchers are resorting to feature selection
    techniques. These researchers hope that by doing so, they can achieve their goals
    more quickly. The fundamental goal of any feature selection algorithm is to first
    determine the characteristics that are the most relevant to the problem at hand
    by making use of a variety of selection criteria, and then to filter out any features
    that are unnecessary or that are duplicates of other features. The work that is
    being presented here makes use of a method for choosing features that is known
    as Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) [23]. This method was used to
    pick the features that are being presented here. Even though it is not a method
    that is utilized in machine learning, linear regression is often used as a foundation
    for more advanced models that are used for data prediction. This is because linear
    regression is so straightforward to implement. The linear regression model makes
    use of a variety of research approaches, one of the most significant of which
    is work done in economics. Other approaches, such as statistical analysis, are
    also used. Analyses of the associations between the independent factors and the
    dependent variables are carried out, and an appropriate prediction model is built
    by applying the regression model to the data that has been gathered. Additionally,
    the structural interpretation hypotheses might be tested with the aid of the variables
    in the study. In the context of structural interpretation, the independent factors
    do, in fact, have an effect on the variable that is being interpreted. The statistical
    regression model, which postulates that the usefulness of a collection of dependent
    characteristics in one dataset is dependent on a set of independent features in
    another dataset, is evaluated using MLR [24], which states that the usefulness
    of a collection of dependent characteristics in one dataset is reliant on a set
    of independent features in another dataset. This is done with the purpose of figuring
    out whether or not this hypothesis is correct. It is very necessary for the dependent
    variable to be of a continuous sort in order for the regression technique to function
    in an appropriate manner. On the other hand, the independent variable might either
    be continuous or discrete in its presentation. One kind of linear modelling is
    known as linear regression, which gets its name from the fact that the resultant
    regression line is often straight. The linearity of the connections between the
    variables is an important point to keep in mind. The regression model is one of
    the most popular choices for predicting crop yield because of the correlation
    that exists between the independent variable yield and the dependent characteristics
    fertilizers utilized, area of production, weather factors, and irrigation parameters.
    This makes the regression model one of the most accurate models available. In
    crop yield prediction models, the crop yield itself is referred to as the dependent
    feature of the dataset, also known as the response feature. On the other hand,
    the other important parameters are referred to as the independent features. The
    MLR model is mathematically illustrated by Eq. 1. $$ y_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}
    x_{{i_{1} }} + \\beta_{2} x_{{i_{2} }} + \\beta_{3} x_{{i_{3} }} + ... + \\beta_{ik}
    + \\varepsilon_{i} $$ (1) where k is the number of features used in the data set,
    xik is the ith measure of the xk feature in the dataset, β1, β2, β3,…, βk are
    the regression coefficients calculated using the independent features, β0 is the
    intercept and εi are the residuals or the error. 4 Result and discussion A data
    set is created by collecting related data from [25]. This data set contains soil
    temperature, soil moisture, soil humidity, soil type, crop type, nitrogen, potassium,
    phosphorus, fertilizer name. Features are selected using Sequential Forward Floating
    Selection algorithm. Data classification is performed by Multi Layer Regression.
    Performance of SFSS-MLR is compared to Random Forest, C4.5, Naïve Bayes algorithm.
    Weka tool is used to implement proposed methodology.Results achieved are shown
    in Table 1 and Fig. 5. Performance of SFSS MLR is better in terms of accuracy,
    precision, recall and F1. Table 1 Result comparison of SFSS MLR technique Full
    size table Fig. 5 Result comparison of SFSS MLR technique with C4.5, NB and RF
    techniques Full size image For the purpose of determining whether or not a classification
    model is effective, evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and
    the F1 measure are used. The performance of various classifiers may be compared
    via the use of benchmark measurements. It is usual practise to calculate a variety
    of distinct metrics while doing a binary classification job. These metrics might
    include the percentage of right classifications, the number of false positives,
    and the number of false negatives. When we talk about \"positive instances,\"
    we''re referring to the examples that have been labelled as positive, and when
    we talk about \"negative instances,\" we''re talking about the examples that have
    been labelled as bad. True positive (TP): Positive instances that are correctly
    classified as positive. False negative (FN): Positive instances that are correctly
    classified as negative. True negative (TN): Negative instances that are correctly
    classified as negative. False positive (FP): Negative instances that are correctly
    classified as positive. $$ {\\text{Accuracy}} = \\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}}}
    \\right)/{\\text{N}} $$ $$ {\\text{Precision}} = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}}
    + {\\text{FP}}} \\right) $$ $$ {\\text{Recall}} = \\frac{{{\\text{TP}}}}{{{\\text{TP}}
    + {\\text{FN}}}} $$ $$ {\\text{f}}\\_{\\text{measure}} = 2*\\left( {\\left( {{\\text{Precision}}*{\\text{Recall}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{Precision }} + {\\text{Recall}}} \\right)} \\right)
    $$ The precision, recall and F1 score of SFSS MLR are also higher than other machine
    learning techniques for agriculture environment monitoring. The accuracy of SFSS
    MLR is 99.3 per cent. 5 Conclusion Precision agriculture can prescribe the appropriate
    ratio of water to fertilizer to paste; it may be possible to link increased crop
    yields to this technique. Precision agriculture contributes to the resolution
    of these issues by reducing the amount of water that is used during the production
    of agricultural goods, as well as by increasing crop yields through the ongoing
    monitoring of soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and pH. This article presents
    the design and development of a smart agriculture environment monitoring system.
    Instability in one''s access to food has been linked to a wide range of adverse
    impacts on one''s health, including infertility, human health issues, accelerated
    ageing, poor insulin regulation, and several other conditions. Both the amount
    and the quality of the food that was made accessible were able to significantly
    improve as a result of the deployment of novel practices. The development of bioorganic
    food items directly results from society''s acceptance of the technology in question.
    During the phase known as \"Data Acquisition,\" input data such as temperature,
    moisture, and humidity of the soil, as well as regional meteorological data and
    crop specifics, are collected. The Sequential Forward Floating Selection algorithm
    is used in feature selection. The categorization of the data is accomplished by
    using multi-layer regression. The performance of the SFSS-MLR method is analyzed
    and contrasted with that of Random Forest, C4.5, and the Naive Bayes algorithm.
    Regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 performance, SFSS MLR performs more
    admirably than its predecessor. The precision, recall and F1 score of SFSS MLR
    are also higher than other machine learning techniques for agriculture environment
    monitoring. The accuracy of SFSS MLR is 99.3 per cent. Precision rate and recall
    rate is 99 percent. F1 score of SFSS MLR is 99.3 percent. In future, SFSS MLR
    can be tested by handling larger data sets, data sets of different sizes. Performance
    of SFSS MLR is also needed to be tested in federal learning environment. Data

    yield and economic returns. This enables users to choose an irrigation strategy
    that best suits their irrigation capacities and expected returns. The irrigation
    schedules can be improved by optional remote detection of plant water stress using
    a sensor platform mounted on a pivot irrigation system, but the app can be used

    sensors 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is the largest water consumer, accounting
    for ∼70% of global freshwater withdrawal and ∼90% of freshwater consumption [1].
    Irrigation allows crop production in water-limited environments and therefore
    plays a vital role in global agricultural production [2]. Nevertheless, increasing
    incidences of weather extremes and uncertainty in irrigation water supply are
    critical challenges faced by many producers worldwide [[2], [3],]. For example,
    the infamous drought of 2011 in Texas, United States, resulted in about $7.6 billion
    in agricultural losses [4]. Some heavily irrigated regions like western and south-central
    United States, northern China, western and central Asia, North Africa, and Mexico
    are projected to have no irrigation potential in the future due to insufficient
    water supply in a warming climate [5]. Moreover, warmer and drier summers are
    expected in many regions in the world, which will exacerbate the situation by
    increasing crop water requirements [6,7]. Therefore, information technology-based
    irrigation decision support tools are needed in these regions to apply limited
    irrigation water more efficiently. Currently available irrigation decision support
    tools can be classified into four types: evapotranspiration (ET) and soil water
    balance (WB)-based, soil sensor-based, plant sensor-based, and crop model-based.
    However, most of these irrigation decision support tools have generally remained
    limited to the scientific community, with low adoption by producers. Issues that
    limit their adoption include the high cost of hardware and software, need to have
    technical background to use the tools, requirement of extensive input data, low
    accuracy, as well as lack of efficient economic analysis support [8]. The ET-WB-based
    irrigation scheduling method has wide applications in web-based or smartphone
    apps due to its simplicity and requirement for little input data. For example,
    the WISE (Water Irrigation Scheduler for Efficient Application) web-based app
    developed at Colorado State University  [9,10] can schedule irrigation on any
    individual farm across the state of Colorado with automated access to daily weather
    data from a network of more than 90 weather stations and soil profile data from
    the SSURGO database (http://sdmdataaccess.nrcs.usda.gov/). The SmartIrrigation
    smartphone app developed at the University of Florida provides real-time irrigation
    schedules for different crops using weather data from 42 sites and forecasted
    short-term data from the National Weather Service [11]. However, the ET-WB-based
    methods have low accuracy in predicting irrigation timing and amount due to the
    lack of field data, such as information about soil properties and on-site weather
    [12]. Soil sensor-based irrigation scheduling requires the installation of sensors
    and extensive manual data collection and therefore is cumbersome and expensive.
    In addition, soil moisture sensors are static and cannot represent the spatial
    variability in soil moisture across a field. DIEM, Dashboard for Irrigation Efficiency
    and Management [13], is a web-based tool developed in Texas for field-specific
    irrigation scheduling that uses soil moisture data collected from static sensors
    and estimates weather data until the end of the growing season based on historical
    data. DIEM requires the installation and removal of soil moisture sensors in the
    field annually. The use of smart sensors in recent years has facilitated the monitoring
    of spatial variability in soil moisture. Some of the examples of these sensors
    include the automated irrigation system developed by Gutierrez et al. [14] and
    several commercially available irrigation management systems [15,16]. However,
    the soil sensor-based irrigation scheduling tools cannot accurately represent
    crop water stress, especially under cloudy and high humidity conditions [12].
    For example, crops may not suffer severe water stress even with a low soil water
    content because of reduced evaporative demand under cloudy and high humidity conditions.
    Alternatively, plant sensor-based methods directly estimate crop water status
    by integrating soil-water environment and, therefore, can effectively determine
    irrigation timing [17]. One popular plant sensor-based method is the Crop Water
    Stress Index (CWSI), which uses the canopy-to-air temperature difference to quantify
    crop water stress. The theoretical CWSI derived following the energy balance equation
    has been successfully used to indicate crop water status and schedule irrigation
    under different climatic conditions [[18], [19], [20]]. However, direct use of
    CWSI before full canopy closure can incur substantial errors due to the influence
    of soil heat flux. To overcome this weakness, Moran et al. [21] developed water
    deficit index (WDI), a modification of CWSI, in which the impact of soil heat
    flux was considered using a linear mixing model of soil and canopy temperatures.
    The WDI method was tested in high-frequency sprinkler irrigation for cotton [22].
    Although plant sensor-based methods can effectively determine when to irrigate,
    the amount of water to be applied cannot be directly obtained. Hence, these are
    usually integrated with other methods for real-time irrigation scheduling. With
    proper parameterization and calibration, crop simulation models can be used for
    irrigation scheduling by integrating soil properties, climate, crop genetics,
    and farming system management practices. Crop models are also helpful in evaluating
    the impacts of deficit irrigation scheduling strategies on crop yield. Several
    crop models have been successfully applied for irrigation scheduling, including
    the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) [23,24], AquaCrop
    [25], CROPWAT [26], and Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) [27,28]. These
    models vary in their complexity and accuracy. For example, AquaCROP uses a simplified
    crop model with few data requirements [[29], [30], [31]], but it underestimates
    soil moisture status, leading to inaccurate irrigation scheduling [32]. Among
    these models, the DSSAT model performs better in deficit irrigation scheduling,
    as demonstrated in a variety of regions [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39],
    [40], [41]]. Considerable progress has been made to improve the irrigation scheduling
    algorithm in DSSAT. For example, DeJonge and Thorp [42] improved crop ET simulation
    in DSSAT by including the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient and ASCE standardized reference
    evapotranspiration methods. Lopez et al. [43] integrated growth stage-based deficit
    irrigation, allowing users to specify different thresholds to trigger irrigation
    during different growth stages in DSSAT. The effectiveness of crop model-based
    irrigation scheduling depends on model accuracy, calibration quality, and weather
    forecast reliability [12]. Crop models have been widely used in the retrospective
    evaluation of irrigation scheduling management using historical weather data,
    but the use of crop model-based real-time irrigation scheduling is still limited
    primarily due to unreliable weather forecasts. Using the RZWQM2 model equipped
    with DSSAT, Gu et al. [44] developed IrrSch to schedule irrigation based on model
    simulated crop water stress. IrrSch is currently being tested for real-time irrigation
    scheduling for cotton in Xinjiang, China [36]. The Food, Agriculture and Resource
    Management System (FARMs) developed by Kim and Kisekka [45] enables web-based
    DSSAT simulation for near-real-time simulation by linking the grid SSURGO soil
    database and weather data from the NASA POWER project (https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/).
    Nevertheless, future weather forecasts in these two real-time irrigation tools
    were produced using historical weather statistics (e.g., mean and variance), leading
    to considerable uncertainties in full-season decision support. In addition, very
    few crop model-based irrigation scheduling tools have attempted to incorporate
    economic models to support cost-benefit analysis at the farm level [8]. To address
    these drawbacks, we aimed to develop an easy-to-use mobile app for a crop model-
    and sensor-based irrigation decision support system, called idCROP (irrigation
    decision support system for Conserving Resources and Optimizing Production). Cotton  (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) was selected as the focus crop to verify the reliability of the app.
    The Texas Rolling Plains and High Plains regions, which collectively produce about
    26% of U.S. cotton [46], were selected as the study regions for app development.
    Cotton production in these regions highly depends on irrigation water from the
    underlying Seymour and Ogallala Aquifers. These aquifers have experienced substantial
    groundwater declines due to intensive irrigation and droughts [47]. On the other
    hand, climate change could lead to warmer and drier summers over these two regions
    in the future [48,49], which will necessitate larger groundwater withdrawals to
    meet the higher ET demands. To reduce groundwater use and prolong the usable economic
    lifetime of the Ogallala Aquifer, Groundwater Conservation Districts in the Texas
    High Plains region have already enacted restrictions on groundwater pumping [50].
    Therefore, adoption of innovative irrigation management tools is essential for
    cotton producers in these regions to efficiently apply limited irrigation water
    to maximize crop water productivity, helping producers comply with groundwater
    pumping restrictions. The objectives of this study were to: (1) develop the framework
    and workflow of idCROP; (2) prepare region-specific input files, including soil
    files, cultivar parameters, and automated weather files throughout the growing
    season; (3) update and extend the economic analysis functionality; and (4) validate
    the crop-based irrigation decision support system using the field data obtained
    in the 2020 and 2021 cotton growing season at Texas A&M AgriLife Chillicothe Research
    Station in the Texas Rolling Plains region. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Crop
    model- and sensor-based irrigation decision support system The overall architecture
    of idCROP with major components and data streams is illustrated in Fig. 1. The
    two main components of the idCROP tool are a mobile application, developed for
    iOS and Android, and a server. The main software used on the server is DSSAT,
    which integrates with a newly developed economic model. The app was developed
    using an Agile-based software engineering methodology, which involves rapid, iterative,
    and feedback-focused software generation. Using this method, we obtained a finished
    product that addresses the feedback from end-users and subject-matter experts
    during the app development process. This process enabled iterative refinement
    and app expansion and provided an expanded set of features and capabilities in
    an incremental fashion. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Layout of crop model- and sensor-based irrigation decision
    support system and illustration of workflow. The dashed line indicates that the
    sensor-based system is an optional setting. The mobile app can be used without
    the installation of in-field sensors. There are three major components of idCROP:
    (1) data input from users, (2) scenario creation and execution, and (3) result
    generation and presentation. User inputs include initial conditions, planting
    details, management practices, harvest details, and expenses/income, as detailed
    in Table 1. For scenario creation and execution, a data manager is used to create
    input files required to execute the DSSAT and economic models. It combines three
    data sources, including data from users, data stored in the database (e.g., environmental
    and economic data), and external data from the internet (i.e., real-time weather
    data). As shown in Fig. 1, if sensors are installed, a datalogging controller
    is used to store and upload data from the field to the server. Result generation
    and presentation include irrigation schedules, seasonal irrigation requirement,
    water use efficiency, and expected yield and net return. Table 1. Input types

    For the data input using the imperial system, idCROP will convert to the metric
    system. ⁎ More details about these parameters are provided in Supplementary Table
    S1. Users can create scenarios based on the unique characteristics of their fields
    and growing practices. The app analyzes different scenarios and compares how different
    irrigation schedules affect the simulated yield and net return. There are two
    options for irrigation scheduling. The default option is based on the DSSAT model,
    with irrigation scheduled by model-simulated soil water balance. This crop model-based
    approach can be used with any irrigation system. Users have an option to improve
    irrigation prescriptions with the installation of in-field sensors (Fig. 1). For
    this optional integrated (i.e., crop model- and sensor-based) approach, a sensor
    platform is mounted on the pivot, allowing real-time measurement of canopy temperature
    and ground coverage. These data are transferred to a server using a datalogger
    and a wireless modem (Fig. 1) to calculate the hourly WDI. The field-calibrated
    relationships between the seasonal average WDI and cotton yield under different
    ET replacements are used to determine the WDI threshold to trigger irrigation.
    The use of WDI provides on-site corrections and improves the accuracy of the model-based
    irrigation schedules. It is also recommended to install a mini weather station
    into the sensor system, which was tested to be highly effective. For users who
    do not have a mini weather station, idCROP automatically acquires real-time weather
    data from publicly available data, which is explained in detail in Section 2.5.
    The idCROP tool currently calculates expected yield following DSSAT-simulated
    seasonal irrigation schedules under four default irrigation strategies––0, 30,
    60, and 90% ET-replacement. However, the tool is customizable to other ET-replacement
    values and our future efforts will focus on this. For each strategy, the system
    applies the economic model to estimate farm profits expected from adhering to
    the simulated irrigation schedule. Users can follow any ET replacement strategy
    to apply deficit irrigation depending on irrigation water availability. With this
    information, users can proactively make decisions about in-season irrigation and
    crop management to optimize crop yield and profit. The resulting irrigation prescriptions
    are updated as the growing season progresses based on recorded irrigations, past
    and real-time weather data from the beginning of the growing season, and updated
    short-term weather for the remainder of the growing season. Users can change their
    irrigation strategy during the growing season, if necessary, based on unanticipated
    changes in the availability of irrigation water, the weather, or their yield and
    economic goals. 2.2. Field experiment and treatments The parameters used in the
    DSSAT model and the WDI threshold used to trigger irrigation under different ET
    replacements were calibrated and validated using field experiments. A two-year
    study was conducted at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research Station at Chillicothe
    in the Texas Rolling Plains in the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons (Fig. 2a). A
    two-tower center pivot irrigation system was used (Fig. 2b). Half of the field
    was covered by the pivot, which was divided into sections, with each occupying
    1/12th of the total area. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete
    block design, with three replications of four irrigation scheduling treatments
    that differed in ET replacement rate (90%, 60%, 30%, and 0%). Download : Download

    radiometer and spectral sensor; and (d) CR1000X datalogging controller. (c) and
    (d) are the equipment required if the user chooses to adopt the sensor-based approach.
    A sensor platform was mounted on the pivot, about 4 m above the ground (Fig. 2c).
    The sensor platform included an SI-121-SS infrared radiometer [51] to measure
    crop canopy temperature and an S2-112-SS spectral sensor pair [51] to measure
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In 2021, a ClimaVUE50 all-in-one
    weather station [52] was added to the sensor platform, allowing for on-site collection
    of weather parameters. The sensor platform was controlled by a CR1000X datalogging
    controller [53] to store and upload data to the server (Fig. 2d). Data were collected
    within two hours of solar noon every two weeks on dry runs (i.e., irrigation water
    was not being applied) of the pivot across the field experiment area. A similar
    sensor system was placed on the ground in the 90% ET replacement plot, including
    an all-in-one weather station and an infrared temperature (IRT) sensor. The ground-based
    system allowed for continuous hourly measurement, which is used to validate the
    pivot-based system. A mid-maturing cotton cultivar (Phytogen 350 W3FE) was planted
    on 15 June 2020 and 27 May 2021. Irrigation was applied weekly or twice-weekly,
    depending on ET water losses. Monitoring and calculation of reference ET was done
    using data from an on-site weather station. The irrigation amount for each ET
    replacement treatment was calculated based on weekly reference ET using the Penman-Monteith
    method, which was multiplied by the appropriate growth stage-based irrigation
    coefficients for cotton from Ko et al. [54] and ET replacement coefficient (e.g.,
    0.6 for 60% ET replacement). At the end of each growing season, plots were harvested
    to determine cotton lint and seed yields. Seed cotton yield (seed + lint) was
    used for model simulations. 2.3. Scenario and data 2.3.1. Initial conditions After
    specifying the field location (latitude, longitude), users are required to select
    the crop grown in the previous growing season. Based on users’ choice, idCROP
    calculates the root and surface residue weight remaining in the field, which are
    the input data required by DSSAT to initialize the fresh organic matter of the
    experiment file. The idCROP app provides input files for 15 crop types, including
    fallow and ‘other crops’. For crop types that are not listed, users can select
    ‘other crops’, which is calculated based on the mean value of major crops. The
    major crop types in the study region were identified from the Cropland Data Layer
    of the National Agriculture Statistics Service, United States Department of Agriculture
    (https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) (Supplementary Table S2 and Figure S2).
    The surface residue at harvest is calculated as: (1) (2) where Sur_residuei is
    the surface residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of the ith type of crop at the harvest;
    Yieldi and Sur_mi are the yield (kg [dry matter] ha−1) and above-ground biomass
    (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of ith type of crop at maturity, respectively; and HIi
    is the harvest index of ith type of crop, which is explained in detail in Table
    S3. The root residue at harvest is calculated as: (3) where Root_residuei is the
    root residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) of the ith type of crop at the harvest, and
    RSratio is the root-to-shoot ratio, for which a constant value of 0.4 is used.
    The decomposition of surface and root residues is analyzed using a first-order
    exponential model [55] as: (4) where Residuet and Residue0 are the surface or
    root residue (kg [dry matter] ha−1) at time t and the harvest, respectively; and
    k is the decomposition rate of surface or root residue and are assumed to be the
    same. Fig. 3 shows the percentages of surface/root residue remaining at different
    times. Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download : Download full-size

    alfalfa from Schomberg and Steiner [57]; peanut from Mulvaney et al. [58]; millet
    from Soratto et al. [59]; and Barley from Loomis et al. [60]. Triticale uses the
    value of winter wheat, and hay and grass use the value of alfalfa. 2.3.2. Planting
    details Some screenshots of idCROP are provided in Fig. 4 to illustrate its capabilities.
    To ensure robust crop growth and production simulation, the app sets a soft warning
    if the entered planting date is outside the dates specified by the crop insurance
    window (April 15 - June 20) and a hard warning if the entered date is 2-4 weeks
    beyond the dates specified by the crop insurance window (April 1- July 5). The
    emergence date is calculated based on an accumulation of 70 daily heat units after
    planting with a temperature threshold of 60 ℉ (15.6 °C) (i.e., DD60) (Eq. S1 in
    Supplementary Material). Row spacing and seed rate data are required from users
    to calculate plant population at seeding (Eq. S2). The idCROP tool automatically
    calculates the population at emergence based on an 82% emergence rate [61] using
    Eq. S3, but advanced users can set the emergence rate by themselves. A simple
    procedure to estimate this parameter is provided if users click the ‘show advanced’
    button (Fig. 4c-d). Download : Download high-res image (788KB) Download : Download

    For irrigation setup, idCROP provides three options, including low energy precision
    application (LEPA), low elevation spray application (LESA), and mid-elevation
    spray application (MESA). The irrigation efficiency of each system was estimated
    as the mean value of efficiencies reported in published studies (Table S3). 2.3.3.
    Management practices After setting the initial conditions and planting details,
    users can define management practices, including irrigation, tillage, fertilizer,
    and chemicals application dates and amounts. The available options for each management
    practice are detailed in Table S1. The data on tillage depth for each application
    method is taken from Neitsch et al. [62] (Table S5). The details about the method
    and depth of fertilizer and chemical application are included in Table S6. 2.4.
    Environmental data 2.4.1. Soil files To provide field-scale soil input data, the
    Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) data and the NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) were
    used to identify dominant soil types in cotton acreages in the Texas Rolling Plains
    region. The dominant soil types are detailed in Table S7. Soil properties such
    as soil texture, bulk density, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, soil pH, and
    cation exchange capacity for the identified soils were obtained from the Official
    Soil Series Descriptions [63]. Other soil information such as the field capacity
    (referred to as drained upper limit in DSSAT), wilting point (lower limit), soil
    water at saturation, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were estimated using
    the Soil-Plant-Air-Water model [64]. Soil root growth factor, an important input
    for each soil layer that reflects physical or chemical constraints on root growth
    in certain soil layers [65], was estimated using a function in the DSSAT soil
    file creation utility program (i.e., SBuild) based on soil texture, bulk density
    and soil organic carbon [66]. The initial soil moisture was assumed to be 65%
    of the available water content. The developed soil files were included in idCROP
    so that user can select a soil type that is similar in soil properties to the
    soil on user''s farm. 2.4.2. Cultivar parameter files The crop modules in the
    DSSAT-CSM require genotype coefficients for different maturity groups to mimic
    their growth and development. Cotton genotype coefficients were developed for
    three maturity groups (i.e., early, early-mid, and mid-full) using variety trial
    data of 45 cultivars from 10 stations collected by Texas A&M AgriLife Extension
    over five growing seasons (2016-2020) [67]. Measured data from irrigated sites
    and dryland sites were used for calibration and validation, respectively, for
    different maturity groups. As shown in Table 2, the calibrated coefficients captured
    the variation in growing season length and differences in growth patterns among
    the maturity groups. The developed cultivar files were included in idCROP so users
    can select the maturity group that best represents the cultivar they plant. Table

    bias error (Eq. S5). 2.5. Real-time weather forecasts To provide real-time weather
    forecasts throughout the growing season, idCROP combines four weather data sources:
    (1) historical weather data, (2) real-time data, (3) forecasted daily short-term
    weather data for 16 days, and (4) forecasted daily seasonal weather data for six
    months. Historical weather data until the day before the date of simulation (or
    app use) was obtained from the nearest West Texas Mesonet weather station [68].
    Missing weather data was filled with two other sources, including the National
    Climatic Data Center data [69] and the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR)
    data [70]. For real-time data, on-site weather station can be set up by the users
    who choose to deploy sensors. For the users without on-site weather station, idCROP
    would automatically obtain real-time data from the nearest West Texas Mesonet
    weather station. Daily short-term forecasted weather data was obtained from the
    Global Forecast System (GFS) for a 16-day period [71]. GFS provides global weather
    forecast every six hours with a 0.5° spatial resolution and 3-hr temporal resolution,
    including daily maximum temperature (Tmax), daily minimum temperature (Tmin),
    precipitation, and solar radiation. The most recent forecast cycle was used for
    the real-time forecast. Daily forecasted seasonal weather data was obtained for
    six months from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) forecasting system.
    NMME is an experimental real-time seasonal forecast system, which provides daily
    global weather forecasts with an 11-month lead time at 1° spatial resolution (approximately
    110 km at the equator) based on ensemble simulations (10 ensembles for each model)
    of several state-of-the-art coupled general circulation models (GCMs). An improved
    statistical downscaling method with corrections for both mean and variability
    [72,73] was used to produce daily data at a 1-km resolution (Eq. S6). The GFS
    hindcast data (2008-2019) and Daily Surface Weather and Climatological Summaries
    (DAYMET, version 4) (2008-2019) at 1 km resolution were used for calibration of
    downscaled data. As shown in Fig. 5, the downscaled GFS data captured the variations
    of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation very well at the farm level. The calibrated parameters
    for the short forecast downscaling method can be found in Fig. S3-S5. Download

    Research Station in the Texas Rolling Plains region. Hindcast predictions (1982-2010)
    and DAYMET data (1982-2010) were used for validation of the downscaling parameters
    for the seasonal weather forecasts using the same statistical downscaling method
    that is being used for the validation of short-term weather forecasts. In the
    current version of idCROP, we have successfully downscaled data from one NMME
    model (i.e., Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model version 4, CanCM4) [74], to
    1 km spatial resolution over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS). As shown in Fig. 6,
    the original CanCM4 data overestimated Tmax and Tmin in most regions. The downscaled
    CanCM4 data captured the seasonal variation of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation at
    the farm level. The calibrated parameters for the seasonal forecast downscaling
    method can be found in Figs. S6 - S8. Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    the Texas Rolling Plains region. A step-by-step procedure for generating updated
    daily weather forecasts covering the entire growing season is depicted in Fig.
    7. For the short-term (16-day) forecasted data from GFS, daily Tmax, Tmin, precipitation,
    and solar radiation were calculated as the maximum, minimum, sum, and mean of
    the sub-daily forecasts, respectively, from the most recent forecast cycle at
    0.5° × 0.5° spatial resolution. The 0.5° × 0.5° resolution data was then downscaled
    to 1 km using the calibrated downscaling parameters. Download : Download high-res

    data inputs and processing in idCROP. For the seasonal forecast (up to six months),
    the ensemble means were first calculated to produce the daily weather forecast
    at 1° × 1° spatial resolution. The 1° × 1° data was then downscaled to 1 km using
    the validated downscaling parameters. The forecasted seasonal solar radiation
    data is not available from the data source, and hence it was calculated using
    Tmax, Tmin, and extraterrestrial solar radiation (Ra) data as suggested by Allen
    et al. [75]. The historic weather data file starts several months before the planting
    date, ensuring the warm-up of the DSSAT model. The real-time and short-term weather
    files were updated daily, and the seasonal forecast weather file was updated monthly.
    The forecasted data would be replaced by the newly available real-time weather
    data as the growing season progresses to improve the reliability of crop yield
    and irrigation water requirement predictions. 2.6. Economic model The economic
    model in idCROP was developed based on an enterprise budget approach, which provides
    visual analytics for irrigation decision support and tradeoff analysis. It combines
    farm input and output data with corresponding prices from online sources. Users
    can compare the net returns for selected irrigation levels and understand net
    return changes due to price fluctuation. Net returns were defined as the difference
    between total revenues and total variable and fixed costs. The total revenues
    for selected irrigation levels are based on the simulated crop yield and the crop
    price at the harvest. The lint and seed yields were estimated as 58.6% and 41.4%
    of the DSSAT-simulated seed cotton yield, respectively [76]. Both seed and lint
    prices were decided based on market prices as mentioned below. Then, the net returns
    for selected irrigation levels (NRj, $ per ha) are calculated as follows: (5)
    where Yij is the lint or seed yield at the selected irrigation level j simulated
    by DSSAT, kg ha−1; Pi is the price for lint or seed at harvest, $ ha−1; Variable_costmj
    is the mth type of variable cost at the selected irrigation level j, $ per ha;
    and Fixed_costnj is the nth type of fixed cost at the selected irrigation level
    j. Variable costs include expenses on seed, fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides,
    labor, fuel, machine repair and maintenance, irrigation application, custom hired
    machinery, and equipment for planting and chemical applications if applicable,
    insurance, interest, and custom harvest. Fixed costs include depreciation and
    opportunity costs of planting, tillage and spraying machinery and equipment, irrigation
    equipment, other assets, and land lease costs if applicable. These data were obtained
    from the enterprise budget for Texas A&M AgriLife Extension District 3 [77], which
    is embedded in idCROP by default. These prices can also be adjusted by users based
    on their own farm-level data or their own regional enterprise budget. Typical
    variable and fixed costs are detailed in Table S8 and Table S9. To provide more
    accurate estimates of total revenues, harvest crop prices were estimated using
    the contract future market price at harvest time plus/minus the average price
    basis for each location during harvest. The default cotton future market prices
    were based on the future market contracts from the New York market [78]. Users
    can also adjust the harvest prices based on their price marketing strategy for
    that season. Additionally, idCROP allows users to evaluate the net return changes
    at alternative price levels by performing sensitivity analysis using the above-mentioned
    harvest price as basis (i.e., harvest price ±20%) for selected irrigation levels.
    The app also provides breakeven prices (i.e., the minimum price required to cover
    variable costs, Eq. 6) and total costs (Eq. 7), for selected irrigation levels.
    (6) (7) 2.7. Crop model-based irrigation scheduling algorithm in idCROP For crop
    model-based irrigation scheduling, future irrigation scheduling throughout the
    growing season is predicted using the ET-based automatic irrigation algorithm
    in DSSAT (i.e., setting IRRIG = E in DSSAT). For the ET-based automatic irrigation,
    the accumulation of ET demand (ACCUM_ET) was updated daily, which was calculated
    as the daily potential plant transpiration plus actual soil evaporation minus
    infiltration from rainfall. The idCROP app sets an ET demand threshold of 25 mm
    (i.e., IMDEP =25) and irrigation is triggered if ACCUM_ET ≥ 25 mm. Then, the irrigation
    amount is the accumulated ET demand multiplied by the deficit percentage (ITHRU)
    (i.e., ACCUM_ET × ITHRU/100). The ITHRU is determined by the user. For example,
    if a user wants to apply 90% ET replacement (i.e., ITHRU=90), then the irrigation
    amount is 0.9 × ACCUM_ET. The lower threshold of available water (ITHRL) is set
    as 20 to ensure a low ET replacement strategy (e.g., 30% ET) can be successfully
    executed by DSSAT. In addition, the minimum number of days between irrigation
    events is kept at three to avoid unreasonable results. The DSSAT parameter setting
    for different irrigation strategies is detailed in Table 3. When actual irrigations
    differ from idCROP scenarios, corrections on appropriate dates can be entered
    and confirmed. Table 3. Crop model-based irrigation scheduling setting in idCROP.

    3. Results 3.1. Major outputs of idCROP Major outputs of idCROP include irrigation
    schedules, seasonal irrigation requirements, estimated water use efficiency, and
    expected yield and net returns. Water use efficiency is defined as the yield produced
    per unit of water applied. Fig. 8 illustrates the major outputs of idCROP under
    different irrigation strategies (i.e., 0%, 30%, 60%, and 90% ET replacements).
    With these outputs, users can compare the simulation output intuitively and choose
    an irrigation strategy that best fits their irrigation capacity, yield, and economic
    goals. Download : Download high-res image (770KB) Download : Download full-size

    Plains. 3.2. Evaluation of crop model-based irrigation decision support system
    First, historical weather data from 1991 to 2020 are used to test the performance
    of crop model-based irrigation scheduling algorithm in idCROP under different
    irrigation strategies. As shown in Fig. 9, seed cotton yield showed an increasing
    trend as the ET-replacement level increased from 0% to 100%, and the corresponding
    seasonal irrigation amount also consistently increased as the irrigation level
    increased. Also, a reasonable number of irrigation events were obtained for all
    irrigation strategies. These results demonstrated that the crop model-based irrigation
    scheduling algorithms could effectively simulate the irrigation amount and timing.

    irrigation decision support system in idCROP was then tested at the Chillicothe
    Research Station in the 2020 growing season. As shown in Fig. 10a-c, the seasonal
    weather forecast captured the variation of Tmax, Tmin, and precipitation during
    the growing season. To investigate the reliability of idCROP at different lead
    times, predictions of seed cotton yield, seasonal irrigation demand, and precipitation
    with 0 to 5-month lead times were further examined (Fig. 10d-f). The cotton growing
    season in the Texas Rolling Plains and High Plains regions generally starts from
    May and continues to October, suggesting a 5-month lead time. Even at the beginning
    of the season (lead 5-month), idCROP can provide reasonable yield, seasonal irrigation,
    and precipitation forecasts with relative errors ranging from 14% to 18%. For
    seed cotton yield prediction, idCROP showed better performance as time proceeded
    in the growing season. However, seasonal irrigation requirements showed relatively
    large variability due to the combined effect of predicted temperature and precipitation.

    outputs from idCROP for the experiment at the Chillicothe Research Station during
    the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons are illustrated in Fig. 11. Seed cotton yield
    showed an increasing trend as the ET-replacement level increased from 0% to 90%
    ET replacement, and the corresponding total costs consistently increased likewise
    as more irrigation was applied (Fig. 11a). The highest net return was found using
    the 90% ET replacement. A detailed analysis of different fixed (22%) and variable
    costs (78%) for the 90% ET replacement is also provided in Fig. 11b. Custom machine
    hires accounted for the largest proportion (39%) of total costs. Download : Download

    lint yields. Sensitivity analysis of the net returns at different harvest prices
    is illustrated in Fig. 11c, which shows changes in net return due to price fluctuation.
    In addition, idCROP provides breakeven prices at different lint yields (Fig. 11d).
    With this information, users can identify the paths to increase their profits
    and secure financial incentives with limited irrigation. 4. Discussion Compared
    to existing irrigation decision support systems, idCROP has several advantages,
    including (1) high-resolution and improved real-time weather forecasts combining
    historic, real-time, and short-term (16-day) and seasonal (6-month) forecasted
    weather; (2) an advanced economic model, enabling the calculation of net returns
    and breakeven prices with consideration of price-cost variability. Users can compare
    the simulation output intuitively and choose an irrigation strategy that best
    fits their irrigation capacity, yield, and economic goals and also switch from
    one strategy to other depending on changes in irrigation water availability at
    any time during the growing season; (3) improved site-specific accuracy by combining
    crop model-based irrigation scheduling with on-farm, non-contact sensor data that
    can be used to improve the irrigation schedules. Currently, the short-term and
    seasonal weather forecasts have already been calibrated over the CONUS at 1-km
    resolution, which has not been incorporated into currently available irrigation
    scheduling systems. This forecasted weather can be corrected with on-site weather
    data as the growing season progresses, enabling a reliable weather forecast covering
    the growing season. idCROP updates and extends the economic analysis by providing
    crop net returns estimates, price sensitivity analysis, and breakeven prices based
    on enterprise budgets by combining farm input and output data with corresponding
    prices from online sources. These economic analyses enable users to choose an
    irrigation strategy that best fits their irrigation capacity and secure financial
    incentives, which is also not available in any existing irrigation scheduling
    decision support systems [8]. Along with the tool, a ticket-based response system
    is implemented and maintained to capture and document the status of all user inquiries,
    suggestions, and trouble reports. This feedback will help prioritize modifications/refinements
    of the system moving forward. The app performance for sensor-based irrigation
    scheduling has not been rigorously tested and verified. In the 2020 and 2021 cotton
    growing seasons, preliminary data were gathered on the WDI water stress index
    using a pivot-mounted sensor at the Chillicothe Research Station. The calculation
    of WDI is detailed in section S4 and Table 10. The data from 2020 indicated a
    strong relationship between WDI and water stress in cotton (Fig. 12a). A relatively
    stable WDI trend in the four ET-based water management regimes was observed when
    the soil between crop rows was not visible to the temperature sensor mounted on
    the phenotyping system (shortly after 60 days of planting). Efforts to address
    the issue before canopy closure are in progress, and the preliminary data in 2021
    (not shown) with nearly bare soil surface showed a relatively stable WDI trend
    under irrigated conditions. The strong relationship between the seasonal average
    WDI and observed cotton seed yield (Fig. 12b) can help us determine WDI thresholds
    for triggering irrigation based on the expected yield/water use. These results
    lead us to conclude that WDI, a modified CWSI method that accounts for canopy
    coverage, can be reliably used as an indicator in precision deficit irrigation
    management. Other preliminary data from the same phenotyping system has shown
    spectral reflectance sensors to be highly accurate in estimating canopy coverage.
    With temperature and spectral reflectance sensors mounted directly to a pivot
    irrigation system, WDI can provide a precise irrigation schedule according to
    the desired level of water deficit, especially when paired with model predictions
    of crop growth and water use. Taghvaeian et al. [8] analyzed irrigation scheduling
    practices in the U.S. in the past ten years and pointed out that water and energy
    could be significantly saved if plant sensor-based methods are part of the irrigation
    scheduling toolsets. Download : Download high-res image (238KB) Download : Download

    management regimes as a function of time (a) and the relationship between seasonal
    average WDI and cotton seed yield (b) during the 2020 growing season at Chillicothe,
    TX. There are several limitations in the current version of idCROP. First, the
    utility of the existing idCROP app prototype is limited to cotton production in
    the Texas Rolling Plains region. However, more crops simulated by DSSAT and any
    field in the CONUS can be added in the future. This can be done by including additional
    information related to soils, cultivars, and crop management, as well as extending
    the geographic extent for the creation of automated weather data files. Second,
    the seasonal weather forecast shows considerable uncertainties, especially for
    precipitation. To reduce the uncertainty in seasonal weather forecasts, we will
    include other NMME models that are being updated every month, including Community
    Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) [79], and Goddard Earth Observing System
    (GEOS-5) [80]. Third, the continued availability of real-time and short-term forecasted
    weather data for the app could sometimes be challenging. This challenge could
    be overcome by setting different priority levels for different weather sources.
    For example, weather data from an on-site weather station, if available, would
    be given the highest priority for historic and current weather data, followed
    by data from the nearest weather station (e.g., West Texas Mesonet), NCDC station,
    and NARR gridded dataset. If these data are not available, the short-term and
    seasonal forecasted data can be used as backup data. Conclusions The idCROP tool
    simplifies the application of DSSAT cropping system model for irrigation scheduling
    with minimal inputs required from the user. Users can provide just basic management
    information such as planting date, row spacing, seed rate, cultivar types, irrigation,
    fertilizer, and chemical applied date and amounts. To provide more realistic soil
    data, idCROP identifies dominant soil types using SSURGO and CDL datasets and
    specifies soil physical properties using the Official Soil Series Descriptions.
    The idCROP app pairs historic and forecasted weather throughout the growing season
    along with recorded irrigations to provide reliable irrigation recommendations
    that are optimized in real-time. The app generates prescriptions for several irrigation
    strategies that users can compare to know how different irrigation schedules affect
    the yield and net returns. We have also tested on-farm sensors mounted on pivot
    irrigation systems to improve the accuracy of irrigation recommendations, although
    the app can be used without the additional sensor data. The prototype idCROP app
    has been deployed to a small group of evaluators on both iOS and Android mobile
    devices. Although the utility of the existing idCROP app prototype is limited
    to cotton production in the Texas Rolling Plains region, more crops and any field
    in the CONUS can be added to idCROP in the future with additional information
    related to soils, cultivars, and crop management, as well as extending the geographic
    extent for the creation of automated weather data files. Supplementary information

  description: Chestnut crop is regaining its fame worldwide with powerful investment
    perspectives. Unluckily the climate change effects are posing high threat to its
    cultivation with less available resources and increased production cost both in
    traditional and specialized orchards. Additionally, the chestnut physiological
    knowledge is still limited, especially as concern the burr development (i.e.,
    the economical production target) and its relationship with the environmental
    parameters. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the seasonal, daily,
    and hourly burr growth pattern associated to environmental parameters for improving
    physiological knowledge on this species. The study was carried out in a traditional
    rainfed sweet chestnut orchard located in the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines (Monterenzio,
    Italy). The chestnut burr growth was measured, along the entire season, both with
    a digital calliper and through the use of plant-based sensors (fruit-gauges) that
    permitted to measure, in real-time, the burr growth pattern. Environmental data
    were recorded by a weather station placed in the middle of the orchard. Results
    evidenced a higher burr growth rate, in the last part of the season (from middle-end
    of August to full fall) while the daily growing pattern was characterized by increased
    oscillation, along the season, of night-swelling and daily-shrinkage. The night-swelling
    was found to be influenced by high nocturnal air relative humidity while the daily-shrinkage
    was influenced by the higher wind speed, solar radiation and vapour pressure deficit.
    Thus, the burr daily net growth can be associated, depending on the phenological
    stages, to environmental parameters. Precipitation but especially the atmosphere
    humidity, in September and October, were the main external drivers of burr daily
    net growth. These results could be promising for the adoption of sustainable (e.g.,
    late season grass mowing, sprinkler irrigation) and smart practices for improving
    chestnut management in both traditional and specialized orchards.

    sensors 1. Introduction Chestnut is regaining its importance in the global market
    with an exponential increase of new hectares planted worldwide (e.g., Portugal,
    Spain, Chile) every year (Beccaro et al., 2019). Unfortunately, at the same time,
    due to the climate change effects, areas where chestnut could be easily grown
    in the past, are nowadays reduced. Thus, it is necessary to start investigating
    chestnut physiological traits to increase orchards productivity and to cope with
    the climate change effects. To date, most of the studies relate to the plant physiological
    traits (e.g., leaf gas exchanges, water relations) and few regard on burr growth
    physiology comparing to other fruit tree species (Rossi et al., 2022). The fruit
    (i.e., nut) is the economical production target and its growth represents the
    integrated result of many physiological processes going on at whole tree level
    (Morandi et al., 2007). Therefore, if the burr is sufficiently growing, all the
    physiological processes at plant level are being efficient, hence the orchard
    is being appropriately managed (Morandi et al., 2017). Perulli et al. (2020) studied
    the seasonal chestnut burr growing pattern in two different seasons (dry and mild)
    but with manual measurements carried out with a digital calliper on a weekly basis.
    To date, literature is lacking on real-time plant-based data evaluating the burr
    daily and hourly growth dynamics and trend during the whole season. Furthermore,
    studies highlighting the burr growth based on its phenological stages and on the
    environmental conditions have not been carried out yet. Usually fruit growth (e.g.,
    apple, peach) is indeed tightly controlled and influenced by exogenous (environmental),
    as well as endogenous, factors as light levels, soil water and temperature (Corelli-Grappelli
    and Lakso, 2004). Improving the knowledge of burr growth dynamics and its relationship
    with the environment would bring chestnut to be better managed, similarly to the
    other fruit tree crops and allowing to optimize resources (i.e., water). The objective
    of the present study is to determine the seasonal, daily, and hourly burr growth
    in relation to environmental conditions for improving chestnut physiological knowledge.

    Monterenzio (Bologna, Italy), at 500 m elevation (44° 16′ N and 11° 24′ E), in
    a mature (150–200 years old), commercial, rainfed sweet chestnut orchard (Castanea
    sativa Mill.). Trees were, most likely, of the ‘Castel del Rio’ ecotype (‘Marrone
    type’) grafted on seedling rootstocks. This ecotype is characterized by a medium
    tree vigour, an expanded canopy, medium productivity (Breviglieri, 1955; Bagnaresi
    et al., 1977; Mellano et al., 2012) and with burr typically containing 3 nuts
    for each burr (Fideghelli et al., 2016). Full bloom occurred in the middle of
    June (June 12th) while full burr falls on October 20th, corresponding to 120 days
    after full bloom (DAFB). Air temperature (T), air relative humidity (RH), solar
    radiation (PAR), wind speed (WS) and pluviometry (P) data were collected from
    a weather station (Wi-Net s.r.l., Cesena, Italy) placed in the middle of the orchard.
    Data were collected, at 15 min intervals, during the whole season. From these
    data, vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was also calculated. 2.2. Burr diameter-weight
    conversion equation A total of 15 burrs, randomly picked every ten days along
    the whole season, was used to obtain the following conversion equation between
    burr diameter (D; mm) and burr fresh weight (W; g): where a, b and c were 0.019,
    0.260 and 1.562, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the relationship
    was > 0.99, as showed also in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (86KB)

    (mm) and burr fresh weight (g). 2.3. Burr seasonal measurement The maximum equatorial
    diameter of 25 burrs (5 burrs tree−1) was measured weekly throughout the growing
    season (n=14), using a digital calliper (Calibit, HK-Horticultural Knowledge s.r.l.,
    Bologna, Italy). Measurements started 14 days after full bloom (DAFB) and ended
    some days before the beginning of burr fall, at burr valves still completely closed
    (108 DAFB). Burrs diameter data (mm) were then converted to fresh weight (g) using
    the equation in Fig. 1. The burr absolute growth rate, both in diameter (AGRd,
    mm day−1) and in weight (AGRw, g day−1), was then calculated as follows: AGRd,w
    = (Pt1 - Pt0)/(t1 - t0); where Pt1 and Pt0 are the burr parameters (i.e., diameter
    or weight) measured on a given day of year (t1) and on the previous sampling date
    (t0), respectively (Perulli et al., 2020). 2.4. Burr hourly and daily measurements
    Burr diameter variations were measured constantly (excluding the days with technical
    problems i.e., 21–27, 37, 38, 51, 62, 71, 72, 83–87 DAFB), along the season (15–112
    DAFB), at 15 min intervals on four burrs (2 gauges tree−1), using custom-built
    gauges interfaced to a wireless data-logger system provided with a general packet
    radio service (GPRS) modem for a real time cloud data monitoring (Wi-Net s.r.l.,
    Cesena, Italy) (Fig. 2). The gauges consisted of a light, stainless steel frame
    supporting a variable linear resistance transducer (Megatron Elektronik AG & Co.,
    Munchen, Germany). Temperature effects on the frame and the sensor were tested
    and showed negligible errors under normal field conditions (Morandi et al., 2007).

    Fig. 2. Gauge for the continuous monitoring of burr growth of sweet chestnut at
    15 DAFB. The monitored burrs were homogeneous in size and position in the canopy.
    At each recording time, diameter data (mm) from all monitored burrs were converted
    to fresh weight (g) using the equation in Fig. 1. For each recording time (15
    min intervals during 24 h), data from the four burrs were hourly averaged and
    standard deviation calculated. Burr net daily growth (BNG; g burr d−1), mean hourly
    AGR (AGRh_mean; mg burr h−1), maximum hourly AGR (AGRh_max; mg burr h−1), minimum
    hourly AGR (AGRh_min; mg burr h−1), and burr daily shrinkage (SHR; mg burr h−1)
    were also calculated. BNG was calculated as the sum of the hourly recorded instantaneous
    AGR during the 24 h. Maximum AGR and minimum AGR were the maximum and minimum
    instantaneous burr growth rates recorded during the 24 h, respectively. The absolute
    growth rate (AGR, mg day−1) of the burrs was then calculated as follows: AGR =
    (Wt1 - Wt0)/ (t1 - t0); where Wt1 and Wt0 were the burr weights measured on a
    given hour of day (t1) and on the previous recorded hour (t0), respectively. Burr
    daily shrinkage (SHR) was calculated as the difference between the maximum and
    the minimum AGR (AGRh_max - AGRh_min) recorded in the 24h. BNG daily pattern was
    represented throughout the whole season selecting the days characterized by homogeneous
    weather conditions (e.g., similar PAR) and distant at least four days by the last
    rain event. 2.5. Statistical analysis Principal Components Analysis (PCA) were
    performed to highlight which, among the considered factors, appeared to be more
    related to burr hourly and daily growth in different burr phenological stages
    from 15 to 112 DAFB (July, August, September, October). Both the PCA were performed
    with statistical R software (www.rproject), R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01), utilizing
    “FactoMineR” and “factoextra” packages, respectively for data analysis and data
    visualization. Data were standardized and scaled before the analysis to make variables
    comparable and eigenvalues were calculated and ordered to determine the number
    of principal components to be considered in PCA. Vectors indicate the increase
    of the factors in a certain direction while points, based on their spatial position,
    indicate their relation to the factor. Hourly data of AGR, T, P, RH, VPD, WS and
    PAR and daily data of BNG, T, P, RH, VPD, WS, PAR and SHR, were analyzed along
    the entire burr development (from 15 to 112 DAFB). 3. Results 3.1. Weather conditions
    During the burr development period (July-October), the total rainfalls was 140
    mm. July and October were the month with the highest cumulated precipitations
    recorded (52.0 mm) while August the one with the lower amount (17.0 mm) (Fig.
    3). Mean daily temperatures (T) were overall mild, with 23.5, 24.1, 18.5 and 14.8
    °C registered in July, August, September and October, respectively. The mean air
    relative humidity and VPD were 64% and 1.8 kPa in July-August and 77% and 1.4
    kPa in September-October, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (279KB)

    Chestnut burr diameter grew almost steady and linearly throughout the growing
    season till reaching 52.6 mm at 108 DAFB (Fig. 4a), while its fresh weight showed
    an almost constant growth till 56 DAFB (12.4 g) when burr growth rapidly increased
    till burr fall, with a final burr fresh weight of 40.7 g (Fig. 4a). Download :

    Seasonal pattern of burr diameter (mm) and burr weight (g) (mean ± standard deviation).
    (b) Seasonal pattern of burr absolute growth rate in diameter (mm day−1) and weight
    (mm day−1) (mean ± standard deviation). Between 23 and 37 DAFB, burr had the highest
    AGRd of the season, reaching a peak of 0.74 mm burr day−1 at 37 DAFB, when its
    values started to sharply decrease to 0.38 mm burr day−1 at 51 DAFB (Fig. 4b).
    From this date, AGRd slowly increased till 66 DAFB when its values progressively
    decreased till 94 DAFB when a peak of 0.44 mm burr day−1 was registered. At 101
    DAFB, AGRd registered its minimum value (0.17 mm burr day−1) along the entire
    season, followed by a sharp AGRd increase in the last burr measurement (108 DAFB).
    The AGRw increased sharply till 37 DAFB when a peak of 0.40 g burr day−1 was registered
    (Fig. 4b). Except a rapid decrease between 37 and 42 DAFB, AGRw progressively
    increased along the whole season till 94 DAFB, when it was reached the highest
    seasonal value of AGRw (0.70 g burr day−1). Afterwards the AGRw sharply decreased
    to 0.30 g burr day−1 (101 DAFB), reaching 0.50 g burr day−1 at the end of the
    season (108 DAFB). 3.3. Hourly burr absolute growth rate and environmental parameters
    The PCA evidenced that the Principal Component 1 (PC1) explained 47.8% of the
    variance of the results and Principal Component 2 (PC2) explained 17.7%. Night
    hours, especially around 22:00 (pink dots), where the main contributors to hourly
    AGR, while first afternoon hours (i.e., 13:00; light-blue dots) contributed, with
    VPD, T, WS and PAR, against the AGR (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the AGR was positively
    related to RH, showing the highest contribution especially in the early morning
    (7:00–9:00; green dots). During the season the AGRh med registered the lower values
    in July (8.42 mg burr h−1) and August (9.67 mg burr h−1) while rapidly increased,
    almost doubling the values, in September (17.3 mg burr h−1) and October (15.7
    mg burr h−1) (Table 1). The AGRh max instead progressively increased from July
    to October, reaching its maximum in September (106 mg burr h−1). The AGRh min
    registered the more negative values in October (-94.5 mg burr h−1) while the less
    negative one in July (-22.1 mg burr h−1). Burr had the highest shrinkages in September
    (199 mg burr h−1) and October (185 mg burr h−1) but still maintaining a high shrinkage,
    compared to July (67.1 mg burr h−1), also in August (153 mg burr h−1). The burr
    daily net gain was lower than 250 mg burr day−1 both in July and August while
    almost doubled in September (411 mg burr day−1) and October (377 mg burr day−1)
    (Table 1). Table 1. Monthly mean (± SD) values of hourly mean burr absolute growth
    rate (AGRh_mean), minimum burr absolute growth rate (AGRh_min), maximum burr absolute
    growth rate (AGRh_max), burr shrinkage (SHR) and daily burr net growth (BNG).
    3.4. Daily burr growth dynamics Burr showed variations in the cumulated net growth
    during the 24 h depending on the phenological stage (Fig. 6), with periods of
    rapid weight gain, usually recorded in the late evening/ night, followed by periods
    of reduced or even negative growth, between the midday and late afternoon (Fig.
    6). At 16 DAFB, hourly variations in burr cumulated net growth were limited, with
    almost steady conditions during the whole day and with a limited net gain at the
    end of the day (0.06 g burr day−1). As the burr developed, hourly variations in
    burr weight were wider, with more evident shrinkages in the early afternoon and
    swelling during the night (Fig. 6). Together with the increase of the burr shrinkage,
    the burr net daily growth increased, especially in the last period, with a daily
    net gain of about 0.5 g burr day−1 (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image

    positively contributing to BNG, were RH and P (Fig. 7). WS and SHR were the only

    4. Discussion From the burr diametral measurement, the recorded seasonal steady
    growth was confirmed also by Perulli et al. (2020) in the same sweet chestnut
    orchard in 2018 (Fig. 4a). A different behavior was instead showed by burr fresh
    weight where a curve increase was registered at 56 DAFB (15/8) (Fig. 4a). This
    was verified by the AGRw that, contrary to AGRd, started to rapidly increase at
    56 DAFB till almost the burr fall, where the reduced AGRw could be likely inferred
    to the nut pericarp and integument hardening and browning, that normally takes
    place in that period (personal communication) (Fig. 4b). The AGRd instead showed
    the highest values at the beginning of burr development while progressively reducing
    its diametral growth rate along the season. A similar AGRd decreasing pattern
    was showed, in two consecutive seasons (2017 and 2018), also by Perulli et al.
    2020. The different pattern of AGRd and AGRw, highlight that in the first part
    of burr development, burr is enlarging its size, likely being in cell division
    stage, while from 56 DAFB, burr start to expand and to accumulate starch in the
    nuts, thus explaining its rapid increase in fresh weight (Chen et al., 2017).
    A similar behavior was also documented for other fruits (e.g., peaches) that appear
    to slow their diametral growth towards harvest although still growing at their
    maximum rate when fresh weight is considered (Corelli-Grappadelli et al., 2004).
    These data were confirmed also by the real-time data acquired with fruit gauges.
    Indeed, the AGRh_mean almost double its values in the month of September (17.3
    mg burr h−1) and October (15.7 mg burr h−1) compared to July (8.42 mg burr h−1)
    and August (9.67 mg burr h−1), indicating an enhancement of the burr development
    in these last growing stages (Table 1). At daily scale, hourly variations in burr
    growth, showed how burr typically swells during the late afternoon and night and
    shrinks around midday-early afternoon, almost independently of the burr developmental
    stage (Fig. 6). The night swelling responded to environmental changes (Fig. 5):
    nocturnal atmosphere humidity was able to positively influence burr rehydration
    (Fig. 5). Although that, burr swelling was probably also related to the cease
    of burr transpiration rate and likely favoured by the daily accumulation of osmotic
    active carbohydrates enhancing, in the night-time, burr turgor pressure, as occurs
    in peach fruit (Morandi et al., 2010). During the day, burr was characterized
    by a strong shrinkage in the early afternoon when the highest values of WS, VPD,
    T and PAR were recorded. These environmental conditions likely enhanced the burr
    transpiration, by the skin surface and by the large amounts of burr live spines,
    with likely xylem inflows not anymore able to match the instantaneous rates of
    burr water losses (Fig. 5). A similar process was displayed by peach fruit, in
    which fruit daily diameter reduction was related to skin transpiration losses,
    enhanced by high VPD (Morandi et al., 2010). At higher AGRh_mean corresponded
    also higher burr net gain in weight (BNG) at the end of the day (Table 1). This
    is especially true in the month of September (0.41 g burr d−1) and October (0.38
    g burr d−1) as the nut growing inside the burr is developing (Chen et al., 2017).
    Together with an increment of daily burr net gain, also the burr shrinkage-swelling
    pattern get intensified during the season, despite the increasingly lower VPD
    recorded in September and October (Fig. 6). This could be likely related to both
    the increased burr surface conductance (data not shown) and burr surface area.
    Furthermore, the high levels of starch, as an osmotically inactive carbohydrate,
    in the last phases of nut development, could intensify the burr daily water losses
    (Chen et al., 2017). Even if the phloem and xylem contributions were not assessed
    in this study, burr exhibited the typical passive fruit growth mechanism, as in
    peach (Morandi et al., 2007), with a likely still fully functional xylem until
    full fall. In this mechanism, the large quantities of water losses through the
    fruit epidermis are the base for achieving the accumulation of soluble solids
    in the fruit and thus for enhancing its net growth (Morandi et al., 2010). The
    BNG, like the hourly AGR, was highly influenced by the external environmental
    parameters in the different burr phenological stages, with T, VPD and PAR playing
    a positive role for BNG in July and August (Fig. 7). The direct PAR stimulation
    on BNG, could be hypothesized to be related to a photosynthetic active process
    occurring also at the burr level (i.e., burr is feeding itself), in a stage when
    the burr carbohydrate demanding is still low. These environmental-related positive
    effects on BNG were probably achieved as the registered mean air temperatures
    in July (23.5 °C) and August (24 °C) and related VPD values were not limiting
    plant physiological performances (Almeida et al., 2007). As the season progressed,
    in September and October the main parameters positively influencing the burr net
    growth were instead precipitations and especially the air relative humidity (Fig.
    7). Concerning the former, literature reported that rains occurring at the end
    of the season were influencing positively the burr growth (Perulli et al., 2020)
    and the nut yield (Gomes-Laranjo et al., 2007; Mota et al., 2018). As for the
    latter (RH), instead, literature data are still missing. The RH positive effect
    on BNG could be explained by an improvement of plant physiological performances
    (e.g., higher carbon fixation) when chestnut trees are subjected to high RH values,
    although a direct RH effect on the burr growth mechanism should not be neglected
    (Figs. 5 and 7). It is known that a suitable atmospheric humidity is among the
    major factor influencing chestnut physiological performances (Araujo-Alves et
    al., 1993; Perulli et al., 2022). Indeed, September and October are the most sensitive
    month for burr growth, as coincide with the nut endosperm filling, with a rapid
    increase in nut fresh weight (Mota et al. 2018b). In this phenological stage,
    burr represents a strong carbohydrate sink for the plant, that if not properly
    directed to the fruit could negatively penalize chestnut yield and quality. 5.
    Conclusion These results helped to characterize the burr seasonal, daily and hourly
    pattern in a sweet chestnut cultivar. Burr showed to have and maintain higher
    burr growing rate in the last part of the season (from middle-end of August to
    full fall). The daily burr growing rate was characterized by progressively increased
    oscillation, along the season, of night-swelling and daily-shrinkage. The night-swelling
    was found to be highly correlated to the nocturnal air relative humidity while
    the daily-shrinkage was correlated to wind speed, PAR, temperature and VPD. The
    burr daily net growth was highly associated, depending on the phenological stages,
    to environmental parameters. Precipitation but especially the atmosphere humidity,
    in September and October, were the main microclimate drivers of burr daily growth.
    These data show that burr growing strategies change based on the phenological
    stages and on the environmental conditions. Based on these results, we conclude
    that, atmosphere humidity plays a fundamental role on burr growth (i.e., nut)
    especially in its last development stages (September and October), suggesting
    rational orchard management practices as a late season grass mowing for preserving,
    as long as possible, a higher atmosphere relative humidity in the chestnut microclimate.
    For those orchards that possess enough water availability to irrigate, an under-canopy
    sprinkler irrigation could be likely the best irrigation management solution to
    rationally increase orchard air relative humidity and thus to enhance burr net
    growth and thus orchard productivity. These practices, together with the adoption
    of plant-based sensor (e.g., fruit gouges), could help to precisely manage, in
    real time, irrigation application based on the burr daily growth rate responses.
    These strategies would better improve chestnut orchard management and counteract
    the climate change effects. CRediT authorship contribution statement Giulio Demetrio

    1. Introduction Agriculture is a vital sector that supports the world''s growing
    population and provides essential resources for our daily lives. However, traditional
    farming practices are increasingly unsustainable due to population growth, climate
    change, and resource constraints. To address these challenges, a novel approach
    has emerged that leverages advanced technologies and AI-enabled IoT applications
    in high-tech agriculture. This approach combines the power of artificial intelligence,
    the internet of things, and precision agriculture techniques to optimize crop
    production, reduce environmental impacts, and enhance resource management. By
    incorporating sensors, drones, robotics, and machine learning algorithms, farmers
    can obtain real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other key
    parameters, allowing them to make informed decisions on irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest management. This approach has enormous potential to revolutionize traditional
    farming practices and enable farmers to achieve higher yields, better crop quality,
    and improved profitability. This article will explore the benefits and future
    scope of using advanced technologies and AI-enabled IoT applications in high-tech
    agriculture. 1.1 Agriculture Agriculture is the practice of cultivating land,
    raising animals, and producing food, fiber, and other products. It is the foundation
    of human civilization, and it has been practiced for thousands of years. Agriculture
    involves a variety of activities, including planting and harvesting crops, raising
    livestock, and managing natural resources such as soil and water. Modern agriculture
    has become highly specialized and is often associated with large-scale farming
    operations that use advanced technologies, such as genetically modified crops,
    precision irrigation systems, and automated machinery. However, small-scale and
    traditional farming practices are still prevalent in many parts of the world.
    Agriculture is essential for food security and the sustainable development of
    communities. It also plays a vital role in the global economy, providing employment
    opportunities and contributing to international trade. However, modern agricultural
    practices can have negative impacts on the environment, such as soil erosion,
    water pollution, and the destruction of natural habitats. As such, sustainable
    agriculture is increasingly being promoted to ensure that the world''s agricultural
    systems are both productive and environmentally sound. Continue Reading References

    full text. Full Text Preview Introduction The world''s population is projected
    to increase dramatically by 2050, reaching 8.7 billion people, up from 6.9 billion
    in 2016. People are adding more protein to their diets as a result of an increase
    in wealth. According to a study from the United Nations'' Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO), agriculturists should boost their output by 65% above present
    levels. To feed the expanding global population, food producers must increase
    their output. The demand for food will rise by about 50% as compared to 2013 with
    the population increase. Urbanization (Mall, P. K. et al., 2023) growth is predicted
    to increase another 2.4 billion people live in urban areas. Even if there is a
    growing need for food, growing urbanization reduces the number of people residing
    in village regions, which results in a shrinking agricultural workforce. In addition,
    rural residents are quickly ageing, which will result in a severe manpower shortage
    in the future. The world''s agriculture is becoming unsustainable as a result
    of population development and urbanization, and 25% of the world''s arable land
    is already damaged. Nearly 40% of the world''s rural population experiences water
    shortages, indicating that water resources are already at an extreme level of
    use. To increase production, unbalanced fertilizers are utilized, which affects
    the amount of soil nutrients. The major soil nutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus
    (P), and potassium (K), whereas iron, manganese, zinc, boron, and chlorine are
    the insignificant ones. The development of the plant and excellent yields depend
    on the proper balance of these nutrients. Amino acids are produced by macronutrients
    like nitrogen, whereas phosphorus and potassium aid in the development of plant
    growths, photosynthesis, and disease resistance. Due to improper irrigation timing
    and unbalanced fertilizer application without knowledge of a certain crop''s real
    nutritional needs, soil fertility is reduced. With advancements in science and
    technology, agriculture''s traditional methods are changing. Technology in agriculture
    advances, responds to customers'' genuine needs, and maintains the balance between
    supply and demand for food. Because of the advancements in automation like sensors,
    gadgets, equipment, information technologies, and quick transmission networks,
    modern farms and agricultural operations operate differently. Robots (Alam, A.,
    2022), sensors, aerial photographs, and GPS (Samanta, D. et al., 2021) technology
    are all used. Modern technology helps farmers to utilize water, fertilizers, and
    other resources efficiently. The efficiency and production of agriculture are
    predicted to rise with technological advancements as larger and miniature farmlands
    are closing and becoming more integrated in comparison with earlier years. Data
    collection is crucial for identifying trends, and it is anticipated that there
    would be 4 million more data points than on a typical farm. The IoT (Reepu, S.
    Kumar, et. al., 2023) enables the analysis of both structured and unstructured
    data to provide additional information about food production (Kumari, M., et al.,
    2022). IoT platforms are converting agricultural frameworks into true AI frameworks
    by using machine learning, AI, etc. to data from field sensors (Ghosh, R. et al.,
    2020). Farmers may make better judgments by studying and connecting data on the
    weather, seeds, soil, disease likelihood, and insect assaults. Continue Reading

    resistor 1. Introduction and Background Agriculture is one of the most important
    sectors of the economy and plays a crucial role in providing food to the world’s
    population. With the growing demand for food and shrinking fertile land, precision
    agriculture has become a necessity to improve the yield and quality of crops.
    One of the key factors that impacts agricultural productivity is weather conditions.
    Remote weather monitoring systems are increasingly being used to monitor environmental
    conditions and provide real-time data to farmers to make informed decisions. In
    this context, the development of a solar tracking system for remote weather monitoring
    in agriculture can have a significant impact, improving agricultural productivity
    while also reducing the dependence on traditional power sources. In the current
    age of technology, energy is a crucial topic of discussion, and renewable energy
    sources such as lunar, thermal, vibration, and wind energies are gaining increasing
    interest. Since the cost of electricity is increasing every year, renewable energy
    is considered the best source of energy. However, renewable energy sources are
    difficult to predict, making it challenging to optimize their production and consumption
    [1]. A cost-effective energy solution is required to balance supply and demand.
    Energy storage is becoming increasingly important, and the market for solar energy
    harvesting is growing rapidly. Ambient energy sources, e.g., solar energy, play
    an important role in monitoring human activities in the last decade and cannot
    be underestimated. Over the years, the introduction of energy management schemes
    that seek to prolong the lifetime of the sensor node and the overall network have
    been proposed, but the amount of energy required by the sensors to be operational
    all the time remains a challenge [2,3]. Solar energy has gained tremendous attention
    in recent years due to various reasons such as the fluctuating price of crude
    oil, public awareness of environmental issues, supporting policies and subsidies
    enacted by local governments to boost renewable energy sectors, the price reduction
    of photovoltaic (PV) panels, etc. Many large-scale solar farms have been commissioned
    in the US, Europe, and China, as the global PV price has been dropping rapidly
    in recent years, which is in agreement with Swanson’s law [4]. However, PV-generated
    electricity is not competitive enough compared to fossil fuels (oil, gas, and
    coal), especially in urban areas. Hence, more extensive research and development
    on PV cell material science is required to overcome the conversion efficiency
    hurdle and reduce manufacturing costs. Meanwhile, several approaches other than
    exploring new materials for PV cells have been proposed. For instance, a concentrated
    photovoltaic (CPV) system was designed to concentrate large amounts of sunlight
    into PV cells [4,5]. Similarly, a maximum power point tracker can draw maximum
    power by tracking and operating on the maximum power point of the PV arrays [6],
    and solar tracking can enable a maximized power captured from the sun by following
    the sun path [7]. These methods can increase the energy production of PV to various
    degrees of success. Above all, solar tracking poses a great advantage to enhance
    the PV system efficiency as compared to a static solar system [8]. A dual-axis
    solar tracker (DAS) is a type of solar tracker with two rotational axes, which
    always enable it to align the PV panels and point directly towards the solar disk  [9,10].
    Solar irradiance (W/m 2 ) is a measure of the amount of sunlight that falls on
    a surface. It is the most fundamental factor in determining the performance of
    a PV panel to be underestimated. Over the years, the introduction of energy management
    schemes has led to many efficient approaches [11]. A single-axis system may require
    more space to accommodate the solar panels and collects energy along one axis,
    which reduces its efficiency. A dual-axis solar tracking system is designed to
    follow the sun and optimize the amount of sunlight collected by PV cells. The
    system follows the sun’s movement in both the horizontal and vertical planes,
    from east to west and north to south, respectively. It is widely used in the agricultural
    field to optimize the amount of collected solar energy, thereby increasing the
    efficiency of the system. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are making a huge impact
    among emerging technologies [12]. WSNs have consistently ranked highly in this
    field of research for over a decade [13]. Since the system is WSN-based, the term
    quality of service (QoS) is defined as the network’s assurance to fulfill the
    desired services for an individual, including delay and other parameters. To meet
    the QoS requirements, the optimal path between the source and destination needs
    to be located, and other components for QoS are resources, request, response,
    and reservation [14]. The authors [15] conducted a study that explored the primary
    parameters of QoS which include delay, loss, jitter, and latency. However, extending
    QoS to WSNs faces several challenges due to features such as mobility, radio channel
    frequency, and battery issues [9]. Numerous research institutes have worked in
    this field and developed research projects that have made significant advancements
    in all aspects, including hardware, software, design, and standard applications
    [16]. WSNs are special-purpose equipment that gather information from the physical
    world and transmit it to users and applications, such as environmental monitoring,
    military operations, agriculture, and energy efficiency [17]. As energy is crucial
    to power various operations and applications, relying solely on electricity is
    not always a cost-effective solution. Renewable energy production, on the other
    hand, provides a better alternative for such requirements [18]. One type of energy
    collection system is the solar harvesting system, which converts heat into energy
    [19]. Intensive research has led to the optimization of QoS for solar systems.
    The main aim is to explore new developments and interests in this field [20].
    Energy collection systems are used to gather strength from background resources.
    The energy harvesting system produces power that can be utilized for various applications
    [21]. The equation for converting heat into electrical energy in a solar harvesting
    system [22] is 𝑃=𝜂𝐴𝐺∗𝐹𝐹 (1) where P is the electrical power output, 𝜂 is the conversion
    efficiency, A is the solar panel area, G is the solar irradiance, and 𝐹𝐹 is the
    fill factor of the solar cells. The formula for calculating Quality of Service
    ( 𝑄𝑜𝑆 ) in a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) [17] is 𝑄𝑜𝑆=(1−𝛼)∗𝑅+𝛼∗𝐶 (2) where R
    is the reliability, C is the coverage, and 𝛼 is the weight given to each parameter.
    The formula for calculating delay in a WSN [13] is 𝐷𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦= 𝑇 𝑒𝑛𝑑 − 𝑇 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 − 𝑡
    𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 − 𝑡 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑢𝑒 − 𝑡 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 − 𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 (3) where 𝑇 𝑒𝑛𝑑 is the time when the packet
    is received, 𝑇 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 is the time when the packet is sent, 𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 is the processing
    time, 𝑡 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑢𝑒 is the queuing delay, 𝑡 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 is the transmission delay, and 𝑡 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝
    is the propagation delay. The equation for estimating solar irradiance on a tilted
    surface [18] is 𝐺= 𝐺 𝑏 ∗𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃)+ 𝐺 𝑑 ∗ (1+𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜃)) 2 + 𝐺 𝑟 ∗ (1+𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡(𝜃)) 2 (4) where
    𝐺 𝑏 is the beam irradiance, 𝐺 𝑑 is the diffuse irradiance, 𝐺 𝑟 is the reflected
    irradiance, and 𝜃 is the angle of incidence of the sun on the tilted surface.
    Solar-based energy tracking systems are proving to be fruitful for various industries,
    providing more output than other types of systems. It is expected that solar tracking
    systems will be the best systems for energy sources in the future, with their
    output efficiency depending on the tracking method used and weather conditions
    [23]. Energy harvesting technologies are the best option to fulfill the needs
    of different fields [24]. Energy harvesting is defined as a technique that is
    used to capture, harvest, and gather unused resources of natural energy such as
    energy produced from the sun, wind, ocean, etc. These natural resources are big
    energy sources and can provide large-scale harvested energy [25]. The energy harvesting
    system consists of four main parts, namely, harvester, energy collector, power
    manager or conditioning circuit, and energy storage unit [26]. As a result, several
    energy harvesting, energy optimization, and distribution approaches have been
    designed recently. In [27], the authors developed a particle swarm optimization
    (PSO), which is modeled after the social behavior of animals such as fish schooling
    and birds flocking. This approach employs a swarm of artificial agents or particles,
    and each agent’s motion is influenced by three factors. It involves separation,
    where agents maintain a safe distance; alignment, where each agent moves toward
    the average behavior of the swarm; and cohesion, where each agent moves toward
    the average behavior of its neighbors. Several unused ambient energy resources
    are available that can be utilized for energy harvesting. These energy resources
    are enough to meet our energy needs and there is no need for extra resources such
    as burning fossil fuels to rotate turbines to produce energy [28]. Environmental
    resources are renewable and can exist for a longer period. Different experiments
    have been performed to find energy resources that could be produced from natural
    resources [29]. The study [30] increased the overall efficiency of the energy
    harvesting system in WSN using maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques
    coupled with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithm. Simulations for
    the system were run using Matlab 2021b. After a successful simulation, a testbed
    was built to verify the results. An AI neural network algorithm was deployed to
    obtain solutions to problems that are hard to solve using common methods such
    as pattern matching, computer vision, design identification, speech credit, classification,
    and control system. Neural network models are similar to learning algorithms,
    but may vary in terms of rules, parameters, weights, and network structures [31].
    The study [32] designed an energy management scheme using a trio energy management
    scheme for harvesting, transferring, and conserving energy. This maintained the
    network lifetime to make it more operation and efficient. However, the cost of
    experimentation, testbed installation, and simulation tools were expensive. Similarly,
    Ref. [33] presented an MPPT-based energy harvesting scheme using a perturbation-based
    micro-solar approach. Results indicated increased efficiency with lower overhead.
    The authors presented an ambient-energy-based solution for WSN networks in [34].
    The authors employed a pulse width modulation scheme and MPPT approach to increase
    the efficiency of the system by 87%. The study [35] created a method for selecting
    optimal parameters of the PSO by considering the topology and parameters of the
    DC–DC converter and other configuration settings of solar panels. The parameters
    of a buck converter connected to a battery were estimated using the newly proposed
    approach. The authors used weaseled, distributed cluster head re-selection and
    polynomial time-scheduling algorithms for that purpose. The outcomes indicated
    that improved performance can be obtained with reduced battery depletion. To address
    these challenges, we present the proposed model outlined in the following section.
    Table 1 provides an overview of existing works in this field. Table 1. Comparative
    analysis of various state-of-the-art approaches. In this paper, we have provided
    a solar energy harvesting scheme that, when fully implemented, reduces the issues
    of limited energy. The main source of solar power is the sun, which can be used
    to obtain solar energy. The sun’s rays strike the earth, delivering 174,000 terawatts
    of energy, which can be used for our needs. This alone makes the solar panel the
    best choice for a renewable energy source—according to the United Nations Development
    Program in 2000, if we can harness the full power of the sun’s rays coming to
    Earth, we can create 1575 to 49,837 Joules of energy, which is far greater than
    the world’s needs. However, the problem lies in the solar panel, i.e., that the
    technology behind the solar panel is not efficient enough to fully harness this
    abundant energy. Thus, to make the soar panel more efficient, we created a movable
    solar panel that can adjust its position regarding the sun’s current position
    to obtain the optimal sunlight. In addition to energy maximization, the proposed
    system can also give parameters such as humidity, temperature, and air quality
    from the remote agricultural fields onto the mobile app, which can greatly facilitate
    the farmers to make informed decisions. The main contributions of this research
    study are as follows: To improve the efficiency of solar panels, the paper proposes
    a solar tracking system with dual axes that can move to adjust its position. The
    solar tracking system aims to maximize energy generation by optimizing the orientation
    of the solar panels; The proposed system not only maximizes energy but also provides
    additional parameters such as humidity, temperature, and air quality from remote
    agricultural fields; The collected parameters can be accessed through a mobile
    app, making it easier fo farmers to monitor and manage their agricultural activities.
    The implementation of the proposed system shows enhanced energy generation and
    provides valuable data for agricultural purposes. The article is structured as
    follows. Section 2 presents the proposed approach. Results are discussed in Section
    3. At the end, Section 4 provides the conclusion. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.
    Proposed Model The block diagram of the proposed system is illustrated in Figure
    1. The diagram illustrates that the values from the LDRs are sent to the Arduino’s
    microcontroller (Arduino, Somerville, MA, USA), then the difference between the
    values is calculated. Based on the results, the relevant motor then moves to make
    the PV perpendicular to the sun and this process will repeat itself throughout
    the day. Here, sun position can be calculated from the sun position algorithm
    and panel position can be calculated from angle sensors connected to the tracker.
    Here, the sun position and PV panel position are both given as inputs to the microcontroller,
    which rotates the panel to an exact position through the DC motor with the help
    of the motor driver and relay. For measuring temperature and humidity, we used
    the DHT11 sensor (AOSONG Electronics, Guangzhou, China) and, for air quality,
    we used the MQ135 sensor (Winsen Sensor, Zhengzhou, China). The sensors measure
    the value and send it to the WiFi module; the WiFi module then sends the value
    to the real-time database, which is then shown on the app with their graphical
    representation. Figure 1. Block diagram of the proposed model. The testbed was
    developed to test the solar tracker and functionality of weather monitor sensors
    such as the temperature sensor and gas sensor, as shown in Figure 2. We used DHT11
    as the temperature and humidity sensor and MQ135 as the gas sensor, which was
    used to measure CO 2 in the air. The solar tracker used LDRs to measure sun luminosity
    and give a value based on it. The values were then collected and averages were
    taken to decide in which direction the solar panel would rotate. The power produced
    by it was then used to power the sensor, whose value could be seen on the laptop
    on an Arduino serial monitor and sent to the cloud for further monitoring and
    use. Specifications of the testbed are shown in Table 2. Figure 2. Experimental
    setup. Table 2. Testbed specifications. The system was comprised of several sensors
    which are briefly described here. 2.1.1. DHT11 Sensor The DHT11 is a basic digital
    temperature and humidity sensor. It provides a digital output representing temperature
    and humidity values. The power requirements for the DHT11 sensor are as follows:  Operating
    Voltage: 3.3 V to 5 V (typically powered with 5 V for most applications);  Operating
    Current: Around 2.5 mA to 3 mA during data acquisition;  Standby Current: Minimal
    standby power consumption. It is important to note that the DHT11 does not have
    advanced power-saving features, and it draws a consistent current during data
    acquisition. When using the sensor in battery-powered projects, it is advisable
    to keep the power consumption in mind to optimize battery life. 2.1.2. MQ135 Sensor
    The MQ135 is a gas sensor primarily used to measure air quality and detect various
    harmful gases like NH 3 , NO x , alcohol, benzene, smoke, and CO 2 . The power
    requirements for the MQ135 sensor are as follows:  Operating Voltage: 5 V (typically
    powered with 5 V for most applications);  Heater Power: The MQ135 sensor requires
    a preheat time to stabilize readings. It has an internal heater element that consumes
    around 120 mA to 150 mA during the preheating phase;  Operating Current: After
    preheating, the operating current drops to around 40 mA during gas sensing;  Standby
    Current: Minimal standby power consumption after preheating. The daily electrical
    load schedule is given in Table 3, while yearly analysis on the solar panel is
    carried out in the following sections. Table 3. Daily electrical load schedule.
    2.1.3. Sensor and Actuator Accuracy and Ranges DHT11 Temperature Sensor: Accuracy:
    ±2  ∘ C; Measurement range: 0  ∘ C to 50  ∘ C. DHT11 Humidity Sensor: Accuracy:
    ±5%; Measurement range: 20% to 90% RH. MQ135 Air Quality Sensor: Accuracy: ±10%;
    Measurement range: 0 to 1000 ppm CO 2 . LDR Light Sensors: Accuracy: ±10%; Measurement
    range: 0 to 1000 lux. DC Motors: Position accuracy: ±1%; Speed control accuracy:
    ±5%. 2.2. Proposed Artificial Neural Network A neural network model is very efficient
    to solve complex problems. In this research, an artificial neural network (ANN)
    was deployed to resolve the problem of optimizing the quality of the harvesting
    system, in which we needed to determine the existing pattern and compare it with
    new results. The gaps in existing results could be found using the backpropagation
    neural network technique. ANN is composed of interconnected elements called neurons,
    which compute values from input and give the necessary output to solve complex
    problems. In this project, the ANN model is deployed to investigate the energy
    harvesting system for the alternative prediction in comparison to the input function
    to obtain better efficiency and optimization. Backpropagation was used for the
    training of ANN, in which neurons were trained according to a given pattern. Proper
    training of neurons ensures the lowest error rate. Backpropagation is a learning
    algorithm that is mainly used by a multilayer perceptron. In this type of technique,
    results or outputs are compared with given values. The learning procedure adjusts
    the links between layers to optimize output. The main reason to select this method
    was its ability to perform a specific task or solve problems, i.e., it is required
    to train a model with certain data. The network was trained based on specific
    values, which improved with time using the backpropagation algorithm. At the start,
    weight distributions were random, and prediction was also random. Then, after
    a specific interval of time, the optimization step was completed by comparing
    the output with the output values which were already known. 2.3. Power of the
    Measuring System The power consumption of a measuring system depends on several
    factors, including the number of sensors, data transmission frequency, data processing
    components, and power management efficiency. A brief overview is provided in Table
    4. Table 4. Components and their corresponding power consumption. 2.4. Algorithm
    for QoS Optimization The sun position algorithm was used to determine the position
    of the sun at a given time for a specific location, using Algorithm 1. The position
    of the sun relative to the earth is affected by the revolution and rotation of
    the earth. Therefore, the sun’s position depends on the time, date, and geographic
    location: longitude (0 to 180 ∘ ) and latitude (0 to ±90 ∘ ). The position of
    the sun was calculated by universal time. World time and daily time were based
    on universal time. The metric T was the difference between two-time scales: Δ𝑇=𝑇𝐷−𝑈𝑇

    Results To evaluate the performance of our model and algorithm, we conducted various
    experiments. The results of these experiments are presented in the following sections.
    3.1. System Efficiency We must compare the power provided by the sun to the electricity
    generated in order to determine the efficiency of the panel. A panel would be
    100% efficient if it could convert all of the light that struck it into energy.
    Unfortunately, achieving such efficiency is impossible. We used the following
    equation to analyze the efficiency of the proposed system (the length and width
    of the panel are given in meters (m)): 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦= 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 (𝑘𝑊) 𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ×𝑃𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑙𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ×𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒
    ×100 (6) 3.2. Daily Analysis Different experiments were carried out in the spring
    season to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Table 5 shows the
    average values of different experiments. These values then can be used by the
    farmers for making further decisions. These real-time data on weather parameters
    such as temperature, humidity, etc. can help farmers make informed decisions on
    irrigation, pest control, and other crop management practices. Table 5. Average
    value of different experiments. Table 5 shows the average values across multiple
    test days, rather than being tied to a specific date. The metrics such as temperature,
    humidity, and air quality were averaged across several experiments. Even without
    the specific dates, these data can still provide some useful insights: The temperature
    range and fluctuations give an indication of typical conditions that may be experienced.
    This could help with system design considerations; The humidity and air quality
    averages establish baseline levels for the location. This is valuable reference
    information; The diurnal temperature profile shows the temperature variation over
    a 24 h cycle. This can inform solar energy generation modeling; The values then
    can be used by the farmers for making further decisions. These real-time data
    on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, etc. can help farmers make
    informed decisions on irrigation, pest control, and other crop management practices.
    Figure 3 provides a graph representing temperature values obtained from a temperature
    sensor installed on the system. The temperature data were recorded at regular
    intervals, typically hourly. These recorded values can be utilized by farmers
    for various purposes. Upon observing the graph, it becomes apparent that the temperature
    fluctuates within specific ranges throughout the day. By glancing at the graph,
    one can easily identify the highest and lowest temperature points. Figure 3. Day
    1 temperature analysis graph. On day 1, as shown in Figure 4, the humidity demonstrated
    a rising trend as the day progressed. This indicates that the humidity levels
    increase gradually over time. Simultaneously, the carbon dioxide levels showed
    a decreasing trend, suggesting a decline in the concentration of carbon dioxide
    in the environment. Thus, the graph illustrates the trend of humidity increasing
    as the day progresses, while the levels of carbon dioxide decrease. The temperature
    readings generally remained within a favorable range. However, there was a spike
    in temperature at some point, which can be attributed to irregularities in the
    sensors used for measurement. Figure 4. Day 1 humidity analysis graph. In the
    results for experiment 2, shown in Figure 5, a similar trend is observed, with
    the graphs displaying small variations in values. The temperature readings ranged
    between 25 and 35 degrees, indicating a relatively stable temperature range. The
    temperature graph shows that the temperature remained within a favorable range
    of 25 to 30 degrees Celsius throughout the day. This consistent temperature level
    suggests stable conditions. However, it is important to note that there was a
    spike in temperature at some point, which can be attributed to irregularities
    or inaccuracies in the sensors used to measure temperature. Overall, the observed
    trends on day 1 indicate increasing humidity, decreasing carbon dioxide levels,
    and a stable temperature within a desirable range. The irregular temperature spike
    should be considered with caution due to potential sensor inaccuracies. Figure
    5. Day 2 temperature analysis graph. Figure 6 shows that the humidity values fluctuated
    within a narrow range of 55 to 57 points. This suggests a consistent level of
    humidity throughout the experiment. The close proximity of the temperature and
    humidity values implies a potential correlation between these two variables. The
    similarity in trends between experiment 1 and experiment 2 may indicate that the
    factors influencing temperature and humidity remain relatively constant or have
    similar patterns during both experiments. It is worth noting that further analysis
    and data collection would be necessary to determine the significance and implications
    of these observations accurately. Figure 6. Day 2 humidity analysis graph. On
    day 3, as shown in Figure 7, a similar trend to the previous days was observed.
    The temperature graph indicates that the temperature ranged between 23 and 26
    degrees Celsius, with small variations within this range. Similarly, the humidity
    values fluctuated between 51 and 65 points, suggesting relatively stable humidity
    levels. The consistency in the trends of temperature and humidity between day
    1, day 2, and day 3 may indicate a continued pattern or stable environmental conditions
    during this period. Figure 7. Day 3 temperature analysis graph. On day 3 as shown
    in Figure 8, the humidity demonstrated a rising trend as the day progressed. This
    indicates that the humidity levels increase gradually over time. Simultaneously,
    the carbon dioxide levels showed a decreasing trend, suggesting a decline in the
    concentration of carbon dioxide in the environment. Figure 8. Day 3 humidity analysis
    graph. In experiment 4, as shown in Figure 9, a distinct trend was observed, where
    the temperature increased as the day progressed, indicating hotter days. The temperature
    readings staredt at 20 degrees and gradually rose to 35 degrees. This trend aligns
    with scientific understanding, as temperatures tend to increase during the daytime
    due to factors such as solar radiation and atmospheric conditions. Additionally,
    it is noted that the nights were colder, suggesting a drop in temperature during
    nighttime hours. This is a common occurrence, as heat is radiated back into the
    atmosphere during the night, resulting in cooler temperatures. Furthermore, the
    maximum temperature recorded during the day reaches a high, indicating a particularly
    hot day during the course of the experiment. Figure 9. Day 4 temperature analysis
    graph. The provided graphs, as shown in Figure 10, represent humidity values and
    air quality values obtained from a temperature sensor placed in a system. The
    humidity values were recorded per minute, while the air quality values specifically
    measured carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels and were also recorded per minute. These
    values were collected at regular intervals and can be utilized by farmers for
    various purposes. In the humidity graph, it can be observed that there were fluctuations
    in humidity levels. Notably, when water was sprinkled or introduced into the system,
    the humidity level varied accordingly. This suggests that the addition of water
    affects the humidity levels, which can be valuable information for farmers in
    determining irrigation or moisture management strategies. Figure 10. Day 1 air
    quality analysis graph. In the air quality graph, the values represent the concentration
    of carbon dioxide in the air. It is evident that the CO 2 levels varied over time,
    and there were distinct increases in value when plants released carbon dioxide.
    This information can be beneficial for farmers to monitor the health and growth
    of plants and potentially adjust ventilation or other environmental factors to
    optimize plant growth. The availability of real-time humidity and air quality
    data can assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding irrigation, moisture
    control, and environmental management practices, ultimately improving agricultural
    productivity and plant health. In the air quality graph, as shown in Figure 11,
    the values represent the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air. It is evident
    that the CO 2 levels varied over time, and there were distinct increases in value
    when plants released carbon dioxide. This information can be beneficial for farmers
    to monitor the health and growth of plants and potentially adjust ventilation
    or other environmental factors to optimize plant growth. Figure 11. Day 2 air
    quality analysis graph. 3.3. Annual Analysis Based on the results obtained from
    various systems observed over the course of a year, it has been found that the
    dual-axis system exhibited the highest output efficiency, specifically measuring
    98.7%. In comparison, the horizontal-axis system achieved an output efficiency
    of 98.2%, while the vertical-axis system achieved an output efficiency of 98.3%,
    both with a sloped angle. These output efficiency values indicate the effectiveness
    of each system in converting irradiance (solar energy) into usable output. The
    higher the output efficiency, the more effectively the system is able to harness
    solar energy and convert it into usable forms such as electricity or heat. To
    further understand the context and implications of these findings, the irradiance
    values are provided. Irradiance refers to the power per unit area received from
    the sun, typically measured in Watts per square meter. Figure 12 presents the
    likely variations in irradiance throughout the year, which can help explain the
    differences in output efficiency observed across the different systems. By analyzing
    the irradiance values and correlating them with the system’s output efficiency,
    it becomes possible to gain insights into how solar energy availability and intensity
    impact the performance of each system. Figure 12. Irradiance values. In Figure
    12, the graph displays the values of irradiance generated from a simulation over
    a one-year time period. The graph likely shows the variations in irradiance levels
    throughout different seasons or months of the year. The purpose of this comparison
    is to evaluate the performance of a simple harvesting system that lacks a tracking
    feature. It is observed that the simple system, without tracking, is unable to
    capture the full irradiance available. As a result, the system experiences lower
    output power compared to the simulated values of irradiance. The comparison of
    the difference in performance of different components is provided in Table 6.
    Table 6. Production efficiency of different components. The comparison between
    the simulated irradiance values and the performance of the simple system highlights
    the importance of tracking features in maximizing the capture of solar energy.
    Tracking systems are designed to align solar panels or collectors with the direction
    of the sun, optimizing the absorption of sunlight and increasing output efficiency.
    The lower output power of the simple system underscores the potential benefits
    of implementing more advanced tracking systems, such as dual-axis or other sophisticated
    tracking mechanisms. These systems can adjust their position to follow the sun’s
    path, ensuring optimal exposure to irradiance and maximizing the energy harvested
    from solar sources. This comparison serves as evidence supporting the use of tracking
    systems for enhancing the performance and output power of solar harvesting systems.
    In the provided figure, it is documented that the dual-axis tracking system has
    demonstrated the capability to capture the highest amount of sunlight or sun rays
    throughout the year. The graph likely depicts the irradiance values or solar energy
    received by the dual-axis tracking system over different time periods. Furthermore,
    a comparison was made between the horizontal system and the dual-axis tracking
    system, as shown in Figure 13. It is observed that the horizontal system, which
    is a fixed system without any tracking capability, exhibits a consistent and linear
    line over the entire year on the graph. This implies that the horizontal system
    does not adjust its position to track the movement of the sun. In contrast, the
    dual-axis tracking system, which has the ability to adjust its position both horizontally
    and vertically to track the sun’s movement, shows more variability in irradiance
    values over the year. This indicates that the dual-axis tracking system is able
    to align itself optimally with the sun’s position, maximizing the capture of sunlight
    and resulting in higher irradiance levels compared to the fixed horizontal system.
    Figure 13. Irradiance values. The comparison between the two systems further emphasizes
    the advantages of incorporating tracking capabilities in solar harvesting systems.
    By tracking the sun’s movement throughout the day and year, the dual-axis system
    can consistently optimize its orientation and capture a higher amount of sunlight,
    leading to increased irradiance and potentially higher energy output. These findings
    highlight the importance of considering tracking systems, such as the dual-axis
    system, for maximizing solar energy utilization and enhancing the performance
    of solar harvesting systems. 3.4. Performance of Artificial Neural Network The
    best validation performance is described with the help of Figure 14, in which
    the system’s performance is explained after running an ANN simulation. Results
    obtained after simulation showed that performance remains stable at the same value
    but, without using this, it may decrease over time. In Figure 14, the histogram
    shows that there were many faults but, after using the ANN technique, quality
    increased. Figure 14. Validation performance of ANN. The best validation performance
    is 0.024918 at epoch 416. A neural network was proposed to optimize the system’s
    efficiency. It contained different layers—3, 10, and 15 layers and neurons were
    used to obtain an optimal architecture. The data were split into train, test,
    and validation sets. The training process proceeded, provided that the system
    continuously enhanced the authentication established. The test pair offered an
    autonomous way of measuring network precision completely. The final architecture
    of ANN contained 3 hidden layers, each with 10 neurons, while the output had 3
    possibilities. This structure provided the best functionality in classification
    among all examined architectures. The number of epochs used for training the ANN
    was 500; however, the best results were obtained at 416 epochs. A histogram analysis
    of ANN is shown in Figure 15. For training ANN, there were three algorithms: Figure
    15. Error histogram for ANN. Levenberg–Marquardt; Bayesian Regularization; Scaled
    Conjugate Gradient. The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm consumes more memory, but,
    positively, it takes less time. Training automatically halts when there is no
    further improvement in generalization. This algorithm was chosen for simulation.
    In the Bayesian regularization procedure, more time is consumed but the output
    is satisfactory, even for datasets which are small, noisy, or difficult. The process
    stops with weight minimization. A scaled conjugate gradient algorithm does not
    use more memory. It stops when there is no further improvement, which is identified
    by increasing the value of the mean square fault of a sample. 3.5. Important Characteristics
    of the Proposed Approach The approach presented in this paper improves the existing
    system in several ways: Improved Efficiency: The main objective of this research
    is to enhance the efficiency of solar panels in providing constant power to sensors
    in agricultural fields. By implementing a solar tracking system that changes its
    direction in two axes based on the sun’s position, the proposed approach optimizes
    the orientation of the solar panels for maximum energy generation; Real-time Data
    Collection: In addition to energy maximization, the proposed system also focuses
    on collecting real-time data on weather parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    and rainfall. These data can be used by farmers to make informed decisions regarding
    irrigation, pest control, and other crop management practices. The collected data
    are transferred to a mobile app, making it easier for farmers to access and utilize
    the information; Hardware Experimental Setup: A testbed with a hardware experimental
    setup is designed to evaluate the system’s capability to track the sun effectively.
    This allows for practical testing and validation of the proposed approach; Integration
    of AI Techniques: The research incorporates AI techniques along with a QoS algorithm
    to improve the quality of service provided by the existing system. This integration
    enhances the overall performance and functionality of the system; Improved Results:
    The research demonstrates that the proposed system leads to a relative increase
    in efficiency of up to 52% compared to the existing system. These improved results
    highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing energy generation
    and providing valuable data for agricultural purposes. In summary, the approach
    presented in this paper introduces a solar tracking system that enhances the efficiency
    of solar panels, collects real-time weather data, incorporates AI techniques,
    and achieves significant improvements in performance compared to the existing
    system. 3.6. Limitations and Future Work The yearly energy efficiency results
    show that the values for dual-axis (98.7%), single-axis (98.2%), and fixed tilt
    (98.3%) are very close, and these small differences may not justify the added
    complexity and cost of dual-axis tracking. A fixed tilt system is likely much
    cheaper and simpler than a dual-axis tracker. The paper could have included estimated
    system costs and discussed whether the fractional efficiency gain of the dual-axis
    justifies the expense. A detailed cost–benefit analysis would strengthen these
    results in the future. Similarly, highlighting the economic trade-offs and costs,
    not just the technical efficiency gains, would give a more complete picture, but
    this research focused on the technical capabilities of the dual-axis tracking
    system to optimize energy yield. Dual-axis tracking is a known technique, and
    the novelty lies in the application focus. The lack of economic analysis makes
    the real-world value unclear. While this initial research focused primarily on
    demonstrating a proof of concept and evaluating the energy optimization capabilities,
    further studies on the reliability, robustness, and maintenance requirements would
    provide valuable additional insights. We could address reliability and maintainability
    in future work that includes the following: Conducting reliability engineering
    analyses such as FMEA to identify potential failure modes and their effects. This
    can help highlight vulnerabilities to be mitigated; Performing accelerated life
    testing on system components to evaluate lifespan and deterioration over time.
    These data can inform maintenance schedules; Implementing self-diagnostic features
    and fault-tolerant architectures to improve reliability and reduce downtime; Evaluating
    ease of repair, replacement, and upkeep to minimize maintenance labor time/costs;
    Considering the use of higher-durability components, weatherproofing, and corrosion-resistance
    to withstand harsh outdoor conditions; Analyzing tradeoffs between reliability
    gains and additional costs to find the optimal balance. Incorporating these factors
    into future work on the solar tracking system could provide a more complete picture
    of overall performance and feasibility. While this research focused on the technical
    capabilities of the dual-axis tracking system to optimize energy yield, economic
    considerations are also important. As the paper notes in the introduction, a key
    challenge with solar PV is improving conversion efficiency and reducing manufacturing
    costs to be competitive with conventional power. The work on comparing the costs
    of expanding the fixed array footprint versus adding dual-axis tracking is excellent.
    The paper compares energy efficiency metrics across different systems but does
    not factor in land usage. As the small footprint increase may be acceptable for
    agricultural applications, it is a good avenue for future work. Incorporating
    the economic analysis described would strengthen the paper by balancing the technical
    potential against practical cost factors in the future. 4. Conclusions This research
    aimed to develop a dual-axis solar tracking system to enhance renewable energy
    optimization and collection from solar sources. The key goals were to improve
    solar panel efficiency, collect real-time weather data, and maximize energy yield
    through optimal panel orientation. The results demonstrated that the proposed
    approach increased efficiency by up to 52% compared to fixed solar panels. This
    aligned with the goal of optimizing efficiency through a tracking mechanism. The
    system also transmitted temperature, humidity, and air quality data to farmers
    via a mobile app. This achieved the objective of real-time data collection for
    agricultural applications. Additionally, the artificial neural network optimization
    increased performance stability, meeting the aim of incorporating AI techniques.
    The prototype testbed validated the ability to accurately track the sun’s position,
    fulfilling the goal of experimental validation. Overall, the dual-axis control
    scheme optimized the solar panel orientation to maximize energy generation in
    alignment with the aims. The combination of efficiency gains, data collection
    capabilities, AI integration, and experimental validation demonstrate that the
    stated goals and objectives were achieved. While further work can build upon these
    results, this research makes significant contributions to developing an intelligent,
    high-efficiency solar tracking system with agricultural data monitoring. The outcomes
    provide a foundation for additional studies into reliability, economics, and end-user
    validation to strengthen real-world viability. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: 'The goal of irrigation for wine grape grown in arid or semiarid regions
    is to sustain vine survival and to optimize berry attributes for quality wine
    production. Precision irrigation of wine grape is impeded by the lack of a smart,
    decision support system (DSS) to remotely monitor vine water status. The objectives
    of this study were to: develop and field test an Internet of Things (IoT) DSS
    system for precision irrigation of wine grape. The IoT system was comprised of
    a suite of in situ sensors used to monitor real-time weather conditions, grapevine
    canopy temperature, soil moisture, and irrigation amount. Sensor data were collected
    and stored on a field deployed data logger that calculated a daily thermal Crop
    Water Stress Index (CWSI) for grapevine using a neural network model with real-time
    sensor data model inputs. The data logger also hosted, via a cellular modem, webpages
    showing a running, 12-day history of daily CWSI, fraction of available soil moisture
    (fASW), irrigation amount, and other sensor data. The webpages were accessible
    to vineyard managers via cell phone or computer. The CWSI based IoT DDS system
    was installed at two small acreage, commercial estate vineyards in southwestern
    Idaho USA over four growing seasons. At each vineyard site, the DSS was used daily
    by the vineyard irrigation manager to schedule irrigation events. Neither vineyard
    manager used any other quantitative vine water status monitoring tool for irrigation
    management decisions. The midday leaf water potential (LWP) of grapevines was
    routinely measured by research project personnel. Data collected over the study
    period at each vineyard showed a significant (p < 0.001) correlation with LWP
    and fASW, providing evidence that, under the conditions of this study, the daily
    CWSI based IoT provided automated, remote monitoring of vine water status. Both
    vineyard managers reported daily use of the DSS for irrigation scheduling decisions.
    Over the four-year study, each vineyard manager was able to maintain consistent
    seasonal average CWSI daily values and irrigation application amounts, despite
    yearly differences in climatic conditions. The results of this study demonstrate
    that a CWSI based IoT DSS can be used for precision irrigation of wine grape in
    a commercial vineyard under semiarid growing conditions. The CWSI based IoT DSS
    used a unique combination of neural network modeling, edge computing, and IoT
    for real-time vine water stress monitoring for precision irrigation.'

    showed a significant (p < 0.001) correlation with LWP and fASW, providing evidence
    that, under the conditions of this study, the daily CWSI based IoT provided automated,
    remote monitoring of vine water status. Both vineyard managers reported daily
    use of the DSS for irrigation scheduling decisions. Over the four-year study,
    each vineyard manager was able to maintain consistent seasonal average CWSI daily
    values and irrigation application amounts, despite yearly differences in climatic
    conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that a CWSI based IoT DSS can
    be used for precision irrigation of wine grape in a commercial vineyard under
    semiarid growing conditions. The CWSI based IoT DSS used a unique combination
    of neural network modeling, edge computing, and IoT for real-time vine water stress
    monitoring for precision irrigation. Previous article in issue Next article in

    support systemInternet of Things 1. Introduction Irrigation management of most
    field crops aims to avoid plant water stress and maximize yield by supplying water
    to fully meet crop evapotranspiration (ETc). However, in wine grape (Vitis vinifera
    L.), fruit quality attributes are prioritized over yield as a production goal,
    and development of the berry and vine canopy are related to vine water status
    throughout the growing season [1,2]. For example, mild vine water stress between
    veraison (berry softening) and harvest is desirable to prevent berry splitting
    or dilution of flavors or sugars and to slow canopy growth in preparation for
    winter dormancy. Inducing vine water stress through deficit irrigation has also
    been shown to increase vine water use efficiency [3], [4], [5]. Water resources
    in the western U.S. are experiencing unprecedented competitive demand from irrigated
    agriculture, growing urban populations, and environmental and ecosystem restoration.
    Groundwater levels in many areas have steadily decreased from historic levels
    and ground water use is approaching an unsustainable level. In addition, the western
    US is experiencing the worst megadrought since 800 CE [6] leading to historically
    low water levels in many of the regions water reservoirs. Warmer winter temperatures
    due to climate change are predicted to reduce future mountain snowpack, which
    is the source of early irrigation developments in much of the western U.S. The
    growing demand on surface and groundwater resources combined with climate change
    necessitates increased water resource stewardship and crop water productivity
    to meet food and fiber needs of a growing population. Wine grape production in
    semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. is well established but relies
    on irrigation during the growing season for vine growth, survival, and economically
    viable yield. Optimum management of irrigation requires routine direct or indirect
    monitoring of vine water status [7]. Indirect methods for accessing plant water
    status include soil water content or soil water potential measurement and atmospheric-based
    methods [7,8]. Soil water monitoring is a widely accepted tool for estimating
    crop water needs for field crops but in the case of vineyards there are several
    disadvantages. These include spatial variability in soil characteristics and 3-dimensional
    soil wetting patterns from drip irrigation leading to the need to install several
    sensors, which complicates information management and increases cost. Additionally,
    there is a lack of established thresholds for determining vine water status and
    severity [7]. Atmospheric based methods include Bowen ratio energy balance and
    eddy covariance to determine ETc and infer plant water status by comparing measured
    ETc to estimated non-water stressed ETc. These techniques require expensive sensors,
    skilled technical knowledge, and large uniform upwind fetch, especially for eddy
    covariance, which make them unsuited for small commercial vineyard water management
    purposes [7]. A more detailed discussion of indirect methods is provided by Rienth
    and Scholasch [8]. Direct (plant-based) methods for determining plant water status
    rely on measurements of physical plant variables. Unlike indirect methods, plant-based
    methods use the plant as a biosensor in a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Conventional
    direct methods include leaf or stem water potential, visual observation, stomatal
    conductance or photosynthesis, sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor pressure
    [7,9]. Midday stem or leaf water potential (LWP) is the most commonly accepted
    direct measurement of vine water status [10] and critical upper and lower water
    stress thresholds have been established [7], making it an effective tool for deficit
    irrigation management. The primary disadvantages of LWP are the limited time of
    day for measurement, the need for repeated measurements due to plant variability,
    and a need for several equipped and trained personnel to cover a vineyard. Visual
    observation is based on the visual growth characteristics of the apical meristem
    or apex of vines, tendrils, and leaf orientation of numerous vines [1,8]. The
    drawbacks of this method include low sensitivity to moderate water stress, time
    lag between water stress and visual observation, and the cost of trained personnel
    to cover a vineyard. Stomatal conductance measures the ease of passage of CO2
    or water vapor through the stomata and is a good indicator of plant response to
    water stress because it changes with atmospheric demand and soil water status.
    It has been shown to indicate the degree of vine water stress but varies with
    timing of measurement and leaf canopy location [7]. The primary disadvantages
    are the cost of the equipment, constant need for calibration, technical skill
    to operate. Sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor are direct measures that
    have been shown to be indictors of plant water stress. However, they have not
    been widely adopted in regional commercial vineyards but have the advantage of
    being automated, which facilitates integration into a deficit irrigation management
    program. Detailed descriptions of other direct methods and their respective advantages
    and disadvantages are provided by [7], [8], [9]. Plant canopy temperature increases
    when solar radiation is absorbed and cools when water is evaporated (transpiration)
    within the leaf structure. A water-stressed plant canopy will reduce transpiration
    and have a higher temperature than a non-stressed canopy [11,12]. This physical
    plant response to water stress makes canopy temperature measurement a viable direct
    method for assessing plant water status. Infrared radiometers have been used to
    measure plant canopy temperature under research field conditions to estimate evapotranspiration
    and drought stress in many crops [13], [14], [15], including grape [16], [17],
    [18], [19], [20], [21]. Infrared thermometry is nondestructive, can be measured
    continuously, can be stationary or mounted on mobile platforms for spatial and
    temporal monitoring [9,[20], [21], [22]], and can be less expensive [23] than
    soil water sensing. Canopy temperature is related to plant water status, but it
    also depends upon solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (Ta), humidity (RH), and
    wind speed (WS) among other things. A method of using canopy temperature to calculate
    a CWSI for irrigation scheduling was proposed over 40 years ago by Idso et al.
    [15] and Jackson et al. [14]. The CWSI normalizes measured canopy temperature
    relative to reference threshold canopy temperatures for a well-watered vine (TLL)
    and a water stressed, non-transpiring vine (TUL) under identical weather conditions,
    resulting in an empirical CWSI value between, 0 (no water stress) and 1 (maximum
    water stress). Unfortunately, the need for TLL and TUL reference temperatures
    under identical weather conditions has limited the use of a CWSI to research scale
    studies and precluded its adoption on a commercial scale [9]. Alternatives to
    actual measurement of crop reference temperatures have been investigated, such
    as artificial wet and dry surfaces [16,[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]] and
    physical and empirical models [14,26,[30], [31], [32], [33]] to predict reference
    temperatures. The required maintenance of an artificial surface has limited use
    on a commercial scale, leaving physical or empirical models as the most logical
    choice. King et al. [33] used measured temperatures of non-water stressed wine
    grape canopies to develop data driven models (neural network, regression) to estimate
    TLL. The models were used to calculate CWSI values for research plots of Malbec
    grapes vines that were differentially irrigated to induce differing severities
    of vine water stress [19] and validated by comparing, over a 5-year period, CWSI
    values with LWP and fASW. The CWSI calculated using model predicted reference
    temperatures was well correlated with LWP (R2 = 0.54) and fASW (R2 = 0.71). When
    CWSI values were used to trigger 28 mm irrigation events, CWSI values increased,
    LWP became more negative, seasonal water application decreased, and grape cluster
    weight decreased. These results demonstrated that a CWSI could be used as an effective
    irrigation scheduling tool for wine grape. Irrigation scheduling based on canopy
    temperature has not been adopted on a commercial scale by vineyard irrigation
    mangers in semiarid regions of northwestern U.S. as evident by the lack of commercial
    systems supporting the application. The objectives of this study were to: develop
    a CWSI based IoT DSS for precision irrigation of wine grape under semiarid conditions;
    field test the CWSI based IoT DSS in two, small acreage commercial estate vineyards
    over four growing seasons; validate the IoT derived CWSI values by statistical
    correlation with LWP and fASW at each vineyard site; and evaluate vineyard manager
    annual consistency in irrigation scheduling. Vineyard irrigation managers were
    allowed to freely decide if they wanted to use the CWSI based IoS DSS for irrigation
    scheduling. Consistency of plant water stress and irrigation application across
    multiple years was used to gage success of the CWSI based IoT DDS system for irrigation
    scheduling as implemented by the vineyard manager. 2. Methods and materials 2.1.
    Field study site characteristics This study was conducted on two small (< 7 ha)
    family owned and operated commercial vineyards in southwestern Idaho USA over
    a four-year period (2017–2020). Both operations were estate vineyards in that
    they have associated wineries that produce branded commercial wines. The vineyard
    sites were located within 30 km of each other but differed in their soil characteristics
    and soil water holding capacities. The soil at vineyard-A (V-A) was a Greenleaf-Owyhee
    silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids) characterized
    as very deep well drained with moderately slow permeability and an available water
    capacity of 0.2 cm−1 (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vineyard-B (V-B) was located adjacent
    to an ancient volcanic vent that had been subjected to limited volcanic rock mining.
    The vineyard site was reclaimed using surrounding soil and original overburden
    to cover exposed rock resulting in a highly disturbed soil profile. The natural
    soils at the site were Turbyfill fine sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive,
    calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents) and Jacquith loamy fine sand (Sandy, mixed,
    mesic Xereptic Haplodurids), both of which are moderately deep and well drained
    in their natural state with moderately rapid permeability. Available water capacity
    of the Turbyfill fine sandy loam and Jacquith loamy fine sand were 0.12 and 0.07
    cm−1, respectively (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vines in both vineyards were grown
    with double trunks on a vertically shoot positioned, two-wire trellis system with
    moveable catch wires. The vines were trained to bilateral cordons and spur-pruned
    annually to approximately 16 buds m−1 of cordon. Row by vine spacing was 2.7 m
    x 1.8 m at V-A and 2.7 m x 1.5 m at V-B. Irrigation at both sites was applied
    using drip irrigation tubing suspended about 30 cm above ground in the vine row.
    Drip emitter spacing was 76 cm with a flow rate of 3.8 L hr−1 at V-A and 61 cm
    with a flow rate of 1.9 L hr−1 at V-B. The wine grape cultivar evaluated at V-A
    was Chardonnay (2017–2020) and the cultivars at V-B were Malbec (2017–2019) and
    Cabernet Sauvignon (2020). 2.2. Field measurements and instrumentation hardware
    and software Canopy temperature was measured using wired infrared radiometers
    (SI-121, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah) with a 36° field of view. The radiometers
    were placed along a single vine row to prevent potential damage to sensor cables
    from vineyard equipment. In each vineyard, two (2017, 2018, 2019) or four (2020)
    radiometers were installed per cultivar. Radiometer cable lengths were 30 m allowing
    a maximum distance of 60 m between radiometers within a vine row. The radiometers
    were installed on vines with representative canopy size and positioned approximately
    15 to 30 cm above fully expanded leaves located at the top of the vine canopy.
    Radiometers were pointed northeasterly at approximately 45° from nadir, with the
    sensor view aimed at the center of solar noon sunlit leaves. The temperature sensing
    area of vine canopy was approximately 10 to 20 cm in diameter and received full
    sunlight exposure during midday. The possibility of background bare soil visibility
    was limited by multiple leaf layers within the canopy below the measured canopy
    location. The infrared radiometer sensor view was periodically adjusted as necessary
    to ensure that the field of view concentrated on sunlit leaves near the top of
    the canopy. The infrared radiometers were installed after fruit set, usually mid
    to late June. Solar radiation (Rs) (SP-110 pyranometer, Apogee Instruments, Logan,
    UT), air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) (HMP50 temperature and humidity
    probe, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and wind speed (WS) (034B, Met One Instruments,
    Grants Pass, Ore.) were measured in each vineyard at a height of 2.5 m. Canopy
    temperature and weather parameters were measured every minute and recorded as
    15 min averages on a datalogger (CR6, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT). The weather
    sensors and data logger were installed in the same vine row and located midway
    between the infrared temperature sensors. The equipment was removed at harvest,
    usually mid to late September. A 1.2 m soil moisture sensor (Drill and Drop, SenTek
    Sensor Technologies, Stepney, SA) was installed in the vine row within 3 m of
    the data logger and within 20 cm of an irrigation drip line emitter. Soil moisture
    was recorded every 30 min measured at 10 cm depth increments to a depth of 1.2
    m. In 2017 and 2018, a tipping bucket rain gage (RainWise, Boothwyn, PA) was placed
    under an drip line irrigation emitter to record cumulative irrigation application
    amount. The rain gage was connected to the data logger and total emitter water
    application was recorded in 15 min and 24 hr increments. In 2019 and 2020 a flow
    meter (36MP.75RG.1, Netafim Irrigation, Inc., Fresno, CA) was installed in the
    irrigation drip line and connected to the data logger. Flow rate was recorded
    in 15 min increments. The field data logger was equipped with a machine-to-machine
    cellular modem (RavenXTA CDMA or RV50 Sierra wireless AirLink, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., Logan, UT) to provide real-time access to the sensor data using commercial
    software. Study personnel accessed sensor data using datalogger management software
    (LoggerNet 4.5, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT). Vineyard managers were provided
    real-time sensor data access through a website. The website was hosted on the
    field data logger. Data logger webpage publishing software (RTCM Pro Development
    4.3.3.6, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) was used to design and publish the
    webpage on the data logger. The website was accessible using either a personal
    computer or a smart phone. The website provided graphical pages with running 12-day
    histories of daily CWSI, soil water content at each depth increment, fASW, daily
    irrigation depth, and latest 15-min averaged weather data, each on a separate
    webpage. The website was available between the hours of 6:00 to 22:00 MDT. The
    cell phone modem was powered down overnight to conserve battery power and to reset
    the modem in case of intruder hacking and malware. The data logger battery was
    charged using a 20 W solar panel. Midday LWP was measured at 7-to-10-day intervals
    in both vineyards in each year of the study to verify vine water status and to
    investigate its correlation with daily CWSI. LWP was measured between 13:00 and
    15:00 MDT on two fully expanded, sunlit leaves from vines adjacent to each installed
    infrared radiometer using a pressure chamber (model 610, PMS Instrument Co., Albany,
    OR) as described by Levin et al. [10,34]. 2.3. Calculated webpage values Information
    shown on webpages hosted by the field data logger was based on several calculations
    performed by datalogger software using measured sensor values. The calculated
    values included daily CWSI, fASW, and daily irrigation depth. Daily CWSI was calculated
    as the average 15-min CWSI between 13:00 and 15:00 MST, which corresponded to
    −1 to +1.5 hr of solar noon. The 15-min CWSI was calculated using the empirical
    equation developed by Idso et al. [15] as: (1) where Tc is measured canopy temperature
    of fully sunlit leaves ( °C). The TLL reference temperature ( °C) was estimated
    using cultivar specific neural network models [32]. Inputs to the neural network
    models were 15-minute averaged values of measured Rs, Ta, RH and WS. The TUL reference
    temperature ( °C) was estimated using the energy balance-based equation of [14]
    as: (2) where ra is aerodynamic resistance (s m−1), Rn is net radiation (W m−2),
    cp is heat capacity of air (J kg-1 °C-1), and ρ is density of air (kg m−3). Aerodynamic
    resistance was estimated using the approach of [30] as described by [33] using
    the same cultivar specific data sets for well-watered wine grapes in southwestern
    Idaho. Values used for ra were 16.8 s m−1 for Malbec and 21 s m−1 for Chardonnay
    and Cabernet Sauvignon. Net radiation was estimated as Rn = 0.9Rs – 60 [33]. The
    fASW for a given soil profile depth was calculated as: (3) where θi is measured
    volumetric soil water content for depth i, θpwpi is estimated volumetric soil
    water content at permanent wilting point for depth i, θfci is estimated volumetric
    soil water content at field capacity at depth i, and n is the number of 10 cm
    soil water content measurement depths considered. Field capacity for each soil
    depth was estimated as the maximum soil water content measured 24 h after an irrigation
    event or soil water content at the beginning of the season for depths below the
    irrigation wetting front. Permanent wilting point (PWP) for each soil depth was
    estimated as 50% of field capacity (FC) or minimum soil water content measured.
    Values for θfci and θpwpi were continually adjusted during the beginning of the
    season as soil water content measurements were collected. Three values of fASW
    were presented in the webpage: 0 to 60 cm, 0 to 90 cm, and 0 to 120 cm. Values
    shown in the webpages were expressed in English units as they were designed for
    use by vineyard managers located in the U.S. Daily irrigation depth was calculated
    as the volume of water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT divided by the drip
    irrigation lateral length represented and vine row spacing. In the case of rain
    gauges, the volume of water measured by the rain gage was divided by the emitter
    spacing and vine row spacing. In the case of flow meters, the daily volume of
    water applied was calculated by summing the flow rate in each 15 min interval
    multiplied by the time interval. The volume of water was divided by lateral length
    downstream of the flow meter and vine row spacing. The calculated irrigation depth
    was presented in the English unit of inches. 2.4. Irrigation DSS vineyard manager
    accessible webpages The irrigation DSS was comprised of six separate webpages
    that displayed daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), soil moisture at depth of 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in) (Fig. 2), soil moisture at a depth of 70 to 120 cm (28 - 48 in) (Fig.
    3), fASW at three soil depths (Fig. 4), irrigation amount (Fig. 5), and weather
    (Fig. 6). The webpages showing CWSI, soil water content (%) and fASW displayed
    data as a running 12-day history. Each webpage had a top menu showing all available
    webpages. CWSI values were graphed independently for each infrared radiometer
    and as the average value of all radiometers. An example of the main webpage at
    site V-B for 13 August through 25 August 2020 is shown in Fig. 1. Soil volumetric
    water content (%) was graphed independently at depth increments of 10 cm (4 inches)
    (Figs. 2,3). fASW (Fig. 4) was graphed independently for soil depths 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in), 0 to 90 cm (1 – 36 in), and 0 - 120 cm (0 – 48 in). Daily irrigation
    amounts (Fig. 5) represent water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT. Fig. 1, Fig.
    2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show data for V-B from 13 August through 23 August 2020.
    Weather conditions in each vineyard (Fig. 6) were displayed as the most current
    15-min average value for Ta, RH, WS, and wind direction. For ease of use, the
    values for Ta and RH were displayed graphically as well as numerically. Download

    Linear and multiple regression were conducted using Microsoft Excel data analysis
    tools. Graphical, linear, and multiple linear regression and variance analysis
    were used to quantify and evaluate relationships between variables. Regression
    line significance was evaluated using ANOVA (p < 0.05). Neural network model development
    was performed using the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, Mass.)
    [33]. Graphs were generated using Sigmaplot 14 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).
    3. Results 3.1. Climatic conditions Climatic conditions during the four-year study
    relative to 20-yr (1996–2016) averages are summarized in Table 1. The climatic
    conditions during the four study years were generally within one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean with a few exceptions. Alfalfa-based reference evapotranspiration
    was greatest in 2018 and exceeded the 20-yr mean by more than one standard deviation.
    The combination of high mean air temperature and daily solar radiation, and low
    mean relative humidity and April through September precipitation resulted in the
    high reference evapotranspiration in 2018. October through March precipitation
    was greatest in 2017 and exceeded one standard deviation of the 20-yr mean. April
    through September precipitation in 2019 and 2020 exceeded one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean. Growing-degree days was greatest in 2018, coinciding with highest
    mean daily air temperature and high reference evapotranspiration. Table 1. Climatic

    water stress Linear relationships between plant water stress measures fASW, LWP,
    and CWSI at each vineyard for the four study years combined are summarized in
    Fig. 7. All the linear relationships between the water stress measures were statistically
    significant (p < 0.001). The linear relationships between fASW versus LWP and
    daily CWSI versus LWP had similar R2 values for both vineyards. The linear relationship
    between fASW and CWSI at V-B had a much greater R2 than for V-A (0.58vs 0.32).
    Variability in the fASW vs CWSI data was similar between the vineyards, but daily
    CWSI spanned a greater range at V-B resulting in a greater R2. The greatest data
    variability occurred between daily CWSI and LWP for both vineyards. The greater
    variability is likely due to CWSI and LWP responding differently to Ta, RS, RH
    and WS. Download : Download high-res image (968KB) Download : Download full-size

    Relationship between seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts The seasonal
    average values for daily CWSI and the cumulative amount of irrigation applied
    between 1 July and 15 September in each study year at each vineyard are shown
    in Table 2. The seasonal average daily CWSI values for each vineyard were largely
    consistent over the four-year study. Seasonal daily CWSI values were higher for
    V-B as the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager
    of V-A. The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly
    increase a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding
    capacity of the sandy soil. Table 2. Average daily crop water stress index (CWSI)

    DSS vineyard manager accessible webpages An example of the irrigation DSS running
    12-day history and weather webpage is presented for V-B for 13 to 23 August 2020
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). An irrigation event, starting
    the evening of 18 August 2020, increased soil water content to a depth of 60 cm
    (24 inches) (Fig. 2) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1). An irrigation
    event starting on the evening of 23 August increased soil water content to a depth
    70 cm (28 inches) (Fig. 3) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1).
    The estimated fASW increased on 18 August and 23 August (Fig. 4) as soil water
    contents increased (Fig 2) due to irrigation events. Prior to irrigation on 18
    Aug, daily CWSI was greater than 0.6 (Fig. 1), while fASW for the 0 to 120 cm
    soil profile was about 0.3 and increased to greater than 0.8 following irrigation
    on 23 Aug. Midday on 25 August daily CWSI was near zero while fASW was about 0.78.
    An overnight irrigation event started on 18 August is depicted as two irrigations
    since it spanned two days (Fig. 5). The first irrigation event applied about 10
    mm (0.4 inch) and the second irrigation event applied about 21 mm (0.8 inch),
    which collectively decreased daily CWSI from 0.6 to near zero (Fig. 1) and increased
    fASW from 0.3 to 0.8 (Fig. 4). The observed variability among radiometers on the
    irrigation DSS webpage for daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), was likely attributed to
    high spatial variability in soil profile characteristics. Limiting historical
    data on the irrigation DSS webpage to a running 12-day period was to optimize
    time efficiency of the user web browsing experience. The infield data logger that
    hosted the irrigation DSS webpages had limited computing capacity, so limiting
    the historical data time frame to a running 12-days offered a reasonable compromise
    between data viewability on a cell phone and time to transfer the data to the
    user webpage interface device. A running 12-day historical record was sufficient
    to establish trends in CWSI or soil water availability useful in making irrigation
    management decisions. The vineyard managers in this study only wanted to know
    if they need to irrigation today and were largely uninterested in historical CWSI
    values. The 12-day historical length can be increased if deemed necessary by uploading
    the data to the cloud and using cloud based graphical software to display the
    same information for the full growing season. 4.2. Relationship between measures
    of vine water status and irrigation A seasonal graph of the irrigation DSS data
    for V-B in 2020 shows an interconnected response among the measured and estimated
    DSS parameters (Fig. 8). Values for daily CWSI and midday leaf water potential
    shown in Fig. 8 are averages of the measured values and fASW is for the 0 to 120
    soil profile. Prior to initiation of measurements on 13 June, there was above
    average precipitation in 2020 (Table 1). The prior precipitation is evident by
    the status of well-watered vines on 13 June (Fig. 8). Daily CWSI was low, fASW
    was > 0.55 and LWP was less negative. A rainfall event on 29 June was associated
    with a decrease in the daily CWSI, an increase in fASW and a less negative LWP.
    Prior to the irrigation event on 20 July, the daily CWSI steadily increased coincident
    with a more negative LWP. The small irrigation event on 8 July had minimal influence
    on daily CWSI or LWP potential as fASW remained below 0.55. Irrigation events
    prior to 17 August reduced CWSI and made LWP less negative for only a few days
    and fASW remained 〈 0.55 for most of the duration. The seasonally highest CWSI
    values and most negative LWP values occurred between 28 July and 24 August. The
    irrigation event on 23 August and precipitation events on 17 and 24 August decreased
    CWSI to near zero, increased fASW to 〉 0.55 and LWP became less negative, all
    of which indicated a short period of increase in vine water status. Between 24
    August and the next irrigation event on 1 September, the CWSI increased, fASW
    decreased, and LWP became more negative. The relatively large (> 25 mm) irrigation
    event on 3 September decreased daily CWSI to 〈 0.2, increased fASW to 〉 0.8, and
    LWP became less negative. The last irrigation on 11 September reduced daily CWSI
    to near zero, increased fASW to nearly 0.9 and increased LWP to > −0.9 MPa. Download

    Average daily CWSI, fraction of available soil water (fASW) in 0 to 120 cm soil
    profile, midday leaf water potential (LWP), precipitation, and irrigation during
    the 2020 growing season at V-B. The fASW is a common method used to express crop
    water stress for field crops. Wine grape is well-watered when fASW is greater
    than 0.55 [35]. The corresponding seasonal responses of fASW, midday LWP, and
    the daily CWSI to irrigation and precipitation events (Fig. 8) supports the usefulness
    and accuracy of daily CWSI for real-time irrigation management of wine grape irrespective
    of soil characteristics that may influence these values. 4.3. Comparison of vine
    water stress measures between vineyards The slopes of linear relationships between
    the fASW versus LWP or daily CWSI differed between vineyards (Fig. 7). This may
    be partially due to differences in soil textures and permeability between the
    vineyards. V-A had a silt loam soil with low to moderate permeability while V-B
    had a sandy soil with high permeability. Water applied by the drip irrigation
    emitter likely resulted in different wetting patterns between vineyards with a
    deeper wetting pattern and less lateral spreading at V-B. There was likely limited
    soil water availability outside the immediate area of the emitter wetting pattern
    at V-B due to the low water holding capacity of the sandy soil. The soil water
    sensor was installed within 20 cm of an emitter and may have provided a better
    measurement of total soil water at V-B than V-A. The greater water holding capacity
    of the silt loam soil at V-A likely resulted in much more stored soil water from
    non-growing season precipitation, limiting the range in fASW over the growing
    season. However, the range in LWP were similar between vineyards. The low permeability
    of the soil at V-A may have restricted movement of soil water to the roots. Lastly
    the soil at V-A exhibited silica cementation ranging from 45 to 60 cm deep during
    soil sensor installation that may have restricted root growth. Ample soil water
    was measured below 60 cm in the root zone (data not shown) but very little extraction
    occurred during the growing season supporting the suspicion of limited root presence
    below 60 cm. The presence of ample soil water below 60 cm limited the range in
    fASW over the growing season and if it was largely unavailable to the vines would
    result in high daily CWSI and low LWP values despite fASW > 0.55. Despite a significant
    linear relationship between daily CWSI and midday LWP for both vineyards (Fig.
    7), there is considerable variability in the relationships, which precludes use
    of CWSI as a direct surrogate for LWP. A quadratic relationship between CWSI and
    LWP averaged over four wine grape cultivars was reported by [21], which depicted
    a similar degree of variability. [36] reported LWP ranging from −0.51 to −1.15
    MPa for well-watered grapevines in California with LWP linearly related to vapor
    pressure deficit (VPD) and Ta. They also reported a linear relationship between
    LWP and VPD for water stressed vines, but with reduced dependence on VPD compared
    to well-watered vines. The results of this study are consistent with the findings
    of [36] as the relationship between CWSI and LWP (Fig. 7) could be represented
    by a piece-wise linear relationship with CWSI ≈ 0 for LWP > −1.15 MPa. Solar radiation
    also influences LWP and LWP measurements should be collected on cloudless days
    [36]. The LWP values reported in this study were made over a wide range of VPD
    and on days with variable clouds. Additionally, some LWP values reported in this
    study were not collected on the same vine used for canopy temperature measurement,
    another source of variability in the relationship between CWSI and LWP. Overall,
    the presence of water stress detected by LWP measurement was also indicted by
    daily CWSI as calculated in this study, demonstrating that CWSI can be effectively
    used as an irrigation management tool for wine grape. The vineyard managers in
    this study were successful in using daily CWSI to achieve similar levels of plant
    water stress over multiple years, despite yearly differences in evaporative demand
    and growing season precipitation. The primary advantage of using CWSI as an irrigation
    management tool is the ability to automate data collection for daily monitoring
    of water stress with minimal labor. The linear relationship between fASW and daily
    CWSI exhibited less variability than the linear relationship between fASW and
    midday LWP (Fig. 7), especially for V-B. Thus, CWSI was a more direct indicator
    of available soil water than LWP. For V-B, when fASW was > 0.55, indicating well-watered
    vines, CWSI was 〈 0.1 supporting the rational than CWSI should approach zero for
    well-watered vines and approach one for severely watered stressed vines as the
    linear relationship depicts. However, for V-A a fASW value of 0.55 corresponds
    to a CWSI value 〉 0.5, which clearly does not follow the rational of CWSI, indicating
    an error in estimating fASW. As forementioned, this discrepancy is likely due
    to the effective root zone of the vines less than the 120 cm depth used to compute
    fASW. The estimates of FC and PWP of the soil at V-A could also be in error, which
    could lead to overestimation of fASW. If estimates of the fASW at V-A were reduced
    by 25%, a fASW value of 0.55 would correspond to a CWSI value < 0.1, like V-B
    and a CWSI value of 0.6 would correspond to a fASW of 0.37. The unrealistic over
    estimation of fAWC at V-A based on measured midday LWP and calculated daily CWSI
    highlights the difficulty in accurately quantifying the fASW using a single soil
    moisture profile measurement with drip irrigated crops. Drip irrigation results
    in a 3-dimensional wetting pattern that makes reliable estimation of root zone
    available soil water difficult at best. As an example, [37] reported that nine
    neutron probe measurements in one quadrant of a vine root zone, to a depth of
    3 m, was necessary to quantify soil water content of drip-irrigated grape vines.
    The difficulty in quantifying fASW in drip irrigated vineyards highlights the
    advantage of using plant-based methods for assessing vine water status such as
    CWSI provided the reference temperatures TLL and TUL can be reliably estimated.
    4.4. Seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts between vineyard managers Neither
    vineyard manager in this study used any type of quantitative plant or soil water
    monitoring techniques to aid in irrigation management decisions prior to the installation
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. Prior to this study, the irrigation managers
    at both vineyards made irrigation decisions based upon intuition, previous experience,
    and crop appearance [1]; so, there was a reasonable expectation that the vineyard
    managers would actively use the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. At the beginning
    of the first study year, the vineyard managers were briefed on the concept of
    CWSI for monitoring plant water status and were given the guideline that a daily
    CWSI value of 0.3 corresponded to approximately a 70% ET rate relative to a well-watered,
    100% ET. Beyond that initial guidance on how to interpret the daily CWSI value,
    the vineyard managers independently accessed the irrigation DSS webpages and made
    irrigation management decisions without input from research project personnel.
    At the end of the first study year both vineyard managers reported that they routinely
    accessed the irrigation DSS webpages for daily CWSI and fASW and used the information
    to support irrigation management decisions. In each of the remaining three years
    of the study, both vineyard managers, at their discretion, continued to access
    the irrigation DSS webpages and use the daily CWSI to facilitate irrigation management
    decisions. Seasonal average daily CWSI values (Table 2) were higher for V-B as
    the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager of V-A.
    The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly increase
    a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding capacity
    of the sandy soil. Cumulative irrigation water application was surprisingly similar
    across vineyards, particularly for years 2018 through 2020, despite differences
    in soil water holding capacity and vineyard managers. Cumulative irrigation was
    low in the first year of the study at V-A due to above average non-growing season
    precipitation and higher water holding capacity of the silt loam soil. The narrow
    range in seasonal average daily CWSI (0.23 to 0.31 for V-A, and 0.36 to 0.44 for
    V-B) and cumulative irrigation (1.14 to 134 mm) in 2018 through 2020 suggests
    that vineyard managers effectively used the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS to develop
    and maintain a consistent deficit irrigation management program. 4.5. Irrigation
    decision support system limitations The data-driven models used in this study
    provided reliable estimates of TLL and TUL in real-time for the semiarid climatic
    conditions of the study site, which was representative of the irrigated wine producing
    locations in the pacific northwestern U.S. The climatic conditions under which
    these data-driven models were developed were representative of the conditions
    in this study. However, the models may not perform as well in other regions with
    weather conditions outside the database range for model development. For example,
    in areas where daily windspeeds exceed 5 m sec−1. Wind speeds higher than 5 m
    sec−1 were not included in the database used for model development and grapevines
    are known to reduce stomatal conductance under high winds [38,39]. A wind induced
    reduction in stomatal conductance would result in an increase in canopy temperature
    independent of plant water stress and, since the data-driven model estimate of
    TLL would be too low, the calculated CWSI value would be elevated. Canopy temperature
    data for well-watered vines under high wind conditions would need to be included
    in the data set used to calibrate the neural network model for estimating TLL
    in windy semiarid regions. There are climatic conditions that can result in a
    calculated CWSI value of less than zero or greater than one. Wet canopy conditions
    typically result in measured canopy temperature that is less than the TLL predicted
    by the data driven model. This results in a negative CWSI value regardless of
    soil water availability. The original development of the CWSI concept by [15]
    was limited to clear sunny conditions. However, the data driven model for predicting
    TLL that was used in this study uses a database of well-watered vine canopy temperatures
    that were measured under variable cloudy conditions. The data driven model can
    therefore predict TLL for variably cloudy conditions. While the data-driven model
    used for predicting TLL is valid for solar radiation < 100 W m−2, TUL predicted
    using Eq. (2) for low levels of solar radiation can be approximately equal to
    TLL resulting in CWSI values less than zero or greater than 1. In this study,
    solar radiation less than 200 W m−2 often resulted in CWSI values less than zero.
    [40] also found solar radiation greater than 200 W m−2 was necessary to reliably
    use canopy temperature measurement for irrigation scheduling. In this study, daily
    CWSI was limited to a maximum of one and a minimum of zero in software to avert
    illogical values. The effect of wet canopy and low solar radiation on calculation
    of daily CWSI is evident in Fig. 8 on 18 and 24 August when a value of zero was
    assigned to daily CWSI during rainfall events. Limiting daily CWSI value to zero
    due to low solar radiation or wet canopy has little practical impact on use of
    CWSI for irrigation management as vine water stress is low under these circumstances
    due to low evaporative demand. When calculated CWSI is greater than one due to
    low solar radiation, limiting the value of one is more problematic as this results
    in a very erroneous representation of vine water stress that could lead to an
    unnecessary irrigation event. The climatic conditions leading to errors in calculating
    CWSI (rainfall, low solar radiation) are limited to 1-to-3-days in duration in
    the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not prevent application
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region. Software used to compute
    CWSI can be modified to detect these events and indicate to the user that the
    daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value for the day preceding the rainfall
    or low solar radiation event can be used to guide irrigation decisions as plant
    water stress will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally as ET will be small
    under low solar radiation conditions. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system
    developed and implemented in this study focused on two small acreage, commercial
    estate vineyards in semiarid southwestern Idaho USA. The climatic conditions at
    the study sites were representative of vineyards in the semiarid irrigated regions
    of the Pacific Northwest U.S. Small acreage vineyards can be found throughout
    the region and most do not have staff with irrigation science training, nor can
    they afford to hire trained vineyard irrigation management professionals or services.
    They need affordable irrigation scheduling tools that are easy to maintain and
    indicate when to irrigate to maintain a desired level of vine water stress. The
    vineyard managers at the study sites were pleased the system reliably and timely
    indication of vine water stress without having to spend time collecting soil water
    content measurements needed to estimate fASW or measure leaf water potential.
    While this study focused on small commercial estate vineyards, the IoT irrigation
    DSS concept is applicable to larger commercial vineyards where it could be used
    to provide plant water stress information needed to ground truth remote sensing
    based estimates of the ratio of actual-to-reference ET such as those provided
    by GRAPEX [41] or OPENET (https://openetdata.org). These remote sensing-based
    estimates have a minimum spatial resolution of 30 m, which is larger than the
    minimum dimension of irrigation management blocks in many commercial estate vineyards,
    hence they are not necessarily applicable to small commercial estate vineyards
    in the region. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study
    used expensive scientific grade equipment, which proved invaluable to investigate
    the validity and adoptability of the system for irrigation management in wine
    grapes. The infrared temperature sensors cost $700 each, the multifunctional precision
    data logger was $2000, and the cellular modem with accessories was $700 totaling
    over $6100 excluding web page publishing software and climatic sensors. The soil
    moisture sensor cost is not included as it is unnecessary for calculation of the
    CWSI. The cost of the equipment used in this study is prohibitive for small vineyards
    to monitor just a single location. Vineyard manager acceptance and adoption of
    the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study justifies continued
    development and enhancement of the system. Future work will focus on incorporating
    less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power, low-cost radio
    communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station. The base
    station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and used to
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature
    at sensor locations across a vineyard and display daily CWSI for each canopy temperature
    monitoring location. These system enhancements would increase size of the vineyard
    area represented by daily CWSI measurements, encompassing multiple cultivars and
    irrigation blocks or irrigation management zones in larger vineyards. 5. Conclusions
    A CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS was developed, and field tested at two small acreage
    commercial wine grape estate vineyards in southwestern Idaho. Irrigation DSS webpages,
    accessible to vineyard managers via cell phone or computer, provided a running
    12-day history of CWSI daily values, soil moisture and current weather conditions.
    Data-driven models were used to estimate reference temperatures needed to calculate
    the CWSI using real-time environmental inputs for Rs, Ta, RH, and WS. Edge computing
    on a solar powered, field-deployed data logger was used to calculate the CWSI
    and fASW, and the data logger was used to host webpages of the irrigation DSS.
    The data logger was connected to a cellular modem located in the vineyard. The
    vineyard managers routinely used the irrigation DSS webpage for the CWSI and soil
    moisture to make irrigation management decisions. The average daily CWSI and irrigation
    amounts between 1 July and 15 September were similar between years over the four-year
    study for each study vineyard suggesting that the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS
    was effective in assisting irrigation management decisions. Linear relationships
    between daily CWSI, midday LWP, and fraction of available soil water were significant
    (p < 0.001) at both study sites. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.58)
    for the linear relationship between daily CWSI and fraction of available soil
    water for V-B was better than that for midday LWP (R2 = 0.38) indicating daily
    CWSI was the most reliable indicator (less variable) of vine water status. The
    data-driven models used to estimate TLL and TUL can result in CWSI values outside
    the theoretical range of 0 to 1 when the canopy is wet from precipitation or solar
    radiation is <200 W m−2. These climatic conditions are limited to 1-to-3-days
    in duration in the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not
    prevent application of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region.
    These climatic instances can be detected by IoT irrigation DSS system software
    and indicate to the user that the daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value
    for the day preceding the rainfall or low solar radiation event can be used to
    indicate plant water stress since it will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally
    as ET will be small under low solar radiation conditions. The hardware and software
    used to implement the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS in this study was very reliable
    but too expensive for practical commercial application. Future work will focus
    on incorporating less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power,
    low-cost radio communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station.
    The base station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature
    at sensor locations across a vineyard and display daily CWSI for each canopy temperature
    monitoring location. Funding The work reported in this paper was partially funded

  description: In farming, weather forecasting refers to the prediction of an area's
    atmospheric state at a specific moment to determine whether it is suitable or
    unsuitable for agricultural activities. Knowledge about the current weather feed
    good decision for farmers in crop cultivation. The numerous daily decisions can
    be better prepared based on weather analysis. These choices include when to fertilize,
    when to irrigate crops, and when to do fieldwork in the farm. Farmers' choices
    will determine whether or not their crop is lucrative. A farmer must be mindful
    of the present climate condition in order to grow a successful crop. In recent
    years, estimating climate has gained significant research attention. Despite the
    abundance of data available for weather forecasting, the majority of them require
    the use of a nonlinear model before forecasting. Due to the advancement in image
    processing, climate detection from atmosphere images provides much information
    for identifying weather condition and it helps the farmers choose the appropriate
    time to operate effectively on a daily basis. This article examines the applicability
    of the combined convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional gated recurrent
    unit (Bi-GRU) approach by developing a robust and climate estimation model from
    real time images acquired from farm atmosphere. The proposed work offers a method
    for precisely and accurately detecting actual meteorological conditions using
    computer vision.

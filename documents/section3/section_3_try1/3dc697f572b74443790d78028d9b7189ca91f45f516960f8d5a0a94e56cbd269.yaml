    to summer desiccation reflects adaptation strategies, setting the stage for a
    large rainfall-induced soil CO2 pulse upon rewetting, an important component of
    the ecosystem carbon budget. In three California annual grasslands, the present
    (DNA-based) and potentially active (RNA-based) soil bacterial and fungal communities
    were tracked over a summer season and in response to controlled rewetting of intact
    soil cores. Phylogenetic marker genes for bacterial (16S) and fungal (28S) RNA
    and DNA were sequenced, and the abundances of these genes and transcripts were
    measured. Although bacterial community composition differed among sites, all sites
    shared a similar response pattern of the present and potentially active bacterial
    community to dry-down and wet-up. In contrast, the fungal community was not detectably
    different among sites, and was largely unaffected by dry-down, showing marked
    resistance to dessication. The potentially active bacterial community changed
    significantly as summer dry-down progressed, then returned to pre-dry-down composition
    within several hours of rewetting, displaying spectacular resilience. Upon rewetting,
    transcript copies of bacterial rpoB genes increased consistently, reflecting rapid
    activity resumption. Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla
    present and potentially active, and showed the largest changes in relative abundance.
    The relative increase (Actinobacteria) and decrease (Acidobacteria) with dry-down,
    and the reverse responses to rewetting reflected a differential response, which
    was conserved at the phylum level and consistent across sites. These contrasting
    desiccation-related bacterial life-strategies suggest that predicted changes in
    precipitation patterns may affect soil nutrient and carbon cycling by differentially
    impacting activity patterns of microbial communities. Issue Section: Original

    PDF Abstract The objective of the study was to examine suitable remote sensing
    methods and data for mapping and measuring the acreages of active crop lands in
    order to improve irrigation management. We compared classification results from
    a supervised classification method and a method using normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) with additional pre‐classification processing. IKONOS and Landsat
    Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images were tested to see if high spatial
    resolution remote sensing data would have significant advantages in distinguishing
    between active and fallow lands. The classification achieved an overall accuracy
    of 93.63%. The results showed that the supervised classification did not have
    a clear advantage over the simple method using NDVI at the level of distinguishing
    between active crops and fallow lands. The result suggests that using ETM+ instead
    of IKONOS high spatial resolution imageries is appropriate because of the high
    cost of IKONOS imageries and image heterogeneity of agricultural fields. It was
    shown that pre‐processing with a mask to exclude the non‐agricultural objects
    blended with agricultural fields is critical. 1. Introduction Knowing the acreage
    of active crops in a particular irrigation rotation is one of the most important
    factors for water planning and management, especially for semi‐arid and arid environments
    where water is limited. Efficiency of managing irrigation water is an important
    issue in arid and semi‐arid areas, such as along the Rio Grande Valley area in
    the south‐west USA where there is a major agriculture corridor for the region.
    The water requirement for an agricultural irrigation rotation usually depends
    on the area of active crops. Traditionally, water planning for agricultural water
    uses is conducted by referring to information on the acreage of irrigated agriculture
    and water supplied in the previous year. Previous water use information is usually
    incomplete since it consists of volunteer‐based reporting from farmers at the
    end of the year. Also, water demand for agricultural uses can vary significantly
    from year to year due to the changes of the acreage of active crops. Therefore,
    mapping and measuring active crops and fallow lands from satellite imagery would
    be appropriate for agricultural water‐use planning. Using satellite remote sensing
    technology for mapping irrigated areas was attempted several decades ago (Heller
    and Johnson 1979, Hoffman 1979, Tinney et al. 1979, Thiruvengadachari 1981). In
    the present decade, there have been new research efforts incorporating the rapid
    advancement of technology to improve the capability of monitoring agricultural
    and hydrological conditions of the land surface (Ambast et al. 2002). For example,
    Thome et al. ( 1988) used Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) data and estimated
    the total irrigated area in the Mendoza province of Argentina. Azzali and Menenti
    ( 1996) used temporal data to distinguish the irrigated and non‐irrigated crops.
    Several studies (Vidal and Baqri 1995, Herrero and Casterad 1999) reported the
    results of using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to detect irrigated areas or
    to assess net water requirements in crop fields using supervised classification.
    A common deficiency of the previous methods of assessing acreages of croplands
    using remote sensing data is the complexity that is impractical for management
    purpose. Their classification methods of using regression or supervised training
    depend on absolute image values so the calibrated coefficients are not transferable
    to a variety of spatial and temporal conditions. Based on the literature, we question
    if these complex methods are significant in terms of achieving the required accuracy
    of classifying between active and fallow lands. One possible solution for simplifying
    the classification process might be the use of a simple classification method
    jointly with a pre‐processing scheme. In this study, we examined two land‐use
    classification methods with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery
    for mapping and measuring the acreages of active crop lands. One is a complex
    supervised classification method, namely the spectral angle mapper (SAM), which
    is based on similarity of spectral characteristics of classes to training site
    (class). The other one is a simple classification method using the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) incorporating a pre‐classification processing
    procedure. By comparing to the complex SAM method, this study can determine if
    the NDVI‐based classification with a pre‐processing procedure would be a suitable
    method for irrigation planning. Suitable results for this application would be
    classification accuracy, less complexity in processing, and cost‐effectiveness
    for required data. In the pre‐classification processing, we explore the usefulness
    of involving ancillary data. The ancillary data include ortho‐planimetric layers
    and land resources, such as road edge, hydro line, hydro area, parcel base‐maps,
    and irrigation boundary. The ancillary data were used to create a mask for delineating
    agricultural fields by excluding non‐agricultural objects. Additionally, the IKONOS
    and Landsat ETM+ images were tested with the SAM classification method to see
    if high spatial resolution remote sensing data would have significant advantages
    in distinguishing between active and fallow lands. Using ETM+ instead of IKONOS
    high spatial resolution imageries can avoid high cost of purchasing imageries.
    Besides the higher cost, the high resolution imagery might not be appropriate
    to use for land‐use with greater heterogeneity. Accuracy of classification with
    different methods and imageries were assessed using a confusion matrix based on
    ground data. The study results would be useful in identifying an accuracy‐reliable
    and cost‐effective method of extracting acreages of active crop fields and fallow
    lands for irrigation management and planning. 2. Study site and data The study
    site is located in El Paso County, Texas, part of the semi‐arid area of the south‐western
    USA (figure 1). Agricultural land uses dominate the site, including the Upper
    Valley and Lower Valley along the Rio Grande River valley. The total irrigated
    agriculture area is about 47 000 acres. Primary field crop commodities consist
    of cotton, pecan, corn, wheat, alfalfa, and commercial vegetables. Figure 1 Index
    map of the study area(El Paso, Texas). The IKONOS images covered two agricultural
    areas: Upper Valley and Lower Valley. Display full size Two types of imagery data,
    Landsat ETM+ and IKONOS, were used in the study. Simple dark subtraction method
    was used for radiometric correction. Five ETM+ images (path 33/row 38) acquired
    at different times (between 1999 and 2001) were sub‐setted to cover the study
    area (figure 1). Landsat ETM+ has a resolution of 30 m with six multi‐spectral
    bands, one thermal band of 60‐m resolution, and one panchromatic band of 15‐m
    resolution. The 386 scenes of IKONOS imagery were acquired by El Paso Water Utilities
    through a contract awarded to a Californian company. The acquisitions were carried
    out between August 2000 and February 2001 to satisfy the requirement of cloud
    free or less than 5% of cloud cover. The images in the Lower Valley portion (south,
    251 scenes) acquired from August to October 2000, and in the Upper Valley portion
    (north, 135 scenes) acquired from August 2000 to February 2001. Each scene is
    in 1‐m spatial resolution (4‐m multi‐spectral bands fused with 1‐m panchromatic
    band) with four bands: blue (band 1), green (band 2), red (band 3) and near‐infrared
    (band 4). Each image (tile) size is 1500×1500 pixels (i.e. 2.25 km2) All IKONOS
    and ETM+ images were geo‐referenced against the El Paso street centreline or El
    Paso Water Utility''s (EPWU) digital orthorectified airphotos, which are in 1‐foot
    spatial resolution and acquired in 1997. Both the street centreline and the orthorphotos
    are in Texas central state plane coordinates with North American Datum of 1983
    (NAD83). 3. Ground investigation (ground data) and analysis In order to understand
    the signatures of crops and fallow lands in the images, an area of 2295.7 acres
    was selected for ground investigation (ground data). The area is covered with
    four scenes of IKONOS images as displayed in figure 2. Three ground investigations
    were conducted on 25 July, 18 September, and 6 November 2001, respectively. The
    ground investigation served for both training and accuracy assessment. The first
    field investigation in 25 July (figure 2( b)) reflected all agricultural lands
    in the crop‐growing season and no fallow land in the ground data area. The area
    of crops was about 1854 acres out of the total area of 2295.7 acres (table 1).
    The remaining areas are residential, school and irrigation ditches. Cotton was
    the dominant crop (∼60%), with corn the second‐most dominant crop (∼27%). Besides
    crop lands, fallow lands (the harvested cornfields) were found in the second field
    investigation carried out on 18 September. This is similar to the situation in
    the previous year (2000) mapped by IKONOS images, as displayed in figure 2( c).
    This portion of IKONOS images was acquired mostly in September 2000, although
    the image acquisitions spanned from August to October 2000. The interpreted results
    of figure 2( c), combined with information observed from the second field investigation
    as well as the information from figure 2( a) and (b) are shown in figure 2( d).
    The acreage of each crop is also included in table 1. The total acreage of the
    fallow lands in this time of 2000 (mostly September) was 484.164 acres, which
    is similar to the total acreage of cornfields (492.191) in 2001. Also included
    from the IKONOS images of 2000 is the 1042.319 acres covered by ‘other crops’
    (table 1). The type of ‘other crops’ in 2000 is cotton, since cotton is usually
    harvested later than corn. In the third ground investigation of early November,
    only cotton (ready to be harvested) and alfalfa remained, while most of the harvested
    cornfields were growing sorgum, which will be ploughed for soil fertilizer in
    December. Figure 2 Images and related ground investigation(ground data) results.

    three field investigations provided the baseline information for various crops
    and experiences for selecting the training sites and for image interpretations.
    4. Pre‐processing and classifications 4.1 Excluding non‐agricultural fields A
    pre‐classification process was conducted to improve classification accuracy. The
    pre‐processing involves the creation of a mask for excluding non‐agricultural
    areas before the classification. figure 3 is a part of the Lower Valley image
    mosaicked from 183 IKONOS images. It visually shows that non‐agricultural fields
    (residential, commercial, school, road system) are blended with agricultural fields
    (green and white polygons). Furthermore, the far right portion (east) of the image
    is the dessert area, while the far left portion (west) of the image is the agriculture
    area in Mexican side (Rio Grande River is the border of the USA and Mexico). Due
    to the spectral similarities of objects in multi‐spectral imagery, a simple threshold‐based
    NDVI classification method as well as supervised‐based classification methods
    without pre‐classification processing are not capable of distinguishing the backyard
    grasses and trees in the residential area from crops. Similarly, spectral resemblance
    occurs to parking lots, roads, buildings, even desert area and fallow lands. Therefore,
    it was hypothesized that creating a mask to exclude the non‐agricultural fields
    would improve the classification accuracy. Figure 3 Portion of the mosaicked IKONOS
    image(tile rows 42–55) in the Lower Valley. Green and white polygons within the
    El Paso irrigation area overlaid on the image are the classified agricultural
    fields. They are active crops and fallow lands, respectively. Display full size
    Ancillary data in GIS format, such as road edge, hydro line, hydro area, parcel
    map, and irrigation boundary, were used for the creation of the mask. Road edge
    covers all of the paved roads (not including the small roads among agriculture
    fields). Hydro line refers to the small irrigation ditches and hydro area refers
    to the larger irrigation ditches. Both these two features overlap with most of
    unpaved roads, although they are much narrower than unpaved roads. Therefore,
    buffer zones of 25 feet on both sides of the hydro line and hydro area were created
    to mask these unpaved roads. Parcel maps were used to mask out residential, business,
    and school areas such as grassy lawns, sports fields, parking lots, and buildings.
    The irrigation boundary is used to exclude the areas outside the El Paso irrigation
    area such as the dessert area to the east and the Mexican side to the west. Then
    these five types of GIS layers were merged into one shapefile for exclusion from
    classification. With this shapefile, a mask shapefile that only covers the agriculture
    fields can then be created. In order to incorporate the mask into classification
    in ENVI software, a binary image of the mask was first produced from the mask
    shapefile. 4.2 Supervised classification There are many supervised classification
    methods such as parallelepiped, maximum likelihood, Mahalanobis distance, neural
    network, and spectral angle mapper. For an accurate classification in our preliminary
    test, we chose the SAM supervised classification in this study. Following usual
    procedures, we also conducted post‐classification with the popular methods, such
    as combining classes, sieve classes, and clump classes. For simplicity, we only
    detail the SAM method and the selection of training sites, while all methods and
    procedures used are summarized in table 2. Table 2. Summary of SAM‐based classification
    procedure. Download CSVDisplay Table 4.2.1 N‐dimensional visualizer and spectral
    endmembers selection Due to the heterogeneity of the land uses in the study site,
    training areas (polygons) were carefully handpicked as polygons in GIS throughout
    the entire irrigation area (not limited in the field data area). Since the same
    crop type (such as corn) may vary in spectral characteristics from field to field
    depending on growing status, water stress, pest infestation, and soil type, we
    usually picked many sites of each variation and then grouped all of them into
    one crop (corn, for example). Similarly, we also grouped many sites of bare soils,
    harvested lands, or ploughed fields throughout the entire irrigation area as fallow
    lands. The field investigations (§3) significantly helped the selection of training
    sites for July 2001. For other old images—four scenes of ETM+ images and all IKONOS
    images—the selection of training sites completely depended on expert''s knowledge
    due to the project not beginning until June 2001. The training polygons selected
    in GIS were converted as regions of interest (ROIs) in ENVI (image processing
    software). These ROIs were used in the N‐dimensional visualizer of ENVI to identify
    the purest pixels (i.e. most extreme spectral responses), or spectral endmembers.
    4.2.2 SAM classifier The SAM classifier is a physically‐based spectral classification
    method that uses n‐dimensional angles to match pixels to reference spectra. The
    algorithm determines the similarity between two spectra by calculating the angle
    between the spectra, treating them as vectors in a space with dimensionality equal
    to the number of bands. This technique, when used on calibrated reflectance data,
    is relatively insensitive to illumination and albedo effects. The SAM classification
    was conducted for both ETM+ and IKONOS images to classify the active crops and
    fallow lands of the El Paso County. An endmember spectrum used by SAM in this
    study was first extracted directly from the ROIs by averaging spectra derived
    from the previous section. SAM compares the angle between the endmember spectrum
    vector (ROI) and each pixel vector of the image in n‐dimensional space. Smaller
    angles (in radians) represent closer matches to the reference spectrum. Pixels
    with a spectral angle larger than a user‐specified maximum angle threshold (in
    radians) are not classified (ENVI User''s Guide, Research System, Inc. 2000, Kruse
    et al. 1993). Selecting the maximum angle threshold value is an important factor
    for successfully using SAM classification. Crosta et al. ( 1998) noticed that
    changes in the value of the threshold produced significant changes in the number
    of pixels classified as one of the reference spectrum. For that reason, we tested
    numerous threshold values for each case, and selected a value that resulted in
    the best classification compared with field data or conceptual valuation based
    on experiences. For the IKONOS images, the threshold value of 0.03 is the best
    value for both active crops and fallow land (table 2). For ETM+ images, the best
    values are 0.08–0.13 for active crops, and 0.05–0.06 for fallow land except for
    the ETM+ image of 12 September 1999. The endmembers of the 1999 image came directly
    from the image of 7 September 2000 due to being the same time of year. However,
    these endmembers worked very well for the year 2000 images, but did not work well
    for the 1999 image. As a complement, endmembers for the image of 1999 were readjusted
    by adding new endmembers and deleting some existing ones, and the threshold values
    were increased to be much larger than the previous threshold values used for the
    image of year 2000 (table 2). This experience suggests that (1) the training endmembers
    usually vary greatly for multi‐temporal images, even for the two images acquired
    in almost the same day (or month) in different years; and (2) there are limitations
    for any standard spectral library due to varying atmospheric and illumination
    conditions since perfect atmospheric correction is impossible. table 2 summarizes
    the key processes in the classification. figure 4 is the general work flow chart
    of SAM‐based classification procedure for using an ETM+ image. The non‐agricultural
    fields were all excluded from IKONOS and ETM+ images by using the mask created
    in §4.1. Figure 4 SAM‐based classification procedure using integrated remote sensing–GIS
    technology. Steps with dashed‐line frames are remote sensing methods, and steps
    with solid‐line frames are GIS methods. Display full size 4.3 NDVI‐based classification
    Vegetation indices have been widely used for tracking green biomass, leaf area
    index of crop canopies, and fractional amount of net radiation (Hatfield et al.
    1984; Daughtry et al. 1990, Jackson and Huete 1991, Kustas et al. 1993). NDVI
    is one of the most widely used indices for indicating the amount of green vegetation
    present in a pixel—higher NDVI values indicate more green vegetation (Jensen 1986,
    Jackson et al. 1988; Pinter et al. 2003). The NDVI method transforms multi‐spectral
    data (bands 3 and 4 of ETM+) into a single image representing the vegetation distribution
    by using equation (1) : where b 3 and b 4 are band 3 and band 4 of the ETM+ image,
    respectively. Valid results fall between −1 and +1. The larger the pixel value,
    the higher the fraction of vegetation cover within the pixel. After using the
    relative atmospheric correction (dark subtraction) method, many threshold values
    were examined against ground data. A threshold NDVI of 0.15 was found to produce
    the highest classification accuracy for separating vegetation cover from other
    land covers. The work flow chart in figure 5 describes the NDVI‐based classification
    scheme with GIS (ArcGIS) and remote sensing software (ENVI). The process with
    the NDVI‐based method as described in this flowchart is more time efficient than
    the one with the SAM method (figure 4). Using the SAM method is time consuming
    since the selection for training sites is labour intensive and depends on professional
    experiences. The NDVI method is efficient since it does not require training site
    selection. It is also computation efficient (several hours for classifying one
    image compared with 2–3 days with the SAM method since selecting the training
    site is labour intensive and needs professional experience). Figure 5 NDVI‐based
    classification procedure using integrated remote sensing–GIS technology. Steps
    1–8 (dashed‐line frames) are remote sensing methods, and steps 9–15 (solid‐line
    frames) are GIS methods. Display full size 5. Classification results and accuracy
    assessment The results produced from both supervised (SAM) and NDVI‐based classification
    approaches on multi‐temporal ETM+ images covering a period of 3 years (29 September
    1999, 10 June 2000, 7 September 2000, 26 April 2001, and 15 July 2001) are illustrated
    in tables 3 and 4, respectively. Since one scene of ETM+ image covers the entire
    county''s agriculture area, the classification result should reflect the actual
    situation in an irrigation rotation. Table 3. Classification results from SAM‐based

    procedure. Download CSVDisplay Table The classification using the SAM method resulted
    in 42 374 acres of active crops and 4826 acres of fallow lands for the ETM+ image
    of 15 July 2001 (table 3). The confusion matrix and ground data information were
    employed to assess the accuracy of the classifications. This was the only adopted
    imagery whose acquisition time matched the first of the three field data. figure
    6( a) shows the ground investigation on the image of 15 July 2001 (field data
    on 25 July), and figure 6( a) is the SAM classification result. The number of
    total pixels in the ground data was 8495 (figure 6( a)). All of the pixels are
    crop lands; there were no fallow land during this time (figure 2( a) and (b)).
    Of these, 7954 were correctly classified as crop lands in figure 6( b). The accuracy
    is 93.63%, and unclassified is 6.37%. Figure 6 The ground data(a) and classification

    the same image acquired in 15 July 2001, 42 168 acres of active crops and 5032
    acres of fallow lands were classified. The results from NDVI differencing matched
    well to the results of SAM classification (with 93.63% overall accuracy). figure
    7 shows the comparison of classification results of crop lands and their percentage
    differences based on SAM and NDVI from the five images. The percentage difference
    is calculated by the equation: where acresNDVI and acresSAM are acres of active
    crops classified using the NDVI and SAM methods, respectively. From the figure,
    it is clear that by using the SAM and NDVI methods, the classification accuracies
    are almost the same. The percentage of differences between two methods are from
    the minimum of ∼0% for the image for 15 July 2001 to the maximum of ∼12% for the
    image for 26 April 2001. Similar accuracy suggests that the more complex supervised
    SAM method did not show significant advantage over the NDVI differencing. In other
    words, the NDVI method jointly with a pre‐classification processing is sufficient
    for separating between active crops and fallow lands. In addition to accuracy
    assessment, the NDVI method requires only threshold values for transformation
    from NDVI to ROIs and a process of excluding non‐agricultural fields blended with
    agricultural areas. Therefore, the NDVI method is more straightforward to use
    compared to the SAM method. The differences between SAM and NDVI method are (1)
    SAM uses all available spectral bands such as six bands for the ETM+ image and
    four bands for the IKONOS image, while NDVI uses only two bands (bands 3 and 4
    for both ETM+ and IKONOS); and (2) SAM is a supervised classification method,
    requiring selection of training sites before classification, while NDVI does not.
    SAM is very good for a hyperspectral image (spectral resolution 20 nm or better)
    where hundreds of spectral bands (wavelengths) are used for classification, while
    NDVI only uses two spectral bands or wavelengths (red and near‐infrared), which
    does not represent the whole spectral picture of an object. For a multi‐spectral
    image (spectral resolution 200 nm or worse), however, only six or four bands are
    available. So it does not make too much difference whether the SAM or NDVI method
    is used, however the SAM method is complex in three aspects: Figure 7 Comparison
    of classification results of crop lands from SAM and NDVI and their differences
    in percentages. Display full size It requires ground investigation for selection
    of training sites, which is not always possible or convenient. For example, it
    is impossible to conduct ground investigation for images acquired in past years.
    So selecting training areas when using old images depends completely on the experience
    of an interpreter. This is the case of this study: four ETM+ images (before 15
    July 2001) and all IKONOS images. Collection of endmembers with the N‐dimensional
    visualizer in ENVI is an interactive tool depending largely on the knowledge of
    experts. The threshold value (the maximum angle) in the SAM method is very sensitive
    to the classification results. The threshold value selection requires exhaustive
    searching and the experience of an interpreter. On the other hand, the NDVI method
    does not have above deficiencies for the purpose of classifying crop lands from
    fallow lands, and will perform the same for any image no matter whether current
    or old, because NDVI does not involve the selection of training sites and it does
    not require a very experienced interpreter. So NDVI could provide better, reliable,
    and consistent accuracy of classification results for the purpose of water management.
    Having carried out the above analysis, we should point out that the supervised
    SAM classification is adequate for classifying different crops such as cotton,
    corn, and alfalfa if proper spectral resolution imagery is used. However in this
    case, all these different crops will be grouped into one class: active crops.
    The remaining objects are in fallow land. In other words, these two classes are
    either green or non‐green, which was accurately separated by the NDVI method.
    However, without the mask previously built, it is difficult to achieve high accuracy
    of classification from both NDVI and SAM methods based on the ETM+ imagery. The
    results of using SAM classification on the entire mosaicked IKONOS image did not
    match the real situation very well, because 386 scenes of IKONOS images were acquired,
    spanning a time period of different irrigation rotations (August 2000 to February
    2001). As an example, figure 8 shows the classification result by using the SAM
    method on IKONOS images. It was visually observed that crops in a field are not
    homogeneous (figure 8( a)). The SAM classification (figure 8( b)) overlaying on
    the IKONOS image could identify bare areas (patches) inside agricultural fields.
    These holes (patches) represent that these crops are in poor condition: less water,
    less fertility, more pests, or salt accumulation. Miyamoto ( 2000) concluded that
    most of these holes are due to salt accumulation, because the soil in these fields
    is silt clay, which has features such as inadequate soil permeability and lower
    water infiltration, especially when the soil is compacted or affected by sodium.
    The information is very useful in farming management such as watering, fertilizing,
    identifying presence of pests, or assessing water quality. In other words, it
    is useful to achieve precision agriculture. A disadvantage is that these holes
    could cause mis‐classification between a crop land in poor conditions and a fallow
    land. This suggests that the higher resolution of IKONOS imagery does not guarantee
    higher classification accuracy in this case. The results based on ETM+ imagery
    may ignore these holes and obtain better classification results except for those
    holes bigger than 30 m. Figure 8 Classification catches these holes (bare areas)
    inside fields. (a) The IKONOS image and (b) the classification results overlaying

    method combined with pre‐processing to exclude non‐agricultural fields for mapping
    and measuring the acreages of active crop lands in order to improve irrigation
    management. The evaluation was based on Landsat ETM+ images and was through the
    comparison to a supervised classification method, namely SAM. The similar classification
    accuracies from the two methods demonstrated that the more advanced classification,
    the SAM approach, did not have a clear advantage compared to the method using
    NDVI at the level of distinguishing between active crops and fallow lands, except
    its potential to make more detailed classification, such as further classifying
    crops into corn, cotton and alfalfa. However, this potential capability of the
    SAM method came with the more complex processing (such as selection of training
    sites, N‐dimensional visualizer, selection of spectral endmembers, and post‐classification)
    and exhaustive searching for some proper threshold values (such as specifying
    the spectral angle threshold and sieve pixel threshold). The accurate classification
    from the relatively simple method of using NDVI differencing demonstrated that
    involving ancillary data in pre‐classification processing is an effective scheme
    for avoiding a complex classification method. Because it is accuracy‐reliable
    and cost‐effective, we recommend the NDVI method with pre‐processing to exclude
    some of the unwanted objects as a practical approach in mapping and measuring
    the acreage of active croplands for irrigation management and planning. A comparative
    test was also made to see if high spatial resolution remote sensing images would
    have significant advantages in extracting active crop lands from an agricultural
    region. By examining IKONOS and Landsat ETM+ images, it is clear that using ETM+
    instead of IKONOS high spatial resolution imageries is appropriate in this application.
    When using high resolution images it is difficult to handle the heterogeneity
    of agricultural fields, so salt and pepper effects are unavoidable (Yu et al.
    2006), such as wrong classification patches caused by water stress, by presence
    of pests, or by accumulation of salt. This result made this testing worthwhile,
    because using ETM+ would also have the advantage of avoiding the high cost of
    purchasing IKONOS images and would be an appropriate data source for irrigation
    management in arid or semi‐arid areas. The study provided valuable insights into
    selecting an appropriate classification method as well as a proper type of imagery
    for increasing classification accuracy, reducing complexity, enhancing computation
    efficiency, and maximizing the cost efficiency. Acknowledgements This project

    \ (400 words) \n34 \nNet carbon balance on croplands depends on numerous factors\
    \ (e.g., crop type, soil, climate \n35 \nand management practices) and their interactions.\
    \ Agroecosystem models are generally used to \n36 \nassess cropland carbon fluxes\
    \ under various agricultural land use and land management practices \n37 \nbecause\
    \ of their ability to capture the complex interactive effects of factors influencing\
    \ carbon \n38 \nbalance. For regional carbon flux simulations, generally gridded\
    \ climate data sets are used because \n39 \nthey offer data for each grid cell\
    \ of the region of interest. However, studies consistently report large \n40 \n\
    uncertainties in gridded climate datasets, which will affect the accuracy of carbon\
    \ flux simulations.  \n41 \nThis study investigates the uncertainties in daily\
    \ weather variables of commonly used high \n42 \nresolution gridded climate datasets\
    \ in the U.S (NARR, NLDAS, Prism and Daymet), and their impact \n43 \non the accuracy\
    \ of simulated Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) under irrigated and non-irrigated\
    \ corn \n44 \nand soybeans using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC)\
    \ agroecosystem model and \n45 \nobservational data at four flux tower cropland\
    \ sites in the U.S Midwest region. Further, the relative \n46 \nsignificance of\
    \ each weather variable in influencing the uncertainty in flux estimates was evaluated.\
    \ \n47 \nResults suggest that daily weather variables in all gridded climate datasets\
    \ display some \n48 \ndegree of bias, leading to considerable uncertainty in simulated\
    \ NEE. The gridded climate datasets \n49 \nproduced based on interpolation techniques\
    \ (i.e. Daymet and Prism) were shown to have less \n50 \nuncertainties, and resulted\
    \ in NEE estimates with relatively higher accuracy, likely due to their \n51 \n\
    higher spatial resolution and higher dependency on meteorological station observations.\
    \ The Mean \n52 \nAbsolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) values of average growing\
    \ season NEE estimates for Dayment, \n53 \nPrism, NLDAS and NARR include 22.53%,\
    \ 23.45%, 62.52% and 66.18%, respectively. The NEE \n54 \nunder irrigation management\
    \ (MAPE= 53.15%) tends to be more sensitive to uncertainties compared \n55 \n\
    to the fluxes under non-irrigation (MAPE= 34.19%).  \n56 \nFurther, this study\
    \ highlights that NEE respond differently to the individual climate variables,\
    \ \n57 \nand responses vary with management practices. Under irrigation management,\
    \ NEE are more \n58 \nsensitive to shortwave radiation and temperature. Conversely,\
    \ under non-irrigation management, \n59 \nprecipitation is the most dominant climate\
    \ factor influencing uncertainty in simulated NEE. These \n60 \nfindings demonstrate\
    \ that careful consideration is necessary when selecting climate data to mitigate\
    \ \n61 \nuncertainties in simulated NEE. Further, alternative approaches such\
    \ as integration of remote sensing \n62 \ndata products may help reduce the models’\
    \ dependency on climate datasets and improve the accuracy \n63 \nin the simulated\
    \ CO2 fluxes. \n64 \n \n65 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2020-129\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ \n66 \nThere has been renewed interest in tracking carbon on croplands because\
    \ of their potential to \n67 \noffset atmospheric CO2 through sequestering carbon\
    \ in crop vegetation and soil, and also soil carbon \n68 \nindicates the status\
    \ of soil quality affecting long term crop production. Croplands act either as\
    \ a \n69 \nsource or sink for atmospheric CO2 depending on numerous factors (e.g.\
    \ crop type, soil \n70 \ncharacteristics, climatic conditions and management practices),\
    \ and their interactions. For instance, \n71 \nstudies of continuous long-term\
    \ flux tower measurements of CO2 exchange on agricultural sites have \n72 \ndemonstrated\
    \ that conservation practices (e.g., no tillage) promote significant amounts of\
    \ carbon \n73 \nsequestration; thus, making such agricultural systems behave as\
    \ a strong net carbon sink (Hollinger et \n74 \nal., 2005; Bernacchi et al., 2005).\
    \ Sustainable agricultural management practices are estimated to \n75 \nresult\
    \ in approximately 45-98 Tg C year-1 soil carbon sequestration on US croplands\
    \ (Lal et al., 1998; \n76 \nChambers et al., 2016). On the other hand, intensive\
    \ land use and land management practices (e.g., \n77 \nconventional tillage, residue\
    \ burning) in agriculture often lead to negative carbon balance, leaving \n78\
    \ \nthese systems as a source for atmospheric CO2 (Anderson-Teixeira et al., 2009).\
    \ These intensive \n79 \npractices not only contribute to climate change, but\
    \ also lead to deterioration of soil fertility through \n80 \nlosing soil organic\
    \ carbon, subsequently affecting long term agriculture production. The magnitude\
    \ \n81 \nof impact on carbon balance with different agricultural land use and\
    \ management practices is highly \n82 \nvariable in space and time, and depends\
    \ on environmental conditions and geographic characteristics \n83 \n(Hernandez-Ramirez\
    \ et al., 2011). As such, there exists a need for understanding the impact of\
    \ \n84 \nvarious agronomic practices and their interactions under various soil\
    \ and management regimes on \n85 \nregional scale carbon dynamics. Such a knowledge\
    \ base will help in developing effective policies \n86 \nand management strategies\
    \ targeting carbon friendly agriculture at local to regional scale.  \n87 \n Agroecosystem\
    \ models are tools widely used for analyses integrating the effects of climate,\
    \ \n88 \ncrop, soil, and land-use (Jones et al., 2017). Such models employ biophysical\
    \ and biogeochemical \n89 \nprinciples coupled with crop management, climate and\
    \ soils to simulate detailed carbon balance \n90 \n(Izaurralde et al, 2006; Bandaru\
    \ et al., 2013). Climate variables are dominant factors influencing \n91 \nmodel\
    \ simulations substantially (Agarwal, 1995). Models rely on weather inputs to\
    \ simulate critical \n92 \ncrop parameters (crop phenology, leaf area index [LAI]\
    \ and evapotranspiration [ET]) that determine \n93 \ncrop growth and development,\
    \ subsequently impacting the net primary productivity (NPP), a primary \n94 \n\
    carbon input. In addition, weather variables (e.g. temperature and precipitation)\
    \ drive the simulation \n95 \nof soil respiration, which impacts NEE. Therefore,\
    \ errors in weather variables will introduce \n96 \nuncertainty in the model estimates\
    \ of carbon dynamics, and the magnitude of uncertainty depends not \n97 \nonly\
    \ on the level of error but also on an indefinite weather variable. For instance,\
    \ soil respiration is \n98 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2020-129\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ more sensitive to temperature inconsistencies than other weather variables (Jones\
    \ et al., \n99 \n2003). As such, a small margin of error in temperature irregularities\
    \ may have substantial impacts on \n100 \nsoil respiration estimates.  \n101 \n\
    \ Models use either point scale in-situ observational data collected at meteorological\
    \ stations or \n102 \ngridded climate databases that include geographically distributed\
    \ weather estimates produced using \n103 \neither 1) interpolating observational\
    \ climate data and other ancillary datasets (e.g. topographic \n104 \ncharacteristics)\
    \ or (2) data modeling and assimilation techniques that model regional changes\
    \ in \n105 \nweather based on satellite observations, land cover, local geographical\

    \ scale carbon flux simulations, generally gridded climate \n107 \ndata sets are\
    \ used because they offer data for each grid cell of the region of interest, while\
    \ insufficient \n108 \ndensity of meteorological stations restricted the accurate\
    \ representation of inherent spatial weather \n109 \npatterns over large regions\
    \ (Bandaru et al., 2017). However, studies have been consistently reporting \n\
    110 \nlarge uncertainties in gridded climate datasets (Van Wart et al., 2013;\
    \ Bandaru et al., 2017). For \n111 \ninstance, recently Bandaru et al. (2017)\
    \ found higher biases in monthly weather variables (e.g. up to \n112 \n3°C in\
    \ minimum temperature) of high-resolution climate datasets generally used in the\
    \ U.S, which \n113 \nwere found to result in percent errors up to 45% in biomass\
    \ of hybrid poplar, a short rotation woody \n114 \ncropping system, simulated\
    \ using 3-PG forest growth model. Similarly, other studies reported \n115 \nuncertainties\
    \ ranging 10-50% in carbon fluxes under forest systems (Ito and Sasai, 2006; Poulter\
    \ et \n116 \nal., 2011; Wu et al., 2017). However, there are no or very limited\
    \ studies on understanding \n117 \nuncertainties in modeled cropland carbon fluxes.\
    \ Crop models are typically run on daily time steps so \n118 \nbiases in daily\
    \ climate variables are expected to be different from those in monthly variables.\
    \ As \n119 \nsuch, currently, there is a knowledge gap on the level of uncertainty\
    \ in the estimated daily carbon \n120 \nfluxes with the use of gridded climate\
    \ datasets in the agroecosystem models, and the relative \n121 \nimportance of\
    \ each of the weather variables (e.g. precipitation) affecting accuracy of carbon\
    \ flux \n122 \nestimates.  As such, this study was conducted to 1) quantify the\
    \ degree of uncertainty in daily \n123 \nweather variables of four gridded climate\

    \ the uncertainty in the four gridded datasets, observed weather data from four\
    \ \n134 \nflux tower sites located in U.S. Midwest were used as reference data\
    \ while quantifying the level of \n135 \nuncertainty in five weather variables\
    \ typically required for agroecosystem models. These weather \n136 \nvariables\
    \ include (1) minimum air temperature (Tmin), (2) maximum air temperature (Tmax),\
    \ (3) \n137 \nshortwave radiation (SR), (4) precipitation (Precip), and (5) relative\
    \ humidity (RH). Further, we used \n138 \nthe Environmental Policy Integrated\
    \ Climate (EPIC) model to understand the influence of biases in \n139 \ngridded\
    \ datasets on daily NEE under irrigated and non-irrigated corn and soybeans. First,\
    \ we \n140 \ncalibrated the EPIC model for corn and soybean crops using measured\
    \ weather at flux tower sites, \n141 \nmanagement and observed NEE data. Then\
    \ 5 different site-level simulations were carried out using \n142 \nweather variables\
    \ from four different gridded weather data sources, along with measured weather\
    \ at \n143 \nthe tower sites (Table-1). Later, NEE simulated by the measured weather\
    \ data was used as a \n144 \nreference and assessed uncertainty in the NEE estimated\
    \ using NARR, NLDAS, Daymet and Prism \n145 \ngridded datasets. Finally, to evaluate\
    \ the relative contribution of each weather variable to the \n146 \nuncertainty\
    \ in the NEE estimates, simulations were run using a single weather variable from\
    \ the \n147 \ngridded datasets, and the rest of the weather variables were measured\
    \ at sites for each simulation. For \n148 \ninstance, to understand the impact\
    \ of biases in shortwave radiation, simulations were run using \n149 \nshortwave\
    \ radiation data from all four gridded data sources and the remaining weather\
    \ variables (i.e. \n150 \nTmax, Tmin, precipitation and relative humidity) from\
    \ measured data at the flux tower sites. \n151 \n2.1 Study sites \n152 \nFor this\
    \ study, three AmeriFlux field experimental sites (US-NE1, US-NE2 and US-NE3)\
    \ \n153 \nlocated at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL) Agricultural Research\
    \ and Development \n154 \nCenter near Mead, Nebraska were selected, as well as\
    \ one AmeriFlux field site (US-BO1) at \n155 \nBondville, Illinois (Meyers, 2016)\
    \ (Table 1). These four sites are characterized by diverse crop \n156 \nmanagement\
    \ practices. US-NE1 (41°09′54.2″N, -96°28′35.9″W) and US-NE2 (41°09′53.6″N, -\n\

    \ continuously planted with corn since 2001 while US-NE2, US-\n160 \nNE3 and US-BO1\
    \ are generally planted with corn and soybeans in rotation. Weather variables,\

    \ Weather Databases \n164 \nAgroecosystem models prefer high resolution climate\
    \ data, when available, to capture \n165 \nheterogeneity present in agricultural\
    \ landscapes. As such, we evaluated four commonly used gridded \n166 \ndatasets\
    \ characterized by spatial resolution finer than 0.5° and covering the spatial\
    \ extent of the U.S. \n167 \nThe details of the selected gridded data are listed\
    \ in Table 2. These datasets are classified into two \n168 \ngroups. The data\
    \ sets in the first group include NARR and NLDAS, which are determined based on\
    \ \n169 \natmospheric models and assimilation techniques, while the second group\
    \ datasets (i.e. Daymet and \n170 \nPrism) are produced by spatially interpolating\
    \ weather observations collected from various weather \n171 \nmonitoring networks.\
    \ \n172 \n2.2.1. NARR (North American Regional Reanalysis):  \n173 \nThe NARR\
    \ gridded dataset (approximately 32 km spatial resolution) is produced at three-\n\
    174 \nhour intervals using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)\
    \ Eta model, a \n175 \nmesoscale weather forecasting atmospheric model, along\
    \ with the Regional Data Assimilation \n176 \nSystem (RDAS) (DiMegoet al., 1992).\
    \ RDAS integrates data variables from various sources (e.g. \n177 \noutputs from\
    \ the NCAR/NCEP Global reanalysis) (Mesinger et al., 2006) using a three-dimensional\
    \ \n178 \nvariational analysis scheme (3DVAR) and statistical interpolation (Kalnay\
    \ et al., 1996), and produces \n179 \nfine spatial and temporal resolution estimates\
    \ of various weather variables.  \n180 \n2.2.2. NLDAS (North American Land Data\
    \ Assimilation System)  \n181 \nNLDAS produces high spatial (1/8°, approximately\
    \ 12 km) and temporal (1-h) resolution \n182 \nweather variables through downscaling,\
    \ and adjusts weather variables to account for the vertical \n183 \ndifference\
    \ between the NARR and NLDAS fields (Cosgrove et al., 2003). In addition, it corrects\
    \ \n184 \nbiases in shortwave radiation using Geostationary Operational Environmental\
    \ Satellite (GOES) data \n185 \n(Pinkeret al., 2003). NLDAS precipitation data\
    \ are constructed by taking daily gauge-based \n186 \nprecipitation data and disaggregating\
    \ to hourly resolution using radar data (Xia et al., 2012). \n187 \n2.2.3. PRISM\
    \ (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) \n188 \nPrism\
    \ generates gridded weather data at two spatial resolutions (800 m and 4 km) and\
    \ two \n189 \ntemporal resolutions (daily and monthly) by interpolating observed\
    \ weather at weather station \n190 \nnetworks (Abatzoglou, 2013). Prism uses gridded\
    \ elevation data and computes a climate-elevation \n191 \nregression for each\
    \ grid cell using observed data of nearby stations. Each station included in the\
    \ \n192 \nregression is weighted based on similarity in physiographic characteristics\
    \ (Daly et al., 2008). \n193 \n2.2.4. Daymet:  \n194 \nDaymet interpolates daily\

    2.3 Estimation of uncertainties in gridded weather \n200 \nTo estimate the uncertainties\
    \ in weather variables of gridded datasets, measured climate data \n201 \nat flux\
    \ tower sites were acquired from the Ameriflux website (http://ameriflux.lbl.gov/).\
    \ Flux tower \n202 \ndata was selected as opposed to observational data at meteorological\
    \ weather stations because \n203 \nstations’ data are generally used as an input\
    \ for producing some of the gridded datasets (i.e. Prism \n204 \nand Daymet) and\
    \ therefore do not constitute as an independent source for comparison. Weather\
    \ \n205 \nvariables of each gridded dataset corresponding to each flux tower site\
    \ were obtained. The Prism and \n206 \nDaymet datasets provide daily weather variables\
    \ whereas NARR and NLDAS produce data at 3-hour \n207 \nand 1-hour temporal resolution,\
    \ respectively. As such, NARR and NLDAS variables were aggregated \n208 \nto produce\
    \ daily data and compared with daily flux tower data. Two metrics were used to\
    \ assess the \n209 \naccuracy in the gridded datasets: 1) bias and 2) Mean Absolute\
    \ Percentage Error (MAPE).  The bias \n210 \ndenotes the deviation in the values\
    \ of gridded weather variables from the corresponding measured \n211 \nvalues\
    \ at flux tower sites, and is used to compute the direction (i.e. under- or over-estimation)\
    \ of the \n212 \nuncertainty. A negative bias indicates underestimation compared\
    \ to the flux tower observed data, \n213 \nwhile a positive bias indicates overestimation\
    \ of the values. The MAPE values represent average \n214 \nerror and can be used\
    \ to assess the uncertainties in the gridded datasets. The bias and MAPE for \n\
    215 \nprecipitation, Tmax, Tmin, shortwave radiation and relative humidity of\

    \ \n233 \nThe EPIC model simulates biophysical and biogeochemical ecosystem processes\
    \ as \n234 \ninfluenced by climate, landscape, soil and management conditions\
    \ (Williams et al., 1989; 2008). The \n235 \ncarbon cycling module in EPIC was\
    \ developed based on the Century model (Parton et al., 1994), and \n236 \nit includes\
    \ detailed carbon routines that consider coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling to\
    \ simulate \n237 \ncarbon stocks and fluxes (both vertical and lateral fluxes)\
    \ in managed and unmanaged lands. The \n238 \nEPIC carbon model has been well-tested\
    \ and widely used for studying carbon dynamics under \n239 \ndifferent cropping\
    \ systems, management regimes, locations and at various scales (Apezteguía et\
    \ al., \n240 \n2009; Bandaru et al., 2013; Izaurralde et al., 2007; Wang et al.,\
    \ 2005). \n241 \n2.3.3. Model calibration: \n242 \nTo calibrate the model, we\
    \ have used collected and measured data at flux tower sites on soil, \n243 \n\
    weather, management practices and NEE, and implemented simulations at these sites\
    \ for all available \n244 \ndata and available years as listed in Table 1. The\
    \ parameters were adjusted to optimize NEE \n245 \nestimates against measured\
    \ flux data utilizing multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II (Deb et al., \n\
    246 \n2002). This method aims to provide near-optimal parameter sets for simulating\
    \ each model output as \n247 \nwell as a compromise between desired outcomes in\
    \ order to identify parameter sets which provide \n248 \nmore balanced model outcomes\
    \ than single objective approaches. The calibrated results suggested \n249 \n\
    that model was able to explain the variability present in the measured fluxes\
    \ reasonably well, \n250 \nindicated by higher R2 and low RMSE values for all\
    \ the sites (Figure 2). The R2 and RMSE (in \n251 \nbracket) values were 0.80\
    \ (29.11), 0.76 (30.34), 0.62 (34.05) and 0.61 (48.67) for US-NE1, US-NE2, \n\
    252 \nUS-NE3 and US-BO1, respectively. We used these calibration settings to simulate\

    \ input from the Soil Survey Geographic \n258 \n(SSURGO) database (http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/).\
    \ The simulations were implemented for 12 \n259 \nyears (i.e. 2002 to 2012) for\

    \ For each simulation, one weather variable from \n265 \neach of the gridded datasets\

    \ using measured weather data at flux tower sites \n270 \n(hereafter, referred\
    \ to as reference fluxes) and compared them with estimated NEE using gridded \n\
    271 \nweather datasets. Similar metrics (i.e. bias and MAPE) for evaluating uncertainty\
    \ in the weather \n272 \nvariables were used for assessing the uncertainty in\

    \ and \n277 \nTmin ranges from -3.94°C to 6.67°C depending on climate data source\
    \ and the day of the growing \n278 \nseason. Results showed that NARR and NLDAS\
    \ overestimated Tmin while Daymet and Prism did not \n279 \nexhibit any consistent\
    \ pattern showing both negative and positive bias values across the growing \n\
    280 \nseason. All data sources were shown to overestimate Tmax for most of the\

    \ Overall, the MAPE in both Tmax and Tmin tends to \n282 \nbe higher at the beginning\
    \ and end of the growing season irrespective of the data source. Among the \n\
    283 \nclimate datasets, Prism was found to have the lowest MAPE in Tmax and Tmin\
    \ with an average \n284 \ngrowing season MAPE of 17.31% and 32.16%, respectively,\
    \ followed by Daymet with 17.75% and \n285 \n38.86% MAPE for Tmax and Tmin, respectively\
    \ (Table 3), but there is no significant difference \n286 \nbetween the two datasets.\
    \ The NLDAS’s Tmax and Tmin, on average, have 18.93% and 76.59% \n287 \nMAPE,\

    \ the season, irrespective of the data source, with values ranging from 19.89\

    \ and Daymet (average over locations=107.27%) (Table \n298 \n3). Unlike temperature\
    \ and radiation variables, the daily uncertainty in precipitation data did not\
    \ \n299 \nexhibit any specific behavior and showed inconsistency across the growing\

    \ spreading from -8.54 to 7.20 mm depending on \n301 \nthe data source and date\
    \ of the growing season. Further, all data sources have a high level of \n302\
    \ \nuncertainty in precipitation as shown by MAPE ranging 2.5 to 253.89%. The\

    \ compared to NLDAS (MAPE=157.13%) and NARR \n305 \n(MAPE=180.08%) (Table 3).\
    \ Results showed that all data sources underestimated relative humidity \n306\
    \ \nfor most of the days with bias values ranging from -21.13 to 4.23.  Among\

    \ MAPE in the daily NEE averaged over the years and grouped by irrigation \n323\
    \ \nmanagement are presented in Figure 5. Bias values in NEE range from -96.01\
    \ kg ha-1 day-1 to 104.11 \n324 \nkg ha-1 day-1 while MAPE in estimated fluxes\
    \ spans from 0.01% to 391.09%. The magnitude of bias \n325 \nand MAPE depends\
    \ on the source of the gridded data, day of the growing season, irrigation \n\
    326 \nmanagement and crop type. Bias in simulated fluxes early in the growing\
    \ season was observed to be \n327 \nnegative, indicating either overestimation\
    \ of carbon gain or underestimation of carbon loss, while \n328 \nlater in the\
    \ growing season, bias values were positive, suggesting either underestimation\
    \ of carbon \n329 \ngain or overestimation of carbon loss. Similar to the observed\
    \ trends in the temperature and \n330 \nshortwave radiation data, MAPE values\
    \ in the estimated fluxes were higher at the beginning and end \n331 \nof the\
    \ growing season. Daymet based fluxes were found to have the lowest average growing\
    \ season \n332 \nuncertainty with the lowest average MAPE and RMSE values of 22.53%\
    \ and 10.82 kg ha-1 day-1, \n333 \nrespectively followed by Prism (MAPE=23.45%\
    \ and RMSE=13.59 kg ha-1 day-1), NLDAS \n334 \n(MAPE=62.52% and RMSE=24.47 kg\
    \ ha-1 day-1) and NARR (MAPE=66.18% and RMSE=25.02 kg \n335 \nha-1 day-1) (Table\
    \ 4). Irrespective of the source of the climate data and crop type, simulated\
    \ fluxes at \n336 \nirrigated sites showed higher uncertainty indicated by higher\
    \ average growing season MAPE \n337 \n(53.15%) and RMSE values (23.98 kg ha-1\
    \ day-1) compared to that of the simulated NEE at non-\n338 \nirrigated sites\
    \ (MAPE=34.19% and RMSE=13.07 kg ha-1 day-1). The MAPE values for corn NEE \n\
    339 \nwere slightly less than soybeans NEE values. However, RMSE values for soybeans\
    \ were lower \n340 \ncompared to that of corn. This could be attributed to higher\
    \ values of NEE for corn resulting in \n341 \nhigher RMSE values, which may not\
    \ necessarily indicate higher uncertainty. \n342 \n3.3 Influence of individual\
    \ climate variables on NEE estimates \n343 \nThe MAPE values in average NEE estimates\
    \ that resulted from errors in the individual \n344 \nclimate variables of different\

    (Figure 6).  These results suggest that dominant climate factors influencing uncertainty\
    \ in NEE vary \n346 \nwith irrigation management irrespective of crop type and\
    \ the source of gridded data. Under non-\n347 \nirrigation management, precipitation\
    \ was found to be the most influential factor followed resulting in \n348 \nhigher\
    \ uncertainty in NEE relative to other factors. The MAPE values in simulated NEE\
    \ under non-\n349 \nirrigation management range from 76.53% to 185.57% due to\
    \ bias in precipitation, while bias in \n350 \nshortwave radiation resulted in\
    \ MAPE values ranging from 72.92% to 119.11% depending on the \n351 \nsource of\
    \ climate data. Bias in other variables was found to induce less than 50% MAPE\

    4. Discussion \n363 \nGiven the high dependency of agroecosystem models on gridded\
    \ climate datasets for \n364 \nsimulating carbon fluxes, in this study four commonly\
    \ used gridded data sets in the U.S were \n365 \nevaluated to understand uncertainty\
    \ in their daily weather variables using observed meteorological \n366 \ndata\
    \ at four flux towers located on agricultural sites in the U.S Midwest region.\
    \ In addition, we \n367 \nfurther studied the impact of uncertainties in climate\
    \ datasets on estimated NEE.  \n368 \n4.1 Uncertainties in climate datasets \n\
    369 \nOur analysis suggests that all gridded climate datasets have some degree\
    \ of uncertainty in \n370 \ntheir daily weather variables. The degree of uncertainty\
    \ varies largely among the datasets depending \n371 \non numerous factors (e.g.,\
    \ quality of inputs used in the climate and geo-statistical models, scale of \n\
    372 \nthe models, representation of land-atmosphere interactions) (Newman et al.,\
    \ 2015; Strachan and \n373 \nDaly, 2017). Similar to earlier findings (Bandaru\
    \ et al., 2017), daily weather variables of Daymet and \n374 \nPrism datasets\
    \ were shown to have less uncertainty as indicated by MAPE values compared to\
    \ that of \n375 \nNLDAS and NARR datasets. The better performance of Daymet and\
    \ Prism datasets could be mainly \n376 \nattributed to the use of meteorological\
    \ station observations as part of model input and a finer model \n377 \nscale.\
    \ In contrast, the NLDAS and NARR data sets primarily rely on atmospheric models\
    \ run at \n378 \ncoarse spatial scale, which often fails to capture local fine\
    \ scale land use, or topographic and \n379 \natmospheric interactions. Among Daymet\
    \ and Prism, the Daymet daily weather variables exhibited \n380 \nless uncertainty,\
    \ and this finding is in contrast to the earlier study where Prism variables showed\
    \ \n381 \nhigher accuracy when monthly weather variables were compared (Bandaru\
    \ et al., 2017). This could \n382 \nbe attributed to differences in topographic,\
    \ physical, and atmospheric factors affecting daily and \n383 \nmonthly weather\
    \ variables and model scale. The Daymet model apparently has a better \n384 \n\
    representation of daily local land-atmosphere interactions compared to the Prism\
    \ model. The Prism \n385 \nuses historical climatology to establish local relationships\
    \ whereas Daymet develops independent \n386 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2020-129\n\

    13 \n \nregression of weather variables against elevation (Thornton et al., 1997;\
    \ Daly et al., 2008; Mourtzinis \n387 \net al., 2018). Further, the use of finer\
    \ resolution elevation maps as input in the Daymet model also \n388 \ncontribute\
    \ to superior accuracy (Ruiz-Arias et al., 2009; Bishop and Beier, 2013). Previous\
    \ studies \n389 \nnoted that a change in the model scale to a coarser spatial\
    \ scale led to greater uncertainty in the \n390 \noutput for interpolation models\
    \ (Bishop & Beier, 2013).  \n391 \nIrrespective of the dataset, temperature and\
    \ shortwave radiation variables exhibited a high \n392 \nlevel of uncertainty\
    \ during the beginning and end of the growing season which represent early spring\
    \ \n393 \nand late fall, respectively. The high uncertainty during early spring\
    \ and late fall could be due to many \n394 \nfactors. During winter months, seasonal\
    \ variance in temperature and radiation is high due to constant \n395 \nstrife\
    \ between subtropical warm air and polar cold air interacting each other. Also,\
    \ the storm track is \n396 \nmore powerful because of a much stronger equator-to-pole\
    \ temperature gradient. These factors could \n397 \ncreate a lower signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio in reanalysis datasets due to model scale and an inadequate \n398 \nrepresentation\
    \ of these complex processes. Additionally, the cloud cover mask used in the models\
    \ \n399 \nmay have a lot of uncertainty during winter months affecting simulation\
    \ of cloud radiative effects \n400 \nleading to errors in shortwave radiation\
    \ (Zhang et al., 2016). Interpolation models used in the \n401 \nDaymet and Prism\
    \ primarily rely on the relationship between climate and topographic features\
    \ and \n402 \ndo not have representation for complex climate dynamics that exist\
    \ during winter months. Also \n403 \nmeasurement errors were found to be high\
    \ during the winter months which could introduce \n404 \nuncertainty in interpolated\
    \ datasets. \n405 \n4.1 Trends and uncertainties in NEE estimates \n406 \nCroplands\
    \ are generally regarded as a carbon sink in all growing seasons since the carbon\
    \ \n407 \nassimilation rate is higher than the total respiration rate during most\
    \ of the growing season. At the \n408 \nstart of the growing season, NEE tends\
    \ to be positive indicating carbon loss due to negligible rates of \n409 \nphotosynthesis\
    \ and relatively higher respiration rates but as the growing season progresses,\
    \ the \n410 \ncarbon assimilation rate increases and NEE becomes negative, making\
    \ croplands act as a carbon \n411 \nsink. NEE increases until the onset of senescence\
    \ (Hernandez-Ramirez et al., 2011; Gilmanov et al., \n412 \n2013) and tends to\
    \ become positive again at the end of the growing season due to the decline in\
    \ the \n413 \nrate of carbon sequestration (Gilmanov et al., 2013). In both corn\
    \ and soybeans NEE estimates, this \n414 \npattern was evident even though there\
    \ were differences in magnitude of daily NEE estimates \n415 \ndepending on the\
    \ climate data sources, crop type, growth stage and irrigation management. Corn\
    \ has \n416 \na higher net CO2 uptake potential compared to that of soybeans as\
    \ corn is a C4 plant, which has a \n417 \nmore efficient in CO2 sequestration\
    \ mechanism. Earlier studies found that corn’s peak CO2 uptake \n418 \nrate is\
    \ approximately 1.7 times higher than that of soybeans. Further, corn has ~15\
    \ days more CO2 \n419 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2020-129\nPreprint. Discussion\

    \ (Dold et al., 2019). Irrigated croplands generally have higher net carbon gain\
    \ compared \n420 \nto non-irrigated croplands. Suyker & Verma (2012) reported\
    \ approximately 20% higher net carbon \n421 \ngain in irrigated corn systems compared\
    \ to the gain under non-irrigated corn. These trends in daily \n422 \nNEE differences\
    \ between corn and soybeans and irrigated and non-irrigated management found in\
    \ \n423 \nour NEE estimates, which suggests that the model structure is adequate\
    \ to capture seasonal complex \n424 \ndynamics in carbon exchange under various\
    \ cropping systems and management practices.  \n425 \nEven though NEE estimates\
    \ captured general seasonal trends, a considerable amount of \n426 \nuncertainty\
    \ was introduced by climate datasets. The differences in uncertainty in the NEE\
    \ estimates \n427 \nmatch with bias patterns in climate datasets. Lower biases\
    \ in Daymet and Prism climate variables \n428 \nyielded better NEE estimates with\
    \ less uncertainty compared to the estimates from NLDAS and \n429 \nNARR datasets.\
    \ Similar findings were reported in the earlier studies, which found that interpolated\
    \ \n430 \nclimate datasets produced based on observational data are characterized\
    \ by less bias, and result in \n431 \nflux estimates with better accuracy (Poulter\
    \ et al., 2011).  \n432 \nOur results indicated that biases in individual climate\
    \ variables won't translate linearly to the \n433 \nuncertainties in NEE estimates,\
    \ even though biases in certain climate variables have strong impact \n434 \n\
    under specific conditions. For instance, irrespective of the source of climate\
    \ data, shortwave radiation \n435 \nand maximum temperature were overestimated\
    \ for all days during the growing season while \n436 \nprecipitation exhibited\
    \ random seasonal bias. However, the biases in daily NEE did not reflect a bias\
    \ \n437 \npattern in any of these variables. Similar trends were found in the\
    \ earlier studies on forest fluxes \n438 \n(Barman et al., 2014). The processes\
    \ determining various carbon components (e.g. net primary \n439 \nproduction and\
    \ soil respiration) are influenced by various individual climate factors and their\
    \ \n440 \ninteractions among themselves and with other factors (e.g., soil characteristics)\
    \ (Schelenkar and \n441 \nroberts, 2009; Hernandez-Ramirez et al., 2011). Their\
    \ relationship is generally non-linear. For \n442 \ninstance, in widely distant\
    \ vapor pressure deficit conditions at different locations, similar temperature\
    \ \n443 \nand moisture conditions can lead to entirely different carbon uptake\
    \ responses (Siebert et al., 2017). \n444 \nFurther, water and heat stress during\
    \ the reproductive stage impacts the CO2 assimilation rate \n445 \nsignificantly\
    \ higher than stress during some vegetative growth stages. Therefore, bias in\
    \ NEE is a \n446 \ncumulative effect of biases in climate variables and their\
    \ interactions with other factors such as crop \n447 \ntype, phenology, soil and\
    \ management practices.  \n448 \nResults suggest that NEE are more sensitive to\
    \ the biases in precipitation and shortwave \n449 \nradiation compared to other\
    \ climate variables under non-irrigated conditions, whereas under irrigated \n\
    450 \nconditions, biases in shortwave radiation and temperature variables impact\
    \ the NEE uncertainty \n451 \nmaximum. The temperature and precipitation variables\
    \ are used in models to determine plant growth \n452 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2020-129\n\

    15 \n \nlimiting factors (i.e. heat stress, water stress, and number of frost\
    \ days) influencing net primary \n453 \nproduction. Additionally, these variables\
    \ influence other plant and soil processes (e.g., soil \n454 \nrespiration, evapotranspiration).\
    \ Under non-irrigated conditions, precipitation becomes the most \n455 \nlimiting\
    \ factor, particularly in sub-tropical and temperate climatic conditions such\
    \ as in our study \n456 \nregion (Kukal & Irmak, 2018). Further, daily biomass\
    \ (primary carbon input) simulated by models is \n457 \nhighly sensitive to the\
    \ duration and timing of dry/wet spells (Dubrovsk´y et al., 2000), which also\
    \ \n458 \nimpacts respiration rates through affecting litter decomposition rates.\
    \ Therefore, uncertainty in the \n459 \nprecipitation amounts, especially during\
    \ critical growth stages, has a substantial impact on the NEE \n460 \nestimates\
    \ (Irmak et al., 2000). Our results showed that precipitation biases are characterized\
    \ by a \n461 \nrandom pattern with both under- and over-estimation of precipitation\
    \ amounts throughout the \n462 \ngrowing season which substantially impact simulation\
    \ of duration and timing of wet/dry spells and \n463 \nlead to high uncertainty\
    \ in NEE.  Under irrigation management, precipitation is not a limiting factor.\
    \ \n464 \nSo, heat stress acts as a primary growth limiting factor and leads to\
    \ a pronounced impact on plant \n465 \ngrowth and carbon exchange (Sippel, 2018).\
    \ Uncertainty in the temperature variables also influence \n466 \ngrowing season\
    \ length and crop maturity period since it influences crop development (Warrington\
    \ \n467 \nand Kanemasu, 1983; Ritichi et al., 1998). Shortwave radiation was found\
    \ to be a major climatic \n468 \nvariable in models affecting NEE under both non-irrigated\
    \ and irrigated conditions. Shortwave \n469 \nradiation determines total potential\
    \ biomass (a primary carbon input), which contributes to a major \n470 \nfraction\
    \ in the total NEE values. Therefore, a small degree of uncertainty in shortwave\
    \ radiation may \n471 \nresult in high level of uncertainty in total net primary\
    \ production.  \n472 \nOur results showed that NEE uncertainties are larger under\
    \ irrigated conditions compared to \n473 \nthose under non-irrigated conditions,\
    \ particularly towards the end of the growing season. Relative to \n474 \nthe\
    \ reference NEE at irrigated sites, NEE estimates based on gridded datasets, particularly\
    \ NARR \n475 \nand NLDAS were found to reach peak earlier (Figure 2) and showed\
    \ large deviation in the daily NEE \n476 \ntrends after the peak. This could be\
    \ because model simulated earlier development of the crop due to \n477 \nuncertainties\
    \ in short wave radiation and temperature variables which primarily influence\
    \ crop \n478 \ngrowth and development patterns under irrigated conditions.  \n\
    479 \n5. Conclusions \n480 \nThis study demonstrates that commonly used high resolution\
    \ gridded climate datasets, \n481 \nirrespective of data source, are characterized\
    \ with some degree of uncertainty and these uncertainties \n482 \nhave a large\
    \ influence on simulated NEE. However, the level of uncertainty in NEE estimates\
    \ vary \n483 \nwith gridded data source and management practices. The gridded\
    \ climate datasets produced based on \n484 \ninterpolation techniques (i.e. Daymet\
    \ and Prism) were shown to have less uncertainties and resulted \n485 \nhttps://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2020-129\n\

    16 \n \nin better NEE estimates with relatively higher accuracy. Simulations of\
    \ NEE under irrigation \n486 \nmanagement were shown to be more sensitive to errors\
    \ in climate data compared to fluxes under \n487 \nnon-irrigation. Further, this\
    \ study highlights that NEE respond differently to individual climate \n488 \n\
    variables, and responses vary with management practices. Under irrigation management,\
    \ NEE are \n489 \nmore sensitive to shortwave radiation and temperature, and biases\
    \ in these variables substantially \n490 \ninfluence uncertainty in NEE estimates.\
    \ Conversely, under non-irrigation management, precipitation \n491 \nis a dominant\
    \ climate factor influencing uncertainty in simulated NEE at the most.   \n492\
    \ \nConsidering the biases in gridded data sources and their impact on NEE estimates,\
    \ it is \n493 \nimportant that careful consideration is taken when selecting climate\
    \ data so that uncertainties in \n494 \nsimulated NEE can be mitigated. Also,\
    \ when reporting NEE or other carbon elements (e.g. NPP) or \n495 \nused in other\
    \ models (e.g. integrated assessment models), uncertainties should be accounted.\
    \ Further, \n496 \nalternative approaches such as integration of remote sensing\
    \ data products should be considered to \n497 \nreduce the model’s dependency\
    \ on climate datasets. Advances in remote sensing facilitate the \n498 \ndevelopment\
    \ of crop type land surface products (i.e. leaf area index (LAI), evapotranspiration\
    \ and \n499 \nsoil moisture), which are determined in the models as intermediate\
    \ state variables using climate data. \n500 \nThese variables play an important\
    \ role in determining NEE by influencing various processes (e.g. \n501 \nCO2 uptake\
    \ rate and soil respiration). Forcing agroecosystem models to use remote sensing\
    \ retrieved \n502 \ncrop variables instead of estimating using climate variables\
    \ is expected to decrease the uncertainty in \n503 \nthe NEE estimates. \n504\

    aerial vehicles 1. Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) is the replication
    of human intelligence by a system or machine. The goal of AI is to create a machine
    that can think like a human and emulate human behaviours such as perception, reasoning,
    learning, planning, and prediction. Intelligence is one of the primary attributes
    that distinguish humans from animals. With the inexorable occurrence of industrial
    revolutions, an increasing number of machine types continue to replace human labour
    in all sectors of life, and the approaching replacement of human resources by
    machine intelligence is the next major problem to be met. Many scientists are
    concentrating on AI, making AI research-rich and diversified. AI study areas include
    search algorithms, knowledge graphs, natural language processing, expert systems,
    evolution algorithms, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and others. It
    is commonly recognized that food is an essential component of human survival and
    is the product of farming, produced after farmers distribute the many commodities
    they have created. Products from the food sector are essential for any nation''s
    development (Kakani, Nguyen, Kumar, Kim, & Pasupuleti, 2020). It played with a
    huge part in the national economy and the global economy in the developing nation.
    Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the safety of food sector products and their
    high quality through appropriate distribution. AI is a recently developed technology
    that has produced positive results in achieving the required objectives in recent
    decades. Investigating the application of AI for smart agriculture and food businesses
    is an important aspect. Such methods deliver high-quality goods on schedule and
    satisfy social requirements. The food processing sector can create a lot of food
    products quickly with this current technology, which will exponentially boost
    the company''s economy (Misra et al., 2020). AI-based systems are widely used
    in almost every aspect of technology. It enables the efficient transformation
    of food industry products, computerization of the food sector, and optimization
    of challenges. By utilizing a computerized system, the industry may review and
    assure that optimal conditions, such as seed picking, monitoring of crops, irrigation,
    and monitoring of temperatures, can be improved, resulting in the perfection of
    in agricultural sector with ultimately affect the food processing sector (Donepudi,
    2014). Additionally, it is useful for processing of food, food storage, and food
    delivery. Robotics and intelligent drones are two examples of intelligent devices
    that can significantly and critically contribute to reducing the cost of packaging.
    It will also assist in transporting the food products, finishing the operation
    in hazardous conditions, and providing extremely high-quality goods (Bera, 2021).
    Management of food security and quality are the two major categories into which
    the significant responsibilities of AI in the food industry may be divided. Therefore,
    in this review, we explored cutting-edge AI methodologies, such as ML, neural
    networks, and deep learning. Moreover, the application of AI in the agri-food
    industry, highlighting its role in ensuring quality across the production process
    is thoroughly discussed by placing a strong emphasis on both existing scientific
    insights and future research & development. 2. Artificial intelligence: State-of-the-art
    techniques DL and ML are two of the most widely used AI techniques. Individuals,
    businesses, and governmental entities utilize these data-driven models to make
    predictions. Currently, machine learning techniques are being developed to address
    the complexity and unpredictability of information in the food business (Negi
    & Rajesh, 2019). Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Robotics, Expert Systems,
    Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and ML are the main subfields of
    AI. The natural language processing (NLP) is used to comprehend spoken people''s
    language, computer vision to view analog-to-digital conversions like speech recognition,
    video, and expert systems to imitate judgment. Learning, which involves the acquisition
    of data and then creating algorithms to turn it into useful information; reasoning;
    and self-correction, are the three cognitive abilities that serve as the foundation
    for AI encoding. Recently, AI technology has made it possible to use it in the
    agro-food industry. AI has contributed to agro-food sector and supply chain and
    actually makes substantial contribution and assistance in comprehending identification
    of models, service generation, and in the process of decision-making. The AI has
    added a vital role in agriculture by delivering precise and predictive decision-making
    in order to increase productivity with retention of resource requirements (Patel,
    Rai, Das, & Singh, 2021). AI tools recommend algorithms to compute performance,
    classify patterns, and predict unexpected problems in order to solve agriculture
    comprehension problems, identify pests and the best treatments, and manage irrigation
    and water consumption systems with smart irrigation systems. Remote sensing and
    sensors are used to evaluate biotic and abiotic elements in order to improve agricultural
    and live-stock management (Patel et al., 2021). The process of acquiring data
    from real-world sources, including as sensors, old documents, and client feedback,
    is known as data acquisition. Following that, the data is cleaned, normalized,
    and prepared as part of the data pre-processing process to guarantee consistency
    and quality. The third step entails integrating engineering with the data extraction
    of pertinent elements to feed the AI model that predicts the quality of the output.
    Subsequently, pre-processed data is used for model training in order to accurately
    anticipate product quality. The process as a whole, including data annotation,
    model validation, interpretability, and ethical compliance, is assessed by human
    supervision that guarantee the AI model functions properly and complies with quality
    requirements and laws. 2.1. Machine learning ML is a significant branch of AI
    that promotes the creation of more creative and productive labour. Fig. 1A shows
    the two categories and types of ML that are available for the applications and
    Fig. 1B represented several algorithms employed in food processing machine learning
    activities. The two main tasks in the ML technique are supervised learning, and
    unsupervised learning (Shetty et al., 2022). Supervised machine learning requires
    supervision, as the name implies. Using supervised learning and the “labelled”
    dataset, computers are trained, and following training, the computer generates
    predictions. In this case, the labelled data show that the inputs and outputs
    were correctly mapped. The creation of the map between input and output variables
    is the goal. Applications for supervised learning include risk assessment, spam
    filtering, and fraud detection. With unsupervised machine learning, the computer
    learns from an unlabelled dataset and makes its own predictions about the outcome
    (Li, Shepperd, Guo, & Technology, 2020). In this case, the dataset used to construct
    the models has not been tagged or classified, and they are then free to act on
    their own. Sorting the unsorted dataset into classes or groups according to similarities,
    patterns, and variations is the main objective of this learning process. The computers
    are supposed to find the hidden patterns in the input dataset. Download : Download

    of machine learning and (B) machine learning interpretation in the food business
    using different algorithms. In ML, mathematical and statistical techniques are
    applied to learn from datasets and make predictions and judgments based on the
    data. Two systems, the symbolic approaches and the sub-symbolic approaches, can
    be distinguished generally. The impact of this strategy, as per supervised learning,
    is to map the variables to the selected output variable (Traore, Kamsu-Foguem,
    & Tangara, 2017). Using the labelled data and knowledge about the desired input
    and output variables, a predictive model is built. There are several algorithms
    employed in supervised learning techniques, but decision trees, Bayesian networks,
    and regression analysis stand out. In actuality, and as Jordan & Mitchell mentioned
    (Jordan & Mitchell, 2015), using an unlabelled dataset, this unsupervised ML instance
    developed the hidden patterns and is mostly utilized for dimensionality reduction
    and exploratory data analysis. In this specific ML challenge, training and test
    datasets are combined while the learner interacts with the environment to collect
    data. To learn more, the learner must experiment with novel, untested acts as
    opposed to employing the information already gained (Mohri, Rostamizadeh, & Talwalkar,
    2018). 2.1.1. Artificial neural network (ANN) An ANN is a further AI component
    and has higher possibilities for the use in food industry. In terms of unsupervised
    learning, it utilizes unlabelled datasets without sufficient information of output
    and input variables and uses methods like ANNs, clustering, genetic algorithms,
    and deep learning. ANNs is the mostly employed technique for determining the quality
    of food in AI applications. An ANN is a node-based mathematical model that can
    have either linear or non-linear processing features (Sun, Zhang, & Yang, 2019).
    Theoretically, an electric signal travels through synapses at the tips of each
    node of an interconnected neural network, passing through neurons with the assistance
    of axons (Jha, Doshi, Patel, & Shah, 2019). The human brain and ANN both operate
    on similar principles, alerting the system to perform an internal task rather
    than a traditional computational activity. The three primary layers that make-up
    the basic architecture of an ANN (Fig. 2A). The architecture includes activation
    mechanisms, including feed-forward or feedback mechanisms. In order to process
    the unprocessed data, the input layer connects to the hidden layer after obtaining
    the data from the architecture. To construct the final output, the collected data
    is then delivered to the output layer attached via the nodes. The ability to forecast
    the foundation of parallel reasoning and effectively train neural networks is
    one of the major advantages of ANN layers. An ANN works as a human brain and is
    capable of learning and accumulating synaptic weights, which are the connections
    between neurons. According to Sukhadia and Chaudhari (2019), the setup of ANN
    is developed in such a way that it may support specific applications, including
    pattern recognition or data classification (Sukhadia & Chaudhari, 2019). Also,
    Gonzalez-Fernandez et al. (2019) asserts that ANN is versatile, adaptive, and
    applicable to a variety of issues and circumstances (Gonzalez-Fernandez et al.,
    2019). They also noted that although modifications are required, ANN is flexible
    to different circumstances and may be used to simulate the majority of non-linear
    systems. Additionally, non-linear regression is one of ANN''s most notable characteristics.
    The multilayer perceptron (MLP) is the most often used network for pattern recognition
    and prediction. The learnt internal representations of the input data are represented
    by the data in a neural network''s hidden layer. Throughout the training process,
    the network''s parameters—weights and biases—interact intricately to create these
    representations. The network''s black-box nature makes it difficult to precisely
    interpret these representations, but methods like feature analysis, visualization,
    and trained weight interpretation can shed some light on the characteristics and
    patterns the hidden layer neurons are picking up from the input data. Download

    Architecture of artificial intelligence technologies. (A) artificial neural network
    layers, (B) standard convolutional neural networkfor analyzing and detecting food,
    and (C) Fuzzy logic with four main parts. 2.1.2. Deep learning Deep learning (DL)
    is one of the fields of AI in which adulteration and defect detection have recently
    achieved exponential development. The development of DL models started in the
    late 1990s with the invention of CNN. One of the most effective ways to learn
    the deep features of digital data input for tasks connected to classification
    and regression is through the use of CNN (J. Singh, Thakur, Ali, Gera, & Kwak,
    2020). CNN networks vary from traditional neural networks which are employing
    with number of convolutional layers. Standard CNN architecture for analyzing and
    detecting food is illustrated in Fig. 2B. Convolutional layers are built using
    filters to extract features from input images. The padding, stride, kernel size
    and activation parameters that are used to create convolution layers are produced
    based on the job at hand and should be optimized accordingly. Completely connected
    layers were placed at the layer end that serves as the classifier and consists
    of a completely linked network block to produce the output. For the categorization
    of images related to food and agriculture, a number of CNN architectures are currently
    available, including LeNEt, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet, and Inception. CNN
    is effective in detecting food adulteration and assessing the quality of agricultural
    items (Griffel, Delparte, Whitworth, Bodily, & Hartley, 2023). 2.1.3. Role of
    machine learning in food processing and preservations ML algorithms can be applied
    in many different contexts to guarantee the safety of fruits and vegetables. For
    instance, supervised learning methods like support vector machines (SVMs) can
    be used to find possible toxins in food items. Fruits and vegetables that may
    have microbial contamination can also be found using SVMs (Kim et al., 2023).
    Grouping related food products together and identifying outliers that may be sources
    of contamination can be accomplished through the use of unsupervised learning
    techniques like k-means clustering. Unusual patterns that can raise questions
    about food safety can be found using anomaly detection techniques like isolation
    forests. Finally, an ideal inspection and reaction procedure to handle concerns
    about the safety of fruits and vegetables can be developed using reinforcement
    learning algorithms (Roy et al., 2023). Fruit preservation can benefit from ML
    in a number of ways. Algorithms for machine learning, for instance, can be used
    to track the quality of fruit that has been preserved and notify users when certain
    conditions are not met. In order to maximize fruit preservation, ML can also monitor
    and modify environmental factors like humidity and temperature. To guarantee that
    the fruit is fresh for the consumer, ML helps forecast the best times for fruit
    harvesting, packing, and distribution (Nile et al., 2020). ML models can be used
    to estimate the remaining shelf-life of perishable food items depending on a range
    of factors, such as product features, initial quality, and storage conditions
    (Ulussever, Ertuğrul, Kılıç Depren, Kartal, & Depren, 2023). The program examines
    the deterioration patterns in the data to give accurate estimations of how long
    a given food will stay fresh and safe to eat. By applying this knowledge, one
    may reduce waste, enhance inventory control, and prevent consumers from purchasing
    defective items (Hu, Ahmed, & L''Abbé, 2023). Perishable food shelf-life can be
    estimated by ML algorithms based on a variety of parameters, including product
    attributes, starting quality, and storage circumstances. Through data analysis
    of deterioration trends, the computer generates accurate predictions about the
    shelf-life and safety of certain products. Making use of this data helps improve
    inventory control, cut down on waste, and stop consumers from buying faulty products
    (Torres-Sánchez, Martínez-Zafra, Castillejo, Guillamón-Frutos, & Artés-Hernández,
    2020). 2.2. Expert system A component of AI called an expert system brings expertise
    and the capacity to solve complicated issues utilizing reasoning and knowledge
    representation. The general form of an expert system, however, consists of an
    interpreter, an inference engine, a dynamic database, a human-machine interface,
    and knowledge acquisition. In this way, the expert system''s problem-solving stage
    is used to imitate the way an expert think through knowledge and information.
    With the enhancement of a small group of variables and numerous factors based
    on prediction performance, an export system operating on common devices has been
    developed. By choosing features based on colour, texture, and geometric aspects,
    it was possible to estimate the fruit''s ripeness with a classification accuracy
    of 100%. In order to recognize fruits, Duong, Nguyen, Di Sipio, and Di Ruscio
    (2020) developed an expert system employing the Efficient Net and MixNet deep
    neural network (DNN) architectures. Compared to a well-known baseline, both topologies
    successfully increased the total classification accuracy up to 95% (Duong et al.,
    2020). To assure their commercial usage for food and agricultural product quality
    inspection, it is required to establish the precise development of expert systems.
    Practically, the pace, monitoring procedure, and automatic detection are used
    to assess an expert system''s performance. Since input functions are readily available,
    their implementation is required to define with their accuracy and speed of operation.
    2.3. Fuzzy logic (FL) The FL simulates how complicated judgments are made by people
    when given unclear and uncertain information. It is demonstrated to be a useful
    tool for handling classification issues involving imperfect data. Fuzzy, however,
    needs to work with better recovery, especially with added constraints while working
    with highly dimensional or massive volumes of data. Fuzzy systems enable the use
    of more simple algorithmic formulations and language variables to explain the
    behavior of a complex system instead of doing it quantitatively and mathematically.
    FL was crucial in the creation of the control systems for sophisticated processes
    used in the manufacture of food and beverages. The rule base, fuzzification inference
    engine, and defuzzification are the four essential components of a typical FL
    design, as depicted in Fig. 2C. According to the fuzzy set theory, an element
    is considered to be a member of a fuzzy set if and only if it has a real number
    in the range [0,1] (Hannan et al., 2019). The FL models involves different steps,
    including fuzzifcation, inference systems, and defuzzification processes (Wu et
    al., 2024). Fuzzifcation is a method that produces fuzzy input sets by converting
    a crisp value into a degree of membership. The membership functions'' equivalent
    degree typically ranges from 0 to 1 (Alsaqour et al., 2015). The most popular
    membership functions are triangular, Z-shaped, S-shaped, trapezoidal, and Gaussian-shaped,
    while there are many others available (Alsaqour et al., 2015). The position called
    inference system where fuzzy rules are used to translate the fuzzy input into
    output. The final stage of the fuzzy logic model called defuzzification (Abd Ali,
    Hannan, Mohamed, & Abdolrasol, 2016). Mean of maximum, centre of maximum, centre
    of gravity, centroid of area, smallest of maximum, and largest of maximum are
    some of the different defuzzification techniques. Similarly, Kanade et al. (2018)
    evaluated the use of FL and the e-nose sensor to categorize guava according to
    ripeness levels (Kanade et al., 2018). The FL module''s results produced classification
    accuracy for guava fruit ripeness estimation of 90%. Similarly, Villaseñor-Aguilar
    et al. (2020) used the FL method for the total soluble solids prediction, and
    the bell pepper maturity phases were found (Villaseñor-Aguilar et al., 2020).
    The classification of four bell pepper maturity stages using FL models yielded
    a precision of 88%. Another study by Pakyürek et al. (2019) utilized the FL method
    to grade the quality of three different types of pineapple (Pakyürek et al., 2019).
    FL has shown that it performs well as a control system, particularly when concerning
    with complicated processes for determining food and agricultural products quality.
    2.4. Computer vision system (CVS) According to Lukinac, Jukić, Mastanjević, and
    Lučan (2018), it involves a number of processes, including image processing, digitalization,
    analysis, and captures using the use of the visible spectrum falling on a surface
    of a reflective, absorbent material, images are obtained using the image analysis
    method. Photons are then caught by camera lenses and converted into electrical
    signals by an image sensor. Digitization is the process of converting these images
    into a numerical format (Lukinac et al., 2018). They reported that CVS can measure
    the external characteristics that form digital images to maintain control over
    the quality of the product through automated examination. As AI continues to evolve
    rapidly, incorporating advancements in machine learning, expert systems, fuzzy
    logic, and computer vision, it offers unprecedented opportunities for innovation
    and impact across various domains. However, when tackling complex or multidimensional
    production/consumption networks, the optimization of AI models is needed to enhance
    efficiency, adaptability, and resilience. AI models should be optimized to streamline
    operations by minimizing resource wastage, reducing production costs, and improving
    overall productivity. Moreover, resource allocation becomes a crucial focus, with
    optimization algorithms ensuring effective distribution across various nodes to
    meet demand while minimizing shortages or excesses. Additionally, AI-driven supply
    chain management aims to forecast demand accurately, optimize inventory levels,
    and identify potential disruptions to maintain seamless operations. On the other
    hand, risk mitigation strategies are integrated, leveraging AI to identify and
    address risks, such as supply chain disruptions or market fluctuations. Ultimately,
    the adaptability and resilience of AI models are emphasized, continuously learning
    and adjusting to changing conditions to maintain performance and mitigate disruptions
    within complicated production/consumption networks. Through these optimization
    efforts, AI models contribute to enhancing the efficiency, agility, and reliability
    of these intricate networks. 3. Applications of AI in food industry The AI approach
    offers a lot of benefits, and the food sector has been implementing it for decades
    with following growing trends in recent time. The AI can be use in the place for
    the traditional food productions system. This can be done by creating new AI models
    or adapt current ones to the special requirements and difficulties associated
    with the production of meat, beverages, and cultured meat. This could entail developing
    models expressly designed to forecast quality metrics, enhance manufacturing process,
    or guarantee regulatory adherence in the food production industry (Kakani, Nguyen,
    Kumar, Kim, Pasupuleti, and Research, F, 2020). In order to continuously learn
    from real-time data gathered during the creation of food items, implement feedback
    loops within AI systems. As it obtains more experience with the new technology,
    this allows the AI system to adjust and enhance its predictions and suggestions
    over time. However, the innovation of AI applications has been elevated in recent
    years towards the food processing sector by 2015. The utilization of ANN in a
    variety of activities in the food processing sector. Based on the R2 values, all
    applications have performed satisfactorily, demonstrating that ANN is capable
    of producing results that are precise and dependable. Ordinary least square regression
    (OLS-R), stepwise linear regression (SL-R), random forest regression (RF-R), support
    vector Machine (SVM) regression, k-nearest neighbours'' regression (kNN-R), principal
    component regression (PC-R), partial least square regression (PLS-R), and boosted
    logistic regression (BLR) are some of the ML techniques used in the food industry.
    Studies revealed that the application of ML has assisted in decision-making, lowering
    the cost of sensory evaluation, and improving corporate strategies to meet user
    needs (Lyu et al., 2020). The food processing sector used long short-term memory
    (LSTM), a synthetic recurrent neural network, for pH sensing during cheese fermentation
    (Kráľová & Jampílek, 2021). Similarly, the genetic algorithm (GA) was useful in
    predicting the fouling rate in food processing and was also used to define the
    food parameters (D. Kim, Zohdi, & Singh, 2020). Furthermore, ML was able to forecast
    the food waste quantity and also provided knowledge on the production process.
    For monitoring of freshness in beef, a novel colorimetric sensor array (CSA) made
    of oxidized chitin nanocrystals (O-Ch-NCs) paired with a CNN was created (Jia,
    Ma, Tarwa, Mao, & Wang, 2023). CSA was treated to methylamine (MA), trimethylamine
    (TMA), and ammonia (NH3) at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 ppm. The discoloration
    was noticeable, as seen in Fig. 3A, notably for the bromocresol green. At 70 and
    100 ppm concentrations, it shifted from yellow to blue for all the three gases.
    However, nuances may be indistinguishable to the human eye, especially when the
    concentration of volatile gas was lower, as it was at the earliest stage of decay.
    The data analysis was done using PCA and HCA methods to assess the CSA sensitivity
    to various gases in order to estimate the limit of detection. Two principal components
    were used to generate the PCA plot, demonstrating that three amine gases clusters
    which were clearly separated (Fig. 3B). When compared to the original, NH3 and
    TMA were clearly recognizable, although MA at low quantities was indistinct. It
    is also worth noting that two eigenvectors only accounted for 87.19% of the total
    variance, but five eigenvectors might account for 95% and seven eigenvectors could
    account for 99%. This suggested that the inter-section phenomena were unavoidable
    in order to meet real applications and that at least three distinct dyes were
    required to achieve up to 99% accuracy. Many prior reports confirmed this result
    (Wang et al., 2022). In addition to PCA, the HCA dendrogram revealed with formation
    of three amine gases with different independently formed clusters at higher than
    70 ppm (Fig. 3C). At 70 ppm for NH3 and TMA, and 100 ppm for MA, the colour shift
    of CSA deviated significantly from the starting colour. Wang, Cheng, et al. (2022)
    reported over creations of colorimetric strip sensor array with bromophenol blue
    (BPB) and BCG and evaluated colour variations in NH3. At 150 ppm of NH3, their
    data revealed a substantial colour changes from yellow-green to blue-green (Wang
    et al., 2022). The CSA sensitively operated in comparisons to others, and both
    PCA and HCA results strongly supported the usefulness of CSA in identifying MA,
    TMA, and NH3 as per combined cross-reactive interaction. The shape, size, and
    colour changes during storage, shelf-life prediction, browning, and melting qualities
    are examples of external quality attributes. In most cases, equipment, professional
    inspectors, or food inspectors themselves will analyze the quality of the food.
    For external quality inspection of products, there are various varieties of Computer
    Vision Systems (CVS) available, including hyperspectral, multispectral, and standard
    CVS (Lakshmi et al., 2017). We can forecast the faults in grains based on their
    size and form by using image analysis. Defective beans are simpler to remove while
    maintaining product quality (Pizzaia, Salcides, de Almeida, Contarato, & de Almeida,
    2018). An electronic nose is a technological advancement in the study of smell.
    It operates on the basis of the mammalian olfactory system and uses gas sensors,
    which are also employed in the wine and coffee industries (R. B. Roy, Tudu, Bandyopadhyay,
    & Bhattacharyya, 2019). Download : Download high-res image (297KB) Download :

    this article.) To ensure product quality, the food and beverage sectors use e-noses.
    According to the guidelines established by the Speciality Coffee Association of
    America (SCAA) Technical Standards Committee, the effectiveness of roasted coffee
    is determined by the coffee cupping method (Thazin, Pobkrut, & Kerdcharoen, 2018).
    After being ground into a powder for five grams of coffee, the beans were boiled
    for three to five minutes at a temperature of 97 °C (Lingle & Menon, 2017). The
    radial basis function ANN is used to forecast the cupping method, which is used
    to collect the data. The computer analyses signals from the gas sensors in the
    e-nose using the Lab VIEW software. Multivariate data analysis is used to analyzed
    e-nose data (Thazin et al., 2018). The three sections of this experiment are as
    follows: the first examines the impact of temperature (10 °C to 90 °C) on liquid
    coffees'' scent characteristics; the second classifies the acidity levels of different
    roast levels for coffee. Finally, humans test the levels of bitterness and provide
    instructions using a radial-based ANN (Thazin et al., 2018). Like the e-nose,
    the e-tongue is also used to assess the quality of various drinks, including milk,
    coffee, tea, wine, and beer. This e-tongue can detect the following parameters:
    bitterness, sourness, and salinity (Tan & Xu, 2020). 3.1. Dairy industry The longevity
    of process cheese is predicted using two different ANN models: the multiple linear
    regression (MLR) model and the Radial Basis Model (RBM) with Fewer Neutrons (Goyal
    & Kumar Goyal, 2012). Based on R2 values, they found that the RBM performs marginally
    superior than the MLR model. They also came to the conclusion that the MLR model
    works better for coffee drinks. To keep the raw milk from spoiling, fuzzy logic
    is used in storage. The spoilage of raw milk can be prevented by taking the following
    three steps: (I) Fuzzy inferences are used to predict temperature from the lining
    times; (II) The temperature data was handled in a fuzzy manner; (III) Warn the
    dairy farm employees. FL and the BP neural network are used to prevent milk from
    deteriorating. These technologies are enhanced by IOT, which increases the accuracy
    of the detection process. An alternative neural network that forecasts cheese
    shelf life uses time-delayed neural networks (TDNN), which operate on continuous
    input data. Two layers make up the TDNN: single and multilayer models that forecast
    how long food products will last on the market (Negash, Vasant, & Jufar, 2018).
    Similar to this, milk also contains additional nutrients like lipids and proteins
    in addition to lactose, which is the main carbohydrate. Manufacturers are removing
    extra lactose from milk to make it easier for consumers to digest or eat small
    amounts of lactose in order to avoid the issues brought on by lactose, such as
    lactose intolerance (Pawłowska, Umławska, & Iwańczak, 2016). Lactose is removed
    using an adsorption technique that uses fixed bed columns and empirical models
    from ANN (Balieiro et al., 2016). The adsorbent gets constantly associated with
    solution using these approaches; the adsorption rates are also increased. By the
    usage of common substances within the automated extraction of stable-level engraved
    silica in a set-mattress phase, molecular imprinting can enhance the adsorbent
    efficiency (Oliveira, Santos, Lima, Soares, & Leite, 2015). To keep raw milk from
    spoiling, FL is used during storage. The first of (i) Three actions to prevent
    raw milk from spoiling is to predict temperature using fuzzy inferences based
    on lining times, (ii) The temperature data was handled in a fuzzy manner, and
    (iii) Give the dairy farm labourers a scare. Milk degradation can be prevented
    with the aid of FL and BP neural network. The inclusion of IOT in these technologies
    enhances the accuracy of the detection approach (Ma, Fan, Li, & Tang, 2018). ANN
    has been developed to estimate the shelf life of processed cheese held at 30 °C.
    It can also measure the high protein content of ripped cheddar cheese, which can
    be utilized as an additional source of protein to beef. This is a tactic that
    combines a number of ingredients, including emulsifier, salt, water, and some
    specific spices. The mixture is continuously mixed while being heated in a jacketed
    vessel to achieve a uniform mass. Another neural network called time delay neural
    network (TDNN) uses continuous input data to forecast the shelf-life of cheese.
    The two layers that make up TDNN are single and multilayer models that forecast
    the food products'' shelf lives (Negash et al., 2018). Similarly, lactose from
    the milk is removed by an adsorption method that uses empirical models created
    by ANN and is carried out using a fixed bed column (Balieiro et al., 2016). Because
    the adsorbent is in constant contact with the solution using these approaches,
    the adsorption rates also rise (Leite et al., 2019). Lactose content is measured
    using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) following the absorption process.
    The Radial Basis Function (RBF) model offers excellent efficiency, speed, and
    simplicity in addition to the MIP model. RBF needs more neurons in hidden layers
    than MIP, but it also needs more neurons in each layer for varied tasks. Researchers
    used MATLAB to build these two models, which are detailed in full by Leite et
    al. (2019). There is a detailed discussion of both MIP and RBF created neural
    structures; the accuracy of these structures'' performance is verified by comparing
    them to other models (Leite et al., 2019). 3.2. Soft drink and beverage industry
    Three categories of drinks are distinguished: (a) alcoholic beverages; (b) non-alcoholic
    beverages; and (c) hot beverages. There is no way to keep tabs on the fermentation
    process in a conventional brewery in real time, but with the help of AI and its
    digital tools, controlling and monitoring the brewing process can be achieved
    (Vassileva & Mileva, 2010). The use of AI techniques to regulate the brewing process,
    including CVS, FL, neural networks, and its hybrid intelligence methods. ANN assists
    in reporting the fermentation of beer (Vassileva & Mileva, 2010). In order to
    prevent weight gain or obesity, deep CNN assists in obtaining nutritional information
    about soft beverages. Using the bottle size and cap ratio, this method can estimate
    the nutritional content. It applies to other fruit-based beverages in addition
    to carbonated beverages. By removing the backdrop from the image as part of CNN''s
    image processing process, nutritional content may be estimated (Hafiz, Haque,
    Rakshit, & Uddin, 2022). According to Ren et al. (2023) investigates the issue
    of the expensive and time consuming traditional R&D work in beverage demand diversification
    by building a model combining electronic sense and ML to anticipate the processes
    and formulas for vegetable-fruit beverages (Ren et al., 2023). The model''s prediction
    performance was influenced following data pre-processing, as seen in Fig. 4. The
    R2 of three models (kNN, RF, and DNN) increased to varied degrees following standardization
    when compared to models without scaled processing. The methods opted for standardization
    impacted on DNN, as indicated by R2 values shifting from negative to positive
    value. Because of standardization, the DNNs called model was prominent in all
    models, and the DNN, scaled model was the best of all models. With an R2 of 0.91,
    the DNNs called model effectively predicted formulas based on sensory information.
    The model performance in forecasting formulas was inadequate when based on e-nose,
    e-tongue, rheometer, and colorimeter data separately, as evidenced by the low
    R2 value and large RMSE and MAE values in Fig. 4. When compared to the R2 of models
    developed using individual e-nose, e-tongue, rheometer, and colorimeter values,
    the R2 of models generated using fusion data were virtually all >0.60. The fusion
    data were crucial for constructing an accurate model with the right algorithm.
    In general, prediction performance based on fusion methods outperformed prediction
    performance based on E-nose or E-tongue sensing information (Hong & Wang, 2014).
    ML is commonly utilized in the regression problem of ingredient prediction and
    is developing as a useful tool in predicting specific components. However, it
    has yet to be used to predict complex formulas. ML was used in this work to forecast
    the formulations of beverages form sea buckthorn-passion fruit juice made with
    the same technique. On the testing set, the model''s performance was estimated
    using RMSE, MAE, and R2. A higher R2 value and lower RMSE & MAE values imply superior
    model performance, resulting in higher beverage formula prediction accuracy (Fig.
    4). Download : Download high-res image (403KB) Download : Download full-size image

    et al. (2023). 3.3. Fruit and vegetable processing industry Using the AQS 602
    machine, which sorts 3 to 5 tons of potatoes every hour (Nachev, Titova, & Damyanov,
    2012),potatoes are supplied by a stream that is formed by belt conveyors, each
    of which requires specific attention and management (Fig. 5A). With the aid of
    a PMC photometric camera, these sorting systems sort the potatoes according to
    the formation of the tubers (Nachev et al., 2012). Fruit classification systems
    are useful for ranking various fruit varieties, but they are not ideal; for example;
    (I) not all classifiers are appropriate for all fruit varieties, (II) more sensors
    were needed, (III) fruit misclassification, (IV) fruit classification systems
    (FCSs) poor performance. An advanced computer vision-based FCS that uses a digital
    camera, additional enhancements for testing various fruit varieties, feed-forward
    neural networks (FNN), latest world optimization technique, and biogeography-based
    adaptive control to lower the rate of misclassification have been developed to
    improve these conditions (Yudong Zhang et al., 2016). With more precision and
    effectiveness, biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is employed in a variety
    of fields. The undesirable background is removed using a split merge technique.
    After digital camera (DC) fruit image collection, principal component analysis
    (PCA) is utilized to lower the size of the hybrid feature. The decreased images
    are then sent into FNN, which has the potential to categorize any nonlinear separable
    styles, after being removed from the chromatic fruit pictures. It only needs one
    concealed layer to withstand the challenging and complicated training. The FNN
    that handles optimization issues can be trained using BBO. This approach is known
    as BBO-FNN. The best load of FNN was determined using BBO, and at the conclusion,
    a sample yield assessment using stratified cross validation (SCV) was used. The
    classifier is trained using learning predictions, which then assist in predicting
    the requested fruit image (Yudong Zhang et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res

    separation of fruits and vegetables based on physical attributes. (A) Potato sorting

    et al. (2021) and is an open access article (copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V., Amsterdam,

    Attribution (CC BY) license. According to Patil, Lande, Nagalkar, Nikam, and Wakchaure
    (2021) employs three ML algorithms like ANN, SVM, and CNN, to recognize and categorize
    dragon fruits based on their characteristics (Patil et al., 2021). As illustrated
    in Fig. 5B, the dataset of Dragon fruit images and camera captured Dragon fruit
    images perform image processing functions such as feature extraction for training,
    image pre-processing, image acquisition, image segmentation, and testing path
    of dragon fruit images. In order to reduce the rate of misclassification, the
    advanced computer vision-based fruit classifications system includes a digital
    camera, additional improvements for testing various fruit varieties, feed forward
    neural networks along with emerging world optimization technique, and biogeography-based
    adaptive control are used (Yudong Zhang et al., 2016). BBO is used in various
    fields with high efficiency results; now, they are using it in the food field
    to get accuracy. Computer vision is a branch of AI, is needed for this automation.
    It employs various software programs to identify any damage in fruits and vegetables
    as well as classify them according to quality (Makkar, Verma, Yogesh, & Dubey,
    2018). One of the greatest non-destructive techniques for illness detection is
    X-ray imaging technology. Mangoes, for instance, are evaluated for quality using
    Artificial Immune Systems (AIS), a technology created using X-ray imaging techniques
    (Addanki, Patra, & Kandra, 2022). The image processing system was created that
    uses images to evaluate, detect, and segment the physical features of mangoes,
    including colour, shape, size, and surface area (Abarna & Selvakumar, 2015). 3.4.
    Intelligent food packaging In order to enhance the design, manufacture, and functional
    characteristics of packaging substances, AI and ML are increasingly employed in
    the packaging of food. On the basis of deep convolution generative adversarial
    networks (DCGAN), the packaging design model was used (Taneja et al., 2023). Visual
    communication technology can be used to improve a packaging design picture, leading
    to stronger visual communication abilities, a greater degree of image information
    fusion, and an enhanced packaging design. The inconsistent shape, colour, and
    size of fruits and vegetables make it difficult to design AI-based solutions in
    this industry. Therefore, large quantities of data are required to adequately
    train the system and enable it to carry out the work in a systematic manner. Drones
    and other intelligent tools can also play a big role in considerably lowering
    the cost of packing (Ahmad, Alvino, & Marino, 2022). Robotics, are being used
    for the automatic process of packaging, thereby lowering the demand for human
    labour and increasing the process speed and efficiency. To make sure that food
    goods are properly packaged and uphold quality requirements, robots may sort and
    examine them. Robotics are utilized to manage inventory, making sure that the
    materials needed for packing are available when required and lowering the possibility
    of shortages. Additionally, food products are delivered directly to consumers
    via drones, eliminating the need for packing and shipping. 3.5. New food product
    development The first bioactive peptide in the world was released by a biotechnology
    business using AI technology. A special peptide network produced from rice protein
    is used as a sports nutrition supplement to reduce inflammation by altering cytokine
    responses and to enhance immune function. The business is the first in the world
    to show how AI can be used to improve human health. The AI-powered “home cooking
    sidekick,” a web and mobile application that combines with the smart kitchen helper
    “Hello Egg” to completely automate kitchen needs, has been released by another
    US-based IoT-focused technology start-up. The home assistant uses voice technologies
    to offer a diet strategy based on a person''s interests. Additionally, this may
    organize the pantry, classify the shopping list, provide video recipes, and help
    with grocery delivery (Taneja et al., 2023). The objective of sensory panellists
    working in the food and beverage industry is to sensory evaluating new foods in
    light of customer flavour preferences. Unfortunately, it might be challenging
    to predict the target group''s perceptions and preferences. This prompted businesses
    to create an effective approach for gauging and forecasting consumer preferences
    using an AI-based Gastrograph system that employs ML and predictive algorithms
    to comprehend market desire (Trencher, 2019). 3.6. Food fraud detection In recent
    time, the use of AI to combat food adulteration has increased. AI for food adulteration
    detection includes managing data sets of real and fake products to train algorithms
    to detect minute compositional variations. These variations are involved in developing
    a model that can analyze the process of tempering food products by sensing the
    products. This technology has a great deal of promise for the identification of
    non-visible adulterants in a non-destructive manner. Additionally, using AI in
    adulterant detection is an efficient and cost-effective approach, mainly for a
    larger number of adulterants. However, when AI examines more samples of real and
    fake goods, its accuracy will eventually increase due to its capacity to learn
    from new data and adapt. An increasing number of food adulteration products including
    edible oil, and beverages are detected using AI.SVM was employed to evaluate the
    quality of agricultural and food products, such as detecting adulterants in cheese,
    seacucumber, tomato, blueberry, and adulterated processed meat (Zhao, Feng, Chen,
    & Jia, 2019). According to Geng et al. (2022) employed the detection of contaminated
    fishmeal, an association of 3D-digital microscope and CNN was used, with 93.3%
    efficiency (Geng et al., 2022). Based on hyperspectral imaging, the CNN model
    was built as a model for quality and quantity features prediction for mutton adulterated
    with pig or duck, and it reached 99.85% efficiency (Yaoxin Zhang, Zheng, Zhu,
    & Ma, 2022). Additionally, CNN has achieved 99.87% efficiency in identifying minced
    mutton adulterated with pig in thermal pictures from various classes. Similarly,
    Izquierdo et al. (2020) classified pure honey and contaminated honey using a thermo-graphic
    camera and CNN, with up to 95% accuracy. Additionally, CNN successfully distinguished
    photos from different classes depend on the several quantities of syrup with a
    classification rate efficiency of roughly 93% (Izquierdo et al., 2020). It''s
    important to note from these publications that CNN has successfully recognized
    photos and has advanced to the state of the art in image pattern recognition.
    Additionally, CNNs consistently outperformed traditional ML for both categories
    and regression (Geng et al., 2022). SVM and partial least squares (PLS) models
    were outperformed by the suggested CNNs in both classification and regression
    (Yaoxin Zhang et al., 2022). Using CNN to statistically predict the porcine content
    of tainted mutton and swiftly identify it in comparison to k-nearest neighbour''s
    algorithm (KNN or k-NN) and SVM. However, in the field of food adulteration, SVM
    has outperformed other ML techniques with more outstanding results (Li, Shepperd,
    et al., 2020). The findings showed that derivative-least squares-SVM (Der-LS-SVM)
    outperformed PLS-DA in terms of efficiency (97.05%), sensitivity (96.57%), and
    specificity (97.58%) when it came to honey adulteration detection. The authenticity
    and adulteration of food have lately been determined using AI methods (Table 1).

    of food compositions and food image The capacity to predict food components with
    sufficient accuracy has a significant impact on food safety, product development,
    and overall nutrition. Conventional methods for analyzing the composition of food
    need a lot of laboratory testing, are expensive, and require a lot of manpower.
    However, recent advancements in AI offer a fantastic opportunity to overcome these
    constraints and produce precise and effective food component forecasts. According
    to a new study, ANNs can predict the chemical composition of peach fruit with
    high accuracy, indicating that AI has practical applications in the food industry
    (Pulimamidi & Buddha, 2023; Gradxs & Rao, 2023). These results are in line with
    the observation that ANN predicts the phenolic and flavonoid content of garlic
    more correctly than the response surface technique does. Dietary assessment is
    fraught with a multitude of research and personal challenges. Several techniques
    have been developed for evaluating food and meal patterns, but all of them rely
    on participants providing their own information. One such technique is principal
    component analysis. Deep learning algorithms for food picture recognition are
    among the novel approaches that are becoming more and more necessary as food databases
    get bigger. The “NutriNet” tool, for example, was created and meticulously evaluated
    using over 225,000 images of 520 distinct foods and beverages; in contrast, the
    GoCARB app performed as well in crab estimation as dieticians (Pulimamidi & Buddha,
    2023; Buddha, Kumar, & Reddy, 2022; Manikyam, McDonald, Mahoney, Andel, & Russ,
    2016). The goFOODTM software could approximate the number of calories and macronutrients
    in a given meal based only on photographs from a smartphone. Thus, nutritional
    assessment in human studies could benefit from these new tools. 3.8. Development
    of personalized nutrition AI makes it easier to design customized meal plans.
    Diverse phenotypic reactions to certain therapies may be explained by various
    biochemical, metabolic, genetic, and gut bacterial components; this is a consequence
    of a customized approach. AI and bioinformatics may be used to identify biomarkers
    connected to certain dietary interventions or health outcomes (Boland, Alam, &
    Bronlund, 2019). The aforementioned aid in both a better understanding of the
    molecular mechanisms underlying nutrition-related illnesses and the development
    of targeted therapeutics. The integration of bioinformatics'' computational power
    with artificial intelligence''s sophisticated algorithms and learning capabilities
    enables researchers to improve our understanding of nutrition-related phenomena,
    create customized treatments, and offer evidence-based recommendations to optimize
    human health and wellbeing. 3.9. Gut and gut microbiota The application of artificial
    intelligence methodologies may be utilized to investigate the connections between
    gut flora and nutrients. It is important to note that researching the different
    effects of probiotics can help develop probiotic combinations, single strains,
    and even synthetic strains using synthetic biology techniques. Furthermore, other
    sophisticated tailored models have been developed, such as the “enbiosis model,”
    which is believed to be reasonably successful in producing individualized meal
    programs to improve microbiome (Simhadri & Chaitanya, 2023; Vaddadi, Arnepalli,
    Thatikonda, & Padthe, 2022). In a pilot clinical trial, this AI-assisted eating
    plan considerably reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome when compared to
    a control diet. Cardiovascular risk prediction models were greatly improved by
    using AI-powered algorithms that incorporate gut microorganisms. 4. Applications
    of AI in agricultural industry Nearly every industry is being affected by innovations
    like the Internet of Things (IOTs), big data &analytics, AI, and ML. Through “smart
    farming,” efforts are being made to make agricultural products more “connected”
    and “intelligent” in order to increase their quality and quantity (Tavill, 2020).
    The influence of AI on the Argo-food sector and FMCG is shown in Fig. 6A. Several
    ML technologies that were implemented in the agricultural sector have improved
    crop management modern imaging. The AI methods use ML algorithms to examine grain
    pictures and spot flaws or contaminants like cracked kernels, foreign objects,
    or fungi. The agricultural grains were identified and classified effectively using
    ANN, dense scale-invariant feature transform (DSIFT) method, and SVM. ANNs are
    employed to categorize various wheat species according to their visual traits,
    such as form, size, and colour (Sabanci, Kayabasi, & Toktas, 2017). The DSIFT
    method is a computer vision technique that can recognize characteristics of wheat
    grains, such as their size, shape, and texture, and use these to classify the
    grains into several groups. Another ML method is SVM, which is used to classify
    wheat grains, identify fungal species in rice, analyze milled rice grains, and
    analyze wheat grains that have germinated. The weed Silybum marianum was detected
    using unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and counter propagation-ANN (CP-ANN) (Rejeb,
    Rejeb, Zailani, Keogh, & Appolloni, 2022).In order to find and identify weed species
    in agriculture fields, it can be highly helpful to use ANN and multi-spectral
    or hyperspectral imaging technology. The weed Silybum marianum was discovered
    using CP-ANN and multispectral images taken by UAS (Pantazi et al., 2017). Multispectral
    imaging entails taking pictures of crop fields at various light wavelengths, whereas
    CP-ANN is a kind of ANN that is utilized for pattern identification applications.
    In another study Binch and Fox (2017), a system for identifying crop and weed
    species was developed using hyperspectral imaging and ML approaches. By capturing
    the agricultural fields using a variety of light wavelengths, a process known
    as hyperspectral photography, it is possible to learn more about the spectral
    characteristics of various plant species. Then, after analyzing these photographs
    and categorizing various plant species, including crops and weeds, ML algorithms
    were applied. The classification of various weed kinds in grassland cropping systems
    has also been established by researchers using an SVM-based algorithm using photos
    from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (Binch & Fox, 2017). Strawberry harvesting
    is a labour and time-intensive activity that can be automated with robots like
    the Berry 5 Robot from Harvest Croo-Robotics (Tampa, FL, USA) (Xiong, Ge, Grimstad,
    & From, 2020). More quickly than a human, the robot can identify and select ripe
    strawberries using computer vision and ML techniques. It can improve the harvesting
    efficiencies of strawberries; this can help farmers cut labour costs and increase
    yields. Similar to this, robots like the “Robocrop” are being created for particular
    agricultural jobs, such pruning strawberry plant blooms. Download : Download high-res

    created to harvest matured strawberries employs computer vision and ML algorithms
    to recognize and choose the strawberries, lowering labour costs and enhancing
    the speed and efficiency of the harvesting operation. The IoTs, a new technological
    device that allows connection under remote conditions and enables smart farming.
    AI advocates the replacement of traditional agricultural methods and techniques
    with smart farming, a sustainable strategy that helps prevent resource waste and
    maintain the sustainable growth (Rejeb et al., 2022). Smart farming ensures the
    farmers about the adequate judgment of crops to improve their production by giving
    them extensive knowledge on particular crops; nutritional deflects of soil, moisture
    levels, and hyper-spectral data to minimize damage. Research indicates that the
    market for supply chain big data analytics would increase to $9.28 billion by
    2026 (Taneja et al., 2023). Agricultural technology start-ups using AI technologies
    is illustrated in Table 2. Table 2. Agricultural technology start-ups using artificial

    on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, enhancing the efficiency of irrigation systems.
    AI systems are able to predict weather patterns, evaluate the health of crops,
    and identify illnesses, pests, and inadequate plant nourishment. Using drones
    with AI technology, farmers can keep an eye on the health of their crops. The
    most time-consuming and physically taxing farm jobs are already being handled
    by some farmers utilizing agricultural robots. These machines can lighten the
    workload of workers and enable farmers to save money on physical labour. Fig.
    6B shows a potential project using ML to anticipate crop yield based on climate
    trends and vegetation indices from remote sensing. Climate records and regional
    or field imaging for the places and crop whose yield are want to forecast are
    required in the case of yield forecasting based on climatic factors and vegetation
    indices. A “supervised-learning” technique would be used in this instance because
    we are fairly certain which climate variables are crucial for crop yield. Precipitation
    totals, air temperatures, degrees of water stress, accumulation of growth degree-days,
    and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) are among the climatic and remote
    sensing indicators utilized as input to the model, as illustrated in Fig. 6B.
    The NDVI and other vegetation indices are computed using data captured by sensors
    installed on a variety of platforms, including satellites, aircraft, and drones.
    Because they include details regarding plant health, canopy coverage, and/or water
    status of canopies, NDVI values estimated during the cropping season aid in the
    yield forecasting process. 4.1. Effect of selected models on the crop classification
    performance A study by Wang et al. (2022) evaluated the influence of several CNN
    designs with varying number of layers on plant categorization from optical pictures
    captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs). They suggested a CNN-based architecture
    that beat state-of-the-art CNN designs, with FDN-17, FDN-29, and FDN-92 obtaining
    overall accuracy of 86%, 84%, and 87%, respectively, compared to 80%, 76%, and
    82% for Inception-V1, ResNet-101, and Dense-Net-121 (Wang, Liu, et al., 2022),
    respectively. Another studyby Morales et al. (2018) examined the effects of the
    chosen U-Net-based topologies on overall categorization performance (Morales et
    al., 2018). Similarly, YOLOv3 outperformed the RetinaNet detector in terms of
    performance, which were trained on the same dataset and achieved an average precision
    of 79.85% compared to 73.41% for the RetinaNet (Bouguettaya, Zarzour, Kechida,
    Taberkit, & Applications, 2022). This is likely owing to the two detectors'' distinct
    backbone topologies, DarkNet-53 for YOLOv3 and ResNet for RetinaNet. Furthermore,
    the authors Fuentes-Pacheco et al. (2019) develoed a SegNet-based architecture
    with fewer layers, resulting in fewer trainable parameters, making it quicker
    and more straightforward (Fuentes-Pacheco et al., 2019). Because of the two detection
    steps, Faster R-CNN has the slowest inference time of 163 ms/image, making it
    unsuitable for real-time operations or compact devices. However, as expected,
    one-stage algorithms (YOLOv3 and Retina Net) acquired the lowest computational
    cost, allowing for real-time detection. According to CrowNet that depends on the
    SegNet architecture outperforms the Mask Scoring R-CNN architecture in maize crop
    row segmentation attaining accuracy rates of approximately 85% and 83%, respectively
    (Pang et al., 2020). However, the decreased precision supplied by Mask Scoring
    R-CNN may be attributed to the greater flying altitude, which ranges between 40
    and 60 m over the ground''s surface. Furthermore, the created model received instruction
    on only two developing stages (V4 and V5), which may have an impact on its ability
    to detect maize crop rows at subsequent growth stages. Also, Yang, Tseng, Hsu,
    and Tsai (2020) studied the FCN method outperformed SegNet with an F1-score of
    83.21% and an inference time of 72 s per image, while SegNet attained only 69.36%
    and an inference time of 106 s per image (Yang et al., 2020). Furthermore, SegNet
    has a very high false detection rate with a recall rate of <30% when using RGB?
    Ex-G? ExGR data and a GSD of 5.7 cm/pixel. However, Song et al. (2020) in the
    instance of sunflower crop classification, SegNet architecture delivers somewhat
    higher overall accuracy than FCN (Song et al., 2020). Similarly, Bah, Hafiane,
    and Canals (2019) discovered that the FCN architecture performs quite poorly at
    detecting beet rows (Bah et al., 2019). Fig. 6C depicts a comparison of different
    algorithms used to classify distinct crop varieties. 5. Sustainability of AI in
    agro-food industry SVM and ANN models were used to support modern ML-based food
    processing technologies that detected the presence of nitrosamine in red meat
    food samples (Arora & Mangipudi, 2021). Furthermore, AI-powered cucumber harvesting
    robots with computer vision systems and hardware such an autonomous vehicle, a
    manipulator, and an end-effectors have been developed. These robots can accurately
    detect and image the ripeness of cucumbers (Van Henten et al., 2002). Moreover,
    AI has demonstrated its efficacy in enhancing the physical fields of microwave,
    radio frequency, infrared radiation, and ultrasonic fields used in the drying
    process of fresh foods, fruits, and vegetables (Sun, Zhang, & Mujumdar, 2019).
    For instance, employing AI to detect and control the drying process online helps
    cut down on energy use, eliminate uneven drying, enhance sensory assessment, and
    minimize nutritional loss (Chen, Zhang, Xu, Sun, & Mujumdar, 2020). To provide
    one more illustration, (Amani & Sarkodie, 2022) offered a method for detecting
    rotten meat using deep learning, which is a significant contributor to food waste
    and greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional methods of managing the supply chain
    for meat, prevalent in many developing countries, rely on non-intelligent equipment
    and manual monitoring that is prone to human error. Reducing waste and halting
    the spread of pathogens require early detection of bad meat. AI is able to instantly
    discern between fresh and rotten meat thanks to deep learning and image processing.
    These AI systems practice on various images of meat to learn how to detect decaying
    (Zheng, 2022). The study demonstrated how well machine learning techniques can
    predict important soil metrics including total nitrogen, organic carbon content,
    and moisture content (Morellos et al., 2016). Furthermore, ML algorithms have
    shown to be beneficial for streamlining irrigation procedures, improving crop
    quality and quantity, and skill fully handling drought conditions when included
    into smart irrigation systems (Goap, Sharma, Shukla, & Krishna, 2018). To maximize
    water resources, smart farms use automated irrigation systems that keep an eye
    on and manage water tanks, chamber and open irrigation systems. Crop management
    with AI starts at seeding and continues with crop development, harvesting, storage,
    and distribution monitoring. Many ML algorithm models are available for predicting
    the weather (Saggi & Jain, 2019), crop protection (A. Singh, Shukla, & Mishra,
    2018), weed detection (Liakos, Busato, Moshou, Pearson, & Bochtis, 2018), crop
    quality management (Chlingaryan, Sukkarieh, & Whelan, 2018), and harvesting (Sadgrove,
    Falzon, Miron, & Lamb, 2018). An in-depth understanding of weather patterns facilitates
    decision-making, which raises agricultural yields of superior quality (Aubry,
    Papy, & Capillon, 1998). The information or data collected by AI agents is analyzed
    by deep learning algorithms and AI-powered systems, making it easier to monitor
    the health of crops and soil (Morvan et al., 2008). Studies have shown that artificial
    intelligence and image processing have made substantial progress in tackling the
    problem of weed identification (Karimi, Prasher, Patel, & Kim, 2006). These earlier
    research demonstrate the potential of AI models, in particular SVM, to increase
    crop output through timely interventions by showing that SVM is excellent at early
    stress diagnosis during crop growth and efficient at identifying optimal nitrogen
    delivery rates (Karimi et al., 2006). Furthermore, a study emphasizes the financial
    importance of minimizing profit and yield declines associated with weeds (Neil
    Harker, 2001) and highlights the role of AI and ML in addressing spatial heterogeneity
    and its impact on crop yield (Swanton, Nkoa, & Blackshaw, 2015). The application
    of AI-based technology in food production and agriculture may benefit the environment,
    according to research findings (Alamu, Menkir, Adesokan, Fawole, & Maziya-Dixon,
    2022). By 2030, these technologies might, for example, save over 300 billion liters
    of water, enhance crop yields by up to 30%, and cut yearly oil usage by 25 million
    barrels (Strategy, 2015). 6. Challenges and future trends According to the United
    States Department of Agriculture (USDA), food, agriculture, and other related
    industries contributed $1.109 trillion to the U.S. GDP in 2019. Yet AI is not
    utilized widely throughout these large sectors. The adoption of AI in the food
    industry is boundless and will drive process efficiencies and customizable experiences.
    It will undoubtedly have an impact on the economy and daily life. A variety of
    AI technologies, such as expert systems, ANNs, DL, and FL, can be used to identify
    the quality of agriculture and food items. Various hybrid non-destructive approaches,
    including the e-nose, computer vision systems, and spectroscopic techniques, have
    been merged for real-time monitoring in problem resolution connected to quality
    of food, taking into account the distinctions of these AI tools. In addition,
    the reliability and computational efficiency of the entire system could be improved
    by combining mathematical models, export systems, ANNs, DL, and FL. There isn''t
    a single algorithm that can fix every issue. For a model to be effective, the
    best learning algorithm must be chosen for the specific task at hand. The goal
    of further studies should be to create a framework architecture where algorithms
    tested and trained for a specific use (such as identifying certain flaws in agricultural
    output and identifying food adulteration) are suggested for future employed in
    practice. Depending on the dataset, one or more methodologies or numerous instrumental
    approaches may be used in terms of data processing. In this manner, integrating
    numerous types of sensors can be difficult since it necessitates collecting data
    from many types of sensors and examining the advantages and disadvantages of each
    sensor in a specific application.AI has been effectively used to evaluate quantitative
    analyses of fruit deterioration, including mechanical damage and chilling injury.
    These approaches often rely on an experimentally determined severity index, either
    by direct induction through an experimental process or through the temporal progression
    of the defect. Using learning techniques, the distinction between the various
    levels of deterioration picked up by objective, non-destructive measuring tools
    was clarified. The quantification of damage and disorders, which is still a difficult
    problem in the agriculture business and calls for more focus on employing learning
    algorithms in the future, is another field of study that sophisticated AI algorithms
    have not yet fully investigated. First and foremost, the biggest social issue
    facing society is potential unemployment. As intelligent machines and robots have
    the potential to replace most monotonous jobs and tasks, human intervention in
    the labour market is decreasing, which will pose a serious danger to employment
    standards. Other technical difficulties include the fact that machines can only
    perform functions for which they are designed or programmed; if they are used
    for anything else, they frequently malfunction or provide results that are not
    relevant. Furthermore, the high expenses associated with developing and maintaining
    intelligent machines and clever computers may be viewed as technological barriers
    to AI advancements. This is particularly true given that AI is constantly evolving,
    necessitating regular updates to hardware and software in order to stay up to
    date. Equipment requires costly upkeep and repairs. Because they are extremely
    complicated machines, their creation comes at a significant expense. The high
    cost of these applications, which could raise the price of the items, is another
    problem. Furthermore, in addition to the advantages that smart and computerized
    technologies provide, there are potential risks and concerns that could affect
    sustainability. These include the enormous energy consumption, the e-waste issue,
    market concentration, employment displacement, and even the ethical framework
    (Patelli & Mandrioli, 2020). 7. Conclusions AI integration in agricultural and
    food processing has the potential to completely transform these sectors, providing
    various advantages in terms of productivity, sustainability, and quality. Throughout
    this study, the application of AI throughout the entire food processing environment
    is addressed, including beverage manufacturing from fruits, vegetable processing,
    dairy sector processing, crop production, and its significance in intelligent
    food packaging are discussed. It lowers the risk of food borne illnesses and ensures
    product quality by detecting pollutants, and spoilage in food products. AI can
    help with traceability as well, making it possible to quickly identify and remove
    contaminated products from the market. Similarly, in the agricultural industry,
    AI has played an important role in crop yield optimization, herbicide and fertilizer
    optimization, crop and weed detection, and fruit harvesting. AI models are effective
    in classification of crop. Global population is predicted to exceed 9 billion
    by 2050, necessitating a 70% increase in agricultural production to satisfy the
    demand. Only around 10% of this enhanced production may come from empty lands,
    with the remainder to be fulfilled by present production intensification. In this
    environment, the deployment of cutting-edge technical solutions to increase agricultural
    efficiency remains critical. Current tactics for increasing agricultural productivity
    necessitate large energy inputs, yet the market expects high-quality food. Robotics
    and artificial intelligence are expected to change the global industry that enables
    the increase production of agri-food products (from farm to retail shelf). These
    technologies will have a significant impact on major sectors of the economy with
    low productivity. Overall, the incorporation of AI into agri-food systems holds
    immense potential in addressing key challenges within agriculture, fostering sustainability,
    and contributing substantially to global food security. As we celebrate one year
    of progress, it is evident that AI continues to be a driving force in reshaping
    the future of agriculture and food industry. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps are vital prerequisites for weather
    prediction models. This study proposes a framework to generate LULC maps based
    on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 24-category scheme using Google Earth Engine.
    To realize a precise LULC map, a fusion of pixel-based and object-based classification
    strategies was implemented using various machine learning techniques across different
    seasons. For this purpose, feature importance analysis was conducted on the top
    classifiers considering the dynamic (seasonal) behavior of LULC. The results showed
    that ensemble approaches such as Random Forest and Gradient Tree Boosting outperformed
    other algorithms. The results also demonstrated that the object-based approach
    had better performance due to the consideration of contextual features. Finally,
    the proposed fusion framework produced a LULC map with higher accuracy (overall
    accuracy = 94.92% and kappa coefficient = 94.19%). Furthermore, the performance
    of the generated LULC map was assessed by applying it to the Weather Research
    and Forecasting (WRF) model for downscaling wind speed and 2-m air temperature
    (T2). The assessment indicated that the generated LULC map effectively reflected
    real-world conditions, thereby impacting the estimation of wind speed and T2 fields
    by WRF. Statistical assessments demonstrated enhancements in RMSE by 0.02 °C,
    MAE by 1 °C, and Bias by 0.03 °C for T2. Additionally, there was an improvement
    of 0.06 m/s in MAE for wind speed. Consequently, the framework can be implemented
    to produce accurate and up-to-date high-resolution LULC maps in various geographical
    areas worldwide. The source codes corresponding to this research paper are available

    8Weather forecast 1. Introduction Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) is a required
    piece of information for estimating meteorological and climatic parameters. These
    parameters are essential in various fields such as environmental assessment, climate
    change, and sustainable development (Huang et al., 2017; Kedia et al., 2021; Navin
    and Agilandeeswari, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). For example, in climate change, LULC
    influences local and regional climates via evaporation and transpiration. Changes
    in LULC, such as the transformation of natural vegetation into agricultural or
    urban areas, induce variations in atmospheric interactions, consequently impacting
    temperature, humidity, and precipitation patterns (Näschen et al., 2019). On the
    other hand, meteorological parameters serve as crucial inputs for climate models,
    facilitating the simulation of future climate scenarios. Thus, enhancing the accuracy
    in estimating these parameters elevates the confidence level of climate models,
    yielding more reliable climate change predictions on both regional and global
    scales. Meteorological parameters are also considered in the field of air pollution
    modeling. Wind speed and temperature affect the dispersion and transfer of greenhouse
    gases (Pérez et al., 2021). Accurate estimation of these parameters is significant
    for understanding the carbon cycle, estimating pollutant concentrations, and analyzing
    the influence of human activities on the environment and climate. Furthermore,
    accurate meteorological parameters make the potential for periodic warnings and
    preparations, thereby mitigating the impact of extreme events on both natural
    ecosystems and human infrastructures. In sustainable development, estimating the
    values of wind speed and solar radiation is necessary to plan for efficient use
    of renewable energy sources. Improving the accuracy of these values supports the
    development of wind and solar energy systems. It helps efficiently utilize renewable
    energy sources, reduce reliance on fossil fuels, and decrease their adverse environmental
    impacts. In all the examples above, accurate mapping and updating of LULC maps
    can significantly impact the estimation of target parameters. In this regard,
    this study aims to pave the way for performing this task. Based on the application,
    the type of the classes defined on the land cover map has an essential impact
    on modeling energy interactions between the land and atmosphere and hydrological
    cycles (Tariq et al., 2023). As a result, the accurate identification of classes
    is vital for effectively estimating and predicting. Therefore, merely assessing
    the accuracy of the generated LULC map is insufficient, and its performance on
    the estimation of target parameters should also be analyzed. For instance, one
    of these critical parameters is air temperature. LULC is associated with local
    temperature variations. Different classes, such as wetlands, broadleaf forests,
    water bodies, and agricultural lands, contribute to local temperature reduction.
    At the same time, residential areas, traffic zones, and greenhouse agriculture
    zones play a role in local temperature increase (Jeong et al., 2015). LULC also
    influences wind speed. It has been investigated that the maximum daily wind speed
    varies based on urbanization rates and development. The interaction between pollutant
    sources and urban planning factors, such as LULC, plays a significant role in
    air quality (Shikwambana and Tsoeleng, 2020). Land cover is a dynamic and constantly
    changing attribute of the Earth''s surface, requiring regular updates to reflect
    its current state accurately. Consequently, producing accurate, precise, sustainable,
    and reliable LULC maps is crucial for conducting various analyses (Ghorbanian
    et al., 2020). The LULC scheme should be compatible with the analysis and scale
    of the study. For example, using a LULC scheme specifically designed for urban
    areas may not be suitable for studying regional weather parameters. Harmonization
    should exist between LULC classes and environmental analysis (Jansen, 2006). As
    mentioned earlier, one of the critical applications of LULC maps is the numerical
    modeling of meteorological and climatic parameters using different physical schemes.
    Numerical weather forecast models are employed along with satellite imagery and
    radar data to enhance the accuracy of weather forecasts. Analyzing the numerical
    sensitivity provides valuable information about the model''s responses to different
    parameterizations (Yoon et al., 2021). Numerical models can simulate complex interactions
    among meteorological variables and give an understandable representation of these
    processes using physical schemes and the concept of parameterization. One of the
    most widely used models for this purpose is the Weather Research and Forecasting
    (WRF) model. WRF was Developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research
    (NCAR) in collaboration with 150 other institutions worldwide. The use of the
    WRF model is not limited to analyzing atmospheric parameters. Different extensions
    of this model have been developed for use in various applications, such as air
    chemistry (WRF-Chem), forest fire simulation (WRF-Fire), and hydrology (WRF-Hydro).
    In the WRF model, LULC data based on the USGS 24-category LULC classification
    system is used as static input data to estimate and predict meteorological parameters.
    Different LULC classes impact the model''s surface calibration parameter, changing
    the energy interaction level between the land and the atmosphere (Payraudeau et
    al., 2003). For instance, considering the parameter of wind speed, one of the
    most significant factors influencing horizontal wind speed is the surface roughness
    length, which is affected by the LULC classes. Another example is the impact of
    LULC data on land surface parameters, such as radiation balance, absorption, and
    reflection. Consequently, the air temperature and surface temperature estimation
    can vary by LULC change. Satellite observations have served as the primary source
    of information in various applications. Remote sensing has significantly contributed
    to enhancing our understanding and knowledge of atmospheric dynamics, oceans,
    and vegetation cover and has also provided novel perspectives in Earth sciences
    research (Goetz et al., 1985). Integrating remote sensing and Geographic Information
    Systems (GIS) provides a powerful tool for LULC mapping and monitoring (Mohamed,
    2017). Accurate and reliable LULC maps necessitate acquiring and processing a
    significant volume of satellite imagery. This task has high computational complexity
    due to the challenges in hardware capabilities and the classification process.
    On the other hand, the advancement of cloud computing systems has addressed many
    of these challenges, leading to improved efficiency, scalability, cost reduction,
    and more accessible data provisioning. One of these cloud-based platforms is the
    Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. GEE has been designed and implemented for
    storing and processing vast spatial datasets on a petabyte scale (Kumar and Mutanga,
    2019). This cloud platform provides easy access to high-performance computational
    resources, allowing researchers to readily share their developed algorithms with
    others (Gorelick et al., 2017). GEE is constantly updated and supports modern
    algorithms and Machine Learning (ML) methods. As a powerful tool, ML offers significant
    capabilities for detecting complex relationships, dependencies, and correlations
    within spatial datasets. These models explore hidden patterns from spatial data
    that exhibit complex correlations and interactions. Many spatial phenomena involve
    non-linear relationships, which ML can efficiently detect by extracting meaningful
    features from the data. Creating a robust framework for generating LULC maps based
    on the USGS 24 standard, using remote sensing observations and implementing ML
    tools within the GEE environment, enables the utilization of the updated version
    of the LULC map in the WRF model for accurate weather parameter estimation. In
    this regard, the efficient fusion of data in various levels (pixel, spectral features,
    and decision level) and across different time intervals leads to the generation
    of LULC maps with a higher level of quality. The primary aim of this study is
    to present a robust framework utilizing the GEE cloud platform for the generation
    or updating of the USGS 24-category LULC map. This framework is specifically tailored
    for integration with the WRF numerical model. It is essential to highlight that
    the current USGS 24-category LULC maps incorporated within the WRF model demonstrate
    suboptimal quality in various global regions. Additionally, in particular geographical
    areas, these maps still need to be updated to address the changes in land use
    patterns. Since the decline in quality or lack of updates in the USGS 24-category
    LULC map leads to a reduction in the reliability of the analyses, the implementation
    of a framework for generating high-quality USGS 24-category LULC maps and replacing
    them in the WRF model is the primary purpose of this investigation. In this regard,
    this research has the following objectives: 1. Implementation of two classification
    strategies based on the pixel-level and object-level features collected in different
    seasons from Landsat 8 imagery on the GEE cloud platform using labels provided
    by experts, then performance evaluation of the strategies for LULC classification.
    2. Performance evaluation of various ML algorithms, including RF, GTB, SVM, and
    CART in both strategies as mentioned above, and selection of the best model for
    LULC classification. 3. Feature importance analysis on the best classifier and
    selecting the best features for each strategy mentioned above in different periods.
    Then, the selected features are combined to generate a new LULC map. 4. Performance
    evaluation of the generated USGS 24-category LULC map using the WRF model for
    simulating and estimating atmospheric parameters such as T2 and wind speed. As
    a novelty, by the proposed framework in this research, the generation of an accurate
    and up-to-date LULC map based on the USGS 24-category schema is realized for any
    arbitrary geographical area through the open-access GEE cloud processing platform.
    Another contribution of this investigation is the development of a pipeline to
    automatically substitute the newly generated LULC map for the default map in WRF.
    Consequently, the updated map contributes to more precise forecasting of weather
    parameters. This paper consists of several sections. An overview of the objectives,
    research problems, and novelty of this study were presented earlier in the current
    section. The literature review of previous studies has been done in Section 2.
    The study area and the data employed in this study are introduced in 3 Study area,
    4 Materials, respectively. The proposed framework for generating LULC maps, along
    with implementation details, are provided in Section 5. The results obtained from
    various experiments to generate a LULC map for substituting in the WRF model are
    represented in Section 6. Section 7 discusses the acquired results and the potential
    of utilizing the LULC map generated by the proposed framework in estimating atmospheric
    parameters. 2. Related work Generating up-to-date and precise LULC maps is crucial
    for accurately estimating meteorological parameters. This contribution is significant
    for effectively managing various environmental issues, addressing climate change,
    and working towards sustainable development goals. Therefore, LULC changes should
    be considered for creating sustainable development plans and dealing with environmental
    challenges. This consideration is particularly crucial in areas with high biodiversity
    and valuable resources, where economic factors also play a significant role (Alvarado
    et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2022; Xin et al., 2023). The environment is directly
    affected by how land is utilized and the economic incentives associated with it
    (Dagar et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2022). LULC maps provide valuable insights into
    the impacts of human activities on environmental challenges. To understand these
    impacts and devise effective strategies, it is crucial to produce accurate LULC
    maps using modern machine learning and data fusion methods. Numerous studies have
    been conducted on various scales to investigate the relationship between LULC
    and different climatic and environmental parameters (Chanu et al., 2021; Chim
    et al., 2021; Hengade and Eldho, 2016; Saha et al., 2020). Fig. 1 provides a SmartArt
    chart to better review previous investigations conducted in the scope of this
    paper. In a study, the spatio-temporal modeling of precipitation based on LULC
    was investigated in the megacity of Shanghai. In four years, including 1979, 1990,
    2000, and 2010, LULC data and the long-term trend of daily precipitation from
    1979 to 2010 were considered. The analyses revealed that the precipitation patterns
    varied in different regions, including urban outskirts, suburban areas, and urban
    areas. The suburban regions exhibited a significant upward trend in rainfall,
    whereas the urban areas experienced a decreasing trend in precipitation (Jiang
    et al., 2020). In another study performed on the Yangtze River Delta in China,
    stations located in areas with high urbanization rates from 1990 to 2015 exhibited
    the strongest negative annual trend in wind speed and indicated the key role of
    urbanization in weakening wind speed (Zhang et al., 2022). Another study investigated
    the impact of LULC changes on Land Surface Temperature (LST) in the San Luis Potosí
    Basin, Mexico, from 2007 to 2020. The findings revealed an average increase of
    11 °C in LST. Notably, areas categorized as sparse vegetation or barren land exhibited
    the highest temperatures, while dense vegetation and water classes displayed the
    lowest temperatures (Ovalle et al., 2021). LULC patterns are intricately linked
    to the concentration levels of various pollutants, including PM2.5. For example,
    Dhaka, Indonesia, is one of the top five megacities with the highest particulate
    matter pollution. As a result, policymakers and executives seek to improve air
    quality through changes in LULC. Zarin and Esraz-Ul-Zannat investigated the relationship
    between PM2.5 concentration levels and LULC changes. They utilized Rapid Eye satellite
    imagery for LULC classification in 2012 and 2018. Water bodies and vegetation
    cover experienced a decrease of 2% and 5% in 2012 and 2018, respectively, while
    barren lands witnessed an increase of 4% and 3.4%, respectively. Correlation analyses
    revealed a positive association between decreasing vegetation cover and water
    bodies with an increase in PM2.5 levels. (Zarin and Esraz-Ul-Zannat, 2023). Download

    Literature review of the SmartArt chart form. The WRF model is a well-known and
    widely used model for simulating weather conditions and estimating meteorological
    parameters. This model utilizes static geographic and gridded data to simulate
    atmospheric conditions (Khvorostyanov et al., 2010; Skamarock et al., 2019). Several
    studies have explored the enhancement of accuracy in simulation results by refining
    input parameters such as topography, LULC map, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) within
    the WRF model (Bhavana et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019a; Navale and Singh, 2020).
    One of the LULC schemes used in the WRF model is the USGS 24-class. The utilization
    and implementation of the USGS 24-class LULC classification in the WRF model have
    been validated and evaluated in various studies (Jiménez-Esteve et al., 2018;
    Kerandi et al., 2017). Li et al. validated the impact of LULC changes on estimating
    T2 and wind speed by WRF. They achieved a bias of 1.456 °C and RMSE of 3.112 °C
    for the parameter T2. Additionally, they achieved a bias of 0.905 m/s, accompanied
    by an RMSE of 2.527 m/s for wind speed (Li et al., 2020a). In one study, the WRF
    model was used in the northern region of China, where environmental and socio-economic
    conditions influenced climate variations. The simulations were carried out for
    2001 and 2010, considering the dynamic interactions between LULC and climatic
    changes in this region. This experiment computed four biophysical parameters:
    albedo, vegetation fraction, LAI, and emissivity based on LULC changes. The WRF
    simulation demonstrated that changes in LULC led to a substantial reduction of
    approximately 1 °C in summer temperatures and an increase of about 0.8 °C in winter
    temperatures. Additionally, the WRF model''s performance was improved by utilizing
    new LULC data (Cao et al., 2015). Wang et al. employed the WRF-Chem model coupled
    with the urban canopy model and urban expansion models to investigate the impacts
    of urbanization expansion in the Pearl River Delta. They examined the early 1990s
    (before urbanization) and March 2001 (post-urbanization). The analyses revealed
    that LULC changes due to urban expansion led to an approximately 0.63 °C increase
    in the monthly average temperature. Additionally, the monthly average wind speed
    at 10 m height decreased by up to 38%. Subsequently, alterations in meteorological
    parameters caused changes in the concentrations of pollutants such as O3, VOC,
    NO, and NO2. The urban expansion increased four parts per billion by volume (ppbv)
    in NOx concentration and a 1.5 ppbv increase in VOC concentration (Wang et al.,
    2009). LULC is also a crucial parameter influencing the occurrence of flood events
    (Ganjirad and Delavar, 2023). Dixit et al. investigated the impact of LULC changes
    on the occurrence of floods. The study area was the state of Kerala, India, where
    the August 2018 floods happened. Using meteorological data and LULC maps for the
    years 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2018, simulations were performed using the WRF-Hydro
    model to understand the role of LULC changes in the occurrence of floods. The
    analysis of LULC revealed that evergreen forests and shrublands experienced a
    significant reduction from 1995 to 2005, while mixed forests showed a substantial
    decrease from 2005 to 2018. The most notable changes in flood-related attributes,
    including discharge, inundation area, and flood surface height, were observed
    for the LULC changes in the 1995–2005 period. High flows increased by more than
    10% (Dixit et al., 2022). Remote sensing is a crucial information source, pivotal
    in generating LULC data. Extensive research has been dedicated to this field,
    generating diverse LULC maps at regional and global scales in various resolutions
    (Grekousis et al., 2015). Nowadays, facilitated by open access to satellite imagery
    and the concurrent utilization of cloud processing systems, the creation of up-to-date
    LULC maps over large geographical areas has become feasible. Cloud processing
    systems such as GEE facilities employ, process, and fuse diverse satellite imagery
    by machine learning techniques. GEE also provides the possibility of seasonal
    and time series analysis of satellite imagery for accurate LULC mapping. On the
    contrary, local processing systems cannot process large volumes of satellite imagery
    due to storage and computational limitations. In a study conducted in Colombia
    by Gonzales et al., a LULC map was generated using Landsat 8 images according
    to the CORINE scheme. Since the study area was extensive, the GEE cloud system
    was used to process the images. In this study, the SVM model showed the best result
    with an overall accuracy of 92% (González-González et al., 2022). In another study
    conducted by Orieschnig et al. on the Mekong Delta region with an area of 44 square
    km, the LULC map in 6 classes, including open water surfaces, bare/fallow land,
    urban/village areas, fruit trees, rice field, and the vegetable field was generated
    by the GEE. In this study, to improve the accuracy of the LULC map, multi-temporal
    images along with the integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were used.
    With a few classes and a smaller study area, this approach reached an accuracy
    of 94% (Orieschnig et al., 2021). In another study, a LULC map based on the LCZ
    scheme with 14 classes was produced in the GBA region of China. The final dataset
    was gathered using Landsat 8 images and Google Earth software. By implementing
    the RF model in the local processing environment, an accuracy of 85.28% was achieved.
    Then, by performing a correlation analysis between the generated LULC and derived
    LST, it was found that the spatial morphology changes of the built-up class positively
    correlated with the increase in LST (Lu et al., 2021). In another study, object-level
    features were considered, and Sentinel-2 images were utilized within GEE to generate
    a LULC map covering the Umbria region, spanning an area of 154 square km. This
    study provided an accuracy of 89.3% for only seven classes by implementing the
    RF model (Tassi and Vizzari, 2020). LULC classification was done by Seyam et al.
    on the Mymensingh region with an area of 445.05 square km. The urbanization rate
    in this region was 217.1% in ten years. The LULC map in 5 classes, including water
    body, build-up, agriculture, barren land, and vegetation, was produced using the
    Maximum likelihood method with an accuracy of 89.6% in a local processing system
    (Seyam et al., 2023). Shafizadeh-Moghadam et al. utilized the GEE platform to
    create LULC maps for the Tigris and Euphrates regions using a time series of Landsat
    8 satellite images. The classes in this study included forest, rangeland, irrigated
    crop, rainfed crop, garden, barren, water, wetland, and artificial surfaces. The
    image segmentation and classification were performed using the Simple Non-Iterative
    Clustering (SNIC) algorithm and RF, respectively. The generated LULC map achieved
    an overall accuracy of 91.7%. The water and wetland classes had the highest accuracy,
    while the garden and rangeland classes exhibited the lowest accuracy (Shafizadeh-Moghadam
    et al., 2021). In another study, Sellami and Rhinane extracted Sentinel 2 images
    in the GEE platform and applied five functions; “Median”, “Mean”, “Max”, “Min”,
    and “Mode” to examine the performance of these functions in pre-processing of
    satellite images for classification purposes. In this way, five new datasets were
    generated. Then, three algorithms, namely RF, SVM, and Classification And Regression
    Tree (CART), were employed for classifying the images. In this study, the “Median”
    mapping using SVM yielded better results with an accuracy of 87.99% (Sellami and
    Rhinane, 2023). As explained above and depicted in the SmartArt chart shown in
    Fig. 1, several challenges still exist despite the considerable efforts made in
    recent investigations for generating and updating LULC maps. These challenges
    include obtaining input data with suitable quality, updating LULC maps, and acquiring
    appropriate training data (Fonte et al., 2017; Troy et al., 2007; Yang et al.,
    2009). This research aims to address these challenges by developing a relatively
    automated framework for LULC map generation. 3. Study area In this research, the
    study area is the state of California, located in the United States. The geographical
    limit of California is depicted in Fig. 2, which also highlights the distribution
    of existing meteorological stations within the state. Positioned along the Pacific
    Ocean coast in the western region of the United States, California is between
    the 32.53° to 42.01° north latitude and 114.13° to 124.48° west longitude. With
    a land area covering 423,973 square km, California ranks as the third-largest
    state in landmass within the United States. Notably, its population reached approximately
    39.44 million in 2019, establishing it as the most densely populated state in
    the country (U. S. Government, 2023). Download : Download high-res image (953KB)

    area, the state of California located in the United States, along with a network
    of various meteorological measurement stations, including the Global Historical
    Climatology Network (GHCN), Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow (CoCoRaHS),
    and California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS). Due to its vast
    expanse, California is generally divided geographically into two main regions:
    Northern and Southern California. The Central Valley is located at the heart of
    the state, serving as the agricultural powerhouse of California. Following Alaska,
    California possesses the highest amount of forested land. Approximately 45% of
    the state''s total area is covered by forests. Salton Salt Lake is located in
    the south of the state, which has various effects on the environment of the southern
    part of the state. The whole southeast of California is desert and dry. The ocean
    moderates temperatures in coastal areas and maintains its temperature consistency
    throughout the year. Fog, particularly in the morning, is expected, so San Francisco
    is the foggiest city during the summer. Southern regions typically experience
    a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is worth noting
    that the southern regions experience a higher average temperature compared to
    the central and northern areas. The northern parts of the state have a maritime
    temperate climate and receive higher precipitation than the southern regions.
    Additionally, the central areas face hotter summers and drier winters (LaDochy
    et al., 2007). It can be concluded that California has one of the most diverse
    and unpredictable climates. This diversity and change in climate intensifies the
    environmental, social, and economic challenges. The average temperature of California
    has increased by approximately 3 °F from 1896 to the present day. If the current
    trend of greenhouse gas emissions continues, it is likely that by 2040, this state
    may experience a temperature increase of over 2 °F, and by 2070, a rise of over
    4 °F (U. S. Diego, 2023). One of the effects of climate change is on the agriculture
    industry. California is a world leader in agriculture, producing more than 400
    agricultural products (Pathak et al., 2018). Climate change models predict California''s
    warmer and drier future, potentially leading to shorter growing seasons (Schneider
    and Mazer, 2016). Land use change is a pivotal determinant influencing climate
    and weather patterns within this region. The alteration in LULC patterns has precipitated
    shifts in surface energy interactions, thereby inducing changes in the carbon
    cycle. Consequently, this series of changes will exert an influence on the climate
    of the area. (Pielke Sr et al., 2002). Finally, considering the large population,
    the variety of weather patterns, and the geographical situation of the region,
    California is a suitable place to conduct this study. Analysis and investigation
    in warm and cool seasons can help better understand this region''s changes. 4.
    Materials 4.1. USGS 24-category LULC Land classification schemes consider both
    land use and land cover. The USGS classification scheme is well-recognized and
    widely used in climate, environmental geography, and numerical weather simulation.
    The first USGS LULC was produced from AVHRR satellite data collected during 1992
    and 1993, in which the land cover was classified into 24 distinct classes (Hai
    et al., 2018). The primary objective of this dataset was to develop a national
    classification system utilizing remote sensing and aerial data, creating a comprehensive
    framework for LULC categorization at various national levels. The LULC classification
    system initially evolved into two levels of detail, Level 1 and Level 2. Subsequently,
    local states expanded it to Levels 3 and 4 of detail based on their specific needs
    (Anderson, 1976). Level 1 includes extensive land uses such as agriculture or
    urban and built. In each class related to level 1, more detailed classes are defined
    (Hille, 2004). The USGS classification scheme can be utilized in various fields,
    such as environmental studies, regional planning, etc. Since one of the fundamental
    objectives of this research is to assess the accuracy of the generated LULC and
    its interaction with various meteorological parameters, it is essential to select
    a classification scheme that plays an essential role in simulating atmospheric
    parameters. In other words, the chosen classification scheme and the number of
    classes significantly impact the estimation of meteorological parameters (Payraudeau
    et al., 2003). Numerous research studies have demonstrated that the WRF model
    can be effectively employed for high-resolution regional simulations and predictions
    (Hai et al., 2018; Pattanayak and Mohanty, 2008; Shiri, 2018). One of the fundamental
    static input data used by the WRF model to estimate and predict the meteorological
    parameters is LULC. This data can be selected based on the USGS 24-category classification
    scheme. The 24 classes of LULC used in the WRF are represented in Table 1. However,
    the LULC employed by the WRF model is not up-to-date and accurate for different
    regions worldwide. Thus, this study proposes a framework for accurate mapping
    of LULC based on the USGS 24-category scheme to be used in the WRF model. The
    default LULC provided for WRF simulation is also applied in the comparative experiments
    and analysis to validate the proposed framework. Table 1. USGS 24 LULC classes
    defined for WRF simulation. Category Index Name of the Category 1 Urban and Built-up

    Bare Ground Tundra 24 Snow or Ice 4.2. Satellite data The primary objective of
    creating the USGS LULC classification was to establish a specific framework for
    generating LULC with satellite and aerial data. One of the well-known satellite
    sensors widely used for LULC generation is Landsat 8. Landsat 8 is a multispectral
    sensor that collects remote sensing data in 11 spectral bands, including Visible,
    Near-Infrared (NIR), Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), Panchromatic (Pan), Cirrus, and
    Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) bands. This study aims to provide a systematic
    approach for LULC mapping utilizing spectral information collected by Landsat
    8. The Landsat 8 satellite possesses a high resolution of up to 30 m in various
    bands, enabling the acquisition of more precise details within the study area.
    The imaging frequency of Landsat 8 is once every 16 days, which makes it suitable
    for monitoring and tracking LULC changes (Holden and Woodcock, 2016; Sekertekin
    et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2005). In this study, Landsat 8 images were utilized
    within the GEE platform to generate a LULC map comprising 24 classes. Specifically,
    during the warm season (from May 1st, 2019, to September 30th, 2019), 371 images
    were employed, and during the cool season (from November 22nd, 2019, to February
    19th, 2020), 192 images were used for the analysis. Despite the numerous advantages
    of the GEE platform, it is essential to strategically select the most impactful
    bands to avoid processing limitations, such as time and data volume. Among the
    various bands, the most significant ones include the Blue band (Band 2), Green
    band (Band 3), Red band (Band 4), the NIR band (Band 5), SWIR 1 (Band 6), and
    SWIR 2 (Band 7) (Jia et al., 2014). Furthermore, the TIRS (Band 10), which provides
    valuable information for detecting water bodies, surface waters, and soil moisture,
    has been added to the dataset. It is worth mentioning that soil moisture will
    be important in distinguishing different agricultural and pasture classes. In
    more detail, despite the lower spatial resolution of this band, when combined
    and integrated with other bands, it offers valuable information that leads to
    improved accuracy and the ability to differentiate urban, water, and various agricultural
    categories. This integration enhances the capability to discriminate urban, water,
    and different agricultural categories (Khaleel, 2007). Statistical evaluations
    have demonstrated that integrating the TIRS band with NIR and other visible bands
    in a single Landsat 8 image will improve the overall accuracy by approximately
    5% to 6%. This improvement in accuracy highlights the significance of combining
    the thermal band with other bands (Sun and Schulz, 2015). 5. Methodology The generation
    of the LULC map and its application in accurately estimating weather parameters
    provide social benefits in multiple areas, such as agriculture, urban planning,
    and crisis management. Incorporating updated LULC into weather forecast models,
    such as WRF, contributes to a more precise forecasting of weather parameters.
    This improvement brings numerous benefits for the government and the general public.
    One of the most essential weather parameters is T2. Accurate estimation of T2
    plays a vital role in government planning related to public health (Ovalle et
    al., 2021). For instance, extreme heat events cause multi-stress vulnerability,
    and managing this problem requires appropriate government policies. Delivering
    precise T2 information can help governments, health organizations, and individuals,
    particularly vulnerable populations, to adopt suitable precautions to mitigate
    the adverse effects of heat stress (Cifuentes et al., 2020). Urban planners can
    also detect heat-prone zones using accurate urban thermal maps. These maps enable
    the implementation of optimal strategies for green space development to minimize
    the effects of extreme heat events (Bolitho and Miller, 2017). Providing appropriate
    information to farmers in agriculture, such as temperature, wind, precipitation,
    and soil moisture, is very important for future planning. For example, accurate
    soil moisture estimation is significant for planning irrigation (Anjos et al.,
    2021). Furthermore, providing precise temperature information gives valuable insights
    relevant to the selection of crops and optimal planting and harvesting times.
    Temperature data are highly beneficial for assessing the risk of frost, particularly
    during the growing season. Farmers can proactively implement preventive measures
    using this information, such as covering crops to mitigate potential damage. Besides
    temperature, determining the wind speed has excellent benefits. Wind speed data
    enables the issuance of warnings in emergencies and facilitates the implementation
    of appropriate preventive measures. Integration of wind speed data into emergency
    response systems enhances preparedness against natural disasters. This system
    can provide relevant information to people when natural disasters occur. People
    can make appropriate decisions based on the provided information (Akinremi et
    al., 1996). Another significant application of wind speed estimation is the optimization
    of energy production. Governments can use wind flow patterns for the feasibility
    of wind energy projects to determine the optimal location of wind turbines and
    increase their efficiency (Carvalho et al., 2012; Di et al., 2019; Mardiyono et
    al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2017). In summary, accurate estimation of meteorological
    parameters is essential for many applications. LULC is a practical input for estimating
    those parameters by weather forecast models such as WRF. In this regard, this
    paper has developed a framework for generating an accurate LULC map for weather
    forecasting. This section elaborates the proposed framework developed in this
    study for generating a USGS 24-category LULC map within the GEE platform to simulate
    the weather conditions using the WRF model. Fig. 3 illustrates different components
    of this framework. Generally, this framework includes four steps. In the first
    step, labels corresponding to each of the USGS 24-category LULC classes were collected
    by experts. Subsequently, all gathered labels based on a defined process were
    reviewed by two experienced specialists. In the second step, Landsat 8 images
    were filtered, and necessary preprocessing was applied to prepare a time series
    stack of images for the study area. In the third step, based on this stack of
    images and the collected labels, a data sampling process was conducted to distinguish
    train, validation, and test datasets for two classification strategies: pixel-based
    and object-based. In the next step, various ML methods were implemented and evaluated
    for image classification. Subsequently, a fusion of optimal features derived from
    the validation results of different classification strategies was performed. This
    led to creating a classification model with the highest accuracy and precision.
    In the end, the output LULC map from the developed framework was replaced in the
    WRF model, and various meteorological parameters were estimated using this model.
    These estimates were then compared with ground measurements to validate estimation
    accuracy. These four steps will be explained in more detail in the following sections.

    Fig. 3. The framework designed for the generation, evaluation, and validation
    of LULC map based on the USGS 24-category scheme using ML algorithms within the
    GEE cloud platform. The generated map is used in the WRF model to estimate various
    meteorological parameters. 5.1. Label collection The label collection process
    was extensive and laborious, requiring a substantial investment of time and numerous
    apprentices'' involvement under principal investigator''s supervision. Moreover,
    the collected labels underwent a thorough review by two principal investigators.
    Further details regarding this process are provided in the subsequent sections.
    The creation and collection of labels corresponding to each of the USGS 24-category
    LULC classes have been completed in four phases as depicted in Fig. 4. Download

    The processes of collecting labels for each class by using high-resolution satellite
    images that are available on Google Earth Pro. The first phase involves the learning
    and introduction of USGS LULC classes. In this phase, all 15 apprentices were
    familiarized with all the classes in the scheme, and a clear standard for the
    labeling process was established. Each person''s interpretation and understanding
    of the classes can vary, and apprentices are faced with labeling 24 different
    classes, some of which, such as classes 2 and 3 as listed in Table 1, have significant
    similarities, making their differentiation challenging. This standardization process
    was necessary to ensure consistency and accuracy in the labeling process due to
    the potential for confusion in interpreting the classes. Furthermore, it is essential
    to note that in this phase, the collected labels serve as the basis for completing
    the classification process in subsequent stages. Any errors in the labeling process
    could propagate and introduce inaccuracies in later stages. For this reason, setting
    specific agreements among the apprentices to ensure a correct understanding of
    the classes minimizes the risk of errors in the following steps. The second phase
    is the operational collection of labels for each class. During this phase, educated
    apprentices, following the predefined agreements, identified various classes from
    high-resolution images available on the Google Earth Pro software and drew convex
    polygons for each defined label. In some regions where determining the class type
    is challenging using satellite images, Google Map Photos within Google Earth Pro
    were utilized to aid the labeling process. Some classes require an examination
    of images from both warm and cool seasons. For example, classes 11, 12, 13, and
    14 (Table 1) are related to evergreen and deciduous forests. To identify these
    classes, the apprentices must examine the area of interest in different seasons.
    The collected labels were aggregated into a standard Shapefile in the third phase.
    This file might have contained various topological and descriptive errors that
    must be addressed. For example, a user might have added extra characters in polygon
    naming, or some polygons might have overlapped, leading to various topological
    errors such as gaps or slivers. All these mistakes and topological errors were
    addressed and fixed in this phase. In addition to naming and various topological
    errors addressed in the previous phase, a region was possibly incorrectly labeled.
    In other words, an apprentice might have accidentally assigned the wrong label
    to an area. To minimize errors in identifying the class of various regions, two
    experienced specialists reviewed all collected polygons again and provided their
    opinions about each polygon. This double-checking process helped to ensure the
    accuracy of the class assignments for the polygons. If the assigned class received
    confirmation from both experts, that polygon remained in the label set. Otherwise,
    if there was any disagreement or inconsistency, the polygon was considered to
    have discrepancies and was removed from the label set. This process ensures that
    only accurately labeled polygons are retained in the dataset. With the completion
    of all four phases depicted in Fig. 4, the process of collecting labels for each
    class was concluded. Table 2 presents the final number of polygons collected and
    their total area for each class. Table 2. Detailed information of collected labels
    in the USGS 24 classification system for the state of California. Class Number

    Total 1221 52,516.28 As illustrated in Table 2, 17 out of USGS 24 LULC classes
    exist in California. In other words, some of the 24 classes are not found in the
    geographical region of California. For instance, classes like Mixed Tundra, Wooded
    Tundra, and Bare Ground Tundra, which are specific to polar regions, were naturally
    not found in this region. The class Urban and Built-up Land has the highest number
    of collected labels, while Wooded Wetland has the lowest number of labels in the
    dataset. Furthermore, considering Water Bodies'' various conditions and status,
    their reflections in aerial and satellite images can vary significantly. Efforts
    were made to collect sufficient labels from different situations of water bodies
    in California. This collection was performed to minimize errors in distinguishing
    this class from other classes, such as Wooden Wetland or Herbaceous Wetland, with
    a high level of similarity. For this reason, the Water Bodies class has allocated
    the most extensive area to itself. Additionally, the Snow or Ice class exhibits
    behavioral similarities with the Water Bodies class, and it is possible to misclassify
    it with the Snow or Ice class in coastal areas due to the effects of sea waves.
    Thus, collecting a sufficient number of labels in these regions is essential.
    5.2. Landsat data collection and preprocessing Landsat 8 images have been processed
    and prepared on the powerful GEE platform. These images were acquired in surface
    reflectance mode. Preprocessing these images is paramount for improving image
    quality, reducing noise, extracting meaningful features, and removing unnecessary
    information. Cloud cover is an obstacle, preventing electromagnetic waves from
    carrying information from objects on the surfaces. When there is a high cloud
    cover ratio, reflected electromagnetic waves cannot penetrate the cloud layer.
    In addition, when the sensor''s viewing angle is not nadir, the shadows created
    by clouds can exacerbate the situation. It is worth noting that cloud cover can
    be beneficial in some weather prediction studies. However, in LULC classification,
    where a direct reflection of the Earth''s surface and its features is required,
    cloud cover obscures observational data and diminishes its quality (Li et al.,
    2019b; Lothon et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2014). For this reason, surface reflectance
    images were filtered by GEE, ensuring that their cloud cover percentage was less
    than 10%. Nevertheless, certain parts of the image may still contain clouds. By
    employing median compositing, the impact of clouds was reduced, resulting in the
    retrieval of more comprehensive surface information. In general, the median filter
    reduces the effects of noise while preserving image details. However, because
    it relies on many images, some smoothing is inevitable, and the image may not
    remain as sharp in fine details. 5.2.1. Spectral indices Spectral indices play
    a crucial role in LULC classification. These indices provide valuable information
    from satellite images that help identify various classes and improve classification
    accuracy while computationally being efficient (Samsudin et al., 2016). Furthermore,
    various studies have demonstrated that using spectral indices along with surface
    reflectance gathered at different spectral bands could improve the classification
    accuracy (Faridatul and Wu, 2018; Forkuor et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2022; Zhang
    et al., 2017). Consequently, in this study, in addition to the spectral bands
    B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, and B10, effective spectral indices such as Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI),
    Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI), and Bare Soil Index (BSI) were calculated
    and added to the dataset. NDVI is calculated according to the following formula:
    (1) where NIR and Red, denote Near Infrared and Red spectral bands, respectively.
    The chlorophyll content present in vegetation effectively absorbs the Blue and
    Red spectrums while reflecting the Green spectrum. Additionally, plants exhibit
    a high reflectance in the NIR spectrum. Since vegetations have high absorption
    in the Red spectrum and high reflectance in NIR, NDVI is a good index for monitoring
    them. Various NDVI values indicate distinct LULC classes (De Bie et al., 2011).
    Moreover, NDVI enables the differentiation of various soil classes (Demattê et
    al., 2017). NDVI values are associated with biophysical properties of different
    land cover classes, which can discriminate LULC classes (Xi et al., 2021; Zhao
    et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2021). Bare lands are often misclassified as built-up
    areas and vice versa (Nguyen et al., 2021). This challenge is intensified in dry
    and semi-dry regions (Rasul et al., 2018). The BSI index aids in identifying areas
    with bare soil or minimal vegetation cover. Furthermore, this index provides valuable
    information for detecting LULC classes related to agricultural fields and urban
    areas. For instance, in a study conducted by Rouibah and Belabbas, the incorporation
    of BSI alongside other spectral indices like NDVI in a k-means classification
    improved the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient by 5.67% and 12.5%, respectively
    (Rouibah and Belabbas, 2020). The BSI index is calculated as below: (2) where
    SWIR and Blue, denote Short Wave Infrared and Blue spectral bands, respectively.
    Another helpful index is NDWI, which is calculated as below: (3) where Green,
    denotes the Green spectral band. The NDWI utilizes the NIR spectrum due to the
    high reflectance by vegetation and low reflectance by water. Additionally, this
    index incorporates the Green band. Chlorophyll in plants, as well as water bodies,
    have high reflectances in the Green band. Thus, NDWI highlights water bodies while
    minimizing the impact of vegetation cover. This index is an effective and powerful
    tool for detecting water bodies (Ahmed and Akter, 2017; Oyama et al., 2015). Several
    investigations have shown that using this index for water body classification
    is more effective than complex methods (Benabdelouahab et al., 2015; Bhandari
    et al., 2015; Kshetri, 2018). It is worth noting that the NDWI index is also sensitive
    to changes in the water content of plant canopies, and NDWI complements NDVI (Gao,
    1996). In a study conducted by Kaplan and Avdan, the use of NDWI for water body
    delineation in Sentinel-2 imagery increased the kappa index by 0.5 (Kaplan and
    Avdan, 2017). Another index employed in this study is the NDBI, calculated based
    on the NIR and SWIR bands. Built-up land uses such as roads, buildings, etc.,
    because of their materials, which include concrete and asphalt, tend to exhibit
    more reflectance in the SWIR rather than NIR (Kshetri, 2018). NDBI is generally
    sensitive to built-up areas and valuable for studying LULC changes (Li and Chen,
    2018; Zha et al., 2003). The NDBI index is derived from the following equation:
    (4) Fig. 5 illustrates a collection of image patches extracted for distinguishing
    various USGS 24 LULC classes. As depicted in Fig. 5, high-resolution images existing
    in Google Earth Pro software were used for labeling these patches. The second
    row displays the corresponding 30 m resolution true-color image captured by the
    Landsat 8 sensor. The third and fourth rows are the corresponding NDVI and BSI
    indices. As shown in Fig. 5, utilizing only spectral bands may not be sufficient
    for classifying regions into 24 categories. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate
    spectral indices to highlight certain features and provide more informative data
    for the classification algorithm. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    B) The corresponding Landsat 8 image patches. C, D) The corresponding raster representations
    of NDVI and BSI indices. One of the significant tools for detecting and distinguishing
    classes such as Dryland Cropland and Pasture (2), Irrigated Cropland and Pasture
    (3), and Mixed Dryland/Irrigated Cropland and Pasture (4) is the distinction between
    Dryland and Cropland characteristics. In these categories, spectral indices will
    provide valuable information. In Fig. 5, the NDVI index for class 2, Dryland,
    has lower values than class 3 (Irrigated). Examining the BSI values for these
    two classes will also indicate differentiation between classes 2 and 3. In contrast,
    class 4, as a mixed class, has values that fall between the two mentioned classes.
    Shrubland (8) typically has moderate to relatively high vegetation cover values
    because it primarily comprises shrubs and low-height trees. NDVI values for Shrubland
    are positive but lower than those for dense forests, such as the Evergreen Broadleaf
    class (13). On the one hand, Grassland (7) regions have denser vegetation cover
    than Shrubland (8), and there are different types of grass in it. The Mixed Shrubland/Grassland
    class (9) also exhibits moderate NDVI values falling between the two classes (7
    & 8). On the other hand, based on the BSI index, Shrubland (8) areas are mostly
    a mixture of soil and vegetation cover, while Grassland (7) areas have minimal
    soil content and lower BSI values. Thus, BSI and NDVI can be employed to separate
    these two classes. Water Bodies (16) exhibit low NDVI and high NDWI values alongside
    positive BSI values. Thus, the primary index for detecting water bodies is NDWI.
    Herbaceous Wetland (17) has denser vegetation cover (higher NDVI) compared to
    Wooden Wetland (18) and is exposed to less soil content (lower BSI). Furthermore,
    if considering the Barren or Sparsely Vegetated (19) in Fig. 5, it will be observed
    that the NDVI values in these areas are at their minimum. At the same time, the
    BSI index reaches its maximum value. 5.3. Classification As depicted in Fig. 5,
    distinguishing between 24 different classes is a complex task, as there are significant
    similarities in the properties of classes. ML models have substantial capabilities
    for detecting intricate relationships. These models can reveal patterns, dependencies,
    and relationships that might be impractical for a human to discern (Du et al.,
    2020; Reichstein et al., 2019). In this study, two different strategies, pixel-based
    and object-based, have been employed for LULC classification using ML algorithms.
    5.3.1. Classification algorithms in GEE In this study, 33,209 samples were collected
    using a stratified sampling approach. Of these, 70% were allocated for training,
    and the remaining 30% were employed for testing. Hyperparameter tuning for ML
    models was performed using validation data (10% of training data). This research
    utilized CART, RF, GTB, and SVM models as classifiers within GEE. CART: CART is
    a decision tree-based algorithm that recursively divides the feature space to
    make predictions (Breiman, 2017). In simpler terms, CART uses various data features
    to divide the data into different groups. The data partitioning based on features
    continues iteratively until a tree is entirely constructed. This means that each
    node is divided into several child nodes until a specific condition, such as tree
    depth or the inability to split further, is met. This algorithm is simple, fast,
    and highly interpretable (Gislason et al., 2006). It is important to note that
    CART models can be susceptible to overfitting without proper tuning of input parameters.
    In this research, by evaluating the model''s performance using validation data,
    it was determined that setting the Max Nodes parameter to its default value (no
    limit on the number of nodes) yielded better results. RF: As one of the popular
    ML models, the RF model is widely used for remote sensing image classification
    (Amani et al., 2019; Jin et al., 2018; Maxwell et al., 2019; Millard and Richardson,
    2015; Phan et al., 2020). This method combines a set of decision trees and creates
    the final model (a forest). This model can provide importance scores for each
    used feature, essentially indicating the contribution of that feature to the final
    prediction (Belgiu and Drăguţ, 2016). Since the results of multiple trees are
    aggregated, RF is robust against noise and significant data variations (Shukla
    et al., 2018). Furthermore, RF is known for its ability to handle complex relationships
    and interactions, and parameter tuning for this model is often considered more
    accessible than other models (Pal, 2005). For the RF model, the number of trees
    was examined using validation data, ranging from 64 to 300, considering the processing
    limitations of GEE. The best results were achieved with 264 trees. GTB: The next
    algorithm used in this study is GTB, which sequentially improves its classification
    performance. This model is an ensemble method that builds trees sequentially,
    with each tree attempting to correct the weakness of the previous tree (Georganos
    et al., 2018). The execution of this model demands high computational power. This
    limitation allowed for a maximum of 20 trees in the model for this research. Like
    RF, GTB can handle datasets with various features, and combining differently weighted
    trees prevents overfitting (Ouma et al., 2022). SVM: The SVM model was also used
    for LULC classification in addition to the decision tree-based algorithms. This
    algorithm aims to find an optimal hyperplane in the feature space of the input
    dataset to separate different classes. The hyperplane is chosen in such a way
    that it maximizes the distance between itself and the closest data points of each
    class. Using the kernel trick in this algorithm allows for exploring complex relationships
    in the data. The choice of kernel and its parameters significantly impacts the
    model''s performance. In this research, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel
    provided more accurate results than other kernel functions such as polynomial
    and sigmoid. It is important to note that SVM is computationally memory-intensive,
    particularly as the input data volume increases. Additionally, the interpretability
    of the model is challenging due to the use of various mathematical relationships
    in the high-dimensional feature space, as well as using non-linear kernels (Talukdar
    et al., 2020). Due to processing limitations in GEE, it is impossible to utilize
    many samples and automate hyperparameter tuning. To fill this gap and avoid overfitting,
    the validation data were employed for tuning the key hyperparameters for each
    model. Table 3 presents the hyperparameters set for each model during training
    and validation. Table 3. Hyperparameters were set for each machine learning technique
    within the GEE platform. Model Hyperparameters CART • Max nodes: No limit • Min
    leaf population: 1 RF • Number of trees: 264 • Bag fraction: 0.5 • Variables per
    split: Root of the number of variables GTB • Number of trees: 20 • Shrinkage:
    0.005 • Sampling rate: 0.7 • Loss: Least absolute deviation SVM • Kernel type:
    RBF • SVM type: C_SVC • Decision procedure: Voting 5.3.2. Pixel-based approach
    The pixel-based classification approach relies on the spectral information of
    the collected dataset. This approach assigns each pixel to a class based on the
    analysis of spectral similarities. In this approach, the class of each pixel is
    determined individually by comparing the feature vector of that pixel with the
    feature vector of the samples (Sibaruddin et al., 2018; Zerrouki and Bouchaffra,
    2014). Indeed, the pixel-based classification approach has its advantages and
    limitations. It is suitable for homogeneous regions. However, dealing with mixed
    pixels, where multiple land cover types are present within a single pixel, can
    be a struggle. In such cases, it may result in misclassification. Additionally,
    noise in the data, such as various atmospheric phenomena, can significantly affect
    classification accuracy. In this approach, spatial relationships such as proximity,
    shape, and texture are not considered in the classification process. The features
    used in this approach, as illustrated in Fig. 3, included surface reflectance
    bands like Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIRS, and spectral indices such
    as NDVI, BSI, NDWI, and NDBI. 5.3.3. Object-based approach In object-based methods,
    a segmentation algorithm transforms pixels into homogeneous image objects. Then,
    these objects are classified. Before assigning LULC classes, pixels are grouped
    into meaningful objects or regions. In object-based methods, the classification
    unit changes from pixels to existing objects in the image. Consequently, a dataset
    containing various features and different textures based on their spatial relationships
    will be available for classification. This approach reduces the influence of mixed
    pixels, and the heterogeneity in different land areas is better modeled. However,
    it is essential to consider the limitations of this method. In the context of
    segmentation, two errors, under-segmentation and over-segmentation, can affect
    the classification process. Under-segmentation leads to the creation of objects
    in the image that cover more than one class. On the other hand, over-segmentation
    fails to properly represent the characteristics of real-world objects on the Earth''s
    surface, such as shape, curvature, and area (Liu and Xia, 2010). In this research,
    the SNIC algorithm was utilized within the GEE platform. SNIC is an enhanced version
    of the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm, known for its non-repetitive
    behavior. Implementation and usage of SNIC are straightforward and user-friendly.
    Additionally, it is computationally efficient and consumes minimal memory resources
    (Achanta and Süsstrunk, 2017). The output of this algorithm includes clusters
    of pixels and the means of each cluster for the input bands. For example, if an
    image has 3 RGB bands as input, the algorithm first segments the image into separate
    clusters based on similarities and spatial proximity. Each cluster represents
    a group of neighboring pixels. Then, the algorithm calculates the mean values
    within each cluster for the Red, Green, and Blue bands. This means that each region
    for each band represents the dominant values of that portion and provides useful
    information for classification (Rittl et al., 2013). The features used in this
    approach, as presented in Fig. 3, included the Blue, Green, and Red bands, along
    with the outputs of the SNIC algorithm, namely Blue_Mean, Green_Mean, and Red_Mean.
    5.3.4. Seasonal analysis LULC maps generally provide static information for each
    region over a year. Human activities, environmental factors, land management activities,
    weather conditions, seasonal variations, vegetation dynamics, and hydrological
    cycles significantly impact the LULC map (Msigwa et al., 2019). Different land
    use classes exhibit varying behaviors throughout the years. For example, Evergreen
    and Deciduous classes display entirely different spectral behaviors during warm
    and cool seasons due to their physical characteristics. Analyzing spectral indices
    during warm and cool seasons can discover these distinct spectral behaviors. Therefore,
    the classification process, illustrated in Fig. 3, was executed in two periods:
    the warm season (May 2019 to September 2019) and the cool season (November 2019
    to February 2020). 5.3.5. Fusion of pixel-level and object-level features The
    classification was implemented in warm and cool seasons with different ML algorithms.
    The output results determined the best classification model. In this study, feature
    importance analysis was first performed on the input features. After that, the
    best features in both pixel-based and object-based approaches were selected during
    different seasons, and a new feature set was created. In other words, a new dataset
    was created through feature fusion, comprising the best features selected from
    both pixel-based and object-based approaches during different seasons. Fusion
    is an effective strategy for enhancing classification performance, especially
    in challenging areas (Mirzaei et al., 2023; Schwolow et al., 2019). This research
    was performed by fusion of pixel-level and object-level features. This means that
    the best features of the object-based approach have been integrated alongside
    the best pixel-based features. The experiments have demonstrated that combining
    classification approaches not only leverages the advantages of each method but
    also overcomes their shortcomings, resulting in a higher classification accuracy
    (Li and Wan, 2015). In this way, spectral signatures associated with each class
    in different seasons with high spectral diversity can be achieved, enhancing the
    informational content for the classifier. Some classes, such as Snow and Ice or
    classes that include the Evergreen attribute, exhibit better discrimination in
    different seasons. Additionally, the performance of certain features may be season-dependent,
    performing poorly in some seasons while excelling in others. As a result, overfitting
    the model to data from a single season is prevented. Moreover, after fusing new
    features, the ML algorithm can better understand the seasonal land-use variations.
    As a result, its ability to classify various land cover types can be enhanced
    by providing a more comprehensive dataset. 5.3.6. Classification accuracy assessments
    The performance of different ML algorithms was examined during warm and cool seasons,
    and the best among them was selected. The confusion matrix was first generated
    for classification accuracy assessment, and the accuracy of ML algorithms was
    compared using different metrics: the Kappa Coefficient (KC), Overall Accuracy
    (OA), Precision, Recall, and F1 score. The KC is an efficient statistical metric
    for assessing classification accuracy, representing the distinction between different
    classes (Huang et al., 2017). It considers both correct and incorrect predictions.
    OA indicates the agreement of a significant portion of the data with the true
    predictions. However, it does not consider random chance estimates in its calculation.
    On the other hand, a high KC value indicates that the classification result is
    not a product of random prediction. The Precision metric calculates the ratio
    of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions. This
    metric indicates the proportion of positive predictions correctly classified as
    positive. Recall shows the proportion of truly positive cases that the model correctly
    identified among all the actual positive cases. The F1 score is a geometric mean
    of both precision and recall criteria. This metric offers a more robust evaluation,
    mainly when there is an imbalance in the data distribution among classes. Each
    metric mentioned above provides unique insights into the model''s performance.
    Consequently, conducting a comprehensive review of these metrics contributes to
    a more precise evaluation of the overall performance of the model. 5.4. LULC in
    climate modeling: WRF-based simulation In addition to the accuracy assessment
    of the generated LULC map, its performance in estimating meteorological parameters
    is validated. Physical models, such as WRF, can evaluate the effects of input
    changes on the estimation of meteorological parameters (Van Beek and Van Asch,
    2004). The WRF model is a numerical weather prediction system that simulates atmospheric
    processes with various physical parameterizations from regional to global scales.
    Various studies have validated the model''s performance for different environmental
    simulations such as weather, atmospheric chemistry, wildfire, and hydrology (Coen
    et al., 2013; Hassanli and Rahimzadegan, 2019; Kumar et al., 2016; Li et al.,
    2020b; Singh and Bhaskaran, 2018; Žabkar et al., 2015). The WRF modeling system
    consists of 4 parts: External Data Source (EDS), WRF-Preprocessing System (WPS),
    WRF Model, and Post-Processing and visualization. Geographic static data and gridded
    meteorological data as model inputs are used in the EDS part. Then, the data are
    entered into the pre-processing part of the model, namely WPS. In this part, several
    domains are defined, and geographical static data and meteorological data are
    interpolated onto these domains. In the core of the model, by running the “Real”
    program, boundary conditions and initial conditions are generated to solve the
    physical parameterization schemes. The Advanced Research WRF (ARW) program utilizes
    numerical methods to solve atmospheric and physical equations. These methods are
    applied for the numerical approximation of various meteorological variables over
    time and space to simulate the region''s weather conditions effectively. In other
    words, numerical methods update the values of meteorological variables at different
    times and locations, producing outputs that represent the weather conditions at
    those times and in those regions. Despite the high popularity of ARW, implementing
    and compiling this model from scratch requires multidisciplinary skills and is
    highly time-consuming. This research uses an open-source plugin for the WRF-ARW
    model called GIS4WRF within the QGIS software (Meyer and Riechert, 2019). This
    plugin utilizes WRFV4 and WPSV4. LULC is one of this model''s most crucial static
    geographical input parameters. As mentioned earlier, LULC plays a significant
    role in the configuration of water and energy fluxes (Tao et al., 2013). Based
    on the used physical scheme, the land cover type significantly influences various
    parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, precipitation, etc. Therefore,
    a framework was designed to assess and validate the performance of the WRF physical
    model in estimating various meteorological parameters by inputting the LULC map
    generated by GEE into the WRF model (See Fig. 3). The setup, configuration, and
    replacement of the generated LULC in WRF is challenging. Further details regarding
    this process will be explained in the subsequent sections. 5.4.1. Configuration
    The replacement of the predicted LULC map in the WRF model was realized in 4 steps
    according to Fig. 7. In the first step, the model configuration was performed.
    In this stage, the coordinate system, nests, and simulation period were defined
    within the WPS part. Since the study area for this research is California, with
    a moderate geographical latitude, the Lambert Conformal Conic projection system
    was set up as a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) following the WRF model manual
    (Wang et al., 2020). As depicted in Fig. 6, two domains with resolutions of 9
    km and 3 km, denoted as D01 and D02, respectively, were configured. For both domains,
    the USGS LULC maps as well as Global Data Assimilation System / Final Analysis
    (GDAS/FNL) meteorological data delivered by National Centers for Environmental
    Prediction (NCEP) with a resolution of 0.25° were employed. The simulation period
    covered three days from 00:00 on 2019.09.04 to 00:00 on 2019.09.07. The model
    was run twice within the specified time frame. In the first run, default WRF LULC
    data was used, while in the second run, the LULC map generated by the GEE system
    was substituted into the model. Additionally, selecting appropriate physical schemes
    in the WRF model is of utmost importance, as it directly impacts the simulation
    of atmospheric processes and interactions. These schemes represent various physical
    processes in the atmosphere, such as radiation, microphysics, turbulence, and
    surface interactions. With the presentation of WRF V 3.9, an option to use the
    set of approved physics was introduced. In this research, the approved physics
    set “CONUS” was used, which has been tested extensively and has shown excellent
    and reasonable results (Wang et al., 2020). It should be noted that the initial
    physical conditions were kept constant every time the model was run, and the changes
    were only in the main variables related to LULC. Download : Download high-res

    After the initial configuration, there is a need to replace the default LULC map
    in WRF with the LULC map generated in GEE. The model will use this new LULC map
    for its estimations. Replacing the LULC map in WRF was realized through a workflow
    in Fig. 8. It should be noted that the WRF-ARW model core performs its calculations
    based on the variables present in the output files generated by the WPS. In these
    files, the output contains two main variables related to land use, namely LU_INDEX
    and LANDUSEF. LU_INDEX represents the LULC map in the format of the USGS 24-category
    scheme, while LANDUSEF depicts the frequency of land use categories within each
    grid cell. Both variables were updated based on the newly generated USGS LULC
    map in the second run. After the necessary modifications, the model was executed.
    Model execution was performed in parallel, and each parallel run of the model
    took approximately six days using CPUs with the specifications of Intel(R) Core
    (TM) i7–8700 CPU @ 3.20GHz with 12 logical processors. Subsequently, parameters
    such as T2 and 10-m wind speed were extracted from the model output, and statistical
    evaluations and validations were performed on them. 5.4.2. Replacing default LULC
    with created LULC The update of the LU_INDEX and LANDUSEF variables in both domains
    were substituted into WRF according to the workflow presented in Fig. 8. Landsat
    8 images were used to generate the LULC map in GEE with a 30 m resolution. However,
    the defined domains had resolutions of 9 and 3 km. A sophisticated algorithm was
    developed to address the resolution mismatch issue. First, the number of WRF model
    domains (N_Nesting) was determined in this algorithm; then, the algorithm updated
    all domains accordingly. Next, the generated high-resolution LULC data was invoked,
    and its resolution was saved in the variable RH. For each WRF model domain, its
    geographical coordinate grid, including layers XLONG_M and XLAT_M, along with
    the domain''s resolution (RL), the number of cells in the X and Y directions (Dim_RY
    and Dim_RX), and two layers related to land use, namely LU_INDEX and LANDUSEF,
    were extracted from the Geogrid program output. The kernel dimensions were calculated
    by dividing RL by RH. It is worth noting that the kernel dimensions must be odd
    numbers. Padding was applied to the high-resolution LULC map according to the
    kernel dimensions to ensure the kernel could fully cover border pixels. There
    might have been incompatibilities in the number of pixels between the WRF model
    domains and the generated LULC maps. Since both layers were georeferenced, the
    connection between the WRF model domains and the produced LULC maps was established
    through geographical coordinates. In other words, to update each cell within a
    domain, coordinates, including Phi_Target and Landa_Target, were extracted, and
    the center of the kernel was embedded in these coordinates on the generated LULC
    map. In this kernel, the frequency of each class was stored. Then, the class with
    the highest frequency was assigned to the target cell in the LU_INDEX layer. The
    LANDUSEF layer consists of sub-layers equal to the number of LULC classes. This
    study used a USGS 24-class LULC scheme, so this layer contained 24 sub-layers.
    The ratio of frequencies of each class was divided by the square kernel dimension.
    5.4.3. Performance evaluation For evaluating the performance of the generated
    LULC map in simulating meteorological parameters, statistical metrics such as
    Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Bias were defined
    below: (5) where and are the predicted and measured values of the target meteorological
    parameters at the location of station , respectively, and denotes the number of
    the ground stations. 6. Results 6.1. Result of pixel-based and object-based classifications
    Depending on the strategy used for LULC classification, including pixel-based
    and object-based approaches, various ML models were implemented and evaluated
    during warm and cool seasons. The results of the pixel-based and object-based
    approaches are presented in Table 4, Table 5, respectively. The RF model generally
    performed better than other models in both warm and cool seasons. However, in
    the object-based approach during the cool seasons, the GTB model provided better
    results. Table 4. The results of evaluating different classifiers in warm and
    cool seasons (Pixel-based approach). Season Classifier Overall Accuracy (OA) Kappa

    91.82 GTB 92.75 91.74 SVM 82.30 79.91 CART 91.26 90.06 In the pixel-based approach,
    the RF model provided a satisfactory OA and a desirable KC in both warm and cool
    seasons. The value of KC indicates that the classification performance is very
    strong and goes beyond random selection. The model successfully explored the non-linear
    relationships in the collected spectral dataset. The GTB model was in the next
    rank. The large volume of data, combined with the processing limitations of GEE,
    has affected the performance of this model. Nevertheless, this model achieved
    satisfactory accuracy using only 20 sequential trees in both warm and cool seasons.
    When dealing with a large volume of data with more complexity, the performance
    of the SVM model tends to decrease. The CART model also achieved accuracy similar
    to SVM. Generally, the OA for all models was slightly lower in the warm season
    than in the cool season. This decrease could be attributed to challenges associated
    with seasonal variations, such as vegetation stress. In different seasons, plants
    experience various environmental conditions, including changes in temperature,
    humidity, and light levels. These changes can lead to alterations in the status
    and growth of vegetation and plants, which may affect LULC classification accuracy.
    The ranking of models based on their performance remained consistent in both seasons.
    According to Table 5, in the object-based approach, the accuracy of all classifiers
    has noticeably improved compared to the pixel-based approach. In this approach,
    the GTB model achieved higher accuracy in the warm season, while the RF model
    provided better results in the cool season. The results indicate that the object-based
    approach is more suitable for LULC classification, especially when considering
    seasonal variations. Generally, the results from both Table 4, Table 5 indicate
    that the models perform well in different seasons. RF and GTB appeared to be the
    best models in terms of OA and KC. SVM and CART had lower performance but still
    provided meaningful results. It is noteworthy that ensemble methods, such as RF
    and GTB, outperformed individual methods, highlighting the effectiveness of ensemble
    methods in handling complex relationships for LULC classification. In the object-based
    approach, the classifiers performed relatively better in the warm season, while
    in the pixel-based approach, they performed better in the cool season. Furthermore,
    even within the object-based approach, the accuracy of class detection varied
    across different seasons. The differences in results can be attributed to the
    unique characteristics of these two approaches. This achievement clearly shows
    that the behavior of LULC has been quite dynamic. Consequently, it is necessary
    to adopt a fusion strategy to achieve more stable and accurate results. 6.2. Result
    of pixel-level and object-level fusion Feature fusion was performed at two pixel
    and object levels to achieve more stable results, preventing accuracy fluctuations
    across different classes. As illustrated in Fig. 9, the influential features of
    each approach derived from feature importance analysis were combined across different
    seasons, resulting in a new feature set consisting of the 14 most important features
    in different seasons. Similar to the previous approach, a sampling process was
    applied to this dataset, and the RF model was chosen due to its capabilities and
    superior results in previous approaches. The outcome of this process led to an
    enhancement in both accuracy metrics, OA and KC, compared to the best results
    from previous approaches (Table 6). In the feature fusion approach, the RF model
    achieved an OA of 94.92% and a KC of 94.19%. Compared to the best results of previous
    experiments (object-based warm), performing feature fusion improved OA and KC
    by 0.88% and 0.92%, respectively. The accuracy improvement by feature fusion strategy
    for LULC classification compared to the best results of previous approaches is
    shown in Table 6. Fig. 10 also depicts the performance of the top classifier (RF)
    across various criteria, including OA, KC, F1 score, Recall, and Precision. These
    criteria were used for performance analysis of different classification approaches
    employed in this research. The bar chart demonstrates that the Fused, Seasonal
    strategy consistently achieves the highest values (above 94%) for all criteria.
    Notably, when considering all the criteria, using object-based features has significantly
    enhanced the classification results compared to pixel-based features. Table 6.

    map generated using the custom-developed algorithm (described in Section 5.4.2)
    was employed to update the WRF model''s default maps. The new updated LULC map,
    compared to the default LULC map of WRF, is depicted in Fig. 11. As mentioned
    in Section 3, the study area for this research was the state of California, and
    the LULC map was generated for this region. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 11, only
    the data related to this study area was updated. It should be noted that the validation
    of the estimated meteorological parameters by the WRF model respective to ground
    measurements is also conducted within this domain. The changes or expansions of
    the previous land use classes have been reflected in the updated LULC map. In
    the new LULC map, the noticeable expansion of Urban and Built-up Land (1) is evident,
    indicating urban areas have developed in various regions. New Water Bodies (16)
    have also been added in some areas. In the default LULC map, no areas are marked
    as Snow and Ice (24). However, updates in some northeastern regions of California
    have added this class to reflect the presence of snow and ice in those areas.
    Changes in LULC classes are also noticeable. In northeastern California, the Shrubland
    (8) class in the default map has changed to Mixed Shrubland/Grassland (9). Some
    errors in the default LULC map are also observed, such as misclassifying dry areas
    in the eastern or southeastern regions as Urban and Built-up Land (1). It should
    be noted that the static geographic data used in the WRF model, including land
    use, topography, etc., are updated and delivered with different versions of the
    WRF model. However, some parameters may not be well-updated in certain regions.
    The primary objective of this research is to design and develop a framework for
    USGS 24 LULC map generation applied for WRF simulations. In this regard, the generated
    LULC map is also employed in WRF to validate the capability of the map for estimating
    meteorological parameters. This validation aims to ensure the reliable use of
    the implemented framework in various regions worldwide where default LULC maps
    are rarely updated. For this reason, efforts were made to evaluate the performance
    and impact of the generated LULC map using appropriate statistical tests by employing
    an adequate number of ground measurements in comparison to what the default WRF
    model provided. 6.4. Summary of results and key findings Generation of the USGS
    24-category LULC map and employing it to estimate meteorological parameters encounters
    various challenges. This classification requires sufficient and accurate labels
    for each class. However, collecting sufficient and accurate labels for each class
    is initially challenging due to limited access to the study area, time constraints,
    and the complexity of different classes. To address this, 15 apprentices were
    trained, and high-resolution images from Google Earth were utilized to collect
    appropriate labels. Two experts further reviewed the collected labels to ensure
    quality and accuracy. As shown in Table 4, Table 5, various machine learning techniques,
    including RF, GTB, SVM, and CART, employed in both pixel-based and object-based
    approaches, demonstrated varying accuracies across different seasons. Since LULC
    exhibits dynamic behavior across different seasons, selecting an appropriate classification
    method that yields the highest accuracy is another difficulty of LULC classification.
    Thus, the proposed classification approach should incorporate the dynamic behavior
    of LULC, necessitating the processing of a large volume of satellite images. Performing
    such tasks on personal systems with limited computational resources can also be
    challenging. To address this, the capabilities of the GEE cloud system were leveraged
    for processing a substantial number of satellite images, including 371 Landsat
    8 images for the warm season and 192 Landsat 8 images for the cool season. Then,
    LULC classification was performed by employing different machine learning techniques
    using features extracted by pixel-based and object-based strategies. However,
    extracted features did not have equal significance, and utilizing all features
    led to data redundancy and computational loads in GEE. Thus, feature importance
    analysis was conducted on various pixel-level and object-level features, and the
    most significant features from different seasons were selected. The model accuracy
    improved by performing fusion at feature and temporal levels, generating reliable
    and up-to-date LULC maps. The results indicated that the proposed fusion approach
    could generate a more accurate LULC map with an OA of 94.92% and a KC of 94.19%.
    Additionally, the performance of the generated LULC map should be validated for
    meteorological parameter estimation. Various numerical weather prediction models,
    such as WRF, do not consider the dynamic behavior of LULC and treat them as a
    static parameter in their equations. However, expansions of urban areas, reduction
    in vegetation cover, and LULC changes should be considered in these models. Additionally,
    the LULC used in these models has a low resolution. The lack of periodic updates
    and the absence of a resolution compatible with simulation objectives result in
    a failure to accurately reconstruct real interactions between the surface and
    the atmosphere. Consequently, meteorological parameters cannot be estimated with
    the desired accuracy. In the final step, the generated LULC was replaced in the
    WRF model. Replacement and updating processes were performed using the developed
    workflow shown in Fig. 8. The result of this update is displayed in Fig. 11. The
    quantitative evaluation demonstrated that the generated and up-to-date LULC map
    could improve the estimation accuracy of parameters, T2, and wind speed by WRF.
    The RMSE, MAE, and bias were improved 0.02 °C, 1 °C and 3 °C, respectively, for
    T2 after updating the LULC map in WRF. Also, the MAE of wind speed estimation
    was decreased by 0.06 m/s. Fig. 12 summarizes the most important findings of this
    research. Furthermore, the datasets and developed codes used in this study are
    freely available on GitHub for use by other researchers via https://github.com/Mganjirad/GEE-LULC-WRF.
    7. Discussion 7.1. Influence of seasonal analysis on accuracy of LULC classification
    As shown in Table 4, all ML algorithms performed better during the cool season
    in the pixel-based approach. Primarily, this reflects the seasonal dynamics of
    land use, regardless of the classification model and approach. For a more detailed
    examination of the effect of feature fusion in different seasons, confusion matrices
    for each of the classification approaches are displayed in Fig. 13, Fig. 14. Improvement
    in accuracy in the cool season can also indicate changes in vegetation. In this
    way, evergreen trees create a more precise distinction than other classes in the
    cool season. As an example, considering the accuracy of the Evergreen Broadleaf
    (13) in Fig. 13, the classification accuracy has indeed improved from 42% (warm
    season) to 50% (cool season) by changing the season. Furthermore, the accuracy
    of the Evergreen Needleleaf (14) has increased from 69% to 75%. The seasonal change
    has also impacted the Mixed Forest (15), which has met a 3% improvement in accuracy.
    This illustrates that the seasonal variations in vegetation cover, particularly
    in evergreen and mixed forests, can contribute to classification accuracy. The
    improvement in accuracy demonstrates that these two classes are significantly
    influenced by the change in seasons. This could be attributed to the physiological
    and spectral properties of these two vegetation cover types, which, under colder
    weather conditions, may result in more stable and distinguishable spectral signatures
    for these classes. Considering the overall increase in accuracy during the cool
    season, it is interesting to note that the accuracy has decreased for some classes
    where water plays a significant role in detecting them. For example, the accuracy
    of the Water Bodies (16) has decreased from 98% to 92%. This decrease could be
    attributed to seasonal variations in water bodies, such as freezing or changing
    water levels, which may impact these areas'' spectral characteristics and classification
    accuracy during the colder months. The classes of land cover that include features
    like open water bodies and wetlands often exhibit spectral signatures similar
    to various other land cover types during the cool season. Distinguishing these
    classes from others can become more challenging during the colder seasons when
    factors like freezing and snow cover can impact the spectral characteristics of
    these areas. This similarity in spectral signatures can decrease classification
    accuracy for water bodies and wetland classes during the colder months. Agricultural
    activities are more prevalent during the warm season. With the onset of the cool
    season, these activities decrease, leading to changes in land cover that can impact
    the accuracy of LULC classification. By the confusion matrix, the Cropland/Woodland
    Mosaic (6) has not been well-identified during the warm season, with an accuracy
    of 3%. However, without any changes to the model, input dataset, sample size,
    or any other effective alterations except for the change in season, the accuracy
    of this class has improved and reached a total accuracy of 34%. This class has
    been significantly influenced by seasonal variations and has displayed a more
    evident pattern under these changes. As shown in Fig. 13, the classification accuracy
    has improved for the classes Dryland Cropland and Pasture (2), Irrigated Cropland
    and Pasture (3), Cropland/Grassland Mosaic (5), Cropland/Woodland Mosaic (6),
    Herbaceous Wetland (17), and Wooden Wetland (18) during the cool season. However,
    the model still struggles to classify them with higher accuracy. For instance,
    the class Irrigated Cropland and Pasture (3) has been misclassified as Mixed Dryland/Irrigated
    Cropland and Pasture (4) with an error rate of about 50%, whether during the warm
    or cool season. The reason behind this misclassification and the decrease in accuracy
    can be attributed to the complexity of these classes and the characteristics of
    the collected dataset. This category of classes is a combination of two or more
    different classes, which makes it harder to distinguish between them. In addition,
    the data set collected in the pixel-based approach is only a set of spectral features
    in each point. In other words, for each point, a set of spectral features has
    been extracted only for that point, and the model does not receive any information
    about the neighborhood of the sample point. Generally, leveraging multitemporal
    data for generating LULC maps is particularly effective in complex and heterogeneous
    environments, such as rapidly expanding metropolitan areas. Multi-temporal data
    improves the accuracy of the classifiers by depicting the dynamic nature of LULC
    changes. 7.2. Influence of object-level features on the accuracy of LULC classification
    In the case of complex and composite classes such as Mixed Shrubland/Grassland
    (9), Mixed Dryland/Irrigated Cropland and Pasture (4), Irrigated Cropland and
    Pasture (3), and Dryland Cropland and Pasture (2), their accurate classification
    indeed requires feature analysis within a block of pixels. Attempting to classify
    them without considering contextual and neighboring features makes the task significantly
    more challenging. The second approach, object-based, goes beyond the pixel-based
    approach by considering various contextual and neighboring information. It provides
    more meaningful clustering for sets of pixels, enabling the extraction of more
    helpful information. The results of different models in the object-based approach
    are presented in Table 5. As illustrated, the models have demonstrated better
    OA and KC performance in both warm and cool seasons compared to the pixel-based
    approach. This performance improvement is notable, especially considering the
    processing limitations of GEE during the execution of the SNIC algorithm. As shown
    in Fig. 3, the training dataset includes only the Blue, Green, and Red bands,
    along with the outputs of the SNIC algorithm, namely Blue_Mean, Green_Mean, and
    Red_Mean. In the object-based approach, inherent spatial relationships are incorporated,
    and these relationships can be beneficial when encountering complex land cover
    patterns. Fig. 14 displays the confusion matrix of the best-performing models
    in the object-based approach for both warm and cool seasons. The accuracy of all
    classes, especially those with complex and composite patterns, has significantly
    improved compared to the pixel-based approach. For example, the class Herbaceous
    Wetland (17), which achieved the best accuracy of 44% in the warm season in the
    pixel-based approach, has improved to an accuracy of 71% by considering contextual
    information in the object-based approach. This demonstrates a significant enhancement
    in classifying complex patterns. Wetlands are indeed complex ecosystems that encompass
    various water contents, vegetation cover, and different soil types, each with
    distinct characteristics. Additionally, mixed pixels can be present in wetlands,
    especially at their borders, where water, vegetation, and soil may coexist within
    a single pixel. Therefore, relying just on spectral values of pixels can lead
    to errors in wetland classification. In the object-based approach, contextual
    information about wetlands, their unique patterns, and structures have been extracted.
    Additionally, considering groups of pixels in this approach helps reduce noise.
    This means that the object-based approach considers the spectral values of individual
    pixels, their spatial relationships, and how they form meaningful objects within
    the wetland landscape. This holistic approach enhances the accuracy of wetland
    classification by capturing the complexity and diversity of wetland ecosystems
    more effectively. In the object-based approach, the class Snow and Ice (24) has
    been accurately identified with high precision during the cold season. Snow and
    ice have distinct textural properties and typically exhibit smoothness, while
    adjacent surfaces can be helpful in better discrimination from other land covers.
    This demonstrates the effectiveness of the object-level features for accurate
    classification. Snow and Ice can create similar spectral characteristics with
    other classes, especially in bare land with little vegetation. In fact, spectral
    confusion is reduced in the object-based approach. 7.3. Feature importance analysis
    To achieve more sustainable results, it is essential to identify the significance
    and importance of the features utilized in various approaches during warm and
    cool seasons. On the other hand, using all the features is not possible due to
    data redundancy and processing limitations in GEE. For this reason, feature importance
    analysis was conducted using the RF and GTB models in the object-based and pixel-based
    approaches based on warm and cool seasons. The results of this analysis are presented
    in Fig. 15. In the pixel-based approach, based on spectral information, the B10
    band (TIRS) has shown the highest significance in both warm and cool seasons.
    This band receives the emitted thermal radiation from the Earth''s surface. Different
    land cover types have distinct thermal absorption and emission characteristics.
    This band has proven to be highly useful and practical in distinguishing classes
    with different temperatures, such as water bodies and urban areas. Water bodies,
    due to their high thermal capacity, exhibit lower thermal reflectance. In urban
    areas, the thermal band is also valuable due to the presence of man-made materials
    such as concrete and asphalt, which absorb and reflect heat. Additionally, the
    phenomenon of the urban heat island, where certain parts of the city are warmer
    compared to the surrounding areas, plays an influential role in classification.
    More precisely, the top-ranking position of the thermal band in both warm and
    cool seasons confirms the reliability and stability of this band as a distinct
    feature. It demonstrates that thermal behavior is an inherent characteristic of
    various land cover types that remain consistent under different environmental
    conditions. B7 (SWIR2) in pixel-based approach has been important in feature recognition,
    ranking second and third in warm and cool seasons, respectively. The SWIR2 band
    of the Landsat 8 sensor provides valuable information related to identifying soil
    types, water quality, and mineral content (Mukherjee et al., 2019; Wang et al.,
    2013). In the next level of importance, we find B2, which is the Blue surface
    reflectance band. This band is located at the second and third positions in the
    cool and warm seasons, respectively. The Blue band is sensitive to water bodies
    and their characteristics. This sensitivity to blue light has been utilized to
    identify the Water Bodies class. Furthermore, the Urban and Built-up Area class
    (1), which comprises impervious surfaces like roads and buildings, can reflect
    more Blue light compared to natural surfaces like bare soil areas and dense and
    sparse vegetation (Capolupo et al., 2020). Urban areas exhibit distinct reflection
    patterns in the Blue band. Following that, the NDVI and NDWI indices are included.
    Considering that most classes in the USGS 24-category scheme consist of combinations
    of various vegetation types, NDVI provides valuable information in this regard
    and distinguishes these classes from urban areas and bare soils. Additionally,
    NDWI is a complementary index in highlighting water bodies and evaluating the
    amount of water within vegetation cover. The NDBI index is at the next position
    in the cool season, demonstrating its effectiveness in urban area detection. Taking
    into account the feature importance values illustrated in Fig. 15, it is shown
    that in addition to B10, the features B2, B7, NDVI, NDWI, and NDBI all have nearly
    equal importance levels (9%). This indicates that these features have effectively
    contributed to the classification process. In other words, the features have a
    balanced contribution, and each has provided valuable information for distinguishing
    different classes. Consequently, no single feature has dominated the ML algorithm,
    and the algorithm has employed a combination of spectral features for classification.
    According to Fig. 15, in the object-based approach, B4 has the highest relative
    importance in both warm and cool seasons. The Red band (B4) is sensitive to different
    surface and vegetation characteristics; thus, it has provided helpful information
    related to vegetation density. Healthy vegetation absorbs more Red light than
    NIR. Like the pixel-based approach, the Blue band (B2) has also demonstrated its
    importance here. In the next ranking, the Green band (B3) is placed. This band
    is sensitive to chlorophyll content and has helped detect fields, forests, grasslands,
    and areas where vegetation cover plays a significant role. Furthermore, urban
    areas exhibit distinct patterns in this band due to the presence of impermeable
    materials. Alongside the mentioned factors, the SR_B3_Mean and SR_B4_Mean bands,
    which are the outputs of the SNIC algorithm, have also demonstrated high importance.
    These bands represent the average values of clusters within the Red band (B4)
    and the Green band (B3), capturing spectral features based on the spatial relationships
    of surrounding pixels. These spatial relationship details, such as texture, complement
    spectral bands, reducing classifier sensitivity to noise and enhancing the discrimination
    of land cover types. 7.4. Influence of features fusion on accuracy of LULC classification
    Considering Table 6, it is shown that the fusion of features from different seasons
    has improved classification accuracy. The values of OA and KC are high and close
    to each other. The proximity of these two metrics indicates that the classification
    results are consistent, reliable, and interpretable. As a result, the classification
    process has been realized based on meaningful distinctions between different classes.
    However, it is essential to note that achieving high accuracy metrics does not
    necessarily mean error-free classification. There could still be some level of
    misclassification or uncertainty in the results, but the classifier has successfully
    made meaningful distinctions between various classes. The confusion matrix of
    the final classification has been examined to provide a more precise discovery
    from the classification and discrimination of different land covers (Fig. 16).
    According to the principal diagonal values, classes 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15,
    16, 17, 19, and 24 have been accurately identified with high precision. Additionally,
    classes 2, 5, 6, and 18 have also been appropriately detected with a satisfactory
    level of accuracy. It can be observed that feature fusion has had an impact on
    distinguishing the classes, resulting in more stable and consistent results. In
    general, in the object-based and pixel-based approaches, fluctuating classification
    behavior or low accuracy was observed in two different types of classes: classes
    related to wetlands and composite classes. About wetlands, there were Herbaceous
    Wetland (17) and Wooden Wetland (18) classes in the classification scheme, which
    were very challenging to recognize in previous approaches, as both had very low
    accuracy. About composite classes, incorporating a group of features in the object-based
    approach has nearly mitigated the accuracy issue for some of them. However, the
    challenge of low accuracy in distinguishing classes, such as classes related to
    the wetlands, still needs to be solved. The class Cropland/Grassland Mosaic (5)
    achieved the best accuracy in both the pixel-based and object-based approaches,
    with 56% and 65% accuracy, respectively, during the warm season. It is worth noting
    that this class represents a combination of agricultural lands and grasslands,
    and its land cover pattern changes during the cool season, resulting in lower
    accuracies of 41% and 47% for pixel-based and object-based approaches, respectively.
    By incorporating spectral features alongside spatial features across different
    seasons, the accuracy for composite classes has reached a stable value of 65%.
    Among all 17 classes, only the Irrigated Cropland and Pasture (3) has achieved
    a low level of accuracy. Irrigated Cropland and Pasture (3) can exhibit a high
    degree of intra-class diversity due to variations in agricultural products, different
    irrigation methods, various soil types, and diverse management activities. The
    diversity within this class leads to numerous spectral patterns. Due to its Irrigated
    nature, this class also experiences temporal changes. In other words, during the
    growth season, factors such as planting, plant phenological stages, irrigation
    frequency, growth phases, and harvesting times cause fluctuations in its spectral
    characteristics. These variations make classification more challenging. It is
    worth noting that the classification of Irrigated Cropland and Pasture (3) has
    had the highest error rate when distinguishing it from Mixed Dryland/Irrigated
    Cropland and Pasture (4). The misclassification is likely due to the proximity
    and high similarity between these two classes. It is possible that because of
    their adjacency and similarities, accurately distinguishing between them becomes
    challenging. To increase the accuracy of classifying Irrigated Cropland and Pasture
    (3), it is advisable to revisit the collected labels, potentially increasing their
    number to address the abovementioned challenges by considering different spectral
    patterns at various scales within this class. Additionally, experimenting with
    the classification with new features that consider the phonological dynamics of
    vegetation is recommended. This should help distinguish and classify this complex
    land cover category better. Overall, the fusion of object-level and pixel-level
    features in LULC classification is an advanced technique that improves the accuracy
    and interpretability of remote sensing data. By performing this, classification
    algorithms better understand different spatial patterns and variations in the
    data. This method is helpful in dealing with mixed pixels and makes the classification
    process more resistant to noise. 7.5. Comparative study The findings of this study
    were compared to previous studies using different criteria, as outlined in Table
    7. Detailed explanations of these studies can be found in Section 2. Table 7 is
    organized based on various criteria, including the study area, the specific LULC
    classification scheme (number of classes), the classification strategy (feature
    extraction), the accuracy of the classification technique, the type of processing
    system (local or cloud-based), the utilization of data fusion techniques, and
    the inclusion of seasonal analysis. As illustrated in Table 7, the proposed framework
    in this study for LULC map generation demonstrates advancements compared to previous
    studies in terms of data integration, the use of cloud processing, the incorporation
    of both pixel-based and object-based features, and the inclusion of seasonal analysis.
    As a result, the classification achieved a significantly higher accuracy (94.9%)
    compared to previous investigations. Although studies conducted by GonzÃ¡lez et
    al. (2022) and Orieschnig et al. (2021) came close to this framework with accuracies
    of 92.0% and 94.0%, respectively, it should be noted that the schemes used in
    those studies were considerably simpler than the USGS 24-category scheme employed
    here. The high classification accuracy achieved within this scheme demonstrates
    the effectiveness of the developed framework, which leverages the fusion of pixel-level
    and object-level features across different seasons using machine learning algorithms.
    Furthermore, performing the classification in an extensive study area in this
    research illustrates the capability of the proposed framework for regional-scale
    applications such as meteorological studies. Table 7. Comparing results of previous

    of LULC on climate modeling The WRF-ARW model was run twice with default and updated
    LULC data. According to the data of the available ground stations, the T2 parameter
    and the U and V components of the wind speed were extracted from the hourly outputs
    of the WRF model on 2019.06.09. By performing appropriate post-processing, the
    daily average of T2 and wind speed data were calculated for the specified date.
    The distribution patterns of the T2 field and the 10-m wind field have been shown
    for both default and updated executions in Fig. 17, Fig. 18, respectively. In
    both figures, LULC has influenced the field distribution of estimated parameters.
    The most significant changes in LULC classes are related to Urban and Built-up
    Land (1). Urban areas typically experience higher temperatures compared to non-urban
    areas in their vicinity. This phenomenon is evident in both visualizations of
    the temperature field resulting from the default and updated executions, with
    the highest temperature levels (in red) revealed in these areas. Some new urban
    areas were added to the LULC map after updating it. These new urban areas have
    their impact on the T2 output of the model in the form of red dots with high temperatures
    similar to other urban areas. Additionally, based on Fig. 17, it can be observed
    that the T2 values in areas where the Snow and Ice (24) or Water Bodies (16) classes
    have been added to the LULC map are reduced to the lowest temperature levels (dark
    blue) compared to the default execution. The impact of this change in LULC classes
    is not limited to just those specific pixels but has also altered the temperature
    field pattern to some extent in the surrounding areas. Daily average wind speed
    changes have occurred, as depicted in Fig. 18. These changes have led to an increase
    in wind speed in the central part of the domain (highlighted brighter areas).
    To better understand the impact of LULC changes and effectively validate their
    performances, statistical evaluations have been performed for parameters such
    as T2 and wind speed. For the T2 parameter, data from a network of 136 CoCoRaHS
    observation stations were utilized. Additionally, wind speed data were examined
    using a network of 32 observation stations from GHCN. The observational datasets
    were extracted from the dataset portal of the NOAA website (www.ncei.noaa.gov).
    The spatial distribution of these two observation networks can be observed in
    Fig. 2. Statistical metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and BIAS were calculated for the
    two parameters, T2 and wind speed, for two runs of the WRF-ARW model. The results
    of these evaluations are presented in Table 8. Table 8. Results of statistical
    evaluation of meteorological parameters. Meteorological Parameter RMSE MAE BIAS
    Air temperature (updated LULC) 2.34 °C 0.93 °C −0.91 °C Air temperature (default
    LULC) 2.36 °C 1.93 °C −0.94 °C Wind speed (updated LULC) 1.19 m/s 0.91 m/s −0.37
    m/s Wind speed (default LULC) 1.16 m/s 0.97 m/s −0.37 m/s In the case of T2, based
    on the RMSE criterion, the model results using the updated LULC maps have become
    closer to ground measurements by 0.02 °C. According to MAE, the average absolute
    difference between the predicted and measured values has improved by 1 °C. This
    demonstrates that the WRF model performance has significantly improved after updating
    the LULC map. Additionally, the Bias value decreased by 0.03 °C after LULC updating.
    For the wind speed parameter, after replacing the updated LULC map, the RMSE value
    has increased by 0.03 m/s, while the MAE value has improved by 0.06 m/s. The BIAS
    value for wind speed has remained unchanged, indicating that both predictions
    are similar based on this metric. While the wind speed parameter changes have
    not been as significant as the T2, the MAE improvement and BIAS stability show
    that the produced LULC map still contributes to better model predictions. In other
    words, the effect of LULC maps on local wind patterns is effective. However, its
    effect is not as dominant as T2. Also, the wind speed is very variable during
    time, and in different places, the effects of changes in wind speed are different
    in hours. On the other hand, the WRF model outputs the wind speed in the form
    of U and V components; thus, converting these components to the speed and averaging
    it causes error propagation, and the effect of LULC patterns may be hidden in
    it. It is important to note that the quality of USGS land use maps varies in different
    regions. This means that the accuracy and quality of the default USGS LULC map
    in California might be adequate, which could explain why their impact on the model
    predictions is less sensed than expected. However, it should be clarified that
    the quality of these maps can vary in other regions of the world, which can significantly
    affect model output parameters. Additionally, observational data is often sparse
    and limited to a certain number of stations. In specific land types, the evaluation
    may not capture the effects of LULC changes in regions without stations, and it
    cannot provide a quantitative representation of T2 and wind speed changes in those
    areas. However, as discussed earlier, based on Fig. 17, Fig. 18, updating the
    LULC map could affect the performance of the WRF model. In general, the results
    demonstrate that the changes made in LULC maps have positively impacted both parameters.
    In other words, the statistical evaluation indicates that the generated land use
    data is consistent with real-world conditions and could affect wind and temperature
    fields. As a result, the framework implemented in the GEE for LULC mapping can
    be used for both research and operational purposes in other regions worldwide.
    7.7. Limitations and future directions Like other research endeavors, this study
    has faced various limitations. Furthermore, recommendations for future research
    are put forth. In this research, high-resolution LULC labels were collected from
    images provided by the Google Earth Pro service for the California region. While
    Google Earth Pro images are generally available worldwide, in some areas, weather
    conditions like cloud cover may affect the quality of these images or updates
    of satellite images may not have been provided in certain regions. Therefore,
    it is recommended to collect land use labels from other available datasets and
    assess their accuracy to complement the training dataset. This would ensure the
    availability of accurate and sufficient LULC labels for regions where Google Earth
    imagery may have limitations. Despite collecting a complete training dataset with
    sufficient diversity (covering all land types) as well as encompassing various
    pixel-level and object-level features for training classifiers, since the training
    dataset has been collected for a specific geographic location, the model''s performance
    can be influenced by changing the study area. However, the framework can be successfully
    implemented in other study areas in case of providing training samples from the
    new target regions. Working with satellite images presents significant challenges,
    including the presence of incomplete information and potential biases. For instance,
    cloud coverage can obstruct valuable data for LULC mapping in the target study
    area. Moreover, complex classes within the LULC scheme may pose challenges when
    relying solely on one remote sensing source. In this research, even with the best
    classification strategies, class 3 (Irrigated Cropland and Pasture) did not achieve
    the desired accuracy due to its high complexity. To address these challenges,
    it is recommended to incorporate additional sources of information such as soil
    moisture, LiDAR data, and SAR imagery. Soil moisture data can distinguish between
    irrigated classes and other types. LiDAR data aids in filtering various vegetation
    types by providing information on slope, aspect, and other land features, enabling
    differentiation between bare land and classes like grassland. SAR images offer
    valuable information regardless of weather conditions, and their higher penetrating
    ability plays a vital role in identifying wetlands. By integrating these complementary
    data sources, the accuracy and reliability of LULC mapping can be significantly
    improved, overcoming the limitations associated with incomplete satellite images
    and complex class distinctions. In this research, a USGS 24-category LULC scheme
    was utilized. The static data of the WRF model supports two types of LULC schemes,
    namely USGS and MODIS. Evaluating the impact of both schemes on the accuracy of
    estimating metrological parameters by the WRF model, depending on the target region,
    is valuable. The WRF model, to estimate atmospheric parameters, utilizes various
    static geographical data, in addition to LULC map, such as topography, leaf area
    index, etc. Using satellite imagery and other available data sources, it is possible
    to generate accurate updates of other input geographical information that inherently
    exhibit dynamic behavior. Due to the limitation on the availability of observational
    station data, this study evaluated two widely used parameters, T2 and wind speed,
    among the output parameters. It is recommended to evaluate other meteorological
    parameters such as soil moisture at different depths, solar radiation, and dew
    point in case of availability of their ground measurements. Despite the powerful
    capabilities of the GEE, which provides a wide range of functionalities for spatial
    data analysis, processing, and interpretation, this research encountered multiple
    limitations when using it for classification. These limitations include computational
    time constraints, data processing volume, and the combination of various features
    within the platform. In cases where the study area is vast, the model training
    process requires many sample points to ensure training data completeness. When
    dealing with complex LULC schemes, using high-resolution imagery and combining
    various spectral features and indices becomes essential. Moreover, in such complex
    scenarios, adjusting the parameters of ML models is also necessary. It is not
    always possible to handle a USGS 24 classification process for a large area with
    a high-capacity model by employing a high volume of sample data. For example,
    we can refer to the GTB algorithm, which could not increase the number of trees
    to more than 20 for the 33,209 sampling. An alternative approach to enhancing
    the accuracy of LULC maps is to leverage deep learning techniques. These techniques
    operate patch-wise, where each patch incorporates sophisticated features extracted
    from satellite imagery. This enables them to recognize intricate patterns effectively.
    Particularly, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for LULC
    classification. These models automatically extract hierarchical features at various
    scales, encompassing edges, textures, and more intricate elements. By autonomously
    deriving relevant features from the data, deep learning eliminates the need for
    manual feature engineering and reduces manual effort. Furthermore, deep learning
    techniques facilitate the generation of real-time LULC information. Recurrent
    Neural Network (RNN) models, in particular, demonstrate the ability to learn and
    adapt to evolving LULC patterns continuously. This adaptability enables the model
    to capture temporal shifts and variations in land cover patterns. Transfer learning
    techniques enhance the model''s compatibility with new situations or different
    study areas. Additionally, integrating deep learning techniques with the GEE platform
    through the Google Cloud platform allows for dynamic LULC mapping by incorporating
    satellite imagery and real-time observations. Despite the existing limitations
    of GEE, the implemented framework has yielded favorable results. However, it is
    worth noting that GEE undergoes continuous improvements and updates, and with
    increased processing power, it holds the potential to generate even more accurate
    classifications. Considering these factors, it is recommended to employ deep learning
    methods, compare their performance, and integrate the models with real-time data
    to produce dynamic LULC maps. It should be acknowledged that the simulation of
    the scenarios mentioned above requires a more comprehensive evaluation of the
    model predictions to ensure their accuracy and reliability. The proposed framework
    presented in this research offers an opportunity to generate up-to-date LULC maps
    that can be effectively utilized in the WRF model. This integration enhances the
    estimation of meteorological parameters. It is recommended that this framework
    be further validated for various fields and applications that necessitate continuous
    monitoring of LULC changes or rely on accurate air temperature estimation. For
    example, validation can be conducted in applications related to the prevention
    of freezing damage in agriculture or the assessment of heat stress. By validating
    the framework in these specific contexts, its effectiveness and applicability
    can be demonstrated, leading to more reliable and precise results in relevant
    fields and applications. 8. Conclusion LULC maps play a crucial role in various
    fields, and one of these areas is the estimation of meteorological parameters
    using numerical models. In these models, different LULC classes influence the
    accuracy estimation of different parameters. The lack of continuous updates to
    LULC data can lead to a divergence between the estimated results and ground measurements,
    increasing uncertainty in the modeling and analysis processes. Using remote sensing
    technology to continuously collect satellite data and process them in cloud processing
    platforms such as GEE to generate updated LULC maps can fill the existing information
    gap. In this research, a framework based on GEE was implemented to produce a LULC
    map of USGS 24 classes with Landsat 8 data with a spatial resolution of 30 m for
    use in the WRF numerical model. The classification was performed using two different
    approaches, object-based and pixel-based, during two temporal intervals, warm
    and cool seasons, using various ML models, including RF, GTB, SVM, and CART. For
    this, first, 15 educated apprentices collected 1221 labeled regional samples for
    17 different LULC classes in California using high-resolution images provided
    by Google Earth Pro service. A time series of Landsat 8 images was processed during
    the warm and cool seasons, and a set of features was extracted at both the pixel
    level (spectral) and the object level. The object-based methods, which take advantage
    of spatial relationships such as texture and consider groups of pixels, provided
    higher accuracy in all models compared to the pixel-based approach. Furthermore,
    the results indicated that the accuracy of ML algorithms varied across different
    temporal intervals, highlighting the dynamic behaviors of LULC patterns in different
    seasons. Based on the results, ensemble ML models such as RF and GTB outperformed
    SVM and CART in terms of OA and KC. To achieve more stable accuracy and consider
    the dynamic behavior of land use in different seasons, feature importance analysis
    was conducted using the best model (RF) for each classification approach (object-based
    and pixel-based) in both seasons. The most suitable spectral and spatial features
    from different seasons were fused, improving LULC classification accuracy. In
    the end, the performance of the generated LULC map was evaluated in the WRF model.
    For this objective, the geographic static parameters such as LU_INDEX and LANDUSEF
    obtained from the LULC map at different domains were replaced in WRF. Then, the
    estimates achieved from the WRF simulation for T2 and wind speed parameters were
    compared respectively to ground measurements. The produced LULC map improved the
    accuracy estimation of T2 and wind speed. Overall, updating the LULC map had a
    positive impact on the estimation of meteorological variables by the WRF model.
    As a result, generating more accurate LULC maps applied to WRF simulations becomes
    feasible in different regions worldwide. CRediT authorship contribution statement

    weather conditions at an alarming rate (1–3), as evidenced by extensive increases
    in the intensity, frequency, and duration of heavy precipitation events worldwide
    over the past five decades (4–7). These changes lead to more frequent extremely
    wet years (EWYs), which are characterized by strong positive anomalies of annual
    precipitation (8). EWYs pose widespread threats to various aspects of environmental
    and ecosystem sustainability (9, 10). In particular, nitrogen (N) losses to aquatic
    ecosystems (Nw) from agricultural land are substantially intensified during EWYs.
    For example, precipitation changes have led to up to a 33% increase in riverine
    N loads within the continental United States (11), causing severe freshwater eutrophication,
    groundwater contamination, and coastal phytoplankton blooms (12–17). Making things
    worse, a substantial portion of Nw eventually turns into N2O, a potent greenhouse
    gas, further exacerbating global warming (18). Unfortunately, EWYs are projected
    to increase further in the future (19). Thus, mitigating Nw and its associated
    pollution is a pressing priority in response to anthropogenic-accelerated climate
    extremes. Previous studies have explored multiple strategies to mitigate Nw and
    address global N pollution, such as enhancing cropland N use efficiency, e.g.,
    by reducing fertilizer application intensity (20) and optimizing other agricultural
    management practices (21–24). However, these studies have not adequately considered
    the impacts of EWYs. As the global population grows and becomes more affluent,
    food demand will increase. This will likely result in increased use of total N
    fertilizer, even with improved N use efficiency (25), which will make sustainable
    water quality management more challenging (11). In addition, the projected increases
    in the frequency and intensity of EWYs due to future climate change exacerbates
    the problem (26). The severity of the N problem ahead requires more effective
    strategies to limit N additions to control extreme Nw during EWYs (referred to
    as extreme Nw hereafter) without notably compromising crop yields. We propose
    a CLimate Extreme Adaptive Nitrogen Strategy (CLEANS), which adapts N additions
    to EWYs. The rationale for CLEANS is inspired by long-term field experiments that
    reveal a substantial amount of residual N (>100 kg N ha−1) in soils during dry
    years (27), which could be used by crops in the following year, especially when
    it is a wet year, so as to reduce N additions without substantial impacts on crop
    yields. In principle, CLEANS is a practical and essential approach that needs
    urgent implementation in the face of climate change. Despite the potential benefits
    of CLEANS, its global significance, impact on extreme Nw, and optimal application
    timing, crop targets, and locations are still not well understood. By addressing
    these questions, CLEANS has the potential to promote both environmental sustainability
    and food security, leading to a win-win outcome. We aim to address these knowledge
    gaps by using the latest advancements in crop modeling [Python-based Environmental
    Policy Integrated Climate (PEPIC)] (20, 28, 29), bias-corrected general circulation
    models (GCMs), and machine learning [Random Forest (RF)], in combination with
    a comprehensive global dataset on crop yields, climate, management practices,
    and soil properties. We estimate the global magnitude of extreme Nw during both
    historical (1981–2010) and future (2036–2065) periods, assess its geospatial distribution
    according to food production units (FPUs) (30, 31), and disentangle the effects
    of key factors, including management, climate, and soil-related variables. With
    this knowledge, we assess the CLEANS approach for mitigating extreme Nw with minimal
    compromises on crop yields. To illustrate the effectiveness of CLEANS under different
    climate scenarios from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways and Representative Climate
    Pathways (SSP-RCPs), we focus on two contrasting trajectories: SSP126 and SSP370
    (32). RESULTS Substantially higher N losses during EWYs During the historical
    period, EWYs with annual precipitation anomalies greater than 2σ (see Materials
    and Methods) occurred in less than 3% of all FPU-year combinations (fig. S1 and
    table S1). However, despite their rarity, EWYs caused significantly higher Nw
    than average, particularly for maize (Fig. 1). In terms of relative change, extreme
    Nw for maize exceeded the historical average by 78 and 107% under rainfed and
    irrigated cultivation, respectively. Furthermore, during years with annual precipitation
    anomalies greater than 3σ, extreme Nw was more than double the long-term averages
    for all crops, regardless of irrigation status. On the other hand, dry years showed
    lower Nw than the long-term averages, indicating that more N is likely stored
    in the soil during periods of low precipitation. Fig. 1. Relative changes in nitrogen
    losses (Nw) under different precipitation anomalies. Bar plots show Nw changes
    relative to the 1981–2010 average for maize (A and B), rice (C and D), and wheat
    (E and F) presented separately for irrigation (left) and rainfed (right) conditions.
    Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals estimated from 1000 bootstrapped
    resampled sets. Numbers in blue indicate the average Nw changes with precipitation
    anomalies >2σ (i.e., extreme Nw changes). The number of FPU-year combinations
    is indicated by “n.” Notably, the magnitudes of extreme Nw varied considerably
    among global FPUs (fig. S2), with considerable effects observed in FPUs characterized
    by low average annual precipitation (fig. S3). In contrast, the patterns of N
    input and average Nw (figs. S4 and S5) were not associated with the magnitudes
    of extreme Nw across different FPUs. This result suggests that low extreme Nw
    is not necessarily linked to low N input and low average Nw losses. Although the
    number of EWYs was small (only 1 or 2 years of 30 in most cases; fig. S6), total
    Nw during these years accounted for more than 10 to 25% of the total Nw in most
    cases during the 1981–2010 period (fig. S7). Globally, extreme Nw has a substantial
    impact on the deterioration of N pollution during both historical and future periods
    (Fig. 2). Cumulatively, extreme Nw across different FPUs was 22 to 56% higher
    than the historical average Nw, depending on crop species and cultivation conditions.
    The area-weighted average for all three crops integrated from irrigated and rainfed
    cultivations was 43%. The extreme Nw are more severe in the future during EWYs
    and could reach up to 29 to 80% higher than of historical average Nw, with an
    area-weighted average of 63% for the three crops under SSP126 and 61 to 120% (92%
    for the three crops) under SSP370. These numbers notably surpass the impact of
    historical EWYs. Over the historical period, ~60% of cropland was affected by
    EWYs, which is projected to increase to about 90%. However, there are differences
    in the future cumulative extreme Nw among different climate models, indicating
    uncertainty in predicting future EWY impacts. The projected increases in the EWY
    impacts are due to the combined effect of increases in precipitations over EWYs
    (fig. S8) and changes in future N input according to plausible social development
    scenarios (table S2). Although future precipitation (both long-term and during
    EWYs) under SSP370 is slightly lower than that under SSP126 during 2036–2065,
    increases of future extreme Nw are larger under SSP370 than under SSP126 due to
    higher future N input, except for rainfed rice. In addition, the frequency of
    the EWYs for future FPU years is projected to increase from less than 3% during
    the historical period to more than 20% (table S1 and fig. S9) using the mean and
    SD of historical precipitation to define future precipitation anomalies (see Materials
    and Methods). Fig. 2. Cumulative extreme nitrogen losses (Nw). Each line shows
    the cumulative extreme Nw relative to the 1981–2010 average along different FPUs.
    Extreme Nw is set to 0 for the regions without EWYs. Bold red lines indicate the
    extreme Nw during the historical period, while bold black lines present average
    extreme Nw among different climate models under future (2036–2065) SSP126 (dashed
    lines) and SSP370 (solid lines) conditions. Small vertical bars along the bold
    lines indicate the number of years falling in EWYs. Irrigated (left) and rainfed
    (right) conditions are distinguished for maize (A and B), rice (C and D), and
    wheat (E and F). Spatially, future climate change is expected to increase extreme
    Nw, and the areas affected by EWYs are projected to become more widespread (Fig.
    3 and fig. S2). Specifically, compared to historical climate, extreme Nw under
    future SSP370 climate is estimated to increase by 500 to 800% for western Russia,
    Saudi Arabia, Iran, southeastern Australia, northeastern China, and central North
    America (Fig. 3). However, the severity of these increases is relatively lower
    under scenario SSP126 (fig. S10). Fig. 3. Changes in extreme nitrogen losses (Nw)
    during 2036–2065 under the scenario SSP370. Maps show the differences (%) in extreme
    Nw averaged over five GCMs relative to the 1981–2010 average. Irrigated (left)
    and rainfed (right) conditions are distinguished for maize (A and B), rice (C
    and D), and wheat (E and F). Drivers of extreme Nw The most influential factors
    that drive extreme Nw are precipitation-related, specifically annual precipitation
    and the relative precipitation differences between two consecutive years (diffPr,
    see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 4 and figs S11 to S13). Unexpectedly, other factors
    such as N input, temperature, and soil properties have no consistent and statistically
    significant effects. The weak and negative relationship between N input and extreme
    Nw across FPUs suggests that reducing N input indiscriminately may not help decrease
    extreme Nw. We found that extreme Nw tends to be higher during EWYs occurring
    over dry regions, indicating that lower precipitations are associated with higher
    extreme Nw. For all crops, the variable diffPr has a strong positive impact on
    extreme Nw under both irrigated and rainfed conditions. This suggests that a substantial
    increase in precipitation in the current compared to the previous year could largely
    increase N pollution. Furthermore, diffPr has a significantly positive relationship
    with the precipitation anomaly of the current year but a significantly negative
    relationship with the precipitation anomaly of the previous year (fig. S14). The
    significant relationship between extreme Nw and diffPr could be explained by large
    N stored in soil (27) during previous dry conditions with less Nw (Fig. 1). As
    a result, high levels of N application in a current wet year, combined with large
    residual N from the previous year, exacerbate Nw. We also found that there are
    differences in the spatial patterns between extreme Nw and the absolute changes
    in Nw during EWYs (fig. S15). Values of absolute changes in Nw during EWYs are
    stronger in wet regions with high N input. Therefore, reducing N fertilization
    during years characterized by high diffPr in regions with high N input could help
    reduce the risk of extreme Nw. Fig. 4. Correlation coefficient (r) between extreme
    nitrogen losses (Nw) and different driving factors of the three crops under irrigated
    (IRR) and rainfed (RFD) conditions. The factors include annual precipitation (aPr),
    N input (Nin), soil bulk density (BD), relative precipitation differences between
    two consecutive years (diffPr), growing season precipitation (gsPr), precipitation
    during N fertilization period (ferPr), annual temperature (aT), growing season
    temperature (gsT), crop yield, coarse fragment (CF), sand content (SDC), and silt
    content (STC). The asterisk indicates significance at 95%. Details of the correlation
    refer to figs. S11 to S13. Mitigation of extreme Nw To identify efficient strategies
    to reduce extreme Nw without much impacting crop yields, we used machine learning
    models, specifically RF (33) models, to connect Nw and crop yield simulations
    from PEPIC with variables related to climate, management, and soil. The RF models
    were highly effective in predicting crop yields and Nw for the three crops, achieving
    an out-of-sample coefficient of determination (R2) greater than 0.92 and 0.85
    for crop yields and Nw, respectively (fig. S16). These RF models allow for greater
    flexibility and computational efficiency in assessing different options for mitigating
    extreme Nw. Scaling down N input every year across the historical period would
    decrease extreme Nw (fig. S17, A and B). However, this scenario would also lead
    to a notable reduction in crop yield over the same period, causing a substantial
    loss of crop production (fig. S17C). An alternative scenario is the CLEANS approach,
    which involves scaling down N input only in years characterized by high diffPr.
    By selecting various diffPr thresholds and scaling ratios of N input, the CLEANS
    method can have different effects on extreme Nw, N input, and crop yield. When
    implemented optimally, it has the potential to substantially reduce extreme Nw
    with a moderate decrease in N input and only minor (or even no) effects on crop
    yield. We demonstrated the effectiveness of CLEANS in reducing future extreme
    Nw, under a scenario without any compromise on crop yield and a moderate reduction
    in long-term N input (<15%) for each FPU and crop. We identified the optimal diffPr
    thresholds and scaling ratios of future N input that allow the largest decreases
    in future extreme Nw in about 50% of FPUs without yield loss (fig. S18). However,
    with this no-yield loss strategy, reductions on future extreme Nw cannot be achieved
    everywhere, particularly for irrigated maize (fig. S19), because no optimal diffPr
    and scaling ratio was found in several major maize producing regions, e.g., the
    North China Plain. To achieve a high reduction in future extreme Nw, we recommend
    implementing CLEANS with a slight crop yield loss, no more than −3%, and no more
    than −15% reduction on N input. In about 90% of FPUs, we detected the optimal
    diffPr thresholds and scaling ratios of future N input, which varied among FPUs
    and crops (Fig. 5 and fig. S20). In many regions, it is possible to scale down
    N input to a very low level (e.g., 0.3) and choose a small diffPr threshold (e.g.,
    0.1) (fig. S21). With these best threshold-scaling ratio combinations, future
    extreme Nw could potentially be decreased by 21 to 42% (26 to 46%) under the SSP126
    (SSP370) scenario (Fig. 6). Future reductions in long-term crop yield are generally
    within 2% for both scenarios with a moderate reduction of N input by 10%. However,
    the exact changes in Nw, N input, and crop yield vary with the management targets,
    as farmers and local governments may have varying levels of capacity to mitigate
    decreases in crop yield (e.g., −3 and −5%) and environmental needs to reduce N
    inputs (e.g., −10, −15, and −20%) (fig. S22). Despite these variations, the example
    provided above demonstrates the feasibility and substantial benefits of implementing
    CLEANS in reducing future extreme Nw. Fig. 5. Optimal combinations of diffPr thresholds
    and scaling ratios of nitrogen input to reduce extreme nitrogen losses (Nw). The
    maps illustrate, for each FPU, the best ratio for scaling down nitrogen input
    (Nin) during years with a relative precipitation difference between two consecutive
    years (diffPr) higher than a certain threshold under irrigated (left) and rainfed
    (right) conditions for maize (A and B), rice (C and D), and wheat (E and F). These
    ratios result in the greatest reduction in extreme Nw while maintaining a <15%
    reduction in long-term Nin and a <3% reduction in crop yield under the SSP370
    scenario. Regions shown in black indicate no optimal diffPr thresholds, and Nin
    scaling ratios were identified for the given reductions in Nin and yield constraints.

    in future extreme Nw, average nitrogen input (Nin), and crop yield for the period
    2036–2065, with and without mitigation measures, relative to the 1981–2010 averages.
    The mitigation measures are achieved by using the diffPr thresholds and Nin scaling
    ratios shown in Fig. 5. Irrigated (left) and rainfed (right) conditions are distinguished
    for maize (A and B), rice (C and D), and wheat (E and F). DISCUSSION This study
    sheds light on the disproportionate contribution of EWYs to past and future increases
    in Nw, underscoring the important role of EWYs in driving N pollution. Our findings
    are consistent with previous studies (34, 35) that identify N input as the primary
    factor controlling Nw (figs. S23 and S24), and N input is not the major driver
    of extreme Nw (36). Instead, the highest levels of extreme Nw tend to occur in
    regions with low precipitation but high variability in precipitation (diffPr)
    and are weakly associated with high N input. This is because regions with lower
    precipitation tend to have greater variability in precipitation (37), resulting
    in a wider range of extreme Nw. Moreover, high diffPr values often reflect dry
    conditions in the preceding year, which can lead to the accumulation of N in the
    soil (27) and contribute substantially to Nw under subsequent wet conditions (12,
    14). This pattern was observed in the upper Mississippi basin, where the nitrate
    flux in 2013 was more than double the historical average due to the substantial
    residual N accumulated in soil during the 2012 drought (38). Therefore, our study
    highlights the need for future N mitigation strategies to account for the impact
    of EWYs and diffPr, as demonstrated by the CLEANS approach. These strategies will
    be critical to balancing food security and environmental risks. Our CLEANS approach
    only aims to reduce N input during years with high diffPr values. This evidence-guided
    approach is most efficient when implemented adaptively, considering factors such
    as EWYs, crop types, local conditions, and specific management goals. To illustrate
    a feasible management target, we chose a crop yield reduction criterion of −3%,
    which could be compensated through innovative techniques and best management practices
    that boost crop yields (39, 40). This flexible methodological framework can also
    accommodate different management targets. The divergent effects of crop type,
    climate, soil, and management-related variables on extreme Nw suggest that nonuniform
    mitigation efforts are necessary for reducing Nw during EWYs (19). The N problem
    is complex and dynamic, involving multiple biological, chemical, technical, societal,
    political, and economic dimensions. Thus, future implementations of CLEANS should
    be conducted in conjunction with advancements from other sectors. For example,
    some agricultural practices—such as enhanced-efficiency fertilizer, biochar additions,
    crop rotation, reduced tillage, and buffer zones—can lower Nw, as highlighted
    in (24). In addition, government subsidies could provide an incentive for the
    implementation of CLEANS, especially among smallholders (41). Combining these
    practices with CLEANS could further reduce extreme Nw and benefit agriculture.
    However, local decision on fertilization practices is a rather complex issue,
    which is often currently determined by local feed and food production priorities
    rather than weather forecasts or climate projections (35, 42, 43). Nonetheless,
    we see the advantage in applying CLEANS for reducing N burdens in regions suffering
    from poor water quality. The information derived from this study is crucial for
    ensuring sustainable agricultural development and other benefits for humanity
    and ecosystems (23, 44). However, as with previous studies, uncertainties related
    to model simulations, GCMs, and future climate scenarios must be considered when
    implementing our CLEANS approach. It is particularly challenging to accurately
    predict future precipitation regimes, the frequencies of extremely wet conditions,
    and the diffPr values. Improved predictions of future EWYs could help mitigate
    these challenges (45–47). From a practical standpoint, CLEANS requires predicting
    diffPr before applying N fertilizer, which can be difficult for farmers. In these
    cases, governance, scientific communities, and agronomic practitioners should
    collaborate to transfer knowledge and provide relatively reliable middle-term
    weather forecasts. Although our study indicates that air temperature (both annual
    and growing season) is not among the main influencing factors of extreme Nw (Fig.
    4 and fig. S12), it is an important driver of the recent intensification of global
    phytoplankton blooms (17, 48). Therefore, air temperature needs to be considered,
    especially when dealing with the risk of eutrophication. Future research should
    investigate the effects of a concurrent occurrence of EWYs and warming conditions
    on eutrophication (49). Last, we did not distinguish the uptakes of different
    chemical forms of N, e.g., nitrate and ammonium. Some crops may have a preference
    for a specific form of N, e.g., rice preferring ammonium under certain conditions
    (50). These distinct preferences and different N uptake rates may affect the CLEANS
    approach, as dry conditions in 1 year could lead to the transformation of ammonium
    to nitrate and thus a lower ammonium level in the next (wet) year. However, crop
    preferences are uncertain and some studies also indicated that rice could take
    up more nitrate under acid conditions (50), and alternate wetting and drying conditions
    (51) making the magnitudes and impacts of the potential preferred N uptake difficult
    to quantify. The CLEANS approach may thus be in its generic form less robust in
    conditions with strong differences of uptake between ammonium and nitrate, and
    we suggest considering the preference of N when practically implementing the CLEANS
    approach. Despite our consideration of multifaceted uncertainties in the research
    outcomes, there are inherent uncertainties in our simulation framework. Differences
    among input data sources, especially in agricultural N input data (39, 52, 53),
    together with structural model uncertainty and approximations e.g., aggregation
    of various N forms and simplified representation of transformation processes in
    both terrestrial and aquatic environments (54), affect the results of our simulation.
    We, therefore, recommend interpreting the conclusions as outcomes derived from
    specific model and input data conditions. Future validation through observations
    at both field and regional scales for a comprehensive assessment could further
    strengthen the robustness of this study. In summary, our research highlights the
    global importance of CLEANS, provides detailed and spatially explicit knowledge
    on its future implementation, and acknowledges that refinement of the approach
    requires collective efforts from scientists, farmers, and policy makers to codesign
    sound agriculture-environment-climate policy and practices in the future. MATERIALS
    AND METHODS Simulating aquatic nitrogen losses To assess the impacts of EWYs,
    we used a large-scale crop model, PEPIC (55) to simulate major grain crops, including
    maize, rice, and wheat, along with their associated N dynamics on a global scale.
    The PEPIC model exhibited a good performance in simulating global N dynamics (fig.
    S25 and table S3) (28) and well represent crop yields across different countries
    (29) with R2 values ranging from 0.48 and 0.67 (fig. S26). Besides, we compared
    our simulated annual Nw of each FPU from the three crops to the observed total
    N concentration in the water bodies from the Global River Water Quality Archive
    dataset (56), both in normalized form, by estimating their correlation coefficients.
    Only the sites with observations of at least 10 years were chosen for the comparison.
    Given the simulated Nw is an aggregated value for each FPU, we then compared the
    simulated Nw with the site located at the most downstream region for each FPU.
    The results show that the correlation coefficients are higher than 0.5 in about
    two-thirds of the compared regions, especially in the United States and Canada,
    where longer observations are available (fig. S27). To estimate Nw and crop yields,
    we used the PEPIC model to simulate both irrigated and rainfed cultivations for
    each crop, with N input (from both chemical fertilizer and manure) applied twice
    during the growing season. The PEPIC model was then applied separately to simulate
    Nw for both historical (1981–2010) and future (2036–2065) periods at a spatial
    resolution of 30 arc min (about 50 km at the equator). Within PEPIC, N losses
    occur via volatilization and denitrification, as well as through surface runoff,
    leaching, and soil erosion, ultimately ending up in water bodies and the atmosphere.
    As the effects of EWYs on atmospheric N emissions are relatively minor (57) compared
    to the aquatic pathway, we focused on aquatic N losses in this study (28) N w
    = N ws + N wr + N wl (1) where Nw is aquatic N losses and Nws, Nwr, and Nwl are
    N losses to aquatic systems through soil erosion, surface runoff, and leaching,
    respectively. These indicators are in units of kg N ha−1 per year. To facilitate
    our analysis, we aggregated the gridded data into FPUs, which were defined based
    on river basins and economic regions introduced by Cai and Rosegrant (30) and
    modified by Kummu et al. (31), with a cropland area weighted method. We used a
    cropland area-weighted approach to ensure that the aggregated values were representative
    of the respective FPUs. We excluded FPUs with the smallest cropland areas, which
    accounted for a total of 0.05% of the global cropland of each crop. Defining EWYs
    We applied the standardized anomaly (SA) method (58), which quantifies the deviations
    of annual precipitation from the multiyear average to quantify the different precipitation
    intervals in different FPUs. The SA of annual precipitation for each FPU during
    the historical period was calculated as σ SA i , t = aPr i , t − aPr i ¯ σ i (2)
    where SAi,t refers to the SA of precipitation in year t for FPU i, aPri,t is annual
    precipitation in year t for FPU i, aPr i ¯ means multiyear average precipitation
    of FPU i, and σi is the SD of annual precipitation for FPU i. For the entire period
    (1981–2010), precipitation intervals were set as −2.5σ to +3.5σ, at an interval
    of 0.5σ, following Li et al. (58). A year was classified as an EWY if its SA value
    was greater than 2σ. For each FPU, the average Nw was estimated for the years
    in each precipitation anomaly interval. The average relative Nw change (in %)
    for a given precipitation anomaly interval from the average Nw over the entire
    period (30 years here) was used to determine the general impacts of precipitation
    anomalies on Nw considering all FPUs. We paid particular attention to the relative
    Nw change during EWYs, which we referred to as extreme Nw in this study. Because
    of high uncertainties in Nw simulations (28), we used 1000 times bootstrap to
    detect the uncertainties of extreme Nw. We also estimated future precipitation
    anomalies (2036–2065) with Eq. 2 but using historical aPr ¯ and σ to show the
    future precipitation changes relative to historical climate condition. Cumulative
    extreme Nw and the influencing drivers To illustrate the impact of EWYs on Nw,
    we plotted the cumulative extreme Nw across FPUs in ascending order based on the
    difference between the average Nw during EWYs and the average Nw during the entire
    historical period. We also cumulated the future extreme Nw relative to the historical
    long-term average Nw to assess the severity of future extreme Nw. Our analysis
    considered various factors, including climate, management, and soil-related variables,
    to identify the major influencing factors of extreme Nw. Climate variables such
    as annual precipitation (aPr), growing season precipitation (gsPr), precipitation
    during the period of two fertilization applications (ferPr), annual air temperature
    (aT), and growing season air temperature (gsT) were taken into account. In addition,
    the precipitation difference between two consecutive years relative to the multiyear
    average (diffPr) was also considered in the regression analysis to represent the
    possible cumulative effects on Nw due to dry conditions in the previous year diffPr
    i , t = aPr i , t − aPr i , t − 1 aPr i ¯ (3) where aPri,t−1 is annual precipitation
    in year t-1 for FPU i. Management factors consider N input, as well as irrigation/rainfed
    condition. Soil properties include bulk density (BD), coarse fragment (CF), sand
    content (SDC), and silt content (STC). Linear regressions between extreme Nw and
    the influencing drivers across FPUs were used to determine the major drivers.
    RF simulations We used the RF (33) machine learning models, implemented through
    the ranger() function in the R programming environment, to train the Nw data simulated
    with PEPIC. To account for potential disparities in the response of Nw to climate
    variations, soil textures, and other influencing variables (e.g., Nin), a specific
    RF model was built for each of the three crops at the FPU level. The model inputs
    included those considered in the regression analysis (as mentioned earlier). In
    addition, we introduced an independent factor variable “IRRF” (1 represents irrigated
    and 0 rainfed) in the model to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed cultivations.
    To distinguish between extremely and non-EWYs, we introduced another independent
    factor variable “Extreme” (1 represents EWYs and 0 other years) based on the SA
    value in each year. Given the strong correlation between aPr and gsPr, as well
    as between aT and gsT (as revealed by heat maps of autocorrelation in fig. S28),
    gsPr and gsT were excluded in the RF model, considering that aPr and aT were more
    important in representing Nw. To build the RF models, we divided the dataset into
    two parts, with 80% as the training dataset and 20% as the testing dataset. We
    removed outliers in both datasets using a chi-square test (59). The RF models
    were trained and optimized using 10-fold cross-validation to determine the best
    hyperparameters, including “mtry” and “ntree.” In each random forest tree, a random
    subset of the training dataset was used to learn from a random number of features
    (mtry) to split the tree. Predictions were made by averaging the predictions of
    all decision trees. We compared the PEPIC-simulated Nw with RF predictions and
    evaluated the performance of the RF models by calculating the root mean square
    error (RMSE) after each cycle of 10-fold cross-validation. The final hyperparameter
    values were chosen to minimize RMSE according to the cross-validation conducted
    with the training set. We tested the final model performance with the testing
    dataset and found that the R2 was higher than 0.85 (fig. S16). In addition, we
    built an RF model to analyze PEPIC-simulated crop yields using a similar approach,
    obtaining satisfactory predictive performance with an R2 higher than 0.92 based
    on the testing dataset (fig. S16). To analyze the relationship between Nw and
    each input variable, we used one-dimensional partial dependence plots (60) by
    averaging over all other predictors. The CLEANS approach The RF models were used
    to investigate the potential mitigation of extreme Nw while minimizing the impact
    on crop yield. Regression analyses were conducted to identify the influential
    factors driving the increase in extreme Nw, with diffPr found to be the most important
    factor (Fig. 4). Subsequently, the CLEANS approach was proposed to attenuate extreme
    Nw. This approach involves scaling down N input to a specified ratio only for
    years with diffPr above a certain threshold. The CLEANS approach was applied to
    both historical and future periods, with varying diffPr thresholds and N input
    scaling ratios resulting in different effects on extreme Nw and crop yield. Combinations
    of diffPr thresholds and N input scaling ratios were selected for each region
    and crop to maximize the decrease in extreme Nw with constraining reduction of
    crop yield (<3%) and N input (<15%). The optimal combinations were determined
    by analyzing the highest reduction in extreme Nw. To account for uncertainties,
    different constraints were set on reducing crop yield (e.g., 3 and 5%) and N input
    (10, 15, and 20%). Datasets Climate data for the historical PEPIC simulation were
    obtained from the AgMERRA dataset (61) (available at http://data.giss.nasa.gov/impacts/agmipcf/agmerra),
    which provides daily air temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, relative
    humidity, and wind speed. The AgMERRA dataset has good representation of extreme
    climate and was mainly designed for detecting the impacts of extreme climate on
    crop production (61). Future (2036–2065) bias-corrected climate data were obtained
    from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP; available
    at www.isimip.org/) data archive, under two SSP-RCP scenarios (SSP126 and SSP370)
    from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 using five GCMs: MRI-ESM2-0,
    MPI-ESM1-2-HR, UKESM1-0-LL, GFDL-ESM4, and IPSL-CM6A-LR. Land cover data were
    derived from the SPAM2010 dataset (62), while crop calendar was obtained from
    the SAGE dataset (63). Historical cropland use and crop calendar information were
    also used for the future period to isolate the effects of climate change on N
    losses. Historical N input data for each crop, including mineral fertilizers and
    manure, were obtained from the EarthStat datasets (available at www.earthstat.org).
    The EarthStat datasets were derived from (39, 64). Mineral N input was compiled
    from multiple data sources, including national and subnational sources, while
    the manure N input was derived from livestock density and mapped proportionally
    to cropland and pasture. The EarthStat N input data have been widely used in global
    studies (42, 65–67) and provide crop-specific N input. Deposited N was estimated
    by the product of N concentration in rainfall and rainfall volume (54). Considering
    future changes in N input could be an important influencing factor of extreme
    Nw, we used Land-Use Harmonization (LUH2) data (68) (available at https://luh.umd.edu)
    for years 2036–2065, similar to (69) This dataset contains both C3 annual crops
    (such as wheat and rice) and C4 annual crops (such as maize). Soil data—including
    the depth of each soil layer, BD, SDC, and STC—were obtained from the ISRIC–World

  description: Dynamics of soil salinity and sodicity is a common feature driven by
    anthropogenic causes such as soil reclamation, the effect of extreme climate events,
    disturbed salt, and water balance in irrigated areas that are devoid of any good
    quality groundwater source and adequate natural surface drainage condition in
    a semiarid climatic region. Periodic soil salinity assessment is therefore vital
    to know the current soil salinity status, plan reclamation, and/or management
    strategies for sustained agricultural growth and livelihood security. Temporal
    studies using Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS III data, at pre- (1997) and post-reclamation
    (2017) stages have indicated spatial changes as reclaimed areas (~ 35%) and dynamics
    of soil salinity as increased areas (~ 61%) under irrigation across the Gangetic
    plain of Haryana State. The prominent areas of reclaimed sodic soil soils were
    located in the old alluvial plain which covered Panipat (12.32%), Karnal (6.01%),
    and Jind (5.9%) districts. Based on pH, ECe, and ESP values, these were classified
    as slight (Sso1, 8.75%), moderate (Sso2, 24.73%), and strong (Sso3, 18.20%) sodic
    soils, respectively. Significant salinity-inflictions (emerging areas) were identified
    at low-lying, poorly drained, irrigated soils in south and central Haryana that
    cover Jhajjar (13.99%), Sirsa (11.06%), Hisar (10.15%), Rohtak (8.73%), Bhiwani
    (6.43%), Palwal (4.31%), and Rewari (3.01%) districts. Slight (Ssa1, 16.82%),
    and moderate (Ssa2, 22.13%), categories are dominant soils, respectively. Among
    the landforms, significant areas (28.24%) were identified in the old alluvial
    plain with sand dunes (OAPSD), aeo-fluvial plain (AFP, 8.6%), and fluvio-aeolian
    plain (FAP, 6.0%), respectively. Dominant areas of reclaimed soils (14.4%) were
    identified in OAPSD. The soil analysis data indicated that these soil are moderate
    to strongly sodic (pH 8.7–11.0) and saline (ECe 4–26 dS m−1). The reclaimed sodic
    soils showed prominent improvement in soil pH and sodicity levels (pH 8.3–9.2)
    at 0–15 cm depth and are commonly located in the Ghaggar and Yamuna river plains.
    Poor quality groundwater with high Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) was dominant
    at selected locations under the arid and semiarid climate. The database can also
    be used as a reference database for further monitoring of soil salinity status
    particularly in the irrigated regions. Currently, it is also used as a primary
    database for harmonization, monitoring, and reconciling of similar soils of the
    world under the Global Soil Partnership projects.

    © 2023 Introduction Global distribution and impacts of soil salinity Salinization
    of soil and water is a global issue primarily distributed in arid and semiarid
    regions (Stavi et al., 2021; FAO, 2020; Singh, 2009, 2022; Singh & Mandal, 2009).
    Spatial and temporal distribution of soil salinity is important inputs for understanding
    the dynamics of soil salinity and planning reclamation strategies. The reported
    extent of soil salinity (Hopmans et al., 2021; Wicke et al., 2011) is distributed
    in 100 countries. The primary factors such as climate change (Corwin, 2021; Daloz
    et al., 2021) and irrigation-induced soil salinity have prompted soil degradation
    (FAO, 2005; Gupta & Abrol, 2000; Qadir et al., 2021). Hassani et al. (2021) have
    used data models to predict complex variations of soil salinity with climate change
    in dryland areas of the world. Other reports such as Singh (2021), Ortiz and Jin
    (2021), Singh (2018), and Akramkhanov et al. (2011) have reviewed the environmental
    factors that influenced salt accumulation, plant response to evapotranspiration
    in irrigated soils. The global degraded areas (~ 23%) have increased at 5–10 million
    ha per annum and have affected ~ 1.5 billion population (Stavi & Lal, 2015). Olsson
    and Schaepman (2008), Suttons et al., (2016), and Turner et al. (2016) have also
    calculated the cost of land degradation on a global scale. Kumar and Sharma (2020)
    have identified ~ 2.2 million hectares of reclaimed sodic soils that have contributed
    17 million tons of food grain per annum, generated 15.5 billion rupees as assured
    income, and employed 2.8 million man-days. Lal (2010) has also reported the losses
    due to soil degradations and impacts on food security in South Asia. Stavi and
    Lal (2015) have suggested economic strategies to improve ecosystem services, control
    the environmental footprint of agriculture, support livelihood security, and achieve
    Zero Net Land Degradation (ZNLD). Aggarwal et al. (2004) have proposed adaptation
    strategies to control Global Environmental Changes (GEC) from Green House Gas
    (GHG) emissions, the vulnerability of the food system, and long-term socioeconomic
    benefits in the IGP. Remote sensing to assess soil degradations Global studies
    have addressed remote sensing data to assess global soil degradations, harmonized
    salinity data of varied sources, and developed maps that represent soil salinity
    distribution at a global scale (Bai et al., 2008; Gibbs and Salmon 2015; Hassani
    et al., 2020; Ivuskin et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019). Other methods include
    the machine learning technique (Kalambukattu et al., 2023); the expert opinion
    and biophysical models; and the proxy estimates such as vegetation indices, hyper-spectral
    data, and large-scale soil databases such as World Resource Base (WRB) 2014 (Zhang
    et al., 2011). Akca et al. (2020) have used Electro-Magnetic (EM)-38 probes for
    monitoring soil salinity changes, while Ivuskin et al. (2019), Hassani et al.
    (2020), Karim et al. (2022), and Scudiero et al. (2015) have used periodic (temporal)
    satellite imageries to assess the regional soil salinity changes. Corwin and Scudiero
    (2020) have compared the accuracy of proximal and remote sensors for soil salinity
    mapping. Zhang et al. (2015) have used time series VI (vegetation indices) data
    for precisely detecting soil salinity at a global scale. Gorji et al. (2015) have
    reviewed the application of remote sensing to map soil salinity using salinity
    and vegetation indices. Based on the Ecocrop map (FAO-Ecocrop, 2008), Negacz et
    al. (2022) have used QGIS to analyze global data on salt-affected soils to identify
    promising areas for saline agriculture. Mandal et al. (2015) used ILWIS GIS for
    harmonization of soil salinity data for the fifteen states in India, in digital
    format. It also prepared interactive databases to show spatial distribution with
    related datasets such as physiography, rainfall, temperature, agroclimatic, and
    geological zones in India. Indian Remote Sensing satellites (IRS 1A, 1B, and 1C)
    showed spatial resolutions ranging from 144 to 23.5 m embedded in 4 bands in IRS
    1A and IRS 1B and 5 bands in 1C (Blue, Green, Red, Near Infrared, and Shortwave
    Infrared). Landsat TM with 30-m spatial resolution and 7 spectral bands (0.45–2.35
    µm—Blue (B), Green (G), Red(R), Near Infrared (NIR), Shortwave Infrared (SwIR),
    thermal Infrared (TIR), and Middle Infrared (MIR)) have been used for monitoring
    soil salinity in Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) which covers India, Nepal, Pakistan,
    and Bangladesh (Dwivedi, 1994; Mandal, 2022a; Rao et al., 1995; Singh & Dwivedi,
    1980; Singh et al., 2010). Currently, Landsat ETM + (30-m spatial resolution and
    bands in B, G, R, NIR, SwIR1, and SwIR2), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)
    and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) (30-m, 15-m, and 100-m spatial resolutions
    and bands between 0.43 and 12.51 µm, coastal aerosol, B, G, R, NIR, SwIR1, SwIR
    2, Panchromatic (PAN), Cirrus, TIRS1, and TIRS2), and Sentinel 2 data (10 m, 20
    m, and 60 m, 13 bands between 0.44 and 12.19 µm, coastal aerosol, B, G, R, vegetation
    red edge-4 bands, NIR, water vapor, SwIR-cirrus, and SwIR-2 bands) with better
    spatial and spectral resolutions were used for assessment of salt-affected soils
    under the Global Soil Partnership (GSP) project (FAO, 2020). Processes involved
    in soil salinization and soil reclamation Rengasamy (2010) has reviewed soil processes
    such as soil water dynamics, soil structural stability, solubility of compounds,
    and nutrients/water movements largely influencing plants’ tolerance to soil salinity.
    Tang et al. (2020) have reported soil structural changes and hydraulic properties
    of sodic soils that play a vital role in the movement and passage of soil water
    and nutrients at root zone, inhibiting plant growth. To investigate polygonal
    crusts of salt playas and salt pans, Lasser et al. (2023) have identified the
    fairy circles to patterned ground sand columnar joints that appeared in many complex
    geophysical settings and transport salts and dusts in arid regions of the World.
    Salt crusts in salt pans, salt playas, or dry lakes located in Chile, Tunisia,
    Bolivia, California (USA), Iran, and China have developed due to extreme climatic
    aberrations and are uneconomical to reclaim. In India, high genetic tolerance
    for salt stress, halophytes are grown in the extreme soil salinity along the Rann
    of Kutch of Gujarat state (Misra & Tanna, 2017). To quantify the sodic soil reclamation
    process, Oster (1993) has explained the slow process of soil reclamation due to
    the low concentration of electrolytes in the soil solution that counteract the
    effects of exchangeable sodium that influenced aggregate stability, clay swelling,
    and dispersion. Using the deep tillage technique for adequate mixing of gypsum
    with soil followed by ponding with good quality of water is essential for successful
    and rapid reclamation of sodic and gypsiferous soils. Mahmoodabadi et al. (2013)
    have shown successful reclamation of calcareous saline soil using combinations
    of amendments (gypsum, cattle manure, and pistachio residue) as soil and water
    treatments that enabled higher mobility of Na+ and K+ than Ca2+ and Mg2+ and also
    enhanced the decrease of EC and SAR within the soil profile. Impact of sodic soil
    reclamation, productivity, and economic issues Reclamation of salt-affected (sodic)
    soils is a universal approach for growing vegetation and is accepted worldwide
    (Abrol et al., 1988; Hasanuzzaman et al., 2014; Sharma & Bhargava, 1981; Paulraj
    & Muraligopal, 2013; Srivastava & Kumar, 2015; Kaledhonkar et al., (2018); EOS
    Data Analytics, 2021). Recent reviews have indicated various methods of reclamation
    using chemical amendments such as gypsum, press mud, and flue gas desulfurized
    gypsum (FGDG) and biological amendments such as biochar, vermicompost, humic substances,
    and vinegar residues, for a wide range of sodic soils showing varying exchangeable
    sodium percentage (ESP), pH, and Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) level (Chaganti
    & Crohn, 2015; He et al., 2022; Toth, 2022). Conservation agricultural practices
    have also been used for the sustenance of reclaimed sodic soils using crop residues
    and minimum tillage practices (Sundha et al., 2020; Raj Kumar et al., 2022; Jat
    et al., 2022). Based on the improvement of average yield in rice–wheat crops,
    Thimmappa et al. (2014) have reported the distribution of reclaimed sodic land
    (67.6%) in 16 districts of Uttar Pradesh state. Reclaiming strongly sodic soils
    (pHs > 10.0) using gypsum applications (12.5 t ha−1) in IGP has revealed yield
    advantages of rice and wheat from zero to 4.2 and 1.8 t ha−1, respectively, in
    the first year of soil reclamation and increased to 6.1 and 2.5 t ha−1, respectively,
    in the fifth year of reclamation (Sharma, 1986; Sharma et al., 2015). Based on
    a farm scale study (123 ha) and 197 farmers in Uttar Pradesh state, IGP, Singh
    et al., (2022) have shown a gain in the agricultural potential of sodic soils
    and improved smallholder food security through the integration of gypsum, pressmud,
    and salt-tolerant varieties. Sheoran et al., 2021 have shown an integrated use
    of salt tolerant rice varieties and matching agronomic practices to manage sodic
    soils for better productivity and farmer’s income in the Haryana State of IGP.
    ICAR (2022) have reported a participatory method for sodic soil reclamation through
    the integration of gypsum, pressmud, and sodicity tolerant varieties at farmer’s
    field. The results showed that soil reclamation has reduced yield loss of rice
    by 64%, 35%, 85%, and 58% in moderate-, slight-, strong-, and severe-sodic soils,
    respectively. The yield losses for wheat were 12%, 40%, 66%, and 47% for all categories
    of soils, respectively. Experiments of agroforestry plantations (Prosopis juliflora)
    have reported an increase in plant height (127%), basal diameters (180%), nutrient
    availability, and infiltration rates (21 to 18%) following gypsum application
    at 7.5 t ha−1 and 15 t ha−1 (Singh et al., 1989). Murtaza et al., (2009) and Jamat
    (2007) have reported prominent socioeconomic impacts (equivalent to US dollars)
    of soil reclamation followed by rice–wheat production considering the costs of
    field operations, other input costs for fertilizer and chemicals, farm manure,
    and gypsum. Globally, the UN (2021) has warned that the livelihood insecurity
    of 1.5 billion people may occur due to an irrigation expansion from 20 to 50%
    that caused an expansion of soil salinity areas and deterioration of soil fertility.
    Monitoring of soil salinity and soil sodicity Space-borne multispectral and temporal
    data has been used as a reliable tool to generate soil inventories based on spatial
    characterization of soil salinity. Periodic monitoring of soil salinity in IGP
    (India) has been reported by Abrol and Bhumbla (1971), NRSC (2008), Mandal et
    al., (2010), and Mandal (2019). Landsat TM data was used for systematic mapping
    of soil salinity (NRSA, 1997) using an integrated approach of image interpretation,
    ground truth, and laboratory studies. With the advances in remote sensing data
    quality, the mapping of soil salinity was achieved with higher accuracy. IRS (Indian
    Remote Sensing) 1C (ResurceSAT) Linear Imaging Self Scanning LISS III data in
    visible and infrared ranges have been successfully used for mapping soil salinity
    at state and district levels and also in irrigation command areas (NRSC, 2021).
    Surface soil salinity and surface ponding (waterlogging) have been mapped successfully
    using a combination of bands in visible and infrared ranges (Mandal & Sharma,
    2001). Integrating ground truth data with satellite image interpretation has improved
    the mapping accuracy by authenticating mixed pixels associated with soil salinity
    at subsurface depth, waterlogging, and cropped areas under irrigation. Remote
    sensing is also used as a potential tool to develop temporal databases for assessing
    spatial changes due to land reclamation. Interpretation of IRS imagery on a 1:1
    M scale during 1975 (pre-reclamation) and Landsat TM imagery as False Color Composites
    (FCCs) on a 1:250,000 scale during 1984 (post-reclamation) revealed a decline
    (8.3%) of sodic soil areas following implementation of statewide land reclamation
    programs that transformed salt crusts into the productive cropped areas in IGP
    (CSSRI, 1985; Sharma, 1999; Sharma & Bhargava, 1987; Sharma et al., 2000). An
    attempt was made to map the spatial extent and characteristics of salt-affected
    soils in Haryana State to update salinity status at the post- reclamation stage,
    compile soil salinity data for district-level planning, and also assess the temporal
    changes (with the past data) of salt-affected soils in irrigated areas of the
    canal and ground-water sources (tube wells). Study area The study area (Haryana
    State) lies between 27°39′ N 74°27′ E and 30°55′ N 77°36′ E. It covers 44212 km2
    with 22 administrative units (districts). The soils are alluvial and aeolian types,
    located in arid to semiarid and subhumid climates. The cultivable area covers
    85% of the Total Geographical Area (TGA), the areas under forest are 3.8%, and
    the barren and uncultivable lands cover 2.4%. The primary irrigation source is
    from canals (49%) and groundwater (50%), and the net irrigated areas covered 71%
    of TGA in Haryana. Principal crops include paddy and wheat, besides cotton, pearl
    millet, sugarcane, sunflower, and pulses. Sesbania aculeate (Dhaincha) is grown
    to improve soil physical properties, reduce salt hazards, and support nutrient
    availability and as an organic carbon source in salt-affected soils and poor quality
    (saline or alkali) groundwater under arid and semiarid climatic zones (Swarup,
    1987; IAEA, 1995; Murtaza et al., 2015; Mandal et al., 2016a, 2016b; Zhao et al.,
    2022). Alluvial soils (old, recent, and active plains) were developed from Ghaggar,
    Yamuna, and its tributaries (Saraswati, Chautang, and Dangri). Aeolian, aeofluvial,
    and fluvio-aeolian plains are distributed in the south and west of the state (Sachdev
    et al., 1995). Prolonged use of salty groundwater sources for growing crops caused
    secondary enrichment of salts in soil profiles. Flow method of irrigation through
    the Western Yamuna (WY) and Bhakra canals caused surface ponding as seasonal (Lsp1)
    and permanent (Lsp2), high water table depth, and subsurface waterlogging (Lsw)
    in poorly drained areas (NRSC, 2007). Saline soils and poor-quality (saline or
    sodic) groundwater are also used for operating brick kilns (Hbk). The discharges
    of toxic waste materials as industrial effluents (Hie) from thermal power plants
    have also caused degradation of the soil ecosystem. Sand mining (Hmd), partially
    stabilized dune (Edp2), and riverine sand (Hmd) have prompted the loss of fertile
    top soils on good agricultural lands, respectively. Using a climate model, Daloz
    et al. (2021) have projected the yield losses of wheat ranging from 1 to 8%, due
    to increase in temperature and also expected the higher yield losses, ranging
    from 4 to 36%, due to an irrigation over the IGP. Bhatt et al., (2016) have cautioned
    about the sustainability rice–wheat cropping system due to its higher water-,
    labor-, capital-, and energy-intensive practices in IGP. Its impact was reflected
    in the deterioration of soil structure, declining groundwater level, and lesser
    land and water productivity in the IGP. Suggested measures such as RCT (resource
    conservation technique) that includes zero tillage, laser-based land leveling,
    and control of soil matric potential, and suitable practices such as bed planting,
    direct seeding, mechanical transplanting of rice, and crop diversification can
    be substitutes for traditional agricultural practices. Narjary et al. (2014) analyzed
    long-term rainfall data between 1972 and 2010 from Karnal weather station in IGP
    that has indicated a mean rainfall of 757.6 mm with a high degree of variation
    (CV = 34.3%), a deficit rainfall in 6 years (18–57% lower than average) during
    2001–2010, a normal for 2 years and an excess rainfall (9–70% higher than average)
    for 2 years. The rainfall and rainy days declined by 13% and 20% over long-term
    averages (LPA). It has also shown a rise in groundwater depths by 2.32 m and 3.16
    m between 2009 and 2010, respectively. CSSRI (1997) has reported the extent of
    waterlogged (0.275 million ha) areas in canal commands of Haryana which is at
    par (0.249 million ha) with the earlier report by the MOWR (1991). A recent report
    has identified the critical problems of waterlogging and soil salinity in a significant
    area (393096 ha, 9%) distributed in nine districts of Haryana State (Moharana
    et al., 2019; www.indianexpress.com: 23rd August, 2023). As a follow-up action,
    the Government of Haryana has planned a systematic reclamation program initially
    for waterlogged and saline lands (10170 ha) during 2021–2022. A web portal also
    facilitates advisory for farmers to proceed for soil reclamation (Datta et al.,
    2000, www.agriharyana.gov.in/hopp). ICAR-Central Soil Salinity Research Institute,
    Karnal (Haryana), India has also accomplished the reclamation of waterlogged and
    saline soils under the Indo-Dutch collaborative Project (IDNP, 2002; www.cssri.res.in).
    The distribution of salt-affected soils in Haryana State has indicated the largest
    areas (74%) in the rainfall zone of 600 mm followed by 800 mm (14%) and 400 mm
    (9%), respectively (Mandal et al., 2011a). The district-wise groundwater table
    depths data between 1974 and 2015 indicated the fluctuations in the groundwater
    table depths. The decline of groundwater table depths is prominent in the highly
    industrial areas in Gurgaon (− 20.10 m) and Faridabad (− 9.95 m); the intensively
    cultivated areas in Kurukshetra (− 24.32 m), Karnal (− 12.68 m), and Panipat (− 13.04
    m); the low-rainfall zones and groundwater dependent agricultural practices in
    Mahendragarh (− 28.85 m), Fatehabad (− 13.78 m), Kaithal (− 18.75 m), and Rewari
    (− 12.88 m) districts, respectively. The rise of water table depth is prominent
    in the Hisar district (+ 7.74 m) (http://agriharyana.gov.in, CGWB, 2022). Gupta
    et al., (1994) have reported the distribution of poor-quality groundwater in India,
    segregating areas in saline water, high SAR saline water, and alkali waters for
    further agricultural use and reclamation needs. Poor quality groundwater (60–81%)
    is common in arid areas (Manchanda, 1976) pertaining to the agroecological zone
    I (Sachdev et al., 1995) in Haryana. The groundwater analysis of quaternary aquifers
    in Jhajjar district, Haryana, India, has revealed unsuitable for drinking purposes
    due to high concentration of fluoride, chloride, salinity, and TDS (Total Dissolve
    Solids) which is related to the weathering of clay-rich formations rich in fluoride
    and grey micaceous sand formations (Gupta & Misra, 2018). The other degraded areas,
    possessing saline soils and underlying poor-quality (saline or sodic) ground-water
    in arid zones, are commonly used for operating brick kilns (Hbk) instead of lying
    barren or kept fallow. The discharges of toxic waste materials as industrial effluents
    (Hie) from thermal power plants have caused degradation of the soil ecosystem
    (Bharti et al., 2013). Sand mining (Hmd), partially stabilized dune (Edp2), and
    riverine sand (Hmd) have prompted the loss of fertile top soils on good agricultural
    lands, respectively (Mandal, 2022a). Recently, Sklenicka et al., (2020) have analyzed
    trends in soil degradations using socioeconomic status of land owners and land
    use matter. The influence of land use characteristics was a dominant factor over
    land owners. The large farm size and non-family character of the farm are prominent
    degradation-promoting factors. The old age, absence of post-secondary education,
    and renting out of their land are other important factors. The owner’s gender
    and the distance of the owner’s place of residence from the plots studies are
    other factors promoting soil degradation. Based on the return to investment made
    for alkali land reclamation technology in India, Tripathi (2013) has revealed
    a high benefit–cost ratio (7.83) and a significant internal rate of return (65.46%)
    proved alkali land reclamation technology as highly remunerative, technically
    sound and economically viable. Materials and methods Data used Indian Remote Sensing
    (IRS) (Resource SAT) LISS III data (www.nrsc.gov.in) with moderate spatial (23.5

    November 2018, 12th November 2018, and 16th November 2018) were used for mapping
    soil salinity. The Survey of India (SOI) (www.surveyofindia.gov.in) topographical
    maps on a 1:50,000 scale, were used to prepare a base map of the study area. Software
    ILWIS (ver. 3.3) was used for geo-referencing and developing thematic layers for
    spatial and creating non-spatial data sets in a GIS framework for spatial analysis.
    The supporting datasets such as crops, soil, land, and water quality data (Manchanda,
    1976; Statistical Handbook, Government of Haryana, 1995; Sachdev et al., 1995;
    HSMITC, 2005; Gupta, 2010) were used as references. The supplementary data on
    climate, groundwater quality, crop yields, and socioeconomic studies (Datta et
    al., 2000; Mandal et al., 2018; Mitra et al., 2021; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2021)
    were also used as supporting information. The salt-affected soil maps on a 1:250,000
    scale (NRSA, 1997) were used as primary soil information. Related data such as
    soil/land degradations and desertification (NRSC, 2005; Ajai et al., 2009; NRSC,
    2019a, 2019b; Sreenivas et al., 2021) were also used as supporting datasets for
    comparison purposes. Geo-referencing and digitization for base map preparation
    The topographical maps were geo-referenced to relate with real-world coordinates
    using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projections (Datum WGS1984, Ellipsoid
    WGS 84, Zone 43). The boundaries (state/district), infrastructure (road/railway),
    irrigation/drainage (canal/river), and settlements (state, district HQ, and villages)
    were digitized to prepare thematic layers in a GIS framework and were overlaid
    to develop a base map of the study area using ILWIS software (Mandal & Sharma,
    2005). Image interpretation and mapping of soil salinity The pre-processed (geometric
    and radiometric corrected) IRS imageries were geo-referenced using UTM projection
    and False Color Composites (FCC) were prepared using a combination of bands such
    as NIR, R, and G for FCC-B321 and SWIR, NIR, and R for FCC-432. The seasonal data
    were interpreted to assess the seasonal dynamics of soil salinity, waterlogging,
    and cropped areas (Fig. 1). Visual analysis was done based on the tone, texture,
    and patterns of the image features depicted on the images and interpreted units
    were digitized following standard guidelines using an ILWIS software (ver. 3.3)
    (Colwell, 1996; Mandal et al., 2011). The spectral data were also used for spatial
    characterization of surface soil moisture, vegetation patterns, salt crusts, riverine
    sand, sand mining, and partially stabilized dunes (Mandal, 2016, 2022a, 2022b).
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI = (Reflectance in B3 − Reflectance
    in B2)/(Reflectance in B3 + Reflectance in B2)) (NRSC, 2014) was used to distinguish
    between barren/fallow and cultivated soils and also normal and stressed crops
    (Fig. 2). The complex spectral properties for closely associated salt, sand, patchy
    crop and waterlogged areas (Figs. 1 and 3) were characterized by field studies.
    Soil sampling sites were identified based on the visual/digital analysis. A hand-held
    GPS was used to locate the sampling sites and were transferred to a GIS database
    that was stored as a point map (Fig. 1). The image-interpreted units were delineated
    using the on-screen digitization method in GIS (Fig. 4). These were edited to
    improve accuracy and generate the polygons of delineated soil units using a vector
    model (segment to polygon) in ILWIS (Mandal, 2016). These units were linked to
    an attribute table to prepare a relational database between the spatial (maps)
    and attribute (soil properties) datasets. Map legends were prepared based on the
    physicochemical properties (pH, EC, and ESP values) of salt-affected soils. The
    interpreted units for salinized areas were integrated with the thematic layers
    of the base map, soil sampling sites, and physicochemical characteristics of soils
    in GIS to prepare a composite database of salt-affected soils (Fig. 4) (Dwivedi,
    1994; Mandal & Sharma, 2011a; Mandal, 2022a). Based on the spatial coverage of
    the interpreted units (usually small), and considering scale limitations, distinguishing
    colors for mapped units (that represent different soil salinity classes) could
    not be displayed in Fig. 4. Thus, a unit single (black) color was preferred to
    show the locations, spatial coverage and merged characteristics of all categories
    of salt-affected soils, following standard protocol. The details of image features
    and soil physicochemical properties for classified soil units are presented in
    Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The area statistics of soil polygons were generated
    to show spatial coverage of salt-affected soils using ILWIS.GIS. These are presented
    in Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6. Fig. 1 IRS imagery March 2009–2010 for a part of the

    in selected districts of the Haryana State Full size table Characterization of
    soil samples Ground truth studies were conducted to verify and authenticate image
    interpretation units with field characteristics. During the field survey, important
    properties such as surface soil salinity and waterlogging status, seasonal salinity
    status and behavior, topography, irrigation/drainage, and crops/cropping practices
    were studied to decide sites for studying and collecting soil and water samples.
    GPS was used to locate and register sites for ground truth and soil profiles studies
    and also to collect groundwater samples (8 Nos.) from tube wells (commonly used
    for irrigation in agriculture) (vide data for other samples in Gupta, 2010; Manchanda,
    1976; Mandal, 2016, 2019; Mandal & Sharma, 2005; Mandal et al., 2013; Mandal et
    al., 2016a, 2016b; Mandal, 2022a, 2022b; Mandal, 2023). During field studies,
    based on field scale visible impacts on crop productivity, salinity in soil profiles
    and environmental impacts such as pollution in the surface water bodies, aquaculture
    practices, and saturation of salts in the root zones of soil and plants (based
    on soil and plant analysis data), the water samples were collected for chemical
    characterization and quality appraisal. Based on the variations of chemical properties
    such as pH (sodicity/alkalinity), EC (salinity), RSC (sodic with RSC > 2.5 me
    L−1), and SAR (> 10) the representative (8 Nos.), water samples that showed critical
    status for irrigation purposes such as high sodicity, salinity, RSC, and SAR and
    are unfit for agriculture are presented in Table 7. Based on the visual image
    analysis of soils that showed mixed pixels for intricate associations of soil,
    water, and crops (Fig. 1); sandy surface (Fig. 3); abandoned sand in river beds
    (riverine sands, Tms), sand dunes (Edp2), and sand mining areas (Hmd); and brick
    kilns (Hbk) and industrial effluent affected areas (Hie), depth-wise (0.0–2.0
    m) soil samples were collected from 886 soil sampling sites (Fig. 4). Each sample
    thus represents 381 ha (out of 337906 ha) of degraded areas. The soil samples
    were analyzed for physicochemical properties (Table 2) such as pHs, ECe, soluble
    cations and anions (CO32−, HCO3−, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl−, and SO42−), organic carbon,
    CaCO3, CEC, ESP, and soil texture (Richards, 1954; Jackson, 1986), and water samples
    were analyzed for RSC (Residual Sodium Carbonate) = [(CO32−  + HCO3−) − (Ca2+
     + Mg2+)] and SAR (Sodium Adsorption Ratio) = [Na+/{(Ca2+  + Mg2+)/2}1/2] for
    quality appraisal (Table 7). The analytical methods for determining carbonates
    (CO32−  + HCO3−) and Ca2+  + Mg2+ and Na+ are the same as those used for the determination
    of soluble cations and anions from soil-saturated paste extracts following standard
    methods described in detail by Richards (1954). Table 7 Quality of representative
    water samples from the Haryana State Full size table Based on the pHs (pH of saturated
    paste), ECe (electrical conductivity of saturated extract expressed as dS m−1),
    and ESP (exchangeable sodium percentage expressed as %), soils were classified
    as saline (ECe > 4 dS m−1, pHs < 8.5); sodic (pHs > 8.5, ECe < 4 dSm−1, ESP > 15),
    and saline-sodic (pHs > 8.5, ECe > 4.0 dS m−1 and ESP > 15), respectively (NRSC,
    2007; Richards, 1954; USDA, 2014). These were further categorized to assess the
    degrees of limitations such as slight (ECe 4–8 dSm−1, pHs 8.5–9.0, ESP < 15),
    moderate (ECe 8–30 dSm−1, pHs 9.0–9.8, ESP 15–40) and strong (ECe > 30 dSm−1,
    pHs > 9.8, ESP > 40), respectively. Based on the standard plots between the electrical
    conductivity of saturation extract (ECe dS m−1) and individual salt concentration
    (me L−1), salt contents were further classified as low, medium, and high, respectively
    (Richards, 1954; Szabolcs, 1989). The reclamation and management options of salt-affected
    soils were also suggested based on the gypsum requirement (G. R. in tons ha−1)
    values (G. R. = G × 1.92, where G = 2 (S-T) me L−1, where S and T are concentrations
    of Ca2+ in saturated gypsum solution and Ca2+  + Mg2+ in the filtrate). A quick
    method using GypCal can also be used as an alternate qualitative method for field
    scale determinations. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gypcal.shyamsanginfosys.com)
    at the field scale. Results and discussion Spatial characterization (image interpretation)
    and field authentication of degraded soils Characterization of sodic soils—natural
    and anthropogenic (sodic groundwater) origin Strongly sodic (white to yellowish
    white tones, irregular shape), waterlogged soils (dark blue to black tones, irregular
    shape), and normal (un-affected) crops (bright red tone, continuous) were easily
    detected based on their strong signatures in the visible and infrared bands (B432)
    (Fig. 1). Strongly salt-affected soils were clearly identified as barren patches
    in the old alluvial plains of Ghaggar and Saraswati rivers (Fig. 1, Table 1).
    Mixed tones for dark blue to black tones and scattered red to dark red tones (Fig.
    1) indicated the association of waterlogging in moderate to slight salt-affected
    soils and patchy cropped areas (Table 1). FCC (B432) showed higher contrast and
    clear boundaries of surface waterlogged soils classified as slight (Lsp1) and
    moderate (Lsp2) and subsurface waterlogged soils (high water table depth-Lsw)
    during the post-monsoon season (Fig. 1) (NRSC, 2007). Waterlogged salt-affected
    soils (Fig. 1) were also located in the Paleo-channels of river Saraswati with
    restricted natural drainage conditions. Figure 3 shows the intricate association
    of salt-affected soils in areas with overburdened sand such as sand dunes, partially
    stabilized dunes, sand mines, and riverine sands and also causes difficulty in
    delineating salt-affected soils due to similar spectral signatures (Rao et al.,
    1995, McBride, 2022). Seasonal data for NDVI (Fig. 2) have facilitated in segregation
    of strongly salt-affected soils, fallow sandy soils, and urban areas as barren
    surfaces (showing negative values) and those soil units located in the cropped
    areas (positive values) based on the varying spectral signatures of crops under
    stress due to salinity, waterlogging, industrial effluents, and irrigated areas
    using poor quality (saline/sodic) groundwater. Prolonged irrigation with salty
    groundwater has prompted the evolution of secondary salinity, low permeability,
    infiltration, and poor drainage conditions in moderate to fine-texture soils at
    subsurface depths in the Ghaggar basin (Mandal et al., 2016a, 2016b). Spatial
    associations of moderate to strong sodic soils, patchy crop growth, and seasonal
    waterlogging were identified in IRS data (March and October) which was authenticated
    by field studies. Irrigation with salty groundwater also caused the evolution
    of surface salt crusts appearing as scattered patches within the wheat and rice-growing
    areas. IRS data has depicted features showing higher energy absorption (dark color)
    due to higher moisture content at surface soils. Ground truth studies have shown
    slow percolation of water, nutrients (low infiltration and permeability), also
    restricted root growth, and poor natural drainage (Fig. 1) due to salt-enriched
    soil profile and fine soil texture (silt/clay) layers at subsurface depths (P3,
    P4, P5, P7, and P8). At places, thick salt crust and sodic groundwater were also
    detected in strongly sodic soils (P6 and P7) under forest cover in the Ghaggar
    (Saraswati forest) and Yamuna (Seonti reserve forest) river basins. IRS (March)
    data also indicated the presence of alkali soils, seasonal waterlogging, and cropped
    areas along the Markanda plain (P14). It showed mixed spectral signatures of sodic
    soils and dark tones of soil moisture at surface soils due to the temporary waterlogging
    along the paleo-channel of river Chautang (P5) (Fig. 1). The use of sodic groundwater
    for irrigation in arid areas prompted development moderate to strongly sodic soils
    that appeared as white patches of barren salt crust along the Ghaggar plain (Fig.
    2) (Mandal et al., 2016a, 2016b). Tiny white patches interspersed with red to
    dark red tones of crops are typical features that influenced the moderately sodic
    soils (Fig. 1) (Mandal & Sharma, 2011b). IRS imageries have also identified red
    to dark tones for moderate to good crop cover for rice and wheat crops, higher
    crop yield (> 50%) and intermittent salt patches within the old alluvial plain
    of central Haryana (Panipat, Karnal and Kurukshetra districts) (Fig. 2). Soil
    profile studies (P2, P8, and P9) have confirmed these as reclaimed sodic soils
    (Mandal, 2016). Slightly sodic soils (P12) showed very good vegetative crop growth
    (Howari, 2003) but low productivity due to crop damage at the maturity stage (Mandal,
    2016). Characterization of irrigated saline soils in arid sandy plains Canal irrigation
    is a common practice to meet the water requirement of crops mainly wheat, cotton,
    sorghum, and pearl millet in the arid sandy plain of NW Haryana. Waterlogging
    and soil salinization were identified in the low-lying flats/depressions showing
    poor to imperfect internal drainage (Dwivedi, 1994; Dehaan & Taylor, 2002; Mandal
    & Sharma, 2010). Continuous irrigation using the flow method in poorly drained
    areas often caused the rise inwater table depth and salt inflictions. The salt
    concentration was higher in the post-monsoon season due to salt transport by advancing
    water table depth (Mandal & Sharma, 2001). Repeated wet and dry cycles favored
    salt precipitation and higher salt concentration during the dry period (Mandal
    & Sharma, 2001). Critically affected irrigated areas in canal commands were identified
    in old and recent alluvial (with sand dunes), aeolian, fluvio-aeolian, and aeo-fluvial
    plains in the west. Image analysis has identified prominent areas of waterlogged
    and soil salinity in the (Bhakra) canal command (CSSRI, 2015). Significant areas
    of waterlogging, soil salinity, and sodicity were also located in the old alluvial
    and sandy arid plains of central and south Haryana (Sharma & Mondal, 2006). Soil
    salinity and alkalinity were identified in soil and groundwater of Haryana (west
    and south) in the Aravalli pediments; fluvio-aeolian, old and recent alluvial
    plains, and sand dunes (Chinchmalatpure et al., 2016; Sethi et al., 2012, 2018).
    Spatial characterization of other soil degradations in Haryana Visual analysis
    of IRS LISS III data (Table 1, Figs. 1 and 2) revealed the prominent areas of
    surface ponding (slight-Lsp1 and moderate-Lsp2), subsurface waterlogging (Lsw),
    brick kiln (Hbk), industrial effluent affected area (Hie), partially stabilized
    dune (Edp2), riverine sand (Tms) and sand mining (Hmd) (Mandal, 2022a; NRSC, 2007).
    Higher energy absorption (blue/black tones) in B432 imageries and differential
    extents during pre- and post-monsoon seasons (March and October) was used to characterize
    surface and subsurface waterlogged areas (Dwivedi, 1994; Dwivedi & Sreenivas,
    2002; Mandal, 2019, 2022a; SAC, 2021). Small areas of riverine sand and partially
    stabilized dunes were identified by bare surfaces and scattered bushes and grasses
    along the river course and in the agricultural fields (Mandal, 2022a). Brick kiln
    areas were characterized as barren, with definite shape and sizes (small to medium)
    and clear boundaries. Mining areas were detected as tiny bare patches within the
    cropped areas (Singh et al., 2007). Surface features such as barren (no vegetation),
    clear boundaries, and surface ponding (dark color liquid wastes) were characteristic
    of the industrial effluent affected areas. Typical features of stressed vegetation
    in varying red tones and patchy and intermittent white and black tones for salt
    and higher moisture content at the surface soils are also common surface characteristics
    of these degraded soils (Mandal, 2022b). Physicochemical properties of soils Table
    2 shows the physicochemical properties of some selected benchmark salt-affected
    soils in Haryana. Soil profiles (P1 and P2) were collected from the experimental
    farm at ICAR- CSSRI Karnal Haryana India. P1 was strongly saline-sodic soil during
    1970 (Bhumbla et al., 1970) and is currently under the natural vegetative covers
    such as trees, shrubs, and grasses. The pH of surface soil (0–0.15 m) has been
    reduced from 10.5 to currently at 9.0 while the pH of the soils at subsurface
    depths (up to 1.5 m) is still higher at 10.0. ECe was 102. 3 dS m−1 at surface
    soils during 1970 and is reduced to 0.9 and 3.1 dS m−1 at surface and subsurface
    depths, respectively. Organic carbon status and ESP values have indicated the
    reduction of sodicity and an improvement in soil fertility (Basak et al., 2021).
    Similarly, pH of P2 has improved from 9.2 (Sso2, sodic-moderate) to 8.3 (Sso1,
    sodic-slight) and EC has reduced from 14.8 to 0.6 dS m−1 after reclamation using
    gypsum and is currently used for rice–wheat-mustard crops. P3 was a natural unamended
    sodic (strong) soil close to an ORP (Operational Research Project) area (active
    between 1978 to 1991) and was used to develop technology for yield sustainability,
    adaptability of validity studies on arable crops such as rice and wheat; growth
    performance studies on trees (agroforestry) and grass species and also for demonstration
    in the farmer’s field with similar agroclimatic and water quality conditions within
    the IGP. It is a strongly sodic soil characterized by high pH (10–11), ECe (4–15
    dS m−1), and high ESP (45–97). The alkalinity arises due to moderate to high soluble
    carbonates (22–176 me L−1) of Na (45–270 me L−1) and nodules and concretions of
    CaCO3 (1.0–16.0%). It is a fine texture soil (silt loam at the surface to silt
    clay loam at lower depths) and poorly (natural) drained and shows low permeability
    (Levy & Shainberg, 2005; Sharma et al., 2007). P4 is a typical sodic soil irrigated
    by sodic ground (RSC) in the Ghaggar Plain. It showed slight to moderate soil
    pH (8.4 to 9.1) and the sodicity is largely influenced by the Na+ (14–21 me L−1),
    Ca2+  + Mg2+ (8.0 me L−1), carbonates (2.0–7.5 me L−1), and ESP (33–42) (Basak
    et al., 2022). Calcrete (CaCO3) (1–16%) and fine soil texture (silt loam, silt
    clay loam) have favored soil compaction and caused low infiltration, less dissolution
    of nutrients, and low water availability at the root zone depths of soil and also
    caused poor crop productivity. P5 is a highly degraded (strongly sodic) soil showing
    high pH (< 10.5) and high ESP (74–83). The severe degradation is attributed to
    the presence of dominantly higher carbonate (4.5–6.0 me L−1) and sodium (16–45
    me L−1) contents (Chhabra, 2004). P6 also represents a severely degraded (Sss3,
    saline-sodic-strong) soil and showed high pH (10–11) and salt content (1.2–7.6
    dS m−1) dominated by soluble carbonates (5.7–68.5 me L−1) and Na (11–67 me L−1).
    High CEC (21–26 c mol. (p+) kg−1) is due to finer soil texture (loam, clay loam,
    and silt loam). In the absence of a good-quality water source (canal or GW), P6
    is currently used for forestry plantations and is protected in a reserve forest,
    managed by the state forest department (http://haryanaforest.gov.in). P7 is a
    reclaimed sodic soil (pH 9.2–11.0) with underlying sodic groundwater in Ghaggar
    plain, currently used partly for forestry and is also used for rice–wheat production
    with limited yields. P8 is a reclaimed sodic soil in Ghaggar plain that shows
    neutral pH 7.1 and ESP varies from 18 at surface soil to strongly sodic (pH 10.0,
    ESP 71) soil at subsurface depths. The presence of carbonates (3.0–5.0 me L−1),
    Na+ (17–51 me L−1), Ca2+  + Mg2+ (4.0–6.0 me L−1), Cl− (7.0–8.0 me L−1), SO42−
    (2.0–13.0 me L−1), and CaCO3 (0.3–1.3%) are typical properties that determine
    sodicity level and soil health. Seasonal waterlogging occurred periodically due
    to fine soil texture (loam to clay loam) and the soil is currently used for rice–wheat
    crops with low yield. P9 is a partly reclaimed sodic soil (pH 9.6) at surface
    and strongly sodic soil (pH 11.0) at subsurface depths while the strong sodicity
    due to carbonates (25.0–119.0 me L−1) of Na (117.0–193.0 me L−1), the presence
    of Cl− (20.0–44.0 me L−1), precipitated CaCO3 (0.6–1.2). Finer soil texture (silt
    loam to silt clay loam) have led to the development of a complex soil (saline-sodic)
    characteristics and a low response during gypsum-based soil reclamation practice.
    The soil profile is currently used for medicinal and aromatic plants in an Herbal
    Garden, which is managed by the State Forest Department, Govt. of Haryana (http://haryanaforest.gov.in).
    P10 (a barren community land used for cattle grazing in villages) represents a
    strongly saline (ECe 10.0–17.0 dS m−1) soil (Ssa3) and is dominated by Na+ (45.0–103.0
    me L−1), Ca2+  + Mg2+ (82.0–127.0 me L−1), Cl− (70.0–200.0 me L−1), and SO42−
    (67–86 me L−1). It is an irrigated, waterlogged (Lsp2), impervious, calcareous
    (CaCO3: 0.4–9.0%). Fine texture (sandy clay loam) soil that facilitates a favorable
    environment for the salt enrichment and further sodicity development in soil profiles
    (Sharma & Bhargava, 1978). P11 is a barren, irrigated, strongly saline (ECe 11–46
    dS m−1), slightly sodic (pH 8.7–8.8), coarse texture (loamy sand-sandy loam) and
    waterlogged soil (Lsw) with high water table depth (WTD < 1.5 m). The area represents
    saline groundwater, abundant brick kilns, an arid climate, and lower topography.
    Salt composition showed dominant ions such as Na+ (70–472 me L−1), Ca2+  + Mg2+
    (80–180 me L−1), Cl− (268–1210 me L−1), SO42− (121–739 me L−1), and carbonates
    (HCO3− 14–40 me L−1). P12 is a slightly sodic soil (pH 9.0–9.5, ESP 21–37) showing
    an irrigation induced soil degradation due to the enrichment of Na+ (14–24 me
    L−1), Ca2+  + Mg2+ (4–6 me L−1), CO32− (2–10 me L−1), Cl− (4–7 me L−1), and SO42−
    (0.5–10.0 me L−1) ions and the presence of CaCO3 (0.5–1.8%) and fine (sandy clay
    loam to clay loam) soil textural strata. It is irrigated with sodic groundwater
    and is subjected to seasonal waterlogging that resulted in relatively lower yield
    of wheat, cotton, and rice (Mandal et al., 2016a, 2016b). P13 is a strongly saline-sodic
    soil (pH 8.7–10, ECe 7–26 dS m−1, ESP 29–59) that showed high contents of Na+
    (92–303 me L−1), Ca2+  + Mg2 (8–38 me L−1), Cl− (50–180 me L−1), and SO42− (49–123
    me L−1) ions. The high sodicity is attributed to the significant quantity of Calcretes
    (concretions of CaCO3) (0.3–2.7%) at 1.2 m depth and loam to clay loam soil texture.
    P14 is a moderate to strongly sodic soil (pH 9.8–9.4, ESP 39–42) located in the
    Markanda River Plain and is currently used for brick kiln purposes. Due to the
    paucity of good quality groundwater for irrigation, agriculture was not economically
    feasible, while sodic groundwater (with RSC) can be alternatively used for making
    bricks in brick kilns. The ionic composition indicated the dominance of carbonates
    (10–8 me L−1), Na+ (14–15 me L−1), Ca2+  + Mg2+ (7–5 me L−1) apart from Cl− (10–8
    me L−1) and SO42− (8–4 me L−1). The precipitated CaCO3 (1.4–1.2%) and loam texture
    are other soil properties actively participating in soil salinization processes.
    Spatial and temporal dynamics of soil salinity Temporal assessment of soil salinity
    problems Table 3 shows the temporal changes due to soil salinity estimates in
    19 districts of Haryana State. Based on the degrees of limitations such as slight
    (1), moderate (2), and strong (3), the spatial estimates for saline (Ssa), sodic
    (Sso), and saline-sodic (Sss) soils were prepared. Using the differentials estimates
    during 1997 and 2017, reclamation effects on salt-affected soils were evaluated
    based on the decrease of spatial coverage. The spatial areas of saline soils have
    increased significantly by 41.2% from 1997 to 2017, apparently due to the increase
    (51.35%) of irrigated areas in Haryana between 1966–1967 and 2013–2014 (Narjary
    et al., 2022). A steady rise in water table depth annually by 1 m also cautioned
    the sustainability of the rice–wheat cropping system (Bhatt et al., 2016; Narjary,
    et al., 2019; Singh, 2000; Gupta & Misra, 2018; Kiran & Singh, 2021; GOH, 2022).
    As a result, the slightly (16.8%), moderately (22.6%), and strongly (2.2%) saline
    soils areas have been increased notably. Using poor quality ground water in central,
    western, and southern Haryana (Kishor et al., 2022), a marked increase of soil
    salinity was noted in Jhajjar (8.2% Ssa1and 1.68% Ssa2) and Hisar districts (4.0%,
    5.2, and 1.8% Ssa1, Ssa2and Ssa3), respectively. A slight increase (1.8%) in salinity-affected
    areas was noted in the Sonepat district, which is mostly confined to slightly
    saline (Ssa1) areas (1.3%). The sodic soils’ areas for Sso1 (8.7%), Sso2 (24.7%),
    and Sso3 (18.2%) are reduced remarkably from 1997 to 2017 (Table 3), respectively.
    Sodic areas were notably declined in Karnal (8.8%), and Kurukshetra (1.6%), respectively.
    Prominent areas of Sso2 and Sso3 have been reclaimed in Karnal (5.2%, 2.5%) and
    Kurukshetra (3.7%, 1.5%) districts, respectively. The areas of Sso1 in Kurukshetra
    (2.2%) and Kaithal (1.5%) districts have increased due to the use of sodic groundwater
    for irrigation (Sharma & Abrol, 1980; Sharma et al., 1976). Significant areas
    of sodic soils have been reclaimed in the Panipat (13.5%) district. The areas
    of Sso3 (9.1%) and Sso2 (4.3%) have reduced significantly. Large areas of sodic
    soils in Jind (9.4%), Faridabad (2.5%), Rohtak (1.6%), Sirsa (1.6%), and Sonepat
    (13.4%) districts have been reclaimed. Prominent areas of sodic soils (Sso2, 6.7%;
    Sso3, 4.7%; and Sso1, 1.9%) have been reclaimed in Sonepat districts. Fatehabad
    (1.2%) and Ambala (0.35%) districts have shown slight changes after reclamation.
    Prognosis (emerging areas) of salinity has occurred in the irrigated areas of
    Jhajjar (2.4%) and Mewat (0.42%) districts (http://rkvy.nic.in). Saline-sodic
    (Sss) soils are quite complex soils showing diverse salt composition and unfavorable
    soil physical properties. The soil showed low response to soil reclamation practices
    mostly located in the irrigated areas (Abrol et al., 1973; Bhargava et al., 1972;
    Sharma & Bhargava, 1978,). With the increasing intensity of irrigation, large
    areas of Sss (34%) have appeared during 2017 as against 1% in 1997 (Kishor et
    al., 2022); these are distributed in Bhiwani (4.1%), Karnal (3.1%), Jind (1.7%),
    Panipat (1.1%), Palwal (1.4%), Rohtak (3.4%), Sirsa (9.5%), and Sonepat (8.2%)
    districts. Overall assessment at the state level has indicated marked changes
    (18.2%) in sodic and saline soils areas (2.2%), respectively (Table 3). Spatial
    assessment of soil salinity in landform zones Landforms play a vital role in the
    distribution of soil salinity at a regional scale. Salt-affected soils were distributed
    in 10 landform units in Haryana State (Manchanda & Khanna, 1981; Sachdev et al.,
    1995). Large areas were distributed in old alluvial plains (OAP, ~ 63%) during
    1997, and the areas were reduced to ~ 14% during 2017 after reclamation (Table
    4). In the old alluvial plain with sand dunes (OAPSD), the sodic soils’ areas
    have increased slightly from 24.8% in 1997 to 26% in 2017, apparently due to increased
    areas under irrigation. A similar trend is followed in the recent alluvial plain
    (4.1%), fluvio-aeolian plain (6.1%), Aravalli pediments (1.7%), and aeo-fluvial
    plains (8.6%), respectively (Mandal & Sharma, 2005). There is an increase in areas
    of saline soils viz, Ssa (8%), a decrease in Sso (6%), and Sss (28%) in the old
    alluvial plain, which are commonly used for irrigated rice–wheat crops. Following
    land clearance of sand dunes, the introduction of irrigation in OAPSD has prompted
    the increase in areas of Ssa (23.8%), Sso (3.0%), and Sss (1.4%), respectively.
    Limited irrigation and agriculture caused the marginal increase of Ssa (2.1%)
    and Sso (2.0%) in the recent alluvial plain (RAP). The increase of areas for Sss
    (7.6%) in the aeo-fluvial plain was ascribed to natural salt accumulation by the
    fluvial action of water. A slight increase in the areas of Sso was noted in the
    active alluvial plain (AAP, 0.58%), Aravalli hills (AH, 0.3%), and Aravalli pediments
    (AP, 1.6%), respectively (Table 4). Spatial changes of soil salinity at district
    levels To address micro-level planning for reclamation (1:50,000 scale) at district
    levels (19 Nos.) of Haryana State, the distribution and spatial changes of salt-affected
    soils were presented in Table 5. Marked changes in the areas of sodic soils have
    been identified in Panipat (12%), Karnal (~ 5%) and Jind (~ 6%) districts following
    successful reclamation of alkali soils (Kumar & Sharma, 2020). The sodic soil
    reclamation is also pronounced in central and south Haryana covering Kurukshetra
    (1.6%), Yamunanagar (0.7%), Sonepat (2.2%), Faridabad (1.98%), Ambala (0.3%),
    and Gurgaon (0.2%) districts. The overall change is 35% at the state level (www.agriharyana.gov.in/hopp).
    A significant increase of areas under salinity has been noted in the Jhajjar district
    (~ 14%, saline ~ 11%, and sodic ~ 3%). There is a distinct increase in the areas
    of saline soils (11%), a decline in sodic (0.86%), and an overall increase of
    soil salinity (10.15%) in the Hisar district (http://aicrp.icar.gov.in/sasusw,
    http://rkvy.nic.in). Due to the increase of irrigated areas, sodic areas have
    increased to 11% in the Sirsa district (Promila et al., 2018). Due to prolonged
    irrigation from canals and saline groundwater in low-lying plains, salt-affected
    areas (total ~ 9%, saline ~ 6%, sodic ~ 3%) in Rohtak district (Sethi et al.,
    2012). Irrigation has enhanced saline soils’ areas (~ 3%) and soil reclamation
    has reduced the sodic areas (3.7%) in Palwal district (Chinchmalatpure et al.,
    2016). Prominent areas of saline soils have increased in Bhiwani (~ 6%), Rewari
    (3%), and Mewat (4%) districts, respectively (Sethi et al., 2018). Spatial assessment
    of other soil degradations in Haryana State Apart from soil salinization other
    anthropogenic factors such as waterlogging in the canal irrigated areas, the setting
    of brick kilns in unproductive (to agriculture) areas underlain with the saline/sodic
    groundwater, partially stabilized dunes in the sand deserts, the riverine sand
    along the river course and areas affected by the disposal of toxic industrial
    effluents play a vital role on soil degradations. Table 6 shows the estimates
    of soil degradations in selected districts of Haryana State. About 22289 ha (0.5%
    of TGA) is affected due to soil degradations other than salinity/sodicity (Mandal,
    2022a). Waterlogged areas account for 83% of the total soil degradations at surface
    (Lsp1, Lsp2) and subsurface (Lsw) soil depths (Kaushik et al., 2018). Lsp1 is
    commonly located in Sonepat (19%), Hisar (10%), Panipat (6.4%), Jhajjar (3.1%),
    Sirsa (2.9%), and Mewat (2.4%) districts. Critical areas of Lsp2 have been identified
    in Jhajjar (3.96%) district. Subsurface waterlogging (Lsw) is a primary constraint
    in Sonepat district (27%) (SAC, 2021). Loss of fertile soils by sand mining (0.7%)
    has occurred along the floodplain of Yamuna in Karnal (0.8%) and Panipat (0.7%)
    districts (Singh et al., 2007). The disposal of industrial effluents (Hie) in
    agricultural areas (~ 9%) is common in Panipat district (Kaur & Rishi, 2018).
    The formation of partially stabilized dunes (Edp2, 1.4%) by erosion and saline/sodic
    groundwater are primary causes of establishing brick kilns in Sonepat (3.5%) and
    Karnal (0.4%) districts, respectively (Mandal, 2022a). Periodic sand deposit along
    the river course (riverine sand, Tms) are common soil degradation that encroached
    on fertile agricultural soils in Kurukshetra district (0.93%) (Sreenivas et al.,
    2021). Water quality studies About 60–80% of the groundwater in Haryana has been
    reported as poor in quality (Gupta, 2010). Saline and sodic ground waters are
    located in the northwest arid and southeast semiarid regions (CGWB, 2022; Minhas
    & Samra, 2003). The properties of selected water samples are presented in Table
    7. In northwest arid plain (T1-T4), water samples were mostly sodic (pHiw 8.4–9.7).
    Carbonates (3.0–12.0 me L−1) were present with Na+ (7.08–36.2 me L−1), Ca2+  + Mg2+
    (8.0–14.0 me L−1), Cl− (10.0–18.0 me L−1) and traces of SO42−. The SAR is low
    in T1 and T3; high in T2 and T4; and RSC (4.0) is critical in T4 (Mandal et al.,
    2016a, 2016b). Water samples are neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7.5–8.6) in
    the southeast semiarid plain (https://cssri.res.in/databaseofgroundwaterquality/).
    The salinity is variable (ECe 2.5–23.0 dS m−1) and is dominated by Na+ (20.9–142.0
    me L−1), Ca2+  + Mg2+ (5.5–125.0 me L−1), carbonates (4.0–11.5 me L−1), and Cl−
    (20.5–307.5 me L−1) ions (Krishan et al., 2021). High SAR (9.4–26.1) and RSC (6.0
    me L−1) are typical characteristics in T6 (Venkata Subbaiah et al., 2022). The
    depth of groundwater lies between 78–99 m in northwest arid and 75–125 m bgl (below
    ground level) in southeast semiarid plains, respectively (CGWB, 2022). Suggested
    options for soil reclamation and alternate land use of salt-affected soils Strong
    sodic soils (P3, P5, P6, P9, and P14) (pH 9.8–11) with coarse to fine soil texture
    (sil-sicl, l-sicl, l-cl-sil, l) need higher gypsum application at 10–12 t ha−1
    followed by leaching of excess soluble salts (Abrol et al., 1973; Bhargava et
    al., 1980; Hopmans et al., 2021; Mandal et al., 2013; Sharma et al., 2008, 2011,
    2015). The use of new approaches such as nano-gypsum (Santosh Kumar and Thiyageswari,
    2018) and FGDG (Sundha et al., 2023) can also be used for more effective reclamation
    of sodic soils. Moderately sodic (P1, P7, and P12) and saline-sodic soils (P3,
    P11) with coarse (sl-scl, l, scl-sl, and ls-sl) to fine (sil-sicl) soil texture
    are reclaimed by gypsum application at 6–8 t ha−1. Slightly sodic soil (P2, P4,
    P11, and P13) showed coarse (ls-sl) to finer soil texture (l-cl-sil-ls, sil-sicl-cl,
    and l-sil-cl) and the CaCO3 contents (1.1–5.3, 1–16, 1.1–4.9, and 0.3–2.7%), can
    suitably be grown for tolerant rice and wheat crops with proper soil and water
    management practices (Singh & Sharma, 2005; Singh et al., 2019). The addition
    of natural amendments such as FYM (Farm Yard Manure) (Abdel-Fattah, 2012), compost
    (Singh et al, 2023), and green manure crop (Sesbania spp., green gram/Moong) (Zhu
    et al., 2022; Sharma et al., 2007) was also effective soil reclamation agents
    that improved soil physical properties, drainage, and waterlogging conditions
    (CSSRI, 2015). Special care is needed for the reclamation of sodic soils (P4,
    P7, P11, and P12) with poor-quality (saline/sodic) groundwater (Dagar et al.,
    2008). The cyclic or mixed modes are commonly used for irrigating good and poor-
    quality of waters that avoid any excess salt load is soils (Minhas & Samra, 2004;
    Dey & Gupta, 2011). The water samples with high RSC levels are recommended for
    agricultural applications following treatment with gypsum. It is a common field
    scale method that is used for neutralizing carbonates and bicarbonates of RSC
    water used for irrigation by passing through a gypsum bed stored in a concrete
    structure (Murtaza et al., 2009). Installation of a subsurface drainage system
    (SSD) is recommended for leaching of excess soluble salts and controlling high
    water table depth (< 1.5 m) in moderate to strongly saline soils (P10 and P11),
    with coarse to fine soil textures (scl, ls-sl, and l-sil-cl), CaCO3 layer at 1.2
    m depth, that caused impeded drainage conditions (Ambast et al., 2007; Mukhopadhyay
    et al., 2023). Forestry plantations (Prosopis, Eucalyptus, and Acacia spp.) (Singh
    & Dagar, 2005; Sharma et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2017; Sharma et al., 2008, 2011,
    2015), growing horticulture crops like banana, citrus (Damodaran et al., 2011),
    and an integrated use of compost and gypsum (Sundha et al., 2020), and the use
    of FGDG (flue gas desulfurized gypsum) due to high-gypsum contents (Sundha et
    al., 2023) are the most suitable options for managing P13 (a typical saline-sodic
    soil) in an arid sandy plain with a moderate salt load (7–26 dS m−1), a reclaimed
    soil (pH 8.7–10) at surface depth, with calcareous (CaCO3) layer, neutral salts
    such as Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, and SO42−, and underlying sodic groundwater. Due
    to multiple constraints such as waterlogging (Lsw-WTD < 1.5 m depth), high salinity
    (EC 11–46 dS m−1), and underlying saline groundwater, P11 is currently used for
    operating brick kilns (Mandal, 2022a). Recently, brick kilns have been identified
    as an important degradation agent that caused the loss of fertile soils and are
    also a major environmental concern for pollution from coal burning (Mandal, 2022a).
    Thus, leaching of salts with good quality water for irrigation and adopting proper
    soil and water management practices is required for further use of such soils
    in agriculture (FAO, 2023). P3 is a reclaimed sodic soil located close to a thermal
    power plant where disposal and treatments (chemical/biological) of industrial
    effluents are the primary concern (Mandal, 2022a). Such areas are currently used
    for gas bottling plants of ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Commission) and be alternatively
    used for peri-urban agriculture (Minhas & Samra, 2004). P4, P7, and P12 are currently
    used for rice–wheat cropping system with low yield; the treatment of sodic groundwater
    with gypsum is required to reduce carbonate toxicities, improve crop yields, and
    restrict environmental degradations from secondary salt accumulation (Minhas et
    al., 2021). P9 is used for forestry and medicinal plantations due to fine texture
    strata in Ghaggar plain and is unsuitable for arable farming due to the sodic
    (with high RSC > 4 me L−1) groundwater (Singh, 2019). P14 is located near riverine
    sand; proper planning is required for the disposal of sand and finding some alternate
    uses (Fig. 5) (Singh et al., 2007). Fig. 5 Soil degradations in IGP: an assessment
    for reclamation and management (PSD = partially stabilized dunes, GQGW = good
    quality groundwater, WTD = water table depth, SSD = subsurface drainage, GW = ground
    water) Full size image Benefits of soil reclamation: constraints and a qualitative
    financial assessment Reclaiming strongly sodic soils (pHs > 10.0) using gypsum
    applications (at 12.5 t ha−1) in IGP has revealed yield advantages of rice and
    wheat from zero to 4.2 and 1.8 t ha−1 in the first year of soil reclamation and
    increased to 6.1 and 2.5 t ha−1 in the 5th year of reclamation (Sharma, 1986;
    Sharma et al., 2015;). Experiments of agroforestry plantations (Prosopis juliflora)
    have reported an increase in plant height (127%), basal diameters (180%), nutrient
    availability, and infiltration rates (21 to 18%) following gypsum application
    at 7.5 t ha−1 and 15 t ha−1, respectively (Singh et al., 1989). Murtaza et al.
    (2009) have reported prominent socioeconomic impacts (equivalent to US $) of soil
    reclamation followed by rice–wheat production considering the costs of field operations,
    other inputs costs for fertilizer and chemicals, farm manure, and gypsum, respectively.
    The economic analysis of the present study has revealed a complex model which
    varies with respect to the different interventions such as input cost of gypsum
    based soil reclamation for strongly sodic soils with low to very low productive
    potential, the use of salt-resistant varieties for moderate and slightly salt-affected
    soils, and the installation costs of subsurface drainage (SSD) to control strongly
    saline and waterlogged soils and the leaching of salts using good quality of irrigation
    water to grow salt-resistant crops for moderate and slightly saline soils. Other
    economically viable option includes the practicing of saline-aquaculture in unproductive
    (severely salt-affected) areas underlain by the poor quality saline/sodic groundwater
    (as alternate land use practice in arid regions) and the extremely salinized low-lying
    ponded areas (basin land) showing prolonged waterlogging (Lsp2) and poor natural
    drainage in canal irrigated regions. The biological interventions by agroforestry
    plantations is also an alternate land use practice for soil reclamation of strongly
    sodic soils with saline/sodic groundwater. Such reclamation techniques involve
    variable costs of reclamation that also differ in productivity potentials. CSSRI
    (2006) reported a benefit cost ratio of 2.30 and 56% internal rate of return following
    the recommended practices of gypsum based soil reclamation at farm scale which
    differs at farmer’s field (1.60 and 1.29) due to the differences in the cost of
    gypsum using Government subsidy and without subsidy of gypsum (open market price).
    Raj Kumar et al. (2022) have reported a higher returns (US$ ~ 7834 ha−1) from
    poplar (Populus deltiodes) based agroforestry plantation compared to the traditional
    rice–wheat cropping system (US$ ~ 4309 ha−1) for a 7 years duration. Similarly,
    a qualitative study by Datta and Jong (2002) has revealed a significant total
    annual loss of 1669 million rupees (equivalent to US$ 37 million) from the waterlogged
    saline areas of Haryana State. (Singh et al., 2014) have reported the variable
    B: C ratios ranging from 2.48 to 6.0 for interventions of integrated farming comprised
    of aquaculture ponds, and vegetable productions. Paulraj and Muraligopal (2013)
    have indicated institutional factors (0.997) have positive impact on decision
    towards soil reclamation whereas economic factors (− 0.394) have negative impacts
    towards soil reclamation measure and have attributed the possible primary reasons
    for non-adoption is due to the lack of awareness creation through an intensive
    extension service and also the absence of farmer’s oriented government policy
    on soil conservation practices. Raj Kumar et al. (2022) have also reported emerging
    challenges such as the availability of amendments, lack of updated database for
    soil salinity, emerging areas of re-sodification from waterlogging, and coexistence
    of multiple abiotic stressors with changing climate. A recommended single methodology
    for assessing economic potentials of soil reclamations is unavailable for the
    study area. Based on several experimentations duly authenticated under the field
    condition, a calculated (qualitative) assessment on the financial return (Table
    5) has indicated a gain of about 148 million rupees from soil reclamations in
    Haryana State. Based on financial return values, Panipat (33.68%), Jind (16.08%),
    Karnal (12.88%), and Palwal (10.54%) districts have shown significant financial
    gains from soil reclamation and thus contributed about 73.18% of the state’s economy.
    Other prominent areas of soil reclamation include Sonepat (6.30%), Faridabad (5.60%),
    Kurukshetra (4.60%), Fatehabad (3.42%), and Hisar (2.42%), respectively. Conclusion
    Spatial analysis of salt-affected soils in IGP showed a reduction in the sodic
    soil areas during the state-wide reclamation program while the emerging areas
    of salinity were noted in the irrigated areas under arid and semiarid climate.
    Significant changes in soil sodicity and salt contents (pHs, ECe, and ESP) have
    occurred at surface depths following gypsum application. Characteristics of reclaimed
    sodic soils have indicated residual sodicity and salinity even in the subsurface
    depths (< 1.2 m). Periodic gypsum application (based on G. R.) and proper management
    of soil, water, and crops are required to control sodicity. The evidence of salinization
    and sodicity development in soil profiles following irrigation with sodic (with
    high RSC) groundwater suggests the treatment with gypsum application to neutralize
    carbonate salts prior to soil application. The adoption of biological reclamation
    techniques such as plantation for agroforestry (e.g., Prosopis juliflora and Acacia
    nilotica), growing nutrient fixing crops such as Sesbania, and medicinal and aromatic
    plants can be followed for the management of sodic (P4) and saline-sodic (P9,
    and P13) soils with underlying sodic groundwater. The salinity and sodicity in
    soils located neara thermal power plant (Hie) can be attributed to the influence
    of toxic wastes. Moderate salt load and low ESP in the P12 and P4, and sodic (no
    RSC) groundwater can be used for growing rice, wheat, and cotton crops. Rice can
    be grown with moderate yield in a strongly sodic soil (P5) with a fine loam soil
    texture and prone to waterlogging (Lsp1). Irrigating a fine-textured soil (sandy
    clay loam) soil profile (P10) caused an alteration of salt and water balances
    during the wet and dry cycles and thus prompted the development of waterlogging
    (Lsp2) and high soil salinity at the root zone. The high water table depth (Lsw < 1.5
    m), an impermeable calcareous (CaCO3) parent material (0.5–1.3%), saline groundwater
    and a coarse soil texture (loamy sand to sandy loam) that permits easy movement
    of salts and water were responsible for strong salinity and sodicity, dominant
    Na+, Ca2+  + Mg2+, HCO3−, Cl−, and SO42− ions in P11. The gypsum requirement (GR)
    of sodic soils with varying degrees of limitations is an important parameter for
    precise and successful soil reclamation. Soil reclamation has increased crop yield
    (rice–wheat), improved the farm economy of small and marginal farmers, and sustained
    livelihood security. Growing salt-tolerant varieties are suitable options in moderate
    to slight salinity. Biological reclamations using agroforestry, and growing Sesbania
    spp. are suitable options for moderate to slightly degraded soils. Conservation
    agricultural practices are more suitable for reclaimed sodic soils. Data availability

    2021 1 Introduction Agricultural reservoirs are critical infrastructures that
    play a pivotal role in ensuring a stable supply of agricultural water, meeting
    approximately 61.3% of the agricultural water demand in South Korea (KRCC 2022).
    Given the direct link between agriculture and human survival, effective management
    of these reservoirs is of paramount importance. However, growing challenges, such
    as increased incidence of water-related disasters (e.g., extreme rainfall and
    drought) due to climate changes, make this task more difficult. For instance,
    the Korean Rural Community Corporation’s (KRCC’s) Drought Report revealed alarming
    trends; in 2012, a prolonged drought caused the storage capacity of reservoirs
    to plummet below 20%, whereas in 2014, a 25% decrease in average precipitation
    resulted in agricultural droughts. More recently, in 2022, the Jeollabuk-do region
    experienced agricultural droughts with a 35% deficit in average precipitation
    (ME 2022). These instances underscore the vulnerability of agricultural reservoirs
    to the impacts of climate change, necessitating immediate measures to adapt and
    ensure their long-term sustainability. Addressing the impact of climate change
    on reservoirs requires various solutions, including hedging, emergency interconnected
    operations, and leveraging emergency storage. Most of these solutions involve
    operational decisions that necessitate an accurate assessment of current reservoir
    water storage. However, only 10% of agricultural reservoirs in South Korea are
    equipped with automatic water level observatories; manual readings (i.e., human
    reading) remain the norm. Furthermore, the geographic dispersion of agricultural
    reservoirs compounds the complexity of water storage estimation, posing significant
    challenges to real-time monitoring, operation, and management. As such, there
    remains a need to implement real-time water level monitoring or alternative water
    level estimation approaches to efficiently manage agricultural water, ensuring
    a continuous water supply and effective contingency planning. Research on water
    level estimation of reservoirs is limited; however, efforts have been made to
    estimate either water levels or flowrates of streams (Hou et al. 2021; Vandaele
    et al. 2021; Liang et al. 2023). These studies highlight challenges related to
    insufficient monitoring devices and actual stream data (e.g., velocity, flowrate,
    and stream water level). Consequently, research leveraging image data, such as
    drones and closed-circuit television (CCTV), has gained significant attention.
    For instance, Maehara et al. (2016) estimated stream water levels based on pixel
    counts from filtered images of flowrates, whereas Li et al. (2022) estimated the
    flowrates in a watershed by measuring surface velocity from video information.
    In some cases, stream water levels were monitored to prevent catastrophic floods
    by calculating changes in water surface through videography (Muste et al. 2011;
    Le Boursicaud et al. 2016; Creutin et al. 2003; Perks et al. 2020). The advent
    of artificial intelligence has further spurred research into estimating stream
    water levels and flowrates using deep learning models and image processing techniques.
    Maehara et al. (2019) employed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for stream water
    level estimation, whereas Chaudhary et al. (2019) proposed a method to estimate
    stream water levels by categorizing objects in images collected through social
    media using the deep learning model R-CNN (region-based CNNs). Several studies
    have also been conducted to estimate irrigation water supply in agriculture using
    deep learning techniques (Hong et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2021). However, these
    studies have demonstrated limitations that significantly affected the accuracy
    of stream flowrates or water level estimation models, based on the resolution
    of image data (Eltner et al. 2018, 2021; Vandaele et al. 2021; Muhadi et al. 2021).
    To overcome these limitations, previous studies have applied deep learning techniques
    and image data preprocessing approaches to improve model performance based on
    CCTV image data (Li et al. 2019; Dhara et al. 2020; Hu et al. 2021). In addition,
    most relevant studies have focused on estimating water level or irrigation water
    supply to recognize the watermark gauge within CCTV images (Lee et al. 2020; Kim
    et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2023). Despite previous studies using video information
    for water level or supply estimation, no study has developed deep learning models
    based on image data (without a watermark gauge) to estimate the water level of
    agricultural reservoirs. Therefore, in this study, a model (Deep learning-based
    Agricultural reservoirs Water level Recognition model; DAWR hereafter) that can
    be used to estimate the water level of agricultural reservoirs using image data
    is introduced. The framework comprises the following three key sub-modules: (1)
    data-processing module; (2) image segmentation module; (3) image classification
    module. The DAWR framework analyzes the image information and water level data
    of two agricultural reservoirs, M-reservoir and G-reservoir, to recognize their
    water levels under four criteria. The model performance and applicability of the
    DAWR framework are evaluated by setting classification intervals corresponding
    to the two agricultural reservoirs and crosschecking how accurately they are predicted.
    Finally, the limitations of the developed level recognition model and suggestions
    for future research are discussed. 2 Study Site and Data 2.1 Site Description
    The proposed framework is implemented in two reservoirs (M-reservoir and G-reservoir)
    managed by the KRCC and located in Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea (Fig. 1). Image
    data were collected using CCTV equipment managed by the KRCC, and the location
    of reservoirs and their sample images are presented in Fig. 1. The characteristics
    of each reservoir, including irrigated areas and effective water storage capacity,
    were investigated based on the annual report for a hydrological survey of agricultural
    reservoirs (KRCC 2022). The M-reservoir covers a total irrigated area of 85 ha
    and has an effective water storage capacity of 412,000 m3, whereas the G-reservoir
    covers a total irrigated area of 120 ha and has an effective water storage capacity
    of 750,000 m3. Fig. 1 Site information and locations for sample images of two
    reservoirs Full size image 2.2 Data The proposed DAWR framework initially utilizes
    two types of data, namely (1) image data and (2) time-series data of reservoir
    water levels. Both datasets were collected during the period spanning from June
    21, 2020, to July 18, 2022. Once the data were collected, image data and the corresponding
    water level were synchronized. The final goal of the DAWR is recognizing the water
    level of the reservoirs without water level monitoring by only utilizing image
    data but must initialize training and validate and test the model. In other words,
    this study was more focused on the development of the framework and its validation
    for potential applications. The high and low water levels for each reservoir were
    179.6 m and 177.6 m for M-reservoir and 197.8 m and 195.4 m for G-reservoir, respectively.
    For further information regarding the time-series data of reservoir water levels
    or CCTV imagery datasets, please refer to Supplemental Material Sections S1 and
    S2. 3 Methodology The proposed DAWR framework utilizes a series of CNN architectures
    for segmentation and classification. The overview of the framework is described
    in the following sections, along with an explanation of deep learning architectures
    for image processing, such as U-Net, CNN, Residual Neural Network (ResNet), and
    EfficientNet, as well as the performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness
    of the proposed model. 3.1 Framework Overview Figure 2 illustrates a schematic
    diagram of the proposed framework, which comprises two modules, namely water segmentation
    and water level recognition. Initially, the collected raw CCTV image data undergo
    preprocessing and formatting adjustments, rendering them suitable input into deep
    learning architecture (e.g., U-Net). The authors manually annotated 10% ratios
    (2,227 of 22,275 images) from June 21, 2020, to July 18, 2022, using the software
    LabelMe; this procedure is defined as ‘preprocessing module’ in the proposed framework;
    the annotated images (2,227 images) were used as the datasets for the segmentation
    module. In the second step (image segmentation), the input data for the second
    step are generated. In the third step (image classification), the segmented image
    data are classified using CNN architectures (e.g., CNN, ResNet, and EfficientNet).
    Finally, to evaluate the performance of the model, the water level classification
    results obtained from DAWR are compared with actual water level data. Fig. 2 Schematic
    illustration of the proposed DAWR framework Full size image 3.2 Image Segmentation
    Module A segmentation module classifies each pixel in an image, resulting in a
    segmented image categorized into predefined classes. To accomplish this, segmentation
    module generates a segmentation map with the same size as the input image. Segmentation
    module typically consist of an encoder-decoder network. In this study, U-Net was
    employed to identify the water map as a result of image segmentation, classifying
    each pixel into two predefined classes (water and landscape). The selection of
    U-Net architecture was based on the following reasons: (1) The architecture was
    designed to effectively capture both local and global features; (2) The architecture
    uses skips connections, connecting feature maps from the contracting path to the
    corresponding location in the expansive path. It retains high-resolution details,
    aiding the network in learning fine details to extract the water map object in
    this study; (3) Unlike the other objects (e.g., backgrounds) in an image, the
    water segmentation models (based on U-Net architecture) were effective and robust
    in the relevant literature (Tambe et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2021, 2022; Wieland et
    al. 2023). The U-Net is a CNN architecture that employs a supervised learning
    approach for classifying different classes by iteratively adjusting the weights
    of convolutional filters (Ronneberger et al. 2015). These filters are structured
    in a network-like manner, allowing the U-Net architecture to identify spectral
    and spatial patterns at various levels of detail. A distinctive technique utilized
    by the U-Net architecture is skip connection, which combines the feature maps
    from the encoder and decoder before up-sampling. This allows the network to effectively
    utilize the features from the down-sampled encoder for up-sampling and achieve
    a more refined segmentation. The U-Net architecture typically consists of five
    hidden layers, but often a smaller number of layers is allowed to reduce the computation
    time and to mitigate the risk of overfitting only once high performance can be
    achieved (Xu et al. 2021). Therefore, this study applied a simplified version
    with four hidden layers. 3.3 Image Classification Module The image classification
    module focuses on identifying objects within images, employing CNN-based architectures
    to recognize patterns or elements. The authors selected three classification models
    to estimate reservoir water levels, namely CNN, ResNet, and EfficientNet architectures.
    The input data for all architectures were a segmented water map image achieved
    by U-Net architecture. First, CNN architectures (LeCun & Bengio 1995) have excelled
    in image processing tasks by leveraging deep learning to detect spatial features
    effectively (Shin et al. 2016) and employ local receptive fields, convolutional
    layers, and pooling layers to process input data, extracting features progressively.
    Convolutional layers use filters to detect specific features while pooling layers
    down-sample the feature map to focus on significant information. Fully connected
    layers generate predictions based on learned features, usually conducted with
    a softmax layer for classification. ResNet architecture was introduced by Microsoft
    in 2015 (He et al. 2016) to address challenges in deep architectures by incorporating
    residual connections and enabling information flow in deep networks. ResNet architecture
    mitigates the vanishing gradients issue with shortcut connections that add input
    to a block’s output, facilitating gradient propagation. The ResNet architecture
    with 152 layers was adopted to classify reservoir water levels. Lastly, The EfficientNet
    architecture is a set of CNN-based feature extraction networks by Tan and Le (2019)
    generated using learning algorithms. EfficientNet architecture scales network
    depth, width, and resolution comprehensively, maintaining high classification
    accuracy with fewer model parameters. 3.4 Performance Metrics The proposed framework
    evaluates the performance of these architectures for image segmentation and classification
    using various performance metrics. For image segmentation (U-Net architecture),
    model accuracy is a performance metric that generally quantifies the percentage
    of correctly classified instances; it is calculated by dividing the sum of TP
    and TN by the total number of classified instances, including both FP and FN.
    In addition, the other metrics (such as precision, recall, F1 score, and intersection
    over union (IoU) score) were also employed. These metrics quantify agreement between
    the manually annotated water truth (WT) data and the predicted data using the
    software LabelMe (Wada 2016, see example in Fig. 2). For image classification
    (CNN, ResNet, and EfficientNet), class group accuracy assesses their performance.
    This metric compares predicted image data to predefined class groups representing
    different water level bounds (details in Sect. 4.1). The class group accuracy
    indicates the percentage of correctly classified groups; FN and TN for accuracy
    quantification were all set to zero in the classification module. In summary,
    an accuracy score of 1 signifies perfect segmentation or classification, while
    a lower score indicates a higher rate of errors. Detailed information on the performance
    metrics is provided in the Supplemental Materials Section S3. 4 Experimental Setup
    4.1 Each Class Between Water Level Criteria While the ultimate goal was to accurately
    predict water levels, the limited data availability necessitates the grouping
    of water levels into predefined ranges (defined as classes). To establish the
    classes of water levels, three types of criteria (Fig. S2) were considered, namely
    (1) equal-interval (EI), (2) probability-based approaches, specifically the Jenks
    natural breaks (JNB) (Jenks 1967), and (3) number of image pixels (PX). The maximum
    and minimum water levels have been set following the high and low water levels
    of each reservoir. Details of water level information are provided in Supplemental
    Material Section S2. 4.2 Experimental Conditions for Image Processing Modules
    The modules (i.e., image segmentation and classification) of the proposed framework
    have different experimental conditions, including training, validation, and test
    data. For the image segmentation module, image data were standardized to a resolution
    of 512 × 512 pixels to optimize memory usage during training. The image dataset
    was partitioned randomly into training (70%), validation (10%), and test (20%)
    sets. The U-Net architecture could be terminated early using an early epoch-stopping
    tool provided by PyTorch (Paszke et al. 2017). In contrast, the image classification
    module similarly scales images to 256 × 256 pixels to manage memory efficiently.
    The image dataset was randomly classified into training (60%), validation (20%),
    and test sets (20%). The obtained results were evaluated using the test dataset
    based on Keras of Tensorflow (Chollet 2021). All experiments were conducted using
    a 64-bit Windows 10 system computer released in 2019, featuring a 3.70 GHz Intel®
    Core™ i9-19000X CPU, 256 GB RAM, and NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. Further experimental
    details are provided in Supplemental Material Section S4. 5 Results and Discussion
    5.1 Segmentation Module: Water Map in the Images Table 1 summarizes the image
    segmentation module results. The loss values remained low during training and
    validation at 0.008 and 0.040, respectively. The loss measures the difference
    between the model’s predicted output and actual labels. Other evaluation metrics
    consistently registered high values, exceeding 99%, during the training phase
    and maintained strong performance levels between 97.92 and 99.72% during testing.
    While minor variations are observed among the evaluation metrics, the overall
    performance proved the model to be excellent. Detailed results, including confusion
    matrix, can be found in the Supplemental Material Section S5. This indicates that
    the model can accurately identify the water area, distinguish different features
    within the original image, correctly separate object areas, and identify changes
    in water levels. Therefore, the input data for the image classification module
    (i.e., water level recognition) obtained from this step can be considered reliable.
    Table 1 Summary of the image segmentation module results Full size table 5.2 Classification
    Module: Water Level Recognition This section describes the results obtained using
    the image classification module. Three different experimental architectures (i.e.,
    CNN, ResNet, and EfficientNet) were utilized to recognize water level based on
    predefined water level criteria. Only the best epoch out of the total number of
    epochs (= 50) were considered for comparison among three architectures and water
    level criteria. Based on our computational resources (Sect. 4.2), these experimental
    tasks required 22 h to train all image datasets over all experimental architectures.
    5.2.1 M-reservoir The results for the M-reservoir are summarized in Fig. 3 showing
    CNN architecture on the left, the ResNet architecture in the center, and the EfficientNet
    architecture on the right. In Fig. 3, the horizontal axis represents the range
    of water levels for the actual class intervals, while the vertical axis represents
    the range of water levels for the predicted class intervals. Essentially, outcomes
    falling along the diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner
    indicate accurate predictions of the class intervals that correspond to the actual
    image information. The results for loss and accuracy exhibited stable convergence
    (the detailed convergence results for each epoch are not included here) during
    a total of 50 epochs. Overall, CNN architecture showed relatively low performance,
    while EfficientNet demonstrated the best performance among all architectures.
    ResNet architecuture also performed well, even with limited image data, due to
    its utilization of residual blocks (He et al. 2016). EfficientNet architecture
    excelled due to its ability to seek an optimal combination of network depth, width,
    and resolution during the training process (Serte et al. 2022). Regardless of
    the criteria considered, the model accuracies for the three architectures followed
    the order of EfficientNet (0.716–0.906), ResNet (0.676–0.777), and CNN (0.446–0.687)
    architecutures. Both the EfficientNet and ResNet architectures exhibited superior
    performance compared with that of the CNN architecture; the best performance was
    computed with EfficientNet architecture. Fig. 3 Confusion matrix of the proposed
    framework for M-reservoir under different water level criteria: a EI; b JNB (4
    classes); c JNB (8 classes); d PX Full size image In terms of the water level
    criteria, as the number of water level classes increased, the performance of water
    level recognition decreased for all architectures and water level criteria (Fig.
    3). Particularly, the results of the EI criterion (26 classes) showed under- and
    over-predictions for the water level by showing accuracy results between 0.489
    and 0.716 (Fig. 3(a)). For the JNB criterion, the accuracy results ranged between
    0.687 and 0.906 for four classes, and between 0.446 and 0.716 for eight classes.
    Finally, the results obtained from the PX criterion ranged between 0.629 and 0.820.
    The poor performance in Fig. 3(a) was attributed to the insufficient amount of
    image data available for the individual classes, leading to low accuracy. Conversely,
    Fig. 3(c) exhibited relatively good performance, with a diagonal distribution
    indicating accurate prediction values. This improvement is credited to the selection
    of the JNB criterion, which evenly distributes image data across classes. Furthermore,
    Fig. 3(b, d) displays strong performance regardless of the models. In these cases,
    more image data were available for each class, which significantly contributed
    to better performance (see Section S6 in Supplemental Materials). In summary,
    overall accuracy decreased as the number of water level classes increased in the
    proposed image classification module. The results obtained from the JNB and PX
    criteria demonstrated good performance, while the results for the EI criterion
    showed relatively lower performance compared with the other criterion. The EI
    criterion involves a large number of classes and hence requires a sufficient amount
    of image data for each class. 5.2.2 G-reservoir Figure 4 illustrates a summary
    of the loss and accuracy results obtained from three different experimental architectures
    (from left to right: CNN, ResNet, and EfficientNet) for G-reservoir. Regardless
    of the criteria considered, the model accuracies for the three architectures followed
    the order of EfficientNet (0.758–0.939), ResNet (0.747–0.889), and CNN (0.434–0.727).
    Notably, both the EfficientNet and ResNet architectures exhibited superior performance
    compared to the CNN architecture. Among all architectures, the best performance
    is observed with the EfficientNet architecture in the image classification module.
    Fig. 4 Confusion matrix of the proposed framework for G-reservoir under different
    water level criteria: a EI; b JNB (4 classes); c JNB (8 classes); d PX Full size
    image Similar to the results observed in the M-reservoir, the results for the
    G-reservoir also indicated that an increasing number of water level classes reduced
    the performance, as evident from the EI criterion results (Fig. 4(a)). Conversely,
    the model performances improved when the number of water level classes was reduced
    (Fig. 4(b, d)). In contrast to the results in the M-reservoir, the JNB criterion
    with eight classes (Fig. 4(c)) showed relatively accurate predictions for several
    architectures due to the balanced distribution of images across each class, which
    effectively avoided under- and over-predictions in water level recognitions. 5.3
    Model Performance Comparison Between Two Different Reservoirs In this section,
    the model performance of the three architectures was compared for each reservoir.
    Figure 5, a bar chart (mean of accuracy) with error plots (variation of accuracy),
    compares the accuracy results of the 10 best epochs of 50 epochs for each water
    level criterion. Regardless of the criteria, the ranges of variation in accuracy
    for the three architectures followed the order of EfficientNet (5–39%), ResNet
    (1–18%), and CNN (4–12%) for both the reservoirs. The range of variation in accuracy
    for EfficientNet architecture was relatively larger than those of ResNet and CNN
    architectures. Smaller variations in accuracy correspond to higher stability,
    which confirms that most ResNet architecture have the highest stability among
    all architectures with sufficient model accuracy. Fig. 5 Comparison of model accuracy
    for two reservoirs under different water level criteria and architectures: a CNN;
    b ResNet, and c EfficientNet Full size image In addition, the mean of accuracies
    was compared between both reservoirs. Regardless of the criteria and types of
    architecture considered (Fig. 5), the M-reservoir models typically showed lower
    performance compared with the G-reservoir models. In general, for most models
    to perform well, they must effectively capture the features presented in the images.
    In the presence of significant variations in the images with changes in water
    levels, most architectures can capture these key features effectively. Concerning
    the comparison between two different reservoirs, the G-reservoir model excelled
    in capturing these essential features related to water level changes compared
    with the M-reservoir model. Furthermore, the model’s performance of the M-reservoir
    model was relatively poorer compared with that of the G-reservoir, despite the
    larger amount of image data available for the M-reservoir (see Section S2 in Supplemental
    Materials). This discrepancy is attributed to the distinct characteristics of
    the image data, particularly the number of pixels, between reservoirs. The image
    data for each reservoir exhibited different variations in pixel counts. Figure
    6 illustrates the results in the form of a box-whisker plot, showcasing the normalized
    number of pixels for each reservoir. The normalization of pixel counts pertains
    only to the water map sector (comprising the total pixels in the white area in
    Fig. S5). Fig. 6 Comparison of normalized number of pixels with respect to water
    level changes in a M-reservoir and b G-reservoir Full size image As shown in Fig.
    6, the pixel count variations for the G-reservoir image were generally more significant.
    This difference is reflected in the coefficient of variation values, which are
    0.106 and 0.253 for the M-reservoir and G-reservoir, respectively. Based on this
    pixel count variation, the G-reservoir model could better match the water level
    classes of each image data, as it exhibited wider gaps among classes. Consequently,
    the model’s performance of the G-reservoir surpassed that of the M-reservoir.
    In other words, distinguishing between different water level classes in the M-reservoir
    proved to be more challenging due to narrower gaps in pixel count of image data
    between these classes. This finding underscores that the performance of the model
    can be improved by responding to the wider pixel changes in the image data when
    it comes to water level recognition of agricultural reservoirs. For example, the
    JNB (4 classes) criterion should have better performance than other water class
    criteria, as they tend to distribute similar numbers of data per class (check
    Fig. S6). For the C1 class, as the PX criterion has a small number of image data,
    it was outperformed by the JNB (4 classes) criterion. However, C2 for the M-reservoir
    and C3 for the G-reservoir were exceptions. The number of image data of the PX
    criterion was smaller than that of JNB (4 classes). However, the results of both
    reservoirs for those classes (second horizontal line in Fig. 3(b, d) and third
    in Fig. 4(b, d)) were higher for the PX criterion, since the pixel variation was
    relatively higher for those classes (Table S1). Despite some exceptions, better
    performance between the two criteria was captured for the criterion with higher
    values on variance in image data for the same classes. To assess the robustness
    of the proposed model, each model was tested using image data from different reservoirs,
    applying the M-reservoir model to estimate the water level of the G-reservoir
    and vice versa. A decrease in the performance of both models by approximately
    20% for the M-reservoir model and 10% for the G-reservoir model was observed.
    These findings align with the general trends shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The M-reservoir
    model showed lower performance than the G-reservoir model, primarily due to the
    characteristics of the image data. This divergence in performance persists when
    the models were applied to different reservoirs, underscoring the significance
    of input data. While there appears to be potential for applying trained models
    from one reservoir to others, further investigation is necessary to enhance the
    models’ performance. In summary, the characteristics of the image data play a
    crucial role in model performance, emphasizing the need to incorporate these characteristics
    in defining water level classes. Specifically, the number of images and the variance
    of pixel changes should be considered when delineating classes. Despite the limited
    number of image data, the substantial pixel variations within each class could
    potentially improve model performance (refer to the image pixel variations under
    both reservoirs in Table S1, Supplemental Material Section S6). This suggests
    a strong correlation between the performance of the model and image data characteristics
    (i.e., pixel variations and the sufficient number of image data). 6 Summary and
    Conclusions This study introduced the DAWR framework, which leverages CCTV image
    data for agricultural reservoir water level recognition. The framework comprised
    the following three sub-modules: (1) data-processing module: collection and analysis
    of actual image data; (2) image segmentation module: generation of input data
    through image segmentation methods (e.g., U-Net); (3) image classification module:
    water level recognition based on image classification architectures (e.g., CNN,
    ResNet, and EfficientNet). The application of this framework to two agricultural
    reservoirs for water level recognition leads to the following three key findings:
    For the image segmentation module, the performance was excellent, indicating its
    potential as a reliable tool for input data crucial for effective water level
    recognition. For the image classification module, CNN architecture exhibited lower
    accuracy as the number of water level classes increased. In contrast, ResNet and
    EfficientNet architectures consistently achieved high accuracy. This variation
    in model performance appears to be linked to how well each architecture can adapt
    to training with limited image data. Finally, the study confirmed that the total
    number of data and variations in pixel change within the image data were closely
    associated with model performance. When the pixel variation corresponding to the
    water level is low, it becomes challenging for water level recognition architectures
    to capture the water level features from the input image data. In conclusion,
    the DAWR framework presented in this study offers a promising approach for agricultural
    reservoir water level recognition, excels in image segmentation, provides insights
    into the performance variation among different classification architectures, and
    highlights the significance of pixel variations in influencing model accuracy.

    It is crucial to note that the environmental benefits of protected agriculture
    are context-dependent, with climate change emerging as a critical factor influencing
    crop yields and the system’s input and output resources. This impact is particularly
    pronounced in terms of water and energy consumption and carbon emissions. In regions
    with extreme climates, protected agriculture provides solutions for producers
    aiming to attain high yields of top-quality crops. The integration of circular
    bioeconomy strategies in this context allows mitigation of the environmental trade-offs
    identified by LCA. Keywords: life cycle analysis; carbon footprint; circular economy;

    Food production within greenhouse structures, commonly referred to as protected
    agriculture, has emerged as a pivotal element in modern agriculture, making substantial
    contributions to global food security [1]. Protected agriculture ranks among the
    most intensified approaches to food production, measurable through various metrics
    such as material inputs, yields per unit area, energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and cost [2,3]. This agricultural technique has spurred substantial
    technological advancements, marked by the utilization of protective structures
    and air-conditioning equipment with varying technological sophistication. These
    components collectively enable the conditioning and management of the microclimate,
    maintaining optimal conditions for the growth and development of plants [4]. The
    adoption of protected agriculture has facilitated the maximization of both the
    quantity and quality of harvested products, efficiently optimizing water and soil
    resources and ensuring a consistent, year-round food supply [5,6]. It is vital
    to recognize that protected agriculture, while offering numerous advantages, has
    also brought about challenges associated with increased consumption of natural
    resources and energy. This heightened resource usage contributes to a negative
    environmental footprint, raising sustainability concerns for productive systems
    [7]. Reports indicate substantial consumption of construction materials, encompassing
    both the greenhouse structure and the materials used for enclosure and covering.
    This consumption poses notable environmental implications, with the manufacturing
    and transportation of these materials contributing to elevated energy consumption.
    Additionally, there is a risk of excessive plastic waste and increased demand
    for fossil fuels to power air-conditioning systems, potentially leading to water
    source contamination [8]. The excessive use of chemical substances for pest and
    disease control and plant nutrition adds a high toxicity load. Authors have highlighted
    concerns about landscape deterioration due to the construction of extensive greenhouse
    clusters globally [9,10]. The coexistence of benefits and environmental impacts
    emphasizes the necessity for a meticulous evaluation and optimization of protected
    agriculture practices to ensure a more sustainable and environmentally responsible
    approach to food production [11]. In the quest to understand and mitigate the
    environmental implications of protected agriculture, the use of the life cycle
    assessment (LCA) tool has gained considerable traction. LCA, a widely employed
    environmental management technique [12], standardized by the International Organization
    for Standardization, operates in four iterative phases: defining objectives and
    scope, conducting inventory analysis, evaluating impacts, and interpreting results
    [13]. LCA facilitates the quantification of environmental loads across the life
    cycle phases of products and services, offering valuable insights for environmentally
    conscious decision making [14]. Despite the increasing adoption of LCA, a lack
    of uniformity persists in its application across diverse research endeavors [15].
    This lack of consistency poses reliability challenges, potentially skewing statistical
    outcomes. The key factors of divergence include variations in databases and non-compliance
    with required standards throughout different phases [16,17]. In the specific context
    of protected agriculture, variability in the application of LCA has not been explored.
    Shedding light on this aspect is pivotal for promoting a more standardized and
    informed approach to LCA. This exploration will notably contribute to filling
    knowledge gaps, particularly in areas such as the use of biomaterials in greenhouse
    structures, the integration of 4.0 technologies, and the adoption of circular
    bioeconomy practices [1,2]. Therefore, identifying the predominant trends and
    addressing their limitations is imperative for advancing our understanding and
    enhancing the implementation of LCA in protected agriculture. In this paper, we
    undertake a comprehensive exploration of the current landscape of LCA application
    in protected agriculture through a combined bibliometric and systematic review.
    The bibliometric analysis shows scientific productivity trends and identifies
    prominent lines of research within this domain. In tandem, the systematic review
    delves into the historical development of agricultural LCA and assesses its operability
    within the context of protected agriculture. These two analytical approaches are
    elucidated in the sections following the methodology described. 2. Materials and
    Methods 2.1. Data Collection and Search Strategy The search, selection, and consolidation
    of the literature reported on LCA in protected agriculture were performed using
    the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
    [18]. This method is based on four steps, and its workflow is presented in Figure
    1. Figure 1. Step-by-step process of the PRISMA methodology used to consolidate
    the literature on LCA in protected agriculture—own elaboration. The first step
    is the identification of publications, which was carried out in two sub-steps:
    defining the search equation and selecting the database. We followed the guidelines
    provided by Koutsos et al. [19] to conduct systematic reviews of the literature
    on agricultural sciences. The search equation includes keywords, boolean operators,
    and truncation symbols. Three parentheses were used to represent the central topic
    of this review: the first was associated with the agricultural sector, the second
    with LCA, and the third with the specific protection structures of protected agriculture.
    Each parenthesis included the most representative keywords using “OR” as a Boolean
    operator. This operator enables the use of one or more defined keywords. Between
    the three parentheses, an “AND” was used as a Boolean operator to represent the
    intersection of the two topics. As the keyword “greenhouse” can be used in the
    context of both protected agriculture and climate change, it was necessary to
    use a fourth parenthesis to avoid retrieving off-topic posts (e.g., “greenhouse
    effect”) using the Boolean operator “AND NOT”. The truncation symbol (*) was also
    used to find both singular and plural words, and the proximity operator (“ ”)
    was used to find an exact sentence [20]. The defined search query is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search query used in the databases to consolidate the literature—own
    elaboration. We chose to assess the databases Scopus and the ISI Web of Science
    (WoS) because they are frequently employed in bibliometric research [19] and are
    managed by Elsevier and Thomson Reuters. The search equation was applied in a
    single day (21 June 2022) using “topic” as the search scope, which included the
    title, abstract, and keywords. The set of retrieved publications included all
    source types (e.g., articles, reviews, conference papers, books, etc.). The number
    of publications retrieved in Scopus was 105, whereas it was 101 in WoS. After
    removing duplicate publications between these two databases, a set of 112 publications
    was compiled. The second step denotes the initial filtering or screening of the
    set of retrieved publications. The screening consisted of two sub-steps. The first
    was to exclude publications that were not entirely in English. Although the keywords
    were defined in English, some publications are not in English but follow the guidelines
    that the abstract should also appear in English. The number of publications excluded
    was 4, of which 3 were in Chinese and 1 was in Spanish. The second substep was
    to check downloadable and unrelated publications based on an abstract review.
    The third step represents the eligibility check, which is the second and final
    filtering of the set of publications. Eligibility was based on whether the full
    text of the publications was closely related to LCA in protected agriculture.
    Finally, the fourth step is the consolidation of the set of publications included
    as the literature to be analyzed and scrutinized (Table S1) [24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120].
    Data from the final set of publications with all available information were exported
    as comma-separated value (CSV) files and then imported into Microsoft Excel 2016.
    2.2. Bibliometric Analysis The bibliometric parameters used to show the scientific
    productivity of the research between LCA and protected agriculture were as follows:
    (i) number of publications per year, (ii) total number of publications both by
    continent and by country, (iii) number of publications per institution, (iv) number
    of publications per author, and (v) trend of topics over time. The open-source,
    R-based tool Bibliometrix v3.0.1 for thorough scientific mapping analysis provided
    these data. Prism 8 software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was
    used to plot the results. 2.3. Analysis of the Thematic Structure of the Publications
    The thematic structure of the publications was assessed through a similarity analysis
    based on the formation of clusters and a text-mining analysis applied to the abstract
    section. Initially, data-cleaning tools were applied following the methodology
    of Abd-Alrazaq et al. [121]. Punctuation, numbers, and incomplete words were then
    removed from the abstracts. All alphabetic characters have been converted to lowercase.
    The text was separated into sentences using the corresponding Python procedure.
    Titles that denote sections of the document (i.e., background, objective, results,
    conclusion) and those within the abstracts were removed. Subsequently, the Python
    Natural Language Toolkit library was used to tokenize the sentences of each summary,
    and the SnowballStemmer procedure was used to convert words to their stems and
    each abstract to a feature vector. Features were defined by term-frequency and
    inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) weights. TF-IDF represents the importance
    of a word in relation to a document (an abstract) in a corpus (the collection
    of abstracts). The TF.IDF for term i in document score j is defined by Equation
    (1): TF.IDFij = TFij × IDFi (1) It is the product of the term frequency (TF) and
    the inverse density frequency (IDF). TF is defined by Equation (2): TFij = fij/(maxk
    fkj) (2) The frequency of term i in document j is normalized by fij by dividing
    it by the maximum number of occurrences of any term in the same document. The
    IDF is defined as the following: IDFi = log2 (N/ni) (3) The term i appears in
    ni of the N documents in the collection (corpus). The terms with the highest TF.IDF
    scores are usually the ones that best characterize the topic of the document.
    This score increases proportionally to the number of times the word appears in
    the document but is offset by the frequency of that word in the corpus. For TF-IDF
    representation of the abstracts, the TfidfVectorizer module of the Python scikit
    library was used. The number of terms to be used for each document was controlled
    by the parameters of the TfidfVectorizer algorithm. The parameter min_df = 10
    determined that the term should appear in at least ten documents, so terms too
    rare to be used in finding document clusters were excluded. The parameter max_df
    = 0.90 determined that the term should appear at most in 90% of the corpus; therefore,
    some terms that are too common were excluded. Hierarchical clustering was used
    for the unsupervised grouping of selected papers based on the similarity of their
    feature vectors. The resulting clustering tree was cut to select four branches
    following Ward’s procedure to guarantee internally coherent but well-separated
    groups. To account for each cluster resulting from the tree, random forest analysis
    with the scikit-learn Python library for supervised classification of selected
    branches of hierarchical cluster analysis was applied. The RFA was trained using
    the bagging method, which combines bootstrapping and aggregation. Using these
    features, the mean of the TF.IDF score was calculated to create a star graph and
    identify the key terms linked to the main subjects in the classes found from the
    cluster analysis. The number of features required to construct each tree corresponds
    to the square root of the total number of features resulting from the analysis
    using the TfidfVectorizer module. With the grid search result from the random
    forest analysis, the list of feature importances to select the first relevant
    features in a number equal to the tree features was found. Finally, the mean of
    the TF.IDF score was calculated to make a star chart and identify the key terms
    linked to the main themes in the groups found. 2.4. Systematic Review In conducting
    our systematic review, we adopted a two-fold approach. First, we outlined the
    historical progression of LCA chronologically, from its inception in a broader
    context to its specific applications in agriculture, with a special focus on advancements
    in protected agriculture. This involved incorporating crucial events and noteworthy
    reports that have significantly influenced the field. Moving on to the second
    phase, we examine the operational dynamics of LCA within protected agriculture.
    Our study followed the steps set out by the International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO) in standards 14040 and 14044 [122]. The four steps are the definition of
    objectives and scope, inventory analysis, impact evaluation, and interpretation.
    Each phase was subjected to scrutiny regarding the methodological aspects of decision
    making. We quantify the frequency of its use and provide detailed information
    on the most relevant findings. To visually represent the prevalence of these aspects,
    we use bar and pie charts. Table 2 shows the framework used in this systematic
    review, in which we included the most predominant aspects of the literature in
    phases 2 and 3. Table 2. Review framework to explore multiple aspects of the 4
    stages of the LCA applied to protected agriculture—own elaboration. The description
    and discussion of the findings allowed us to identify environmentally friendly
    practices in protected agriculture, analyze the coherence of methodological decisions
    with respect to ISO 14044 guidelines, and deduce whether methodological choices
    limited the value of the study in promoting environmentally sustainable protected
    agriculture. 3. A Brief History of the Agricultural LCA LCA has undergone an evolution
    in both methodology and applications for more than 60 years to become a well-known
    and widely used tool in industry, academia, and politics [123]. The LCA has presented
    different stages of development and adoption, including (i) the early years period
    (1960–1970), (ii) the conception period (1970–1990), (iii) the standardization
    period (1990–2000), (iv) the elaborations period (2000–2010), and (v) the concept
    broadening period (2010–until now) [124]. The conceptualization of LCA emerged
    in the 1960s as Resource and Environmental Profile Analysis (REPA) in the US or
    Ecobalances in Europe [125]. Initially rooted in industrial packaging research,
    LCA primarily focused on energy use and pollutant emissions. Knowledge dissemination
    of early LCA advances was limited, leading to largely uncoordinated method development
    in the US and Northern Europe [12]. Notable reports and committees reflecting
    the knowledge generated in the 1970s include “The Limits to Growth”, “A Blueprint
    for Survival”, and the “Committee on the Survey of Materials Science and Engineering”
    [125]. Methodological innovation and international coordination of LCA between
    private sector stakeholders and the scientific community have substantially increased
    since the 1980s. The term LCA, particularly the concept of life cycle thinking,
    became established and normative in the 1990s [124]. Key actions in the late 20th
    century included the launch of normalized assessment scores for environmental
    impact categories (CML-92 method), the publication of the LCA sourcebook A European
    Guide to Life Cycle Assessment, the establishment of the International Journal
    of Life Cycle Assessment, the introduction of the standards 14040 and 14041 of
    the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the development
    of the Dutch Eco-Indicator 99 method [126]. In the following decade, consolidation
    and harmonization of the LCA methodological basis occurred, primarily through
    the Life Cycle Initiative, the Ecoinvent database, and the ISO 14040 standard
    [127]. These events expanded the coverage to include more products and systems,
    with results disseminated through academic papers and government and industry
    reports [128]. The first set of LCA guidelines for agricultural production systems
    was developed as part of the “Harmonization of Environmental Life Cycle Assessment
    for Agriculture” project [129]. This project addressed the greater complexity
    inherent in the application of LCA to agricultural products due to multiple converging
    processes and factors. Subsequent efforts on LCA in agriculture led to biannual
    LCA Food international conferences, recognized as the “reference event for the
    LCA Food scientific community” [130]. LCA studies of agricultural and food systems
    continue to intensify, becoming a field of research to respond to growing public
    concern about climate change, biodiversity loss, and soil and water pollution
    in productive agricultural areas [128]. In 2012, the World Food LCA Database Project
    established stronger and more comprehensive guidelines for evaluating new environmental
    aspects [131]. Initiatives such as the Envi Food Protocol (Food SCP RT 2013) and
    the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) Pilot were launched to address the new
    stages of the life cycle of a food product [12]. Mitigating environmental damage
    to a greater extent became a central goal, capturing the interest of researchers
    who conducted studies on different agricultural production systems, including
    protected agriculture [132]. Valuable information on trade-offs between alternative
    agricultural processing, distribution, and consumption behaviors associated with
    food systems has been discussed and reported [133]. Similarly, data for the verification
    of environmental technologies, including food process wastewater treatment [134],
    formulation of forecast policies for public payments for organic production [135],
    sustainable comparison of specific goods of food choices [136], and improvements
    in eco-design [137,138], are available. In protected agriculture, LCA has promoted
    the study of innovative systems for sustainable greenhouse production, including
    the exchange of energy between the greenhouse and its associated building, as
    well as light and shade transmission processes [72]. LCA methodological development
    continues to this day, employing a variety of approaches to study the nutritional,
    environmental, economic, and social impacts of the agricultural sector under its
    different production systems. 4. Bibliometric Overview of LCA in Protected Agriculture
    Research on LCA applied to protected agriculture began more than 20 years ago,
    with its inception in 2000, marked by two publications (Figure 2). These initial
    publications explored the advances and potential of bioenergy from biomass crops
    in the United States and delved into the role of consumers in food purchases [120,139].
    In the first decade, scientific production exhibited variability, averaging less
    than five publications annually. Notably, no publications were reported between
    2001 and 2004. The inaugural study intrinsically linked to protected agriculture
    surfaced in 2005, introducing an LCA methodology encompassing various greenhouse
    types and emphasizing the benefits of hydroponic crops and recycled plastics [119].
    No papers were published in 2006 or 2007. The publication count in the first decade
    peaked in 2008 with four publications, followed by three in 2009 and one in 2010.
    Figure 2. Mapping of knowledge carried out by bibliometrics to the literature
    concerning LCA on protected agriculture in terms of annual production of publications;
    continents, countries, institutions, and most outstanding authors in scientific
    productivity; and central themes by continent—own elaboration. In the second decade
    of research on LCA in protected agriculture, the number of publications more than
    doubled compared with the first decade. However, the produc-tivity trend varied
    from year to year. We observed continuous growth in the number of publications
    over a three-year period, from 2010 to 2012, from one to five publications, and
    from 2016 to 2018, from seven to ten publications. The year with the largest scientific
    production was 2020, with fifteen publications, followed by 2019 and 2018, both
    with ten publications, and 2017, with nine publications. A minor decrease in publications
    was noted in 2021, with ten reported. Up to the current database search in 2022,
    four publi-cations have been found. Europe emerges as the leader in scientific
    productivity of LCA in protected agri-culture by continents, with Asia, America,
    Oceania, and Africa following suit (Figure 2). The top five countries are Spain,
    Italy, China, the United States, and Germany. The top five countries driving this
    productivity are Spain, Italy, China, the United States, and Germany. These observations
    align with the notion that Europe is a pioneer in protected or intensive greenhouse
    agriculture, boasting over 43% of the world’s greenhouse area [140,141]. Spain,
    France, Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands stand out with the largest areas of
    protected cultivation, with Spain leading at 71,783 hectares, notably concen-trated
    in agricultural regions such as Almeria province [142,143]. Examining the most
    prolific affiliations and authors per continent based on the number of publications
    reveals a notable focus on protected agriculture, urban agriculture, and sustainable
    agricultural production (Figure 2). European research centers its themes on urban
    agriculture, industrial ecology, rooftop greenhouses, and the circular economy
    applied to specific crops. Notably, Spain, Italy, and France are often featured
    in case studies exploring models for ecological compensation, environmental and
    economic cost–benefit analyses, and the evaluation of water and nutrient recirculation
    [59]. In Asia, research aligns with sustainable agriculture and environmental
    impact analysis for crops such as strawberries, wheat, tomatoes, sunflowers, and
    cucumbers. This research investigates greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprints,
    nitrogen footprints, pesticides, and solar energy sources [64,83]. The American
    continent, influenced by European research, has shown interest in rooftop greenhouse
    studies aimed at establishing urban gardening in commercial parks. Additionally,
    there is research on hydroponic and biogas systems to close cycles in greenhouse
    processes [38,70,97]. Oceania’s focus includes the adoption of algal biofertilizers
    for nutrient circularity, the evaluation of greenhouse typologies in various cropping
    environments, and the reuse of municipal wastewater [28,37]. Finally, African
    researchers have explored the limits and prospects for smallholders in protected
    vegetable cultivation, the use of stem residues for banana production, and innovations
    in cucumber irrigation using groundwater [43,75]. 5. Main Research Lines concerning
    LCA in Protected Agriculture The implementation of the random forest algorithm
    enabled the classification of group names into categories such as “water management”,
    “technology management”, “energy management”, and “impact measurement” (Figure
    3). These categorizations are derived from the prevailing themes within the clusters,
    potentially reflecting the research directions outlined below, deduced from the
    content of the publications, and the relevance of keywords (Figure S1). Figure
    3. Hierarchical clustering dendrogram for the 97 papers analyzed, where four clusters
    were obtained by cutting the tree at 13.4 Ward’s link distance between cluster
    groups. The word “techno” denotes technology. The numbering provided on the X-axis
    of the dendrogram indicates the publications that can be identified in Table S1—own
    elaboration. Efficient water management: This cluster focuses on optimizing water
    usage within greenhouse environments. Key considerations include addressing water
    scarcity [108], enhancing irrigation efficiency [3], ensuring water quality [43],
    managing leachate drainage [44], and mitigating the impacts of climate change
    [73]. Emphasis is placed on proper leachate management to facilitate reuse and
    prevent environmental concerns such as groundwater contamination. The integration
    of decision support systems and innovative irrigation technologies, such as smart
    irrigation, is a crucial avenue to significantly enhance efficiency and minimize
    costs. Technology management: This cluster delves into technologies aimed at reducing
    environmental impact and enhancing efficiency, particularly in regions with challenging
    climates. It encompasses strategies for achieving high-quality vegetable production
    in low-energy systems [13,16] and the use of alternative energy sources such as
    biomethane [47], biodiesel [57], wind power [38], and solar panels [64]. Efficient
    energy use: This cluster focuses on optimizing energy consumption for heating
    and transportation. Key aspects include initiatives to reduce fuel consumption
    [18] and design optimizations to minimize heat losses in structures [116]. Research
    within this cluster has investigated the environmental impact of tomato production
    and transportation on consumers [25] and explored diverse marketing methods for
    greenhouse vegetables [31]. Strategies to reduce transportation distances are
    considered crucial, with investigations into approaches such as urban agriculture,
    rooftop agriculture, and zero-mile agriculture [25,31,41]. Impact measurement:
    This group delves into evaluating the environmental footprint of various agricultural
    systems and practices. Research within this group includes analyzing the impact
    of cultivating various crops such as tomato [49], pepper [65], wheat [66], cucumber
    [67], apricot [80], lettuce, and barley [90]. Some studies have explored the combined
    impact of multiple species grown together, considering aspects such as recycling
    drainage effluents [29] or using urban and rooftop greenhouses [48]. 6. Technical
    Discussion of the Operability of the LCA 6.1. Goal and Scope Definition LCA emerges
    as a powerful tool not only for comprehensive comparisons between competing and
    potential systems but also for the optimization of existing systems. The successful
    achievement of results in an LCA is intrinsically linked to the precise formulation
    of the objectives and scope; therefore, this phase is an integral part of the
    LCA execution process and is interrelated with each of the subsequent phases [17].
    6.1.1. Goal The objectives of the LCA analysis should be clearly defined, encompassing
    the target audience, the context of the work performed, and the causal factors
    driving the LCA, along with the expected utility of the results [144,145]. These
    aspects facilitate the understanding of the findings, enabling different stakeholders
    to focus on specific and relevant aspects of the analyzed product or process [146].
    The current overview of the objectives in the reviewed literature is illustrated
    in Figure 4, which is consolidated into four main groups. Figure 4. Types of objectives
    identified and grouped in the LCA literature on protected agriculture—own elaboration.
    The first group focuses on comparative environmental studies that analyzed various
    greenhouse cultivation alternatives. For instance, it assesses climate optimization
    alternatives or diverse types of greenhouses, studies the efficiency of water
    and fertilizer use in soilless cropping systems, explores the integration of various
    renewable energy sources, and examines pest and disease management strategies.
    These studies propose viable alternatives to mitigate the environmental impacts
    associated with conventional intensive agricultural production [147]. The second
    group comprises publications that conducted descriptive environmental studies,
    aiming to propose production strategies with a circularity approach under greenhouses.
    This approach enhances the utilization of waste generated in agricultural production.
    Likewise, researchers have identified studies that aim to increase crop yields
    and improve consumption habits to reduce the negative environmental impact generated
    during the commercialization phase of the food supply chain [148]. The third group
    encompasses studies that aimed to compare production in open fields and greenhouses,
    analyzing various irrigation and fertilization management strategies, along with
    the impact of diverse climatic conditions. As for the fourth group, we identified
    reports that analyzed the food supply chain from both an environmental perspective
    and the socio-environmental standpoint of the water–energy–food nexus. This context
    has recently gained significant attention in international science and policy
    to promote integrated resource management and sustainability [84,149]. 6.1.2.
    Scope The scope of LCA can be categorized into descriptive analyses, comparative
    analyses, or combinations of both (Figure 5). Descriptive analysis aims to identify
    environmental burdens in the production process of a product or service, whereas
    comparative analyses seek differences in environmental loads within modified or
    optimized processes. Figure 5. Scope types identified in the LCA literature on
    protected agriculture—own elaboration. In the scope of comparative analyses, constituting
    67.8%, studies such as He et al. [83] compare conventional and organic tomato
    production under greenhouse conditions. While reporting that organic production
    yields up to 54% less environmental impact than conventional methods, this study
    stresses the need to optimize the use and conditions of organic fertilizers to
    limit soil ecotoxicity. Similarly, Martínez-Blanco et al. [110] compared tomato
    production in open fields and greenhouses by examining fertilization practices
    using mineral fertilizers and compost. They found that greenhouse production can
    increase by up to 50% compared with open fields, albeit with higher resource and
    energy requirements during construction. Additionally, using compost in the greenhouse
    can replace part of the mineral nutrition and reduce environmental impacts on
    open-field cultivation. The descriptive scope, representing 27.8%, includes works
    describing environmental loads in the production of certain foods in greenhouses
    [72]. Research also focuses on evaluating environmentally friendly technologies
    to identify innovation priorities for agricultural production [107]. Regarding
    studies of combined scope, accounting for 4.4%, their objective is to showcase
    reduced environmental impact through process optimization or innovation. Hosseini-Fashami
    et al. [55] assessed the energy use and life cycle of strawberries under greenhouse
    conditions and found that integrating solar technologies reduces negative environmental
    impacts by at least 16% compared with diesel fuel. 6.1.3. Types of Food Products
    Analyzed The products under analysis in each study were categorized into eight
    groups, as illustrated in Figure 6. Among these, tomatoes emerged as the most
    extensively studied product, featured in 42 of the analyzed papers. Other vegetables,
    including chard, spinach, and eggplant, were the subject of 10 studies, while
    cucumbers, lettuce, and peppers were each examined in 8, 7, and 4 studies, respectively.
    Consequently, the total number of studies dedicated to the analysis of horticultural
    products reached 71. This trend likely stems from the realization that both low-
    and high-tech greenhouse horticulture engenders various environmental impacts,
    posing a significant threat to sustainability [150]. Consequently, there is a
    growing emphasis within the scientific community, among producers and consumers,
    on the evaluation and transparent communication of these impacts. This extends
    beyond understanding them to actively seeking strategies for optimizing production
    systems to mitigate these environmental burdens [90]. Figure 6. Types of food
    products studied in the LCA literature on protected agriculture—own elaboration.
    We also identified 21 studies addressing other types of products, such as bananas,
    citrus fruits, tilapia grown in aquaponic systems, beans in covered greenhouses,
    and beans in open-field greenhouses. Furthermore, four studies focused on strawberries,
    and an additional four explored cut and ornamental flowers as well as potted plants.
    Notably, considering the global significance of greenhouse flower production,
    the number of publications in this domain remains comparatively low. Despite ongoing
    investigations into strategies for enhancing flower quality and yield, there appears
    to be limited interest in analyzing their environmental impacts [116,151,152].
    6.1.4. System Boundaries System boundaries present a formidable challenge for
    LCA because they require meticulous establishment of the limits for the analyzed
    system, service, or product. This requires a rigorous definition of each activity,
    input, and unitary process integral to the analysis [35]. Figure 7 illustrates
    the breakdown of approaches found in the collected papers, with 37% of the papers
    delineating the system from cradle to gate. In this comprehensive approach, LCA
    encompasses everything from procuring and extracting basic raw materials to production,
    harvesting, and, at times, packaging or packing of the final product. Figure 7.
    System boundaries in the LCA literature on protected agriculture—own elaboration.
    The gate-to-gate approach was followed closely and adopted by 17% of the studies.
    This approach focuses solely on activities within the production nucleus, disregarding
    the entry of raw materials to the farm, the end-use of the final product, and
    the waste generated during production. These two approaches, both cradle-to-gate
    and gate-to-gate, have been widely favored for analyzing environmental impacts
    on various industries, including agriculture [153]. They prove particularly effective
    for evaluating the environmental performance of technological changes implemented
    in production processes, a common occurrence in covered agriculture where multiple
    technological options exist for food production [49]. A subset of papers, constituting
    15%, narrowed the LCA to “cradle to consumption”. This approach typically excludes
    consideration of the product’s final use, limiting the analysis to the point of
    delivery to a wholesale or retail market or when the consumer makes the purchase,
    irrespective of the product’s eventual use or disposal. Lastly, 8% of the papers
    embraced a cradle-to-grave approach, comprehensively examining impacts at each
    stage of a product’s life cycle—from raw material extraction and processing to
    production, harvesting, transformation, transportation, product use, and, ultimately,
    disposal [154]. 6.1.5. Functional Unit Establishing a functional unit is pivotal
    for constructing and modeling a product system in LCA. This unit quantifies the
    product’s function and serves as a crucial reference point for all impact assessment
    calculations in both descriptive and comparative studies [83,144]. The functional
    unit can be derived from various product characteristics, primarily those related
    to the production system [155]. In agriculture, the unit of mass of the final
    product, such as 1 mg, 1 g, 1 kg, or 1 ton of the product, is commonly chosen,
    as indicated in Figure 8. Over half of the studies opt for functional units of
    this typology, referred to as product quantity, with kg and tons of the product
    being predominant. Figure 8. Functional units in the LCA literature on protected
    agriculture—own elaboration. Nevertheless, in some studies, the definition of
    a functional unit varies based on the objective and system limits. For instance,
    four studies designate the unit of the product as the functional unit. Bonaguro
    et al. [79] considered a single plant in its 14 cm pot as a functional unit, revealing
    that substituting 10% expanded perlite for 10% fresh rice husks can reduce the
    environmental impact of cyclamen pot production without compromising the quality
    of the final product. Another study by Canaj et al. [49] used one hectare of tomatoes
    grown under an unheated greenhouse in Albania as the functional unit. The authors
    concluded that these results could serve as a “springboard” for detailing and
    quantifying the environmental impacts of other crops and as a foundation for extending
    sustainability thinking in agricultural production. Approximately 10% of the studies
    used the amount of product obtained per unit of harvested area or simply the amount
    of product obtained, indicating yield and productivity. These studies focused
    on comparing the environmental impact of different cultivation systems in rooftop
    greenhouses and plastic waste generated in greenhouses across various parts of
    the European Union. About 3.3% of studies used water and energy resources as functional
    units, basing their analysis on resource consumption. These studies compared the
    environmental impacts of greenhouse air-conditioning and the water footprint resulting
    from different irrigation methodologies and growing systems. Additionally, 2.2%
    of studies adopted the cost of the product as a functional unit. This scenario
    arises, for example, when comparing a conventional greenhouse tomato production
    system with a greenhouse cultivation system equipped with photovoltaic panels.
    In such cases, the authors mention that the functional unit is generated to have
    a monetary basis for integrating crop production and electricity, enabling the
    analysis of a system that produces goods with different commercial values [64].
    Finally, we noted that almost a third of the studies did not specify the functional
    units of the LCA. 6.2. Life Cycle Inventory Inventory analysis involves collecting
    information from sources, creating flowcharts, and applying calculation methods
    [83,144]. These steps enable the accurate estimation of relevant inputs and outputs
    associated with a product and its system [104]. Sources can be primary (measured
    in situ or through field surveys) or secondary (database) [83,144]. In LCA applied
    to protected agriculture, several databases were used, such as GaBi from Germany
    [156], CLCD from China [157], NREL-USLCI from the USA [158], Ecoinvent from Switzerland
    [159], LCA Food from Denmark [160], and ELCD from Europe [161]. Most studies clarify
    whether the calculation of potential environmental impacts can refer to the global,
    regional, or site scale. Furthermore, some studies fully describe the assumptions
    made regarding agricultural production. We identified five categories within inventory
    analysis, as shown in Figure 9. Among these categories, the most frequently reported
    was the use of fertilizer and pesticides, followed by water use and greenhouse
    infrastructure. The categories of energy consumption for air-conditioning and
    harvesting, post-harvest, and commercialization are also reported. Figure 9. Inputs
    from inventory analysis in the LCA literature on protected agriculture—own elaboration.
    6.2.1. Water Consumption Water depletion, a crucial environmental impact category
    in LCA, aims to curtail crop water consumption [66]. A transformative strategy
    to achieve this is the digitization of agriculture, which provides real-time insights
    into water inputs and outputs throughout the crop growth cycle. This involves
    harnessing data from soil moisture sensors, infrared plant images, and water meters
    [162]. Ensuring a genuine and verifiable water inventory over the crop cycle is
    imperative for precisely assessing the water footprint and devising strategies
    for enhanced water management [36]. Detecting inefficiencies in irrigation water
    usage is critical for implementing intelligent irrigation practices, which, despite
    initial investment costs, yield substantial benefits in terms of water conservation
    and reduced energy for water pumping [27,38]. Diverse techniques can be employed
    to reduce crop water demand. Controlled-environment agriculture, such as aquaponics
    and hydroponics, has emerged as a promising solution because of its high productivity
    and minimal use of soil and water [38]. Using rainwater for irrigation reduces
    reliance on the water supply network, while reclaimed water offers an alternative
    to address water scarcity [43]. In addition, desalinated seawater can help alleviate
    aquifer overexploitation, albeit with a caveat—the environmental impact hinges
    on the sustainability of the desalination or wastewater treatment process, particularly
    in terms of clean energy use [29]. While agronomists traditionally measure water
    use efficiency in absolute volumes, a recent method rooted in LCA provides a comprehensive
    perspective. This method gauges water footprints in terms of freshwater scarcity,
    considering the nature of the water source, whether it is treated wastewater,
    groundwater, or desalinated water for irrigation [99]. 6.2.2. Use of Fertilizers
    and Pesticides Analyzing the entry of fertilizers and pesticides into LCA involves
    systematically collecting data on material flows, energy, and emissions throughout
    the production, transportation, use, and disposal of these substances in protected
    agricultural systems [163]. Efficiency in using fertilizers and pesticides within
    protected agriculture is pivotal for mitigating adverse impacts, including increased
    nutrient leaching, greenhouse gas emissions, and excessive water and energy consumption
    [37,50,164]. Achieving this involves determining optimal dosages and carefully
    selecting products and application methods. Recent research has presented promising
    alternatives to reduce the dosage of fertilizers and pesticides. Firstly, the
    application of organic amendments, such as plant waste and composted animal manure,
    emerges as a standout option. These amendments contribute to soil carbon sequestration
    and enhance crop productivity by providing nutrients, thereby maintaining fertility
    and structural stability [68,80]. However, proper treatment is crucial to prevent
    the transmission of pathogens, the diffusion of hormonal substances, or the spread
    of antibiotic-resistant genes [83]. In this context, the ‘One Health’ approach
    gains relevance, promoting balanced well-being among humans, animals, and the
    environment in managing organic amendments [122]. Secondly, the use of microbial
    inoculants with metabolic capacities that promote plant growth is noteworthy not
    only to replace mineral fertilizer doses but also to mitigate the effects of abiotic
    and biotic stresses on crops [165,166,167]. Based on the meta-analyses reported
    so far, Pseudomonas is the most effective bacterial genus for improving crop yields
    by alleviating stress, while Enterobacter is the most effective for improving
    plant nutrient availability [165,166,167,168]. In terms of crops, these two genera
    have the greatest beneficial effect on horticultural crops. Also highlighted are
    endophytic microorganisms that live in the plant tissue of various fruits, vegetables,
    and medicinal plants. These can generate phenotypic benefits from seed germination,
    fruit development, and even the post-harvest period. The most prominent endophytic
    bacterial genera are Burkholderia and Azospirillum [165,166,167,169,170]. Additionally,
    microbial inoculants serve as useful biological seed treatments, counteracting
    chemical seed treatments and improving seed germination, seedling emergence, plant
    biomass, and crop yield [122,171,172]. All these virtues of the use of microbial
    inoculants translate into LCA in the reduction of the environmental impact of
    agricultural production in terms of mineral extraction, eutrophication and aquatic
    ecotoxicity, acidification, and global warming. [4,173]. Thirdly, the use of bioactive
    plant substances, such as tansy flower extract, has been highlighted as an effective
    alternative for pest control in horticultural systems [174]. Furthermore, microbial
    inoculants of the genus Bacillus have proven to be bioalternatives with numerous
    benefits in pest control [175,176]. This approach helps avoid negative impacts
    on biodiversity and ecosystem health, contributing to more sustainable and ecologically
    responsible greenhouse agriculture without compromising productivity. 6.2.3. Greenhouse
    Structure Within the LCA framework, this category typically encompasses all aspects
    related to greenhouse infrastructure, including foundations, structures, enclosures,
    climate control equipment, and even the energy and man-hours consumed during construction
    [90]. The diversity of greenhouse typologies used globally, coupled with the varying
    scales and technologies employed in each country, makes this category highly heterogeneous—ranging
    from small to large scale and low to high technology [4]. Incorporating the greenhouse
    structure into the LCA analysis is crucial as it provides an opportunity to pinpoint
    strategic areas for improvements to reduce environmental impact. Potential enhancements
    include the use of more sustainable materials and the integration of environmentally
    friendly technologies [177]. It is worth noting that some authors opt to exclude
    infrastructure from the analysis because of challenges in obtaining accurate inventory
    data from builders or manufacturers. They argue that, given the long useful lives
    of many structural components, their contribution to environmental impact may
    not be as significant compared to other inputs [178]. The greenhouse structure
    often poses the most significant environmental impact concerning global warming
    and abiotic depletion. Primarily, this is attributed to the extraction of minerals
    and fossil fuels for raw materials like steel, concrete, and plastic, leading
    to substantial CO2 emissions [179]. Studies have quantified that these structural
    materials contribute up to 35% and 47% to these impact categories in low-tech
    greenhouses [100,101]. In high-tech greenhouses, the contribution to global warming
    is around 10%, driven by greenhouse gas emissions and the high energy consumption
    during the manufacturing of materials such as aluminum and glass—key components
    of venlo-type greenhouses [179]. The distinction between greenhouse types is significantly
    influenced by the equipment and energy used for heating, lighting, and cooling,
    which are common practices in high-tech greenhouses [180]. 6.2.4. Energy Consumption
    in Air-Conditioning In LCA, the energy consumption associated with air-conditioning
    emerges as a critical factor, particularly in production systems featuring high-tech
    greenhouses and regions with extreme climatic conditions preventing traditional
    agricultural practices [32]. In such scenarios, these advanced greenhouses exhibit
    a substantial environmental impact compared with their low-tech counterparts and
    open-field crops. Despite the benefits of climate control and enhanced efficiency
    in agricultural production, high-tech greenhouses significantly contribute to
    the environment, primarily because of the consumption of fossil fuels and electrical
    energy for heating and cooling operations [181,182]. The continual need for energy
    to sustain optimal climatic conditions results in a noteworthy carbon footprint,
    elevating greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to the broader challenge of
    climate change. Consequently, ensuring the sustainability of high-tech greenhouses
    becomes imperative, necessitating the adoption of eco-friendly practices and the
    advancement of renewable energy sources to alleviate their environmental impact
    [183]. Venlo greenhouses, a prevalent type of high-tech greenhouse, exhibit climate
    control activities as major contributors to impact indicators related to global
    warming, air acidification, abiotic depletion, eutrophication, and photochemical
    oxidation, constituting 81–97% of these indicators [144]. However, the extent
    of these impacts is contingent on the type of energy used for climate control
    and improvements in the energy efficiency of associated systems. Torrellas et
    al. [183] demonstrated that in a Venlo-type greenhouse with an electrical cogeneration
    system, electricity production exceeded the greenhouse’s needs, resulting in negative
    values for the eutrophication impact indicator. Current efforts to address the
    negative environmental impacts associated with high-tech greenhouses concentrate
    on innovations aimed at optimizing the thermal insulation of materials used in
    their roofs and enclosures [72]. Furthermore, strides have been made in adopting
    sustainable energy sources, such as solar and geothermal energy, to fulfill greenhouse
    air-conditioning needs [64]. A noteworthy recent development involves the construction
    of greenhouses on urban building roofs, capitalizing on residual energy from domestic
    activities and building thermal comfort, leading to enhanced energy efficiency
    [70]. 6.2.5. Harvesting, Post-Harvesting, and Commercialization Harvesting, post-harvest,
    and commercialization processes encompass several activities, with transportation,
    packaging, and drying playing pivotal roles in LCA considerations. The impact
    of transporting goods from farms to retailers or consumers is substantial, influencing
    fuel use and metrics such as carbon footprint, fuel consumption, global warming
    potential, carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq), and fossil fuel depletion. However,
    quantifying transportation poses a challenge in LCA due to its complexity, marked
    by diverse modes and means influenced by spatial and temporal variations [184].
    While some studies model transportation, a significant portion of LCA analyses
    in protected agriculture opt to overlook this stage, citing data scarcity and
    associated complexities [171]. In the realm of protected agriculture, only 12.4%
    of LCA studies address the impact of transporting and distributing food products.
    The energy efficiency of transportation, contingent on vehicle types, is a crucial
    aspect. Urbano et al. [25] conducted a life cycle analysis on eight scenarios
    of fresh tomato supply to urban consumers, revealing that long transportation
    distances from production sites to supermarkets exert the highest environmental
    impact on global warming. Lorries, especially those meeting EURO 6 standards with
    a 32-ton capacity, are typically used for long-distance tomato transport. Conversely,
    lorries with a capacity of 3.5–7 tons are employed for shorter distances. Pineda
    et al. [41] found that rooftop greenhouses in urban areas outperform conventional
    rural greenhouses because they produce tomatoes with a lower environmental impact
    due to reduced transportation distances and smaller heat losses during colder
    months. The environmental impact of air transport warrants careful evaluation,
    especially considering its potential harm to certain products. In Switzerland,
    where 51%–60% of fruits and vegetables are imported, Stoessel et al. [106] emphasize
    that reducing food transportation distances is the most effective means of reducing
    environmental impact. Consumption of seasonal produce from local sources is advocated,
    with air transport particularly discouraged due to its disproportionately high
    environmental impact. Packaging and drying activities contribute to the environmental
    burden, necessitating the exploration of (bio)alternatives, especially for materials
    with high carbon emissions and dependencies on fossil energy. While packaging
    consumption is addressed in a mere 2.1% of agricultural production system LCA
    analyses, exploring recycled boxes and promoting direct consumption can circumvent
    the need for cardboard, wood, and polypropylene packaging. Post-harvest drying,
    mentioned in only 1% of studies, amplifies energy demand but concurrently reduces
    the impact of climate change, as highlighted by Bosona et al. [68], emphasizing
    the benefits of drying organic tomatoes in terms of reducing product losses and
    enhancing shelf life. 6.3. Life Cycle Impact Assessment Life cycle impact assessment
    is a pivotal stage in LCA, translating collected data into a nuanced array of
    potential impacts strategically weighted through category indicators. This approach
    offers practitioners and decision makers a deep insight into the negative consequences
    of resource use and associated emissions [83,144]. In practice, this phase involves
    classification, characterization, normalization, and weighting. While the first
    two are mandatory, normalization and weighting are considered optional components
    of this third phase [83,144]. The classification step entails identifying the
    impact assessment method, often relying on established methods such as CML (including
    versions like CML 2 baseline 2000 V2/world and CML 2000), ISO 14044 (2006), ISO
    14040, and IPCC 2001 GWP 100 [144,185]. In the characterization phase, impact
    categories are selected, and the environmental impact on each category is quantified.
    Figure 10 illustrates the most frequently reported impact categories in the studies.
    Eutrophication potential and global warming potential were the most utilized,
    with 55 and 54 papers, respectively. Acidification potential and human toxicity
    potential had 49 and 34 papers, respectively, while ozone and abiotic depletion
    potential were featured in 31 and 28 papers, respectively. The subsequent subsections
    provide detailed descriptions of these six impact categories. Figure 10. Impact
    categories most considered in the LCA literature on protected agriculture—own
    elaboration. The increasing need to identify the most pertinent impact categories
    and achieve unambiguous results has spurred additional research into normalization
    and weighting [83,144,186]. Normalization offers insights into the relative significance
    of impacts, enhancing the interpretation of the results. Various approaches to
    normalization exist and are categorized as follows: global normalization, production-based
    normalization, and consumption-based normalization [83,187]. Despite notable strides
    in normalization approach development, several questions remain. Crucial inquiries
    involve methodological disparities between the studied and reference systems,
    alignment of the spatial extension of the reference system with the system under
    study, and alignment of the reference year with the study year [188]. The weighting
    process facilitates the ranking of alternatives and aids stakeholders in making
    informed decisions. Over the last few decades, various weighting sets have been
    developed. Different techniques are available for normalization weighting: (i)
    binary weighting (for zero weights or equal weights); (ii) panel weighting, involving
    the consideration of opinions of stakeholders and experts; (iii) monetary weighting;
    and (iv) distance to target, where weighting factors depend on the distance between
    the current impact level and a desired state based on regulations [144,189]. The
    weighting process is challenging because the composition of the panel or the design
    of the questionnaire may influence the weighting factors. Therefore, it is advantageous,
    if possible, to apply different weighting methods to verify the robustness of
    the study’s conclusions [83,186]. 6.3.1. Eutrophication Potential Eutrophication
    potential involves the augmentation of nutrients in soil or water, with nitrogen
    and phosphorus being the primary contributors to this enrichment. The surplus
    nutrients lead to the overgrowth of algae and plants. In aquatic environments,
    this excessive proliferation of microorganisms causes oxygen depletion and reduced
    penetration of solar energy. Consequently, it contaminates plants and groundwater,
    contributing to terrestrial eutrophication [190]. This review uncovered notable
    results, particularly in recent years, where studies have compared production
    in open fields with that in conventional and indoor greenhouses. For instance,
    Martínez-Blanco et al. [110] found that tomato production in open fields has an
    eutrophication-related environmental burden up to 57% higher than that in greenhouses.
    Similarly, Page et al. [99] reported a greater environmental impact of growing
    tomatoes in open fields and low-tech greenhouse production systems than in medium-
    and high-tech greenhouses. Payen et al. [96] noted that the tomato crop produced
    in Morocco and marketed in France significantly contributes to freshwater eutrophication,
    accounting for 66% of the impact, mainly due to phosphate emissions during fertilizer
    production, while the manufacturing of containers and transportation contributed
    20% and 12%, respectively. Regarding rooftop greenhouses, Muñoz-Lieza et al. [32]
    concluded that this alternative for horticultural production in highly populated
    cities requires structural improvements and enhancements in roof materials to
    halve the current environmental impact associated with potential water eutrophication,
    both sweet and salty. Additional studies have concentrated on optimizing water
    usage, cropping systems, and fertilizer application. Martín-Gorriz et al. [29]
    suggested that a significant reduction of up to 72% in the eutrophication potential
    is attainable through the implementation of hydroponic growing systems with leachate
    treatments. Similarly, Canaj et al. [27] indicated that employing smart irrigation
    systems in protected Mediterranean agriculture could reduce eutrophication by
    up to 15% compared with the current situation. 6.3.2. Global Warming Potential
    Global warming potential serves as an indicator that measures the overall impact
    of a process by assessing the absorption of thermal radiation in the atmosphere
    caused by the emission of greenhouse gases associated with that process [191].
    The analysis of global warming potential quantifies the contribution of greenhouse
    gases to climate change, encompassing various activities such as energy consumption
    for maintaining optimal microclimatic conditions, energy use linked to resource
    consumption, and waste and emissions management from specific agricultural practices
    [192]. This metric plays a key role in conducting a comprehensive environmental
    assessment of indoor agricultural production [193]. Greenhouse agricultural activities
    have substantially contributed to the global warming impact category [105]. Whether
    it is the production of structures, the implementation of automated technologies,
    the selection of materials, or specific growing practices, each stage in the greenhouse
    supply chain and operation significantly influences greenhouse gas emissions [101,194].
    The assessment of global warming potential in protected agriculture reveals noteworthy
    findings when comparing various systems with different technological levels. For
    instance, fully automated, climate-controlled greenhouses used in urban agriculture
    exhibit lower environmental performance than conventional plastic-covered greenhouses.
    These structures yield values of 2.59 kg (CO2 eq) for tomatoes and 26.51 kg (CO2
    eq) for lettuce, in contrast to 0.59 kg (CO2 eq) and 0.92 kg (CO2 eq) in conventional
    greenhouses [82]. Similarly, the roof greenhouse, despite its operational efficiency
    with automated technologies, shows an environmental load between 21% and 66% higher
    in the heating potential category than conventional glass and ethylene-vinyl acetate
    plastic film greenhouses. This increase is primarily attributed to the energy
    considerations associated with automation and air-conditioning [32]. In the context
    of supply chains, the transportation of tomato crops from the Mediterranean to
    export European markets has emerged as a noteworthy contributor to climate change,
    representing 44% of the impact for tomatoes transported from Morocco to France.
    Concurrently, the cultivation of tomatoes in climate-controlled greenhouses in
    France significantly contributes to the climate change impact, with a notable
    share of 45%. This substantial contribution is primarily associated with CO2 emissions
    incurred during the manufacturing processes of greenhouse components and the electricity
    consumption for fertigation and irrigation [96]. These findings align closely
    with those reported by Bojacá et al. [101], except for the non-heated greenhouses
    used in Colombia for tomato production. In soilless cropping systems, particularly
    ornamental crops, the acquisition and transportation of peat have been identified
    as significant contributors to global warming, accounting for 66% of the impact.
    In contrast, expanded perlite and rice husk make minor contributions at 8.5% and
    8%, respectively. Therefore, when selecting substrates, it is important to consider
    environmental aspects alongside technical suitability [79]. In the context of
    greenhouse banana production, approximately 55% of the global warming impact is
    attributed to the incineration of crop residues. Adopting practices such as implementing
    biogas to heat irrigation water in this greenhouse crop can reduce the environmental
    footprint by up to 5% compared with scenarios where irrigation water is heated
    with natural gas [46]. 6.3.3. Acidification Potential Acidification potential
    is an indicator of the impact of acidifying emissions throughout the agricultural
    life cycle [195]. This metric gauges the capacity of compounds, such as sulfur
    and nitrogen oxides, to induce acidity in their surroundings [43]. In the realm
    of greenhouse LCA, potential acidification is influenced by various components
    of the production system. Notably, the application of nitrogen-based fertilizers,
    especially those containing ammonium and nitrate ions, plays a significant role
    in potential acidification [196]. Additionally, the type of energy used in greenhouse
    climate control, particularly if it involves the consumption of fossil fuels,
    can contribute to emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, thereby contributing
    to phenomena such as acid rain and the acidification of natural resources [197].
    A thorough investigation by Canaj et al. [49], focusing on a greenhouse tomato
    plantation in Albania, identified ammonia volatilization as the primary contributor
    to fine particle formation and soil acidification potential. The authors underscored
    the importance of factoring in geographical and site-specific elements in LCA
    studies for more precise assessments of the environmental impacts linked to tomato
    and other greenhouse crop production. One potential solution to alleviate these
    issues could involve the adoption of intelligent irrigation and fertilization
    systems, contributing to a 5% reduction in the potential for acidification compared
    with traditional irrigation systems [27]. Likewise, an analysis of the supply
    chain has identified that transportation activities to the end market contribute
    up to 50% of the total impact in the land acidification category. Following closely
    are fertilization and pest and disease management activities with 39%, and finally,
    post-harvest or processing activities such as packaging with 10% [96]. The impact
    during transportation is mainly attributed to nitrogen oxide emissions generated
    by truck transportation. Moreover, sulfur dioxide emissions, which are related
    to fertigation, fertilizer production, and energy consumption, also play a prominent
    role. In comparison, slightly newer technologies involving the use of rooftop
    greenhouses proved to be a more sustainable option, generating 10% less environmental
    burden compared to the heated glass greenhouse in terms of potential acidification.
    However, it is worth mentioning that this technology exhibited a 33.3% increase
    in potential acidification compared with the ethylene-vinyl acetate plastic film
    greenhouse [32]. Finally, in crop fertilization activities, it has been observed
    that potential acidification can be up to three times greater in heated greenhouses
    than in simple, unheated tunnels. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions
    cause this increase [109]. These variations are mainly attributed to the implementation
    of automation technologies and the choice of energy-efficient roofing materials.
    This automation approach has significantly contributed to operational efficiency,
    and the careful selection of roof materials has positively impacted the reduction
    of energy consumption. 6.3.4. Human Toxicity Potential Human toxicity potential
    is a commonly employed metric in LCA, serving to quantify the inherent toxicity
    burden associated with emissions from a process or product [191]. Within greenhouse
    agriculture, the potential for human toxicity is linked to the use of agrochemicals,
    including pesticides and fertilizers. The application of these chemicals can result
    in residues in crops or contamination of soil and water, posing a risk of toxicity
    for humans consuming the cultivated products [192]. Additionally, the manufacturing
    process of raw materials for greenhouse construction and the use of fossil fuels
    for air-conditioning contribute to the negative environmental impact quantified
    in this category [109]. It is noteworthy that LCA analyses integrating toxicology
    with greenhouse production are still limited due to differences of opinion among
    various authors and a lack of consensus on the methodology for pesticide evaluation
    [183]. Studies addressing this impact category reveal that in heated greenhouses,
    tomato cultivation with air-conditioning practices contributes five times more
    to human toxicity than tunnels for soil cultivation and multi-tunnel greenhouses
    for soilless cultivation. However, when examining the impact derived from pesticide
    use, it was observed that this impact is 5 and 22 times higher in tunnel cultivation
    with soil compared with multi-tunnel greenhouse and heated greenhouse scenarios
    [109]. Bojacá et al. [101] reported that in Colombian greenhouses used for tomato
    production, pest and disease control practices contribute up to 45% of the impact
    in this category. Furthermore, implementing climate-smart agriculture practices
    has been shown to reduce the impacts of this category by up to 12% through precise
    control of irrigation and fertilization [27]. Therefore, adopting responsible
    environmental practices in plant nutrition and the management of chemical agents
    for pest control is essential to mitigate the negative impacts of greenhouse production
    [82]. 6.3.5. Ozone Depletion The ozone depletion potential is an environmental
    indicator that reflects the reduction of the Earth’s ozone layer in the atmosphere.
    This phenomenon is associated with the presence of halocarbons, which are compounds
    that break down ozone molecules and contribute to ozone layer depletion. The consequences
    include increased radiation, including ultraviolet radiation, reaching the Earth’s
    surface, potentially leading to various climatic alterations with implications
    for ecosystems and human health [193]. Greenhouse production contributes to ozone
    depletion primarily through the use of ozone-depleting substances. Certain refrigerants,
    solvents, and blowing agents employed in greenhouse air-conditioning and thermal
    insulation systems may contain chlorofluorocarbons and halons [194]. When released
    into the environment, these substances can reach the stratosphere, decomposing
    and releasing chlorine and bromine atoms that participate in ozone-depleting chemical
    reactions [195]. Additionally, the excessive or inappropriate use of specific
    fertilizers containing nitrogen compounds can result in the emission of nitrogen
    oxides [192]. In greenhouses, the ozone depletion potential can be reduced by
    up to 40% compared with that in open fields when proper fertilization practices
    are employed [90,110]. Similarly, the combustion of fossil fuels such as natural
    gas or oil, which are used in air-conditioning, tillage, and transportation, can
    release chemical substances such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Activities
    in greenhouses contribute between 10% and 60% to the ozone depletion potential
    [90,109]. 6.3.6. Abiotic Depletion The abiotic depletion potential is centered
    on measuring the use of non-renewable resources such as minerals and fossil fuels
    throughout the entire lifecycle of greenhouse production [196]. A typical use
    of abiotic depletion potential is to tackle direct reliance on non-renewable resources
    [197]. A lower abiotic depletion potential value not only signifies decreased
    strain on these resources, implying more environmentally friendly practices but
    also acts as a crucial tool for making strategic decisions to enhance the efficiency
    of agricultural production [198]. Abiotic depletion, particularly during the fertilization
    stage, has emerged as a crucial factor in the environmental impact of tomato and
    other vegetable production, contributing up to 30% to this category [101,110].
    Moreover, elements such as galvanized structures and steel cables in metal greenhouses
    can impact abiotic depletion by 16%. The introduction of recirculation systems
    adds significant variability, as both the infrastructure supporting crops and
    water recirculation can contribute up to 40% to this impact. Key materials such
    as polyethylene covers, polypropylene in gutters and doors, and mosquito nets
    also exert a notable influence, emphasizing the importance of considering various
    aspects of greenhouse design and operation [119]. Abiotic depletion resulting
    from energy consumption ranges between 30% and 35%, emphasizing the pressing need
    for energy-efficient strategies in greenhouse agricultural practices [55,89].
    In the particular scenario of tomato production in suburban Beijing, a comparison
    between conventional and organic farming systems reveals intriguing trends. While
    the organic system requires 31.5% less non-renewable energy resources, there is
    a noticeable 1.73% increase in water depletion. Furthermore, the land area expansion
    for organic production is 29.98% higher compared to conventional production [83].
    These findings emphasize the importance of identifying sustainable trade-offs
    between resource demand and territorial expansion in organic agriculture. In the
    specific context of greenhouse fertigation techniques for tomato cultivation,
    a noteworthy contribution to abiotic depletion is observed, particularly in the
    category of metal depletion. The greenhouse structure, which is characterized
    by a significant use of iron, and the fertigation system are the primary drivers
    of this impact [29]. Tomato cultivation accounts for 34% of this impact, which
    is primarily attributed to the plastic used to cover the greenhouse [96]. In different
    crops, such as apricots cultivated in greenhouses, the structure, irrigation system,
    and canopy material can contribute up to 100% to abiotic depletion [80]. Similarly,
    studies focused on green bean production have revealed significant results, with
    abiotic depletion values up to 10 times higher in open fields than in greenhouse
    systems, primarily due to low efficiency in the use of water and fertilizers [105].
    When considering greenhouse construction materials, wood and plastic greenhouses
    emerge as environmentally favorable options, displaying up to 30% less impact
    in the abiotic depletion category compared with metal and glass greenhouses [119].
    Consequently, the selection of materials and cultivation methods significantly
    influences the environmental sustainability and efficiency of greenhouse agricultural
    systems. 6.4. Interpretation Ensuring robust and reliable information for investors
    and stakeholders in greenhouse agriculture requires thoughtful methodological
    decisions during the LCA interpretation phase [199]. These decisions should prioritize
    transparency, thorough documentation, and consideration of the specific context
    and objectives of the analysis, aiming for a comprehensive assessment of the environmental
    sustainability of the studied agricultural system [200]. Moreover, addressing
    uncertainties through sensitivity analysis and scenario assessments becomes crucial,
    given the inherent variability in agricultural processes. Agriculture stands out
    as a sector with particularly uncertain impact results due to the natural variability
    involved in its processes, making the evaluation of uncertainty a mandatory necessity
    [201]. The aim of interpreting LCA results is to extract valuable insights and
    offer a succinct summary of both inventory analysis and impact assessment outcomes
    [185]. Beyond mere information provision, this phase plays a crucial role in delivering
    practical recommendations to enhance sustainability and mitigate the environmental
    impact of protected agricultural systems. A pivotal consideration guiding the
    interpretation phase is frequently the identification of inputs or impact categories
    that underscore the unique challenges within the region under study. Presently,
    this phase relies heavily on the water–energy– food nexus approach, a comprehensive
    framework that tackles the vital interconnections between these key elements in
    greenhouse agriculture [84]. Concerning LCA studies with uncertainty analysis,
    we observed that there are not many of them and that stochastic modeling or a
    probabilistic approach using numerical methods is the prevailing way to deal with
    uncertainty. We highlight the study by Romero-Gámez et al. [77]. They conducted
    a quantitative uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo simulation to compare the
    environmental impacts of three cultivation scenarios: greenhouse, screenhouse,
    and open field. The results emphasized that the manufacturing of steel structures,
    production of perlite, use of high-density polyethylene plastics, and consumption
    of electricity for irrigation and fertilization generated the greatest environmental
    impacts. The greenhouse scenario showed the greatest impact in most categories,
    being up to 96% greater than the scenarios with a screenhouse and open field in
    terms of eutrophication. The identification of these burdens allowed valuable
    conclusions to be drawn for improving environmental performance in protected agricultural
    systems, underscoring the importance of considering both methodological decisions
    and uncertainty in interpreting LCA results. In the same vein, Gil et al. [34]
    recently conducted research that employed stochastic multi-attribute analysis
    (SMAA) to assess the environmental performance of agricultural systems, addressing
    common limitations in conventional LCA, particularly related to uncertainty and
    the correlation between impact categories. Unlike traditional LCAs that often
    focus on averages or mean values, neglecting the inherent variability and correlation
    in agricultural production, the SMAA method provides advanced insight by offering
    a single unbiased indicator that stochastically incorporates individual results
    from selected categories. This improved approach not only overcomes the limitations
    of traditional methods but also enhances the accuracy of detecting significant
    differences in LCA comparisons. In addition, the SMAA method tackles potential
    bias in weighting procedures, providing an objective assessment for selecting
    the most appropriate alternative from an environmental performance perspective.
    In summary, this study underscores the importance of considering advanced methods
    such as SMAA to address the shortcomings of conventional approaches for environmental
    impact analysis and uncertainty management in LCA. 7. Opportunities for Future
    LCA in Protected Agriculture Recommendations and priorities to improve the applicability
    of LCA have been continually reported [128,146,185,202]. The reported findings
    thus far highlight challenges and knowledge gaps in each of the four phases of
    LCA development. Next, we compile and propose interventions to guide future research.
    7.1. Comply with the Standards Required by Phase We found that several LCA studies
    in protected agriculture did not comply with the ISO standards. All phases showed
    methodological gaps. We observed superficial descriptions of functional units
    and system boundaries. Furthermore, there is limited use of normalization and
    weighting processes in the third phase and uncertainty analysis in the fourth.
    New approaches are needed to encourage the acceptance of normalization and weighting,
    as well as the communication of single scores within the broader community [203].
    In addition, we strongly recommend more frequent and complete reporting of uncertainty
    analyses. Identifying, quantifying, and communicating uncertainty in LCA studies
    is vital for determining confidence levels in the findings. These limitations
    do not make a study illegitimate [203]; however, they make methodological harmonization
    and comparison between studies difficult. 7.2. Strengthen Under-Addressed Impact
    Issues The life cycle impact assessment of protected agriculture does not provide
    data on land degradation or nutritional quality. These aspects are associated
    with ecosystem services and are rarely considered in other agricultural systems
    [202,204]. This situation limits the adequate perspective needed to robustly dimension
    environmental trade-offs. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the system of agricultural
    LCA indices and standardize the respective evaluation methodologies. Ecosystem
    services are “blind spots” in LCA for protected agriculture, according to van
    der Werf et al. [202], because less than 10% of the literature mentions them.
    LCA research has focused on supporting and regulating ecosystem services, such
    as nutrient cycling, soil formation, biodiversity, pollination, water and air
    quality, waste decomposition, climate, and pest control [24,205]. However, provisioning
    ecosystem services has received little attention. Aspects of raw material management,
    including biomass, water, genetic resources, and biofuels, provide ecosystem services
    [206,207]. 7.3. Synergistically Integrate LCA with Other Frameworks Existing research
    on protected agriculture reflects that few frameworks are used alongside LCA.
    Cucurachi et al. [146] suggested that LCA should not be used in isolation but
    should be complemented using other methods. In this way, a more complete perspective
    of social, economic, and even environmental aspects converging in protected agriculture
    can be obtained, leading to improved effectiveness in decision making. Van der
    Werf et al. [202] proposed integrating frameworks focused on ecosystem services,
    McLaren et al. [128] proposed integrating frameworks focused on nutritional and
    dietary factors, and Fan et al. [185] proposed integrating frameworks focused
    on agent-based modeling, data envelopment analysis, and multi-criteria decision
    analysis. The joint use of the previous three methodologies and LCA has not been
    explored in protected agriculture. A frequently asked question in the literature
    is how can LCA become acquainted with assessing sustainability on various temporal
    and spatial scales [208]. The combined application of the second and third interventions
    described here, i.e., the previous and current interventions, can be regarded
    as part of the solution. 7.4. Build Regional Databases Measuring and modeling
    the performance of agricultural systems is a complex task [202]. The characteristics
    of natural resources, such as soil, climate, and ecosystems, strongly influence
    and vary by region [185]. Therefore, the use of a general global database is a
    disadvantage that has been widely recognized [128,146]. Biases and inaccurate
    interpretations can easily occur, affecting decision making. Urgent action is
    needed to regionalize databases on the necessary local spatial scale [203]. It
    is crucial to recognize that the backbone of LCA is an up-to-date, reproducible,
    consistent, and quality-controlled life cycle inventory dataset. Computational
    frameworks to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of data collection in LCA
    have been established [209,210]. Countries such as Switzerland and Peru have shown
    interest [211,212]. Government efforts guided by global agendas can promote, establish,
    and finance this goal. 7.5. New Research Horizons We recommend a comprehensive
    exploration of the LCA environmental performance of modern integrated greenhouses
    under different climatic conditions. This includes analyzing effective energy-saving
    methods (e.g., photovoltaic modules, solar collectors, heat pumps, and other integrated
    modules) for the design of greenhouses, considering their structures (geometry,
    orientation, cladding material), ventilation, and lighting systems. Another avenue
    for research lies in the implementation of circular agricultural practices, necessitating
    a thorough understanding of the overall performance of the production system concerning
    circularity and sustainability. This can be effectively accomplished by integrating
    circular economy indicators—such as the material circularity indicator, material
    efficiency metric, product circularity indicator, longevity indicator, and others—into
    the LCA [185,213]. Simultaneously, applying the circular life cycle sustainability
    assessment framework, which encompasses environmental and circular dimensions,
    also extends to economic and social aspects, providing a more holistic evaluation
    [185,214]. The synergy between the circular economy and protected agriculture
    is gaining strength to the point that its benefits for the sustainable transformation
    of territories are beginning to be examined [185,215]. It is expected and suggested
    to continue studying the integrated use of LCA and the “Nexus” approach (i.e.,
    energy-water-food nexus) since it has enormous potential to quantify the environmental
    burdens of the systems, considering the interdependent relationships between resources.
    We underline the pressing need to provide more evidence through LCA in the debate
    on organic agriculture versus conventional agriculture or the pragmatic integration
    of these under greenhouse structures, considering the specific needs and capacities
    of each region. Finally, we highlight the importance of research that delves into
    the ecosystem services provided by protected agriculture, creating innovative
    versions of methodologies and establishing new methodological frameworks that
    include indicators and protocols intrinsic to the missing categories of ecosystem
    services. 8. Conclusions The world of LCA is evolving rapidly, exerting influence
    across various sectors and shaping sustainable practices within protected agriculture.
    While the implementation of LCA in protected agriculture is not recent, its current
    popularity is on the rise. Spain, Italy, and China dominate scientific productivity
    in this field. Research topics vary across continents, with particular interest
    in urban agriculture, biofuels, hydroponic systems, the circular economy, wastewater
    management, biomass, and spatial limits. The research carried out encompasses
    four general lines of research: water management, energy management, technology
    management, and impact measurement. The application of LCA unveils discernible
    patterns aligning with the four standard phases. Concerning the objective and
    scope, tomatoes, along with cucumber and lettuce, are the most researched foods.
    Moreover, the cradle-to-gate boundary system is widely implemented. Although the
    studies largely considered the mass unit of the final product, there is no uniformity
    in the functional unit chosen, making LCA results difficult to compare. For the
    inventory, the predominant inputs commonly reported include the application of
    fertilizers and pesticides, water management practices, and greenhouse infrastructure,
    with transportation receiving notably scant attention. Eutrophication potential
    is the most measured impact category in the third phase of the LCA, followed by
    global warming potential and acidification potential. However, integrating more
    impact categories is necessary to elucidate the trade-offs more robustly. The
    interpretation phase is strongly guided by the water–energy–food nexus approach,
    considering the challenges of the region under study, but largely lacks uncertainty
    analysis. Overcoming major bottlenecks requires addressing the negligent approach
    to the standards required by the four phases, making limited efforts to apply
    evaluation frameworks that complement the LCA, and emphasizing indirect effects.
    As possible next steps, consolidating regional databases and developing environmental
    impact indicators for sustainable agriculture are critical. Supplementary Materials

  description: 'Global changes in climate and land use are threatening natural ecosystems,
    biodiversity, and the ecosystem services people rely on. This is why it is necessary
    to track and monitor spatiotemporal change at a level of detail that can inform
    science, management, and policy development. The current constellation of multiple
    Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites collecting imagery at predominantly ≤30-m spatial
    resolution affords an opportunity for the generation of global medium- resolution
    products every few days. Our goal is to both identify the information needs and
    provide direction towards the generation of a suite of global, high-level, systematically-generated,
    medium-resolution products designed for both management and science. Our vision
    builds on the success of the NASA MODIS/VIIRS product suite, while recognizing
    the unique strengths of medium-resolution satellite data given their higher spatial
    resolution and longer time series. We propose a suite of 13 essential products
    that enable the characterization of the current state and changes in the biosphere,
    cryosphere, and hydrosphere, and would fill information needs identified by the
    Committee on Earth Observation Satellites for the Global Climate Observing System
    and the Global Terrestrial Observing System, by the National Research Council
    of the US National Academies in the decadal survey, and by others. These products
    are: land cover, land cover change, burned area, forest loss, vegetation indices,
    phenology, dynamic habitat indices, albedo, land surface temperature, snow cover,
    ice extent, surface water extent, and evapotranspiration. Furthermore, we provide
    a list of desirable products poised for addition to the essential products (e.g.,
    crop type, emissivity, and ice sheet velocity). Lastly, we suggest aspirational
    products requiring further algorithm development (e.g., forest structure and crop
    yield). For the identified essential products, algorithms are in place, making
    it feasible to begin generating products systematically. These products should
    be accompanied by quality and accuracy assessments undertaken following consensus
    protocols. Five decades after the first Landsat satellite, and two decades after
    the MODIS products were first produced, it is time now for readily available,
    standardized, and consistent high-level products built upon medium-resolution
    imagery, thereby fulfilling the promise and the vision that inspired the Landsat
    program since its inception.'

    • We propose 13 essential products, complemented by 11 desirable products. • Many
    algorithms are mature to systematically generate global products. • Success of
    MODIS land products demonstrates science and application need. • Landsat and Sentinel-2
    constellation expands opportunity for global products. Abstract Global changes
    in climate and land use are threatening natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and
    the ecosystem services people rely on. This is why it is necessary to track and
    monitor spatiotemporal change at a level of detail that can inform science, management,
    and policy development. The current constellation of multiple Landsat and Sentinel-2
    satellites collecting imagery at predominantly 30-m spatial resolution affords
    an opportunity for the generation of global medium- resolution products every
    few days. Our goal is to both identify the information needs and provide direction
    towards the generation of a suite of global, high-level, systematically-generated,
    medium-resolution products designed for both management and science. Our vision
    builds on the success of the NASA MODIS/VIIRS product suite, while recognizing
    the unique strengths of medium-resolution satellite data given their higher spatial
    resolution and longer time series. We propose a suite of 13 essential products
    that enable the characterization of the current state and changes in the biosphere,
    cryosphere, and hydrosphere, and would fill information needs identified by the
    Committee on Earth Observation Satellites for the Global Climate Observing System
    and the Global Terrestrial Observing System, by the National Research Council
    of the US National Academies in the decadal survey, and by others. These products
    are: land cover, land cover change, burned area, forest loss, vegetation indices,
    phenology, dynamic habitat indices, albedo, land surface temperature, snow cover,
    ice extent, surface water extent, and evapotranspiration. Furthermore, we provide
    a list of desirable products poised for addition to the essential products (e.g.,
    crop type, emissivity, and ice sheet velocity). Lastly, we suggest aspirational
    products requiring further algorithm development (e.g., forest structure and crop
    yield). For the identified essential products, algorithms are in place, making
    it feasible to begin generating products systematically. These products should
    be accompanied by quality and accuracy assessments undertaken following consensus
    protocols. Five decades after the first Landsat satellite, and two decades after
    the MODIS products were first produced, it is time now for readily available,
    standardized, and consistent high-level products built upon medium-resolution
    imagery, thereby fulfilling the promise and the vision that inspired the Landsat
    program since its inception. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Landsat Sentinel-2 data 1. Introduction Humans rely on the benefits of natural
    ecosystems, but climate and land-use change threaten many of these benefits (IPCC,
    2021; MA, 2005). Human population increase and activity since the agrarian and
    industrial revolutions have caused global changes beyond natural variability (Foley
    et al., 2005; Steffen et al., 2015). Scientific understanding, monitoring, modeling,
    and management of the Earth system and of global change processes requires free
    and nondiscriminatory distribution of accurate, consistent and unbiased monitoring
    data, for which satellite observations are fundamentally important. There has
    long been recognition of the need and utility of satellite data for studying global
    change (Justice et al., 1985; Kaufman et al., 1998; NASA et al., 1986; NRC, 1990;
    Sellers et al., 1995). To date, high-level global products derived consistently
    and systematically from satellite data have been generated at coarse (100-1,000
    m) spatial resolution. However, coarse spatial resolution data may not resolve
    many global change processes and terrestrial phenomena apparent at medium (10
    m to 100 m) and high (<10 m) spatial resolution. High spatial and temporal resolution
    data with global coverage are becoming available from commercial satellite constellations,
    but currently these data are collected with a smaller number of multi-spectral
    bands that are not rigorously calibrated and corrected for atmospheric effects
    and sun-sensor geometry without cross-calibration with other satellites (Roy et
    al., 2021). Gridded, medium-resolution ‘higher-level’ global products that have
    been subject to geophysical transformations and processed to derive environmental
    variables over different time periods (weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual) are
    needed by the user community, as has been suggested by the Landsat Science Team
    (Roy et al., 2014b). The products should be generated on a systematic basis and
    subject to routine quality assessment and validation, with reprocessing as needed.
    The continued availability of Landsat observations, initiated in 1972 with Landsat-1
    through the 2021 Landsat-9 mission (Masek et al., 2020), combined with the Landsat-like
    Sentinel-2A, -2B and planned Sentinel-2C and -2D missions (Drusch et al., 2012),
    provide a unique opportunity to generate such products. The widespread use of
    existing coarse-resolution data products demonstrates the strong demand for systematically
    derived, high-level products. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
    sensor series have been in operation since 1978 and provide global daily coverage
    at coarse to very-coarse spatial resolution (1 - 15 km, (Cracknell, 1997)). The
    AVHRR data, particularly in the first several decades, were suboptimal for terrestrial
    monitoring due to a number of factors, including lack of visible wavelength calibration
    and substantial orbit drift (Giglio and Roy, 2020). Despite this, AVHRR data were
    used with substantial investment to generate the first global coverage land products
    (Townshend, 1994). The NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    program built on this heritage to systematically generate a suite of high-level,
    global land, ocean, and atmospheric data products that have revolutionized global
    change research and applications (Justice et al., 1998), with instrumentation
    evolution and continuity provided by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
    (VIIRS). However, the MODIS record started in 2000 whereas the Landsat record
    began in 1972, and full global repeat Landsat 30-m coverage has been available
    since the 1990s (Wulder et al., 2016), which means that longer-term trends can
    be captured. The Sentinel-2 systems, launched in 2015 and 2017, provide 10-, 20-
    and 60-m multispectral reflective wavelength observations that complement Landsat
    capabilities, and together provide high temporal global coverage for common visible
    to short wavelength infrared (VSWIR) bands until at least the early 2030s. While
    there are only a few large-area data products derived systematically from medium-resolution
    satellite imagery, those that are available support key applications and scientific
    advances. At national scale, examples include the United States Geological Survey’s
    (USGS) National Land Cover Data (NLCD) (Homer et al., 2020) and the United States
    Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Crop Data Layer (CDL) (Boryan et al., 2011),
    which are both generated on a systematic basis. At global scale, several medium-resolution
    products have been developed such as global land cover (Chen et al., 2015), forest
    dynamics (Hansen et al., 2013), and surface water dynamics (Pekel et al., 2016).
    The uptake of these existing medium-resolution data products attests to their
    relevance, but also highlights the lack of a full suite of other products needed
    to inform global change and terrestrial, cryosphere, and aquatic applications.
    Substantial advances in computing provide new and timely opportunities to produce
    global, medium-resolution products. These include increasing storage capabilities,
    multi-core processing, graphical processing units, cloud computing, and high bandwidth
    internet. Landsat data distribution via the internet, which once was a limitation
    for many users (Roy et al., 2010), has now become the norm (Zhu et al., 2019b).
    Analysis Ready Data (ARD) have been developed to reduce the pre-processing burden
    on users and provide direct access to user-friendly products. For example, the
    USGS provides Landsat tiled, top-of-atmosphere and atmospherically corrected ARD
    defined in a common equal area projection, accompanied by spatially explicit quality
    assessment and cloud mask information over the conterminous United States (CONUS),
    Alaska, and Hawaii for the Landsat-4/5/7/8/9 30-m archive (Dwyer et al., 2018).
    Methods to improve the harmonization among Landsat sensors, for example, to account
    for differences in the spectral response functions of similar bands on different
    Landsat sensors (Berner et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2016a), and between Landsat
    and Sentinel-2 sensors (Chastain et al., 2019; Wulder et al., 2021) have been
    developed. Furthermore, planning is underway to extend the ARD products to include
    Landsat-1 to Landsat-5 Multispectral Scanner System (MSS) data (Crawford et al.,
    2023), and the generation of global coverage Landsat ARD products is being considered
    (Wulder et al., 2022). For example, multi-sensor ARD are being developed by the
    NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project, which generates products similar
    to the Landsat ARD but harmonizes Landsat-8 (and since May 2022, Landsat-9), Sentinel-2A
    and -2B data to a common 30-m product from 2015 onwards in the Sentinel-2 tile
    grid (Claverie et al., 2018), and the European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sen2Like algorithms
    is designed for a common 10-m product (Saunier et al., 2022). In addition, the
    two sensors complement each other well in that Landsat provides thermal measurements,
    whereas Sentinel-2 has additional reflective wavelength bands, for example red
    edge bands, which allow plant functional traits such as leaf chlorophyll content
    to be estimated. Our goal in this paper is to both synthesize the information
    needs and articulate a vision for a suite of medium-resolution, high-level, global,
    systematically generated products derived from Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. First,
    we highlight the information needs for global change science and management that
    require medium-resolution products. Second, we provide a vision for a suite of
    high-level products, which we categorize as either (a) essential, of highest importance,
    and for which algorithms are mature (land cover, land cover change, burned area,
    forest loss, vegetation indices, phenology, dynamic habitat indices, albedo, land
    surface temperature, snow cover, ice extent, surface water extent, and evapotranspiration),
    (b) desirable, also technically feasible now, but for which demand is not quite
    as pressing and user communities are smaller, or (c) aspirational, that are in
    need of further research and algorithm development. 2. Information needs for sustainable
    management, societal benefit, and global change challenges Mitigating and adapting
    to global change requires consistent, long-term monitoring and modelling of the
    Earth System (land, cryosphere, ocean, and atmosphere). Globally, the need for
    such monitoring has been identified by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA,
    2005), the Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UN, 2012),
    and the assessment of planetary boundaries by the Stockholm Resilience Center
    (Steffen et al., 2015). The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate developed
    the requirements and recommendations for a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS,
    2016, GCOS, 2021). In its latest implementation plan, GCOS highlighted the need
    for systematic and consistent observation as the basis for long time series, but
    also urgency to provide near-real time information (GCOS, 2022). In support of
    GCOS, the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) was set up to facilitate
    the observation, modeling, and analysis of terrestrial ecosystems. Similarly,
    the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), and especially its virtual
    constellation on Land Surface Imaging (LSI-VC) with its thematic subgroups on
    Forests & Biomass, and on Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM), have defined
    information needs for terrestrial land monitoring. Within the US, the latest Decadal
    Survey of the National Research Council (NRC, 2018) identified 35 key science
    and applications priorities including key geophysical observables and measurement
    parameters. Prior conventions and committees have established general information
    needs for management and global change science, but often without explicit consideration
    of the necessary data characteristics to meet those needs. Our contribution here
    is to highlight the extent to which those established information needs can and
    should be met via systematic satellite data products derived from medium-resolution
    Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery (Table 1). We group these information needs into
    five thematic areas: climate change, biodiversity conservation, sustainable management
    and ecosystem services, food security, and natural hazards. Table 1. Information
    needs for the five major thematic areas related to sustainable management, societal
    benefits, and global change challenges. ‘High’ means that there is a strong information
    need for a given societal benefit of global change challenge. Societal benefit
    or global change challenge Climate change Biodiversity conservation Food security
    Sustainable management and ecosystem services Natural hazards Information needs
    Biosphere Land cover and land use High High High High Medium Vegetation condition
    and phenology High High High High High Biodiversity and faunal habitat Low High
    Low High Low Disturbances High High High High High Surface energy balance High
    Medium High Low Medium Cryosphere Snow cover High Medium Medium Medium Medium
    Ice sheets and glaciers High Low Medium Low Low Hydrosphere Freshwater and marine
    ecosystems High High High High High Evapotranspiration High Low High High Medium
    Information needs related to climate change fall broadly into two main categories.
    First, there is information needed to better understand the drivers of climate
    change, especially the global carbon cycle, including sources of carbon emissions
    and sequestration stores. For example, carbon loss due to deforestation and emissions
    from biomass burning are important information needs, which motivate the GOFC-GOLD
    program (https://gofcgold.umd.edu/). Accordingly, the Paris Agreement of the United
    National Framework Convention on Climate Change mandates an assessment of progress
    towards its goals called the global stocktake for which satellite observations
    are essential (Hegglin et al., 2022; Ochiai et al., 2023). Second, there is a
    need to monitor the effects of climate change. For example, the United Nations
    Framework Convention on Climate Change highlights information needs for the cryosphere,
    including snow cover, the speed at which glaciers and ice sheets flow, and the
    distribution of sea ice (GCOS, 2016). The critical information needs related to
    climate change have led to the development of the Essential Climate Variables
    (ECVs), many of which require satellite data to monitor, but are currently only
    starting to become available at medium resolution. Global biodiversity declines
    were the impetus for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which was passed
    at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.
    Since then, 15 meetings of the Conference of Parties have taken place, including
    the 15th meeting in Kunming-Montreal where the Global Biodiversity Framework was
    passed (UNCBD, 2022) that include a target to effectively conserve at least 30%
    of terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine areas (Target 3). The strategic
    plan of the framework stated the need for global biodiversity monitoring (Target
    20) with the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, 2022) focused on
    in situ observations, and the GEO-Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO-BON, 2022)
    emphasizing satellite-derived indicators and the Essential Biodiversity Variables
    (EBVs) (Pereira et al., 2013; Pettorelli et al., 2016) to quantify change in the
    state of biodiversity (Scholes et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2003). To address
    food security, the Group of Twenty (G20) countries met in 2011 in France and ratified
    a declaration regarding food security called Actional Plan on Food Price Volatility
    and Agriculture (G20, 2011) in response to agricultural commodity price fluctuations
    that began during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Out of this came a major
    initiative called the Global Agricultural Geo-Monitoring (GLAM) with the goal
    of “strengthening global agricultural monitoring by improving the use of remote
    sensing tools for crop production projections and weather forecasting.” Ultimately,
    this became organized within the United Nations (UN) Group on Earth Observations
    (GEO) and is known fully as GEOGLAM. Over the past decade GEOGLAM has evolved
    from establishing best practices and satellite needs for crop production monitoring,
    particularly in terms of spatial resolution and revisit rate, to understanding
    how this imagery can help in meeting UN Sustainable Development Goals (Whitcraft
    et al., 2022). A number of regional- to continental-scale crop monitoring programs
    exist (Fritz et al., 2019), which typically have supranational or governmental
    support, for example from the European Commission, or from U.S. and Chinese agencies.
    Crop monitoring data have proven invaluable for rapid, synoptic assessment of
    regional areas. However, the majority of these crop monitoring programs are based
    on satellite data with coarse spatial resolution, limiting their value for more
    localized food security initiatives. This is particularly true in those parts
    of the world where food security is lower, and where fields are typically small,
    intercropped, and surrounded by complex landscapes. Medium-resolution crop monitoring
    data are essential to ensure food security in these environments. Regarding sustainable
    management and ecosystem services, the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
    (UN, 2017) highlight manifold and urgent information needs for management and
    continued provisioning of ecosystem services. For example, land cover maps are
    essential for SDG 6, the protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems
    including mountains, forests, and wetlands, and the monitoring of aquatic ecosystems,
    and for SDG 15.1, the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of ecosystems
    and their services. Closely related are maps of forest area, and ideally maps
    of forest structure that are necessary for SDG 15.2., the sustainable management
    for forests. Similarly, maps of urban land cover and form are required for SDG
    11.3, inclusive and sustainable urbanization. Evapotranspiration (ET), as a metric
    of consumptive water use and ecosystem health, is a information need for many
    SDGs. Both monitoring of management and decision support aimed at ensuring the
    continued provisioning of ecosystem services would greatly benefit from medium-resolution
    data products because medium-resolution satellite data match the scale of land
    management units such as crop fields, forest stands, or urban subdivisions in
    many parts of the world, while coarse-resolution imagery does not. Several natural
    hazards have important information needs that can be met with moderate-resolution
    data. For example, desertification is a natural hazard with clearly established
    information needs (UNCCD, 2013) that is best monitored with medium-resolution
    satellite data. Wildfires are another important natural hazard, both because of
    the risk they pose to human lives, homes, and livelihoods (Schug et al., 2023),
    and the impacts they have on ecosystems and climate (GCOS, 2016). Medium-resolution
    satellite data do not currently have the temporal frequency to adequately capture
    active fires (Wooster et al., 2021), but can map burned areas more accurately
    than coarse resolution satellite data (Chuvieco et al., 2019). Frequent medium-resolution
    satellite imagery is required to capture the spatial extents of flooding events
    (Heimhuber et al., 2018), as well as damage from hurricanes, tornadoes, and hailstorms.
    Anomalies in evapotranspiration derived from thermal infrared imagery have proven
    to be an effective early signal of developing flash drought (Otkin et al., 2013),
    with medium-resolution imagery revealing drought impacts of fields (Yang et al.,
    2021a) or forest stands (Yang et al., 2021b). Understanding the extent and impacts
    of natural hazards is especially important given that more frequent extreme weather
    fluctuations are expected due to climate change. 3. The proposed suite of high-level,
    medium-resolution products Based on the above articulated information needs for
    the five major thematic areas related to sustainable management, societal benefits,
    and global change challenges, we identified a suite of products that can be derived
    from medium-resolution satellite imagery (Table 2). In many cases, a given product
    meets the information needs for more than one of the five thematic areas. For
    example, land cover data are essential for food security, land management, climate
    change, and biodiversity assessments. Among all products, we separated those that
    are essential, and required by large user communities, from others that are desirable,
    but have smaller user communities. High-level derived products should preferably
    be generated using community-endorsed algorithms, i.e., ones that have been selected
    competitively by scientific peer review and/or that are published in the literature.
    We do not advocate specific algorithms but rather outline the required characteristics
    of the resulting products. Similarly, it is beyond the scope and intent of this
    paper to prescribe computational solutions and procedures for higher level product
    generation. We assume that some form of global ARD similar to the USGS Landsat
    ARD or the NASA global HLS are available, because systematic product generation
    requires radiometrically and geometrically calibrated satellite data including
    cloud masking, atmospheric correction, and addressing bi-directional reflectance
    effects as detailed in Claverie et al. (2018), Roy et al. (2019) and Saunier et
    al. (2022). As new satellite data are acquired, they should be subject to the
    same ARD processing and characterization to ensure that they are temporally consistent.
    We also assume that, following standard practice, per-pixel quality assessment
    information is part of all products to help ensure correct product utility. Table
    2. Medium-resolution satellite image-based products that meet the identified information
    needs for sustainable management, societal benefits, and global change challenges.

    assessment should be undertaken, typically by product examination at different
    temporal and spatial scales, which is necessary given the large number of factors
    that can adversely affect product quality (for a detailed discussion see Roy et
    al., 2002). In addition, each product’s accuracy needs to be validated periodically
    to ensure appropriate scientific use. Validation should follow community-endorsed
    procedures that are necessarily product-specific but are typically undertaken
    by comparison with a representative sample of independent reference data collected
    at finer spatial resolution and with minimal error (Baret et al., 2006; Morisette
    et al., 2002). The results of the quality assessment, and sometimes the validation,
    may result in the need for product reprocessing. 3.1. Land cover, land use, and
    land cover change Mapping and monitoring of land cover and land use was a key
    motivation for the launch of the first Landsat in 1972 (Goward et al., 2017).
    While often grouped together, land cover, land use, and changes in these properties
    are distinct quantities. Land cover defines the physical properties at the surface
    of the Earth, while land use describes the social, economic, and cultural utility
    of the land (Loveland et al., 2000). For example, a land cover class could be
    grassland and the land uses could include pastureland or parkland, but satellite
    data do not always suffice to distinguish land uses. Land cover, land use, and
    land cover change maps that capture human activity and many ecological processes
    are more appropriately resolved at medium than coarse spatial resolution (Gutman
    et al., 2008; Townshend and Justice, 1988). For example, processes, such as fire
    spread, forest edge effects, or habitat selection, operate at scales that require
    medium-resolution land cover maps. Similarly, impact evaluation of land management
    actions and policies requires monitoring of changes at sub-watershed scale and
    with respect to parcels, stands of trees or agricultural fields. Coarse-resolution
    satellite imagery are not able to monitor parcel-scale processes, and so miss
    important human-environment interactions that provide insights needed to improve
    management and foster improved environmental stewardship. Land cover is an essential
    climate variable in the global climate observation system (GCOS) (Bojinski et
    al., 2014). Land cover products are important for characterizing anthropogenic
    activity and biogeographical and eco-climatic diversity (Cihlar, 2000; Townshend
    et al., 1992; Wulder et al., 2018). Detailed, accurate, and up-to-date land cover
    products are required by resource managers and decision-makers to develop and
    monitor land management policies, and to satisfy reporting requirements from local
    to global scales (Erb et al., 2017; Foley et al., 2005; Roe et al., 2019). Global
    land cover maps were initially derived from coarse-resolution AVHRR data (DeFries
    and Townshend, 1994; Hansen et al., 2000; Loveland et al., 2000). With the availability
    of improved data provided by MODIS, land cover has been mapped globally at 500-m
    resolution on a systematic annual basis, initially based on the International
    Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) and University of Maryland land cover classification
    legends (Friedl et al., 2002; Hansen and Reed, 2000). The most recent Collection
    6 MODIS land cover product includes six distinct classification legends (Sulla-Menashe
    et al., 2019) including a hierarchical scheme based on the FAO’s Land Cover Classification
    System (LCCS; (Di Gregorio, 2016)). Rather than define discrete land cover classes,
    continuous estimates of physiognomic or structural attributes (DeFries et al.,
    1999), such as percent vegetative cover, have also been derived, which, if needed,
    can sometimes be transformed into land cover classes (Hansen et al., 2011). There
    is a long recognized need for medium-resolution land cover products generated
    over large areas (e.g., Cihlar, 2000; Townshend et al., 1992). The availability
    of free and open Landsat data has enabled systematic land cover mapping at medium-resolution
    with national products generated at regular frequency and with relatively low
    latency. For example, the USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) has produced
    30-m CONUS land cover maps with 8 and 20 classes every 2-3 years since 2001, with
    a 3-5 year latency (Homer et al., 2020). The USGS Land Change Monitoring, Assessment,
    and Projection (LCMAP) project generates annual 30-m land cover maps for CONUS
    with 8 classes since 1985 with 2 year latency (Brown et al., 2020a). European
    medium-resolution land cover products include the 5 and 15 class 100-m CORINE
    Land Cover product (Büttner et al., 2004) with a 3-year latency (Inglada et al.,
    2017). Recently, global land cover maps have been generated using Landsat, often
    supplemented with MODIS and AVHRR data to compensate for limited cloud free Landsat
    availability prevalent in many regions of the world (Kovalskyy and Roy, 2013).
    Global Landsat 30-m land cover products include the Finer Resolution Observation
    and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) product generated for 2010, 2015
    and 2017 (Gong et al., 2013), the Globeland30 product generated for 2000, 2010
    and 2020 (Chen et al., 2015), the iMap World 1.0 product generated annually from
    1985 to 2020 (Liu et al., 2021), and the Global Land Cover Estimation (GLanCE)
    products generated annually from 2001 to 2020 (Friedl et al., 2022). Global land
    cover products derived from 10-m Sentinel-2 data include ESA WorldCover 2020 (Zanaga
    et al., 2021), the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Land Cover
    (Karra et al., 2021), and the Google Dynamic World (Brown et al., 2022) products.
    Land use products are needed, particularly as the area of land dominated by humans
    expands and land resource competition has increased (Goldewijk, 2001; Ramankutty
    and Foley, 1999). Certain land uses can have profoundly negative impacts on ecosystem
    services including water supply (Li et al., 2007; Spera et al., 2016), carbon
    sequestration (Erb et al., 2018), and biodiversity (Felipe-Lucia et al., 2020;
    Haines-Young, 2009; Powers and Jetz, 2019). Global land use classification schemes
    have been developed but typically include a mixture of both land cover (e.g.,
    Forest land, Grassland, Wetlands) and land use (e.g., Cropland, Settlements) classes
    (Milne et al., 2003). As noted above, medium-resolution data have sufficient spatial
    resolution to map land cover, but finer spatial resolution (<10 m) data are typically
    required to accurately discriminate spatially fragmented land use classes. For
    example, infrastructure (e.g., buildings, roads) and agricultural fields in many
    regions are not resolved at medium resolution (White and Roy, 2015). Large-area
    agricultural land use mapping has received significant attention reflecting the
    critical role of agriculture. Notably, the USDA on an annual basis systematically
    generates the 30-m US Crop Data Layer (CDL) for the conterminous United States
    using Landsat and other sensor data, and benefits from extensive training data
    collected as part of the US agricultural census to provide approximately 110 classes
    (Boryan et al., 2011). Global agricultural cropland maps have been produced (Fritz
    et al., 2015; Thenkabail et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2013), but are not generated
    systematically. In addition, there is a growing body of research on mapping agricultural
    practices, for example, irrigated versus rainfed (Deines et al., 2017; Xie and
    Lark, 2021), tilled versus no-till agriculture (Azzari et al., 2019; Zheng et
    al., 2014), and mapping of crop rotation and fallow periods (Dara et al., 2018;
    Sahajpal et al., 2014; Yin et al., 2020). Lastly, maps of built-up land reflecting
    the distribution of human settlements and associated infrastructure have been
    developed from MODIS (Schneider et al., 2009) and Landsat data (Esch et al., 2017).
    Because built-up land is a land use defined by spatial context, newer deep learning
    classification methods are promising for mapping and monitoring urban land use
    (Chen et al., 2020). Land cover change is an essential information need. Land
    cover change mapping in the last decade has evolved to using Landsat time series
    instead of single-date images, to better characterize the type and timing of change,
    and to gain insights on the directionality and persistence of change trends (Hansen
    and Loveland, 2012; Woodcock et al., 2020; Zhu, 2017). The analysis of temporal
    metrics, combined with ancillary data, allows different types of land cover and
    land cover change products to be generated (Wulder et al., 2018). However, changes
    may not manifest themselves in the data for some time after the event that caused
    the change, and changes in surface condition can occur without a change in land
    cover. For example, trees can persist yet appear spectrally different over time
    due to insect activity or drought stress, causing a change in vegetation condition
    without a change in land cover (Coops et al., 2020). Mapping change in a binary
    change/no-change manner for some phenomena may thus be restrictive. For example,
    forests are defined by physiognomic or structural attributes including potential
    mature tree height and canopy cover. Therefore, change mapping based on sub-pixel
    fractional cover can be advantageous (Ye et al., 2021b). Land cover and land cover
    change mapping algorithms are mature, and a wide range of methodological options
    are available. We suggest to adopt a land cover class catalog that is hierarchical
    and supports different levels of detail (e.g., UN LCCS; (Di Gregorio, 2016)).
    A global land cover map will necessarily require some level of simplicity and
    generalization (Milne et al., 2003), but should allow for additional detail on
    a local to regional basis (Tulbure et al., 2021). Integrating new capabilities
    in a research-to-operations mode while maintaining a core record consistent with
    historical data is desirable. The current state-of-the-practice approach for large
    area land cover classification is based on the application of ensemble tree-based
    classifiers, such as random forests (Breiman, 2001), to satellite time series
    to take advantage of spectral differences among classes over time (Brown et al.,
    2020b; Sulla-Menashe et al., 2019; Wulder et al., 2018). Deep learning-based algorithms
    have advantages for land cover classifications (Kussul et al., 2017; Zhang et
    al., 2020). Deep learning models can exploit spatial relationships among pixels
    in contrast to conventional classification approaches that are applied independently
    to individual pixel locations, and that is beneficial, for example, when classifying
    urban areas. While deep learning requires large training data sets and considerable
    computer resources for the derivation of the classification model, once generated,
    the model can be applied quite efficiently, allowing for rapid classification
    updates. Land cover and land cover change mapping should ideally be based on a
    single integrated mapping process. Generation of change features (where, when),
    and metrics describing the nature of changes detected (e.g., change magnitude
    and persistence), is recommended, and can support the generation of land use maps
    (Wulder et al., 2018). With the advent of free and easily obtainable ARD, sharing
    classification models for on-demand classification applications has considerable
    potential. The development of interoperable machine learning models and training
    data standards would be helpful in this respect. At present, reliable global land
    cover product generation requires substantial human interaction and is not purely
    a data science issue. This is due to the aforementioned need for training data
    and because of irregular temporal cadence of satellite time series and factors
    that reduce input product quality. Training data collection is a bottleneck but
    there are a number of methodologies to reduce this (Wulder et al., 2018). Training
    data collection is particularly challenging for change product generation because
    high spatial resolution imagery in archives such as Google Earth are often spatially
    and temporally sparse (Lesiv et al., 2018). Recent constellation satellite imagery,
    such as the PlanetScope constellation, which provides 3-4 m imagery with a global
    median average revisit interval of only 30 hours (Roy et al., 2021), may be useful
    for training data collection. Human inspection will almost certainly continue
    to be necessary for the foreseeable future, with classification iteration as appropriate.
    In particular, classes consisting of mixed life forms (shrubs versus trees), or
    sparse cover (semi-arid grasslands), can be challenging to consistently discriminate
    and characterize, particularly with temporally sparse satellite data. Rigorous
    accuracy assessments are a key element of any land cover and land cover change
    product, including independent assessments and reporting on the accuracy of both
    maps and changes (Tsutsumida and Comber, 2015; Zhang and Roy, 2017). Validation
    data (i.e., independently collected land cover and change samples) are as challenging
    to collect as training data. Obtaining globally representative independent land
    cover reference data is essential, which is particularly complex for change classes
    because both the spatial and temporal distribution of change should be sampled
    (Boschetti et al., 2015) and accuracy assessments need to follow best statistical
    practices (Olofsson et al., 2014; Olofsson et al., 2012). 3.2. Disturbance Disturbance
    refers to events that disrupt ecosystem, community, or population structure but
    typically do not result in a land cover change (Zhu et al., 2022). Change in disturbance
    regimes, for example, changes in the spatial and temporal dynamics of disturbance,
    or in disturbance severity, may have profound effects on ecosystems (Senf and
    Seidl, 2021; Turner, 2010). We propose two essential disturbance products, burned
    area and forest loss, because algorithms for both are mature and have established
    requirements, and given their importance for the global carbon cycle, ecosystems,
    and biodiversity. Accurate disturbance mapping is highly dependent on the temporal
    resolution of the available satellite data. However, the temporal cadence of satellite
    observations is often irregular in space and time due to cloud and shadow contamination
    and different overlapping swath geometries (Egorov et al., 2019), which present
    substantial detection challenges (Brown et al., 2020b; Roy et al., 2019). The
    free and open policy of Landsat has made the use of dense Landsat time series
    possible, allowing disturbance mapping intervals to shrink from a decade (Masek
    et al., 2008) to every 2-3 years (Jin et al., 2017), annual (Hansen et al., 2013;
    Hermosilla et al., 2015; Vancutsem et al., 2021), sub-annual (Zhu et al., 2012),
    8-16 day (Pasquarella et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2021a), and owing to the launch
    of Sentinel-2 and the creation of harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 data ca. 3 days
    (Claverie et al., 2018; Li and Roy, 2017). 3.2.1. Burned area Fire is a widespread
    disturbance occurring on all continents except Antarctica (Giglio et al., 2018).
    In addition to loss of life and property (Radeloff et al., 2023) and the deleterious
    impacts of frequent and intense fires on ecosystems, fire is a major source of
    greenhouse gases (equivalent to ∼25% of fossil fuel emissions) (van der Werf et
    al., 2017). Active fire detection algorithms require middle-infrared (~4 μm) wavelengths
    to reliably detect the location of small and cool fires (Wooster et al., 2021).
    Landsat sensors have no middle-infrared bands and only a 16-day repeat, and so
    Landsat data are of limited use for systematic active fire detection, despite
    algorithms developed for this purpose using the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave
    infrared (SWIR) bands (Kumar and Roy, 2018; Schroeder et al., 2016). In contrast,
    Landsat data have been used widely for mapping burned area (Arino et al., 2001;
    Boschetti et al., 2015; Chuvieco et al., 2019). Fire transforms living and dead
    leaf and woody material into char and ash that typically is identified by reduced
    reflectance post-fire, particularly in the NIR, which may persist for weeks (in
    savannas and grasslands) to decades (in boreal forests) (Melchiorre and Boschetti,
    2018; Trigg and Flasse, 2000). Prior to the free availability of Landsat, burned
    area mapping was undertaken using a small number of cloud-free images, typically
    by thresholding spectral reflectance or by visual interpretation (Hall et al.,
    1980; Minnich, 1983). Subsequently, spectral band ratios such as the Normalized
    Burn Ratio (NBR), defined as the NIR minus the SWIR reflectance divided by their
    sum (López García and Caselles, 1991), and others (Chuvieco et al., 2002) were
    developed and used to map burned areas. The NBR has also been used to map burn
    severity, including systematically across the U.S. (Picotte et al., 2020), although
    relationships to ground assessments of severity are often imperfect (French et
    al., 2008; Roy et al., 2006). In the last decade, Landsat and Sentinel-2 time
    series based burned area mapping algorithms have been developed to take advantage
    of the temporal persistency of fire effects. The change in reflectance post-fire
    depends on several factors but predominantly on the fraction of the pixel that
    burned and on the combustion completeness, which is the fraction of fuel exposed
    to the fire that actually burned (Roy and Landmann, 2005). Factors including post-fire
    vegetation recovery, the degree of char and ash dissipation by wind and rain,
    and pre-fire and post-fire vegetation structure, soil and understory reflectance,
    also affect burned area mapping (Disney et al., 2011; Kokaly et al., 2007; Lentile
    et al., 2006; Roy and Landmann, 2005; Trigg et al., 2005). In addition, burned
    area algorithms must differentiate between spectral changes due to fire and similar
    spectral changes that are not fire related (Giglio et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2005).
    There is no consensus burned area mapping approach, although most algorithms are
    applied to reflectance or spectral band ratio time series and many are supplemented
    with active fire detections, such as Landsat and MODIS active fire detections
    (Boschetti et al., 2015), Sentinel-2 and MODIS active fire detections (Roteta
    et al., 2019), using only Landsat (Hawbaker et al., 2017), or both Landsat and
    Sentinel-2 (Roy et al., 2019). An outstanding issue is the need to rigorously
    validate medium-resolution burned area products. Previously, 30-m burned area
    maps interpreted from hundreds of globally distributed Landsat image pairs were
    used to validate coarser spatial resolution global MODIS burned area products
    (Boschetti et al., 2019; Padilla et al., 2014). Currently, high spatial resolution
    (<10 m) independent burned area data are needed to assess the accuracy of Landsat
    and Sentinel-2 burned areas products, and this, with ongoing algorithm development,
    is an area of active research and development. We consider burned area an essential
    medium-resolution product that should preferably map the approximate day of burning
    given the ephemeral nature of fire and the utility of higher temporal resolution
    information for natural resource and fire management applications. The product
    should include per pixel quality information with flags to denote if there were
    insufficient satellite time series data to detect the burned/unburned status,
    the approximate detected day of burning, the acquisition dates of the images bounding
    the change, and a measure of the confidence of burn detection. 3.2.2. Forest loss
    Forest loss accounts for >10% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions mainly
    due to deforestation of humid tropical forests (Houghton, 2013) with rising emissions
    over the last two decades (Feng et al., 2022). In addition to carbon sequestration,
    forests provide many ecosystem services, including habitat for terrestrial biodiversity
    and maintenance of hydrologic services (Chiabai et al., 2011; Schwaab et al.,
    2021), and provide key commodities, such as timber, pulp for paper, rubber, and
    cacao. Monitoring forests, in particular the conversion of natural forests to
    forestry or non-forest land uses, is required to assess the effects of these changes
    on environmental sustainability. The main way to assess national- to global-scale
    forest change has been through the use of time-series satellite data. Landsat
    data have been key for the mapping of forest loss in the Brazilian Amazon (Nelson
    et al., 1994), North America (Masek et al., 2008; White et al., 2017; Zhao et
    al., 2018, Egorov et al., 2023), Europe (Potapov et al., 2015; Senf and Seidl,
    2021), and Asia (Grogan et al., 2015). At global scale, the Global Forest Change
    product (Hansen et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2014) identifies 30-m pixels with >50%
    of canopy cover loss annually since 2000. We consider annual forest loss an essential
    dataset, for which feasibility at global scale have been demonstrated by the Global
    Forest Change product (Fig. 1). There is a range of approaches to map forest loss,
    including classification approaches based on image metrics (Potapov et al., 2015),
    or the analysis of Landsat time series (Zhu, 2017) including temporal segmentation
    (Hermosilla et al., 2015; Kennedy et al., 2010) or other types of fitted time
    series models (Verbesselt et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2012). An ensemble of forest
    disturbance algorithms aggregated through ensemble learning (Healey et al., 2018)
    can overcome differences in the results of different forest disturbance detection
    algorithms (Cohen et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res image (978KB) Download

    from annual multi-temporal Landsat metrics, shown averaged at a 0.05 degree resolution
    in red, green and blue by epoch. Insets are full resolution zooms of (b) Chaco
    woodland clearing in Paraguay centered at 60°40''16\"W, 20°41''47\"S, (c) shifting
    cultivation expansion in humid tropical forest of the Democratic Republic of the
    Congo centered at 29°19''19\"E, 0°57''14\"N, and (d) boreal forest logging and
    fire in Siberia, Russia centered at 103°22''44\"E, 55°49''02\"N (after Hansen
    et al., 2013). In addition to accurately identifying the timing and extent of
    forest loss, future forest loss products would ideally attribute forest loss to
    specific agents, such as harvest (Healey et al., 2006; Wilson and Sader, 2002;
    Wulder et al., 2004), fire (Hawbaker et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2019), wind (Baumann
    et al., 2014), hydrology (Castaneda et al., 2005; Pekel et al., 2016), landslide
    (Barlow et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2019; Lacroix et al., 2019), insect infestation
    (Goodwin et al., 2008; Ye et al., 2021b), pathogens (Chen et al., 2017; He et
    al., 2019), or multiple disturbance agents (Kennedy et al., 2015; Schroeder et
    al., 2017). Recovery information characterizing the condition and structure of
    vegetation after disturbance is another desirable attribute (Pflugmacher et al.,
    2014; White et al., 2018). Forest degradation remains challenging to quantify,
    due to its ephemeral nature particularly in tropical systems (Souza et al., 2005),
    and differing definitions and measurable attributes, but is possible (Bullock
    et al., 2020; Matricardi et al., 2020). Forest loss alerts are a monitoring application
    intended to provide near-real time information on disturbances that on the ground
    land managers and other interested parties may use to interdict or deter potential
    illicit activity. Landsat and Sentinel-1 and 2 based alerts (Hansen et al., 2016;
    Reiche et al., 2021) are part of the Global Forest Watch project (https://www.globalforestwatch.org/blog/data-and-research/integrated-deforestation-alerts/),
    and have decreased the probability of deforestation in Africa with attendant carbon
    benefits (Moffette et al., 2021). Forest loss validation is challenging but validation
    and area estimation of forest loss is possible through the use of random sampling
    designs and unbiased estimators (Penman et al., 2003). Good practice approaches
    to forest loss accuracy assessment and area estimation can be made using “reference
    data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately
    label each unit in the sample” (Olofsson et al., 2014). In this manner, a map
    of forest extent and change is used to stratify a study area, with accurately
    mapped classes affording a sampling efficiency that improves the precision of
    area estimates (Hansen et al., 2008). Importantly, probability-based stratified
    sampling of the reference data allows unbiased estimation of the forest cover
    loss accuracy metrics and associated standard errors (Olofsson et al., 2014).
    In addition, reference data may also allow to assess forest type, causes of forest
    loss, and land cover and land use outcomes (Tyukavina et al., 2018; Tyukavina
    et al., 2017). Such approaches enable the assessment of commodity driven deforestation,
    such as the role of soybean expansion in South America deforestation (Song et
    al., 2021). Sample-based estimates currently remain the most precise way to summarize
    forest extent and change dynamics. Validation is key to build confidence in the
    use of mapped products in downstream applications. 3.3. Vegetation condition and
    phenology Measures of vegetation condition reflect the overall health of vegetation
    (e.g., drought stress) and generally require a historical baseline to quantify
    changes (i.e., long-term average and trend). In addition to changes arising from
    external forcing, variation in phenology arising from natural variation in weather
    can drive changes in vegetation that are distinct from changes in condition. Time
    series of medium-resolution imagery allow both vegetation condition and phenology
    to be monitored at scale (Fig. 2). Typically this is undertaken using vegetation
    indices, which serve as proxies for canopy properties (Huete et al., 2002). Download

    Continental land surface phenology at 30-m spatial resolution from Harmonized
    Landsat Sentinel-2 imagery (Bolton et al., 2020). The top row shows the day of
    year for green-up (left) and green-down (right) in 2019. Lower panel shows zoom
    in for specific locations for green-up: (A) mix of natural vegetation and land
    use in central Tennessee with higher elevation Smokey Mountains in the eastern
    portion of the image; (B) agriculture in North Dakota; (C) Appalachian ridge and
    valley system in Pennsylvania. In natural ecosystems, the timing of phenological
    events is a key indicator of the effects of climate change on growing seasons
    (Korner and Basler, 2010; Penuelas et al., 2009; Piao et al., 2019) and characterizes
    the sensitivity of ecosystem processes to climate variability and change (Friedl
    et al., 2014; Keenan et al., 2014). In agro-ecosystems, phenology is diagnostic
    of management practices (e.g., sowing and harvest dates, irrigation), crop types,
    and crop yields (Bolton and Friedl, 2013; Sacks et al., 2010). Intra-annual time
    series of vegetation indices capture patterns in land surface phenology, providing
    information related to crop development and ecosystem function (de Beurs and Henebry,
    2004; Gao et al., 2020). Phenological information resolved at medium resolution
    is particularly relevant for agricultural systems, both within large agro-industrial
    fields and in regions where smallholder agriculture with small fields and mixed
    cropping prevails (Griffiths et al., 2019). Long-term average land surface phenology
    can be estimated from multi-year Landsat time series (Elmore et al., 2012; Fisher
    et al., 2006), as can the timing of leaf emergence and fall senescence (Melaas
    et al., 2016), and (in combination with MODIS) additional phenology dates such
    as canopy maturity or dormancy in forests (Baumann et al., 2017) and crops (Gao
    et al., 2017). The launch of Sentinel 2A and 2B, in combination with Landsat 8
    and 9, provides the capability to monitor vegetation phenology and condition at
    medium resolution, but with MODIS-like temporal sampling. We consider vegetation
    condition and phenology products that map the timing and variability in vegetation
    indices at sub-seasonal time scale to be essential medium-resolution products.
    The products should include quality assurance information quantifying uncertainty
    in vegetation condition and phenology metrics. Specifically, we suggest development
    of 30-m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation
    Index (EVI) products, along with a separate phenology product derived from these
    vegetation indices. In cloudy regions, image compositing approaches (Qiu et al.,
    2023) can be applied to produce cloud and atmospheric artifact-free gap-filled
    data sets (Griffiths et al., 2019; Potapov et al., 2020). Gap-filled products
    provide user-friendly ARD, and would also provide reproducibility and transparency
    for analyses based on these data. Analyses of HLS data have generated medium-resolution
    land surface phenology (Bolton et al., 2020) and crop phenology (Gao et al., 2020;
    Gao et al., 2021) products at scale. The land surface phenology metric product
    should capture three key characteristics of vegetation development: (i) timing
    of key phenological dates (e.g., the start of the season, peak growth, and the
    end of the season); (ii) productivity (e.g., seasonal mean, or the growing season
    integral of the vegetation index time series); and (iii) seasonality (i.e., the
    magnitude of within-season variability). Global maps of such metrics can only
    be produced at medium resolution using both Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. Vegetation
    condition products for the pre-Sentinel-2 era should focus on composite vegetation
    indices and on a reduced set of phenological descriptors insensitive to sparser
    time series data. Alternatively, the combination of Landsat observations from
    multiple years can be used to produce multi-year average phenology products (Baumann
    et al., 2017), and, where there is sufficient data density, annual start and end
    of growing season metrics for stable land cover types (Melaas et al., 2016). Several
    factors influence the quality of phenological metrics: the temporal cadence of
    the satellite observations (i.e., the density and distribution of observations)
    during the annual phenological cycle, the quality of cloud, shadow and snow flagging,
    and the appropriateness of the model used to fit the observations. Per-pixel product
    quality information should reflect factors such as the maximum gap between observations
    during each phenophase (e.g., greenup) during the growing season, and the coefficient
    of determination (R2) between interpolated and observed values during different
    periods in the growing season (Bolton et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018). In addition
    to the vegetation index and phenology essential products identified above, desirable
    vegetation condition products include medium-resolution Leaf Area Index (LAI)
    and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy
    (FAPAR). Both can be derived in multiple ways including radiative transfer modelling
    (Ganguly et al., 2012), downscaling MODIS/VIIRS LAI (Gao et al., 2012), or using
    machine learning (Kang et al., 2021). For example, the Sentinel-2 Level 2 LAI
    and FAPAR products use the physically-based PROSAIL model to simulate surface
    reflectance and retrieve LAI and FAPAR using trained neural networks (Fernandes
    et al., 2014; Weiss and Baret, 2016). Another desirable product is the fraction
    of green vegetation cover. Spectral mixture analysis can estimate fractional cover
    estimates globally from coarse resolution data (Filipponi et al., 2018), and is
    likely straightforward from Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series through generalizing
    endmember selection based on machine learning regression (Frantz et al., 2021;
    Schug et al., 2020). 3.4. Surface radiation balance The partitioning of incoming
    radiation at the land surface is a key factor in regulating climate and Earth
    system processes. Incident radiation from the sun (Sd) and downwelling longwave
    radiation from the atmosphere (Ld) can be reflected, absorbed and re-emitted at
    the land surface, defining the net radiation energy (Rnet) available at the surface:
    (1) here Snet and Lnet, are net shortwave and longwave radiation energy, respectively,
    α is the broad-band albedo, Sd and Ld are the incoming (downward) shortwave and
    longwave radiation, respectively, εs is surface emissivity, Ts is surface temperature
    (ST), and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The precise balance defined in Eq.
    1 depends on local surface conditions and governs the rate of heating or cooling
    of the surface and surrounding air layer. The reflectance of the Earth surface
    in discrete wavelength bands is a primary satellite observable, conveying information
    including about properties of soils, plants, urban cover, and surface water. Satellite-based
    surface reflectance, albedo, and surface temperature products are collectively
    critical to understanding how factors regulating surface radiation balance respond
    to changes in land-use and land-cover, as well as the role humans play in modifying
    their environment. 3.4.1. Surface reflectance Atmospheric correction of top of
    atmosphere (TOA) reflectance to surface reflectance is a fundamental pre-processing
    step required for the majority of land products (Roy et al., 2014a). The influence
    of the atmosphere in scattering and absorbing incoming solar radiation as well
    as reflected and emitted surface radiation, is well established (Fraser and Kaufman,
    1985). This influence, like the weather, is highly variable in space and time,
    particularly for aerosol constituents that significantly scatter and absorb at
    shorter wavelengths (Dubovik et al., 2002). For example, the mean absolute difference
    between TOA reflectance and atmospherically corrected (i.e., surface) reflectance,
    expressed as a percentage of the surface reflectance, was documented as 45%, 22%,
    and 12% for the Landsat ETM+ visible blue, green and red bands across the United
    States (Roy et al., 2014a). Modern atmospheric correction algorithms use radiative
    transfer models in conjunction with ancillary data that characterize the atmospheric
    constituents, and usually an image-based aerosol retrieval methodology. The LaSRC
    (Land Surface Reflectance Code) is a generic atmospheric correction algorithm
    that accounts for gaseous absorption along with molecular scattering and aerosol
    extinction. LaSRC is based on the inversion of the “6SV” vectorial radiative transfer
    code (Kotchenova and Vermote, 2007; Kotchenova et al., 2008). Although LaSRC was
    originally developed for MODIS and VIIRS (Vermote et al., 2014; Vermote and Saleous,
    2002), it has been adapted to Landsat-8 and 9 (Vermote et al., 2016) and Sentinel-2
    (Doxani et al., 2018). LaSRC provides per-pixel quality assessment data and an
    internal cloud and shadow mask (Skakun et al., 2019). When both Landsat and Sentinel-2
    observations are combined, other approaches to atmospheric correction can also
    be considered. Given that the primary bands of Landsat-8 and 9 are very similar
    to Sentinel-2, and that their data together provide several observations per week,
    time series approaches such as the Multi-Angle Implementation of the Atmospheric
    Correction (MAIAC) algorithm (Lyapustin et al., 2018) are possible. The use of
    the dynamic covariance technique, where the latest image is correlated with earlier
    images, helps establish a reproducible spatial surface pattern and develop a clear-sky
    reference image for improved cloud and cloud shadow detection (Lyapustin et al.,
    2008). Other algorithms, such as the Sensor Invariant Atmospheric Correction (SIAC)
    algorithm, that uses the MODIS BRDF/Albedo product (Schaaf et al., 2002) and Copernicus
    Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) operational forecasts of aerosol optical
    thickness and column water vapor (Benedetti et al., 2009; Morcrette et al., 2009)
    have been developed to atmospherically correct Landsat and other sensor imagery
    (Yin et al., 2022) with per-pixel surface reflectance uncertainties that are helpful
    for propagation into higher level product generation algorithms. Validation of
    surface reflectance is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the atmosphere
    and has typically relied on the use of AERONET data (Holben et al., 1998) to characterize
    atmospheric constituents at sites selected to capture a wide range of surface
    and atmospheric conditions (Ju et al., 2012; Vermote and Kotchenova, 2008; Wang
    et al., 2009). Recent community exercises including the Atmospheric Correction
    Intercomparison eXercise (ACIX) provide a forum for surface reflectance validation
    and atmospheric correction algorithm inter-comparison (Doxani et al., 2018; Doxani
    et al., 2023). Notably, the most recent ACIX exercise included the use of reference
    data from instrumented sites, such as ROSAS (Meygret et al., 2011) and RadCalNet
    (Bouvet et al., 2019), that directly and continuously measure surface reflectance.
    New systems, such as CAMSIS that use imaging systems mounted on stationary towers
    to measure heterogeneous vegetated sites (Vermote et al., 2022), are being developed
    and will enable meaningful validation of corrections to account for surface heterogeneity
    (i.e., adjacency effects) (Liang et al., 2001; Lyapustin, 2001; Ouaidrari and
    Vermote, 1999). 3.4.2. Albedo Land surface albedo is also considered an essential
    climate variable (CEOS, 2015) necessary to monitor the surface energy budget.
    Medium-resolution albedo measures, retrieved daily or every couple of days, provide
    the details required to fully capture variability of the surface energy budget.
    Land surface albedo (α) is a hemispherical reflective quantity, representing the
    proportion of the incoming solar radiation that is reflected as a function of
    surface cover and structure, and ranges from 0.0 for the most absorptive surfaces,
    such as water, to almost 1.0 for the brightest reflective surfaces, such as fresh
    snow. Surface albedo can vary rapidly in time, for example, due to snowfall, snow
    melt, vegetation phenology, harvesting, and wildfires (Wang et al., 2017; Zhang
    et al., 2017), and at scales that may not be resolved at coarse spatial resolution.
    If sufficient directional surface observations are available to adequately model
    the character of the surface reflectance anisotropy (defined by the bidirectional
    reflectance distribution function (BRDF)), then robust measures of intrinsic surface
    albedo can be estimated from satellite observed reflectances. Note that intrinsic
    measures of surface albedo, commonly called white sky albedo (bihemispherical
    reflectance, or wholly diffuse albedo) and black sky albedo (directional hemispherical
    reflectance, or wholly direct albedo) can be combined as a function of aerosol
    optical depth to generate an instantaneous albedo at a specific time (also known
    as blue-sky albedo) as would be measured by tower albedometers (Roman et al.,
    2010). Coarse spatial resolution land surface BRDF and albedo products have been
    generated at global scale on a systematic daily to weekly basis, including from
    MODIS and VIIRS (Roujean et al., 1992; Schaaf et al., 2002; Schaaf et al., 2011;
    Wang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017) and from multi-angle sensors such as MISR
    (Lyapustin et al., 2006; Martonchik et al., 1998), POLDER (Bacour and Breon, 2005;
    Hautecoeur and Leroy, 1998) and AATRS (Sayer et al., 2012). Sensors that have
    narrow fields of view and lower revisit cycles, such as Landsat and Sentinel-2,
    do not provide sufficient angular sampling of the surface to be able to characterize
    the BRDF reliably at time scales where the surface can be assumed to be unchanged
    (Roy et al., 2016b). Recently, medium-resolution surface albedos have been determined
    by coupling medium-resolution surface reflectance with surface anisotropy information
    derived from coincident more frequent but lower spatial resolution sensors. For
    example, a Landsat albedo algorithm has been developed that relies on daily MODIS/VIIRS
    BRDF retrievals from concurrent or nearby locations and couples these with each
    Landsat observation to generate 30-m albedo products (Fig. 3) (Elmes et al., 2021;
    Erb et al., 2022). Ideally, Landsat and Sentinel-2 based albedo products should
    be produced at near-daily to weekly time steps to capture rapid surface changes.
    This is especially needed to capture snowfall and rapid melting of snow cover,
    which can result in significant radiative forcing changes due to markedly different
    snow and non-snow covered surface albedo and changes in the snow characteristics
    (Betts, 2000; Erb et al., 2022). Thus, the temporal dynamism of snow covered surfaces
    will be better captured by combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations and this
    will be particularly true at higher latitudes because of low illumination conditions
    in the shoulder and winter seasons (despite more frequent overpasses). Download

    Landsat-8 derived Shortwave White Sky Albedo for May and June 2018 over Alaska
    USA. The 30-m resolution albedo values are generated by combining Landsat surface
    reflectances (C1) with temporally coincident BRDF information from MODIS (C6.1).
    The insets highlight the detail provided by 30-m albedo data including A) albedo
    values over the small waterbodies and wetlands in the Yukon River Delta in June
    2018, and B) the decrease in albedo occurring over the Mooseheart (left) and Zitziana
    River (right) fires scars which occurred in 2018. For further details see Erb
    et al. (2022). Satellite albedo product accuracy has been quantified by albedo
    product comparison with tower radiometer observations, such as measured by the
    US National Ecological Observation Network (NEON), the Baseline Surface Radiation
    Network (BSRN), the Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net), and the international
    FLUXNET (Wang et al., 2019). Accuracy assessment has typically been limited to
    comparisons with instrumented towers, but field measurements and uncrewed aerial
    vehicles UAVs and airborne data are also possible (Lyapustin et al., 2010; Wright
    et al., 2014; Wulder et al., 2022). Tower data provide long time series validation
    opportunities. The tower height governs how spatially representative the tower
    data are of the satellite footprint. For Landsat and Sentinel-2, even the short
    GC-Net towers are sufficient (Elmes et al., 2021). All albedo products produced
    by space agencies internationally have per-pixel quality assessment information,
    for example, indicating the confidence in the albedo retrieval, and whether the
    albedo is a snow-free, and it is important that this information be examined by
    product users. 3.4.3. Land surface temperature Land surface temperature (Ts) is
    a critical diagnostic of the surface energy balance, evaporative fluxes, and vegetation
    stress. Ts can vary rapidly in space and time: for example, the diurnal variation
    in land Ts can be markedly different between a road and an adjacent crop field.
    Ts does not mix linearly with scale, and medium-resolution estimates are needed
    to capture many aspects of the landscape that are not resolved at coarse resolution.
    Medium-resolution land Ts has a wide range of uses including estimating net radiation,
    crop water use and evapotranspiration (see section 3.8), and quantifying urban
    heat island effects (Weng et al., 2004). That is why we consider medium-resolution
    land Ts to be an essential product. There is a long history of algorithms developed
    to retrieve land surface temperature (Ts) from coarse global coverage sensors
    with thermal wavelength detectors. Notably, the NOAA AVHRR sensors have ~11-μm
    and ~12-μm thermal bands and more recent sensors have an additional ~4 μm band,
    and MODIS and VIIRS continue these configurations. Split-window Ts algorithms
    take advantage of these bands to reduce differential atmospheric absorption (Gerace
    et al., 2020; Wan and Dozier, 1996). The Sentinel-2A and -2B sensors do not have
    thermal wavelength detectors and so land Ts and εs products would need to be derived
    from Landsat only. Landsat’s thermal sensors are unique for their excellent calibration
    (<0.3 K RMSE) and routine global medium-resolution coverage (Barsi et al., 2014;
    Hook et al., 2020; Schott et al., 2012). The Landsat TM and ETM+ sensors had a
    single ~11.5-μm thermal band and although land Ts can be derived using atmospheric
    data, this requires the emissivity to be pre-defined or assumed to be constant
    (Malakar et al., 2018). Landsat-8 and 9 carry the TIRS sensors with two thermal
    bands (10.8 and 12 μm) that enable retrieval of land Ts after compensation of
    the measured radiance for atmospheric effects using a split-window correction
    (Gerace et al., 2020). However, the εs must be specified a priori, for example,
    based on the ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset (Hulley et al., 2015). The goal for
    satellite-retrieved land Ts is an uncertainty of 1 K based on user-driven baseline
    requirements and approved by the Committee on Earth Observation (CEOS) Satellites
    Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) Land Production Validation
    subgroup (Guillevic et al., 2018). The WGCV has further defined a protocol for
    best practices for the validation of surface temperature products. These include
    a temperature-based validation, radiance-based validation, multi-sensor inter-comparisons,
    and time-series analyses (Guillevic et al., 2018). Quality Assessment flags in
    land Ts products should include information related to the input data quality,
    cloud flags, and other algorithm performance metrics. Land εs is a desirable product.
    However, at least three thermal bands are necessary to physically retrieve emissivity.
    Planning for the next generation of Landsat therefore includes five thermal bands
    (Wulder et al., 2022) specifically to facilitate temperature-emissivity separation
    (Hulley and Hook, 2011). In this case, emissivity could be dynamically retrieved
    and supplied as an independent product such as in the current standard MODIS,
    VIIRS, and ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station
    (ECOSTRESS) surface temperature products (Hulley et al., 2022; Hulley et al.,
    2018). Furthermore, net radiation (Eq. 1) should be considered as an aspirational
    product, combining albedo, temperature, emissivity, and gridded insolation and
    longwave data from reanalysis. 3.5. Biodiversity and faunal habitat Biodiversity
    declines are a major societal concern because of resulting threats to ecosystem
    services, and because of the inherent value that many people place on natural
    ecosystems and the species that inhabit them. However, assessing the full diversity
    of life is challenging. Satellite data and derived products have an important
    role in informing efforts to conserve species’ habitat and safeguard biodiversity.
    Land cover classifications, for example, are good predictors of habitat quality
    and species distributions (Skidmore et al., 2021; Turner et al., 2003). Similarly,
    land cover change analyses highlight threats to protected areas (DeFries et al.,
    2005; Falcucci et al., 2007) or ecosystem services (Andrew et al., 2014). In addition,
    satellite data can characterize the underlying environmental conditions that affect
    biodiversity (Duro et al., 2007). Coarse-resolution satellite data can predict
    biodiversity at global to continental scales (Fjeldsa et al., 1997; Waring et
    al., 2006). For example, the 1-km MODIS-based Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs),
    explain two thirds of the variation in species richness of amphibians, birds,
    and mammals globally (Radeloff et al., 2019). Similarly, image texture measures
    derived from MODIS vegetation indices provide a proxy for habitat heterogeneity
    (Tuanmu and Jetz, 2015; Wallis et al., 2016), and MODIS-based winter habitat indices
    capture patterns of snow and frozen ground (Gudex-Cross et al., 2021), making
    such indices useful, for example, for bird species richness predictions (Carroll
    et al., 2022). Medium-resolution satellite data are best suited for assessments
    of biodiversity and faunal habitat (Farwell et al., 2021; Pettorelli et al., 2014;
    Turner et al., 2003) because those data capture both variability in environmental
    condition within an animal’s territory (Pettorelli et al., 2005; St-Louis et al.,
    2010) and heterogeneity in vegetation structure (Cohen and Goward, 2004; Liu et
    al., 2001). Furthermore, medium-resolution satellite data capture conservation
    threats, such as urban development and agricultural expansion, well. There are
    several metrics that can be retrieved from satellite data to act as proxies or
    predictors of biodiversity. The DHIs summarize three aspects of the annual phenology
    of vegetation productivity and were originally proposed by Berry et al. (2007)
    and Mackey et al. (2004), and further developed by Coops et al. (2009), Hobi et
    al. (2017) and Radeloff et al. (2019). Cumulative productivity is a measure of
    available energy. Minimum productivity is a measure of resource limitations. Lastly,
    Variation in productivity captures seasonality. The DHIs correlate well with biodiversity,
    but currently are only available globally at coarse resolution (e.g., silvis.forest.wisc.edu/data/dhis).
    We suggest to produce the three DHIs globally as an essential medium-resolution
    product for biodiversity applications (Fig. 4). The DHIs can be derived from any
    proxy for vegetation productivity (Hobi et al., 2017), so 30-m EVI data would
    be adequate until more direct measures of productivity, such as FPAR were available.
    For the composite DHIs, which summarize long-term averages and are best for analyses
    of multi-year biodiversity data, such as species richness estimates derived from
    range maps, we suggest to analyze one decade of Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations,
    and calculate the median monthly vegetation indices among years. For the annual
    DHIs, which are best when analyzing annual biodiversity data from field survey,
    missing monthly values need to be filled after curve fitting (Hobi et al., 2021).

    US (A) as a color composite with the cumulative, minimum and variability DHIs
    in GBR, and a zoom-in for parts of Colorado highlighting differences between MODIS
    (B) and Landsat DHIs (C). The DHIs cannot be measured directly on the ground,
    and are unitless, which precludes their direct validation. However, quality assessment
    flags for the DHIs need to propagate uncertainties inherent in the EVI (or FPAR),
    and uncertainties related to sparse observations. For both composite and annual
    DHIs, it would be valuable to report the number of observations available in each
    month, their standard deviation, the months for which missing values had to be
    filled, and the longest stretch of subsequent months for which data was missing.
    In addition, a categorical quality flag that summarizes the detailed quality-related
    information into three classes of high-, medium-, and low-quality DHIs would be
    useful. 3.6. Snow and glaciers We suggest that snow cover extent is an essential
    data product to support climate change investigations and snow hydrology applications.
    Although most land cover remote sensing classifications include permanent snow
    and ice thematic classes, there is a need to map inter- and intra-annual variability
    in snow cover. Trends in the perennial land ice extent relate to local climate
    trends and the impacts of warming, water resources during the dry season, and
    contributions to sea level rise as glaciated areas continue to recede globally.
    Satellite-based cryospheric products, primarily derived from active and passive
    microwave data, and in a few cases Landsat, emerged in the late 1980s with imaging
    of ice sheet margins, sea ice, snow cover, albedo, and surface melting (Cavalieri
    et al., 2003; Key and Haefliger, 1992; Key et al., 2016). Mapping snow cover extent
    was based on thresholding spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Snow
    Index (NDSI), which is the normalized ratio of the green and SWIR bands (Dozier,
    1989). Landsat snow cover extent mapping was limited by visible band saturation
    in the pre-Landsat-8 era (Crawford et al., 2013; Hall et al., 1986) and Landsat''s
    low temporal resolution, which prohibited the mapping of fast-changing snow cover
    conditions that occur, for example, in mountainous regions and ephemeral mid-latitude
    melt zones (Crawford, 2015; Selkowitz and Forster, 2016a). In the 1990s and early
    2000s, snow mapping algorithms were developed using Landsat and MODIS with refinements
    using other indices such as the NDVI to reduce NDSI thresholding sensitivity to
    forest cover (Hall et al., 2019; Riggs and Hall, 2020; Riggs et al., 2017). Spectral
    unmixing methods were developed that retrieved the sub-pixel fractional snow cover
    by unmixing end-member snow spectra from various background surface types such
    as rock, soil, or vegetation (Dozier et al., 2009; Painter et al., 2003; Painter
    et al., 2009). The improved radiometric resolution of the Landsat-8 and 9 optical
    wavelength sensors (12- and 14-bit, respectively, versus 8-bit for previous Landsat
    sensors) greatly increases the efficacy of the spectral unmixing approach for
    snow cover mapping (Crawford et al., 2019). For example, spectral unmixing is
    the basis for the current USGS fSCA algorithm (Selkowitz and Forster, 2016b; Selkowitz
    et al., 2017). A second essential product is perennial ice extent, which has been
    developed using MODIS and VIIRS by tracking the seasonal minimum snow extent,
    and spectrally determining the extent of exposed bare ice and snow-covered glacier
    ice, and excluding debris-covered areas (ice with heavy debris cover, or rock
    glaciers, or ice pods within permafrost, are not typically not considered in the
    mapping) (Rittger et al., 2021; Rittger et al., 2013). Perennial ice extent mapping
    is also possible with the current Landsat and Sentinel-2 constellation using existing
    algorithms that together have daily coverage >50° latitude and sub-daily coverage
    near the poles (Li and Roy, 2017). Although past algorithms based on MODIS and
    VIIRS have succeeded in mapping the snow cover minimum and its interannual variability,
    mapping the trend of perennial land ice cover will require the medium-resolution
    scale of the Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors because extent changes are small from
    one year to the next. For snow cover extent, validation and quality data will
    need to address retrieval uncertainties that propagate from atmospheric correction
    artifacts, cloud and cloud shadow contamination (Crawford et al., 2013), and terrain
    shadowing (Rittger et al., 2021). For accuracy assessments, especially of fractional
    snow cover maps, high-resolution satellite imagery is necessary. Just as Landsat
    data were used to develop and validate snow cover products from MODIS (Crawford,
    2015; Hall et al., 2001; Rittger et al., 2013), Landsat snow cover algorithms
    can be validated using high spatial resolution WorldView or PlanetScope imagery
    (Bair et al., 2020; Stillinger et al., 2019). To validate perennial ice cover,
    Worldview stereo imagery and other sources of high-resolution topographic data
    can be used to identify the surface slope break along debris-covered glacier boundaries
    relative to the adjacent non-ice or low-ice content material. As a desirable product,
    we recommend glacier and ice sheet velocity data in addition to snow albedo (Section
    3.4.2) and cover extent. Glacier and ice sheet flow velocity measurement by VNIR
    image-pair correlation to map ice feature displacement is quite mature (Bindschadler
    and Scambos, 1991; Fahnestock et al., 2016). These approaches became feasible
    thanks to the improved radiometric sensitivity of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, which
    allows ice flow tracking by estimating displacement based on decameter-scale roughness
    features (sastrugi fields, (Bindschadler, 2003)), even in the absence of higher-contrast
    crevasses or debris cover. 3.7. Inland and coastal water extent and condition
    3.7.1. Surface water extent and dynamics Surface water greatly affects climate,
    ecosystem processes, and human activity (Arnell, 2004; Shiklomanov, 1998). Surface
    water extent is highly dynamic due to both natural processes such as precipitation
    and evaporation, and human activities such as damming and irrigation. Information
    on surface water presence is a key variable in numerical weather prediction and
    climate models (IPCC, 2013) (Subin et al., 2012). The Global Climate Observing
    System (GCOS) has identified lake area as an Essential Climate Variable, and surface
    water occurrence change is one of the relevant indicators of change in the climate
    system (Adrian et al., 2009). Natural lakes and free-flowing rivers are among
    the world’s most species-rich ecosystems (Dudgeon et al., 2006), making surface
    water habitat an Essential Biodiversity Variable (Pereira et al., 2013; Pettorelli
    et al., 2016). Similarly, the UN Sustainable Development Target 6.6 calls for
    protection and restoration of water-related ecosystems and for the monitoring
    of change in their extent over time as a key environmental indicator (UN Environment,
    2019). Humanity depends on water for drinking (WHO, 2016), sanitation (Hutton
    et al., 2004), food production (Khan and Hanjra, 2009; Luseno et al., 2003), energy
    (Spang et al., 2014), and industry (Florke et al., 2013), while waterborne diseases
    such as malaria, and dengue pose substantial health risks (Birley, 1991). Given
    the critical importance of surface water for climate, biodiversity, and humanity,
    it is necessary to map surface water occurrence reliably and consistently worldwide
    over several decades, with the highest possible spatial and temporal resolution.
    This means capturing seasonal and inter-annual changes of waterbodies, as well
    as their persistence over time (Belward et al., 2020). While surface water is
    often included in land cover maps, such maps do not capture surface water dynamics,
    which require mapping surface water extent ideally on a daily basis, but at least
    weekly. There are various methods for mapping surface water using optical remote
    sensing, with distinct trade-offs in terms of spatial and temporal resolution
    (Huang et al., 2018). The necessary first step in retrieving a range of downstream
    derivatives is identifying surface water presence or absence with very low commission
    and omission error for each single observation (‘pixel level’). Such higher-level
    derivatives are available in the Global Surface Water Explorer and include products
    such as occurrence, occurrence change intensity, maximum extent, recurrence, seasonality,
    and transition (Fig. 5), which describe both short- and long-term global surface
    water dynamics (Pekel et al., 2016). Landsat data allow to map surface water seasonality
    at 5- to 10-year intervals (Yamazaki et al., 2015), and over multiple decades
    at sub-continental (Tulbure et al., 2016), continental (Mueller et al., 2016),
    and global scales (Pekel et al., 2016; Pickens et al., 2020). However, Landsat’s
    30-m resolution and relatively low observation frequency induce omission errors
    for smaller water bodies, which can be widespread (Downing et al., 2006) and precludes
    mapping of surface hydrological connectivity (Wu et al., 2021) making it advantageous
    to also analyze 10-20 m Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1 data. Download : Download high-res

    transition extracted from the Global Surface Water Extent dataset (Pekel et al.,
    2016) focusing on the River Ob in western Siberia, Russia. This change map offers
    comprehensive documentation of transitions taking place between permanent water
    bodies and seasonal ones, and is based on an analysis of the entire Landsat archive.
    The identification of surface water presence or absence with low commission and
    omission error is the necessary first step before deriving temporally resolved
    water parameters, such as the maximum surface water extent, water recurrence and
    seasonality, needed to describe short- and long-term global surface water dynamics
    (Pekel et al., 2016). Inland water’s small area (<3% of the global land area)
    and high spatio-temporal variability pose particular challenges to assess accuracy
    globally across different sensors and over several decades (Pekel et al., 2016;
    Pickens et al., 2020) while adhering to best statistical practices (Olofsson et
    al., 2014; Olofsson et al., 2012). The validation design for water surface evaluation
    must address the inherent challenges of small spatial extent and spatio-temporal
    variation of inland water (Pekel et al., 2016). Obtaining a comprehensive global
    reference dataset for validation purposes is challenging due to the limited availability
    of high spatial resolution imagery archives. Furthermore, the frequent cloud coverage
    in certain regions restricts the availability of suitable observation. However,
    to meet the requirements of best statistical practices, a substantial number of
    samples is necessary. For instance, the validation of the Global Surface Water
    Explorer conducted by Pekel et al. (2016) utilized a comprehensive set of 40,124
    control points. A confidence measure of the class assignment (i.e., water, land,
    or non-valid observation) should be provided as per pixel QA flags, and propagated
    into parameters that document the long-term surface water dynamics. 3.7.2. Surface
    water quality Just as important as the presence or absence of surface water is
    its quality, which is directly related to the ecosystem services waterbodies offer.
    Water quality is usually defined in terms of the physical, chemical, or biological
    properties of the water column. Global human change and rising temperature together
    with more frequent severe weather events threaten water quality in lakes, rivers,
    reservoirs, and coastal environments (Vörösmarty et al., 2000; Whitehead et al.,
    2009). Optical remote sensing allows for monitoring surface water quality indicators
    such as the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla), which is the primary pigment
    in phytoplankton (Carpenter and Carpenter, 1983). MODIS Chla products at 250-
    to 1000-m resolution have been utilized for studying and monitoring harmful algal
    blooms and trophic states in coastal waters (Park et al., 2010; Werdell et al.,
    2009) as well as in large African or North American lakes (Binding et al., 2010;
    Chavula et al., 2009). However, many water bodies are too small to be reliably
    monitored with MODIS or MERIS data. For instance, Clark et al. (2017) showed that
    only < 10% of the U.S. water bodies (e.g., drinking water supplies, recreational
    waters) are resolvable through a nominal 300 m spatial resolution. Since the mid-1980s,
    Landsat data analyses of small waterbodies demonstrated the feasibility for determining
    turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) (Carpenter and Carpenter, 1983; Mertes
    et al., 1993; Montanher et al., 2014), harmful algal blooms (Ho et al., 2017)
    and water clarity (Kloiber et al., 2002). The utility of Landsat-5 and 7 data,
    however, remained largely exploratory, due to their low temporal resolution, low
    radiometric resolution, and sparse spectral bands in the visible and NIR needed
    to monitor dynamic water quality parameters (Mouw et al., 2017). The improved
    radiometric quality and spectral coverage of the Landsat-8 and 9 OLI and OLI-2
    (Masek et al., 2020) combined with Sentinel-2A and -2B MSIs with similar radiometric
    capabilities but improved spectral resolution in the NIR, has spurred research
    efforts to assess the feasibility of generating harmonious water quality products
    from the two missions (Kuhn et al., 2019; Pahlevan et al., 2019). Combined Landsat
    and Sentinel-2 water quality products would enable the monitoring of naturally
    dynamic aquatic ecosystems, impacts of episodic events such as extended wet/dry
    periods (Gámez et al., 2019; Sinha et al., 2017), illegal spills and discharges
    (Dethier et al., 2019), and harmful algal blooms (Bresciani et al., 2018). Indeed,
    the shellfish industry is using this virtual constellation for site selection,
    and to devise risk mitigation strategies in the event of harmful algal blooms
    (Gernez et al., 2017; Snyder et al., 2017). The UNEP as the custodian agency for
    Sustainable Development Goal 6.3.2 indicator (i.e., the proportion of waterbodies
    with good ambient waters) is leveraging such data products to report on the global
    near-surface water quality conditions on a global scale. Estimating essential
    near-surface water quality variables including Chla, TSS, turbidity, and Secchi
    disk depth (or transparency) requires consistent satellite TOA reflectance data
    with reliable cloud screening and atmospheric correction (Pahlevan et al., 2021),
    and retrieval algorithms that, to date, rely mostly on empirical or semi-analytical
    models (IOCCG, 2000, IOCCG, 2018). Given the state of the knowledge and the availability
    of adequate in situ training datasets, global TSS, turbidity, and transparency
    products from both Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations are feasible for a range
    of aquatic conditions (Balasubramanian et al., 2020; Kuhn et al., 2019). With
    its red-edge band, Sentinel-2 is capable of resolving Chla in highly turbid/eutrophic
    waters whereas, similar to coarse-resolution imagers like VIIRS that are missing
    this band, Landsat can be used to retrieve Chla in less trophic waters (i.e.,
    Chla < 8 mg m-3) (Jiang et al., 2020; Pahlevan et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2021).
    Progress on compensating for atmospheric effects will reduce the uncertainties
    in surface water quality products although atmospheric correction algorithms over
    aquatic environments are still underway (Pahlevan et al., 2021). Validation of
    surface water quality products has been demonstrated (Pahlevan et al., 2022; Warren
    et al., 2021). However, high spatio-temporal dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, in
    particular in estuaries or larger lakes, present a major challenge when comparing
    satellite retrievals with field measurements. Frequent cloud cover, haze, sunglint
    effects, and unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g., high winds) further diminish
    validation opportunities particularly in low and high latitudes. Lastly, validation
    data in developing countries are scarce, requiring a more cautious approach for
    the interpretation of products there. Surface water quality products should include
    pixel-level quality assessment flags, ideally in the form of continuous variables
    that quantify the confidence in a given estimate, rather than just categorical
    variables separating, for example, high-, medium- and low-quality pixels. 3.8.
    Evapotranspiration Evapotranspiration (ET) is the net transfer of water from the
    land to the atmosphere, via both transpiration from plants and evaporation from
    soil and other surfaces. ET is the second largest component of the water budget,
    after precipitation, and a measure of the water that is consumed and lost from
    a watershed and therefore unavailable for other uses. Irrigated agriculture accounts
    for 70% of human water use globally, and water demand is expected increase further
    by 20% by 2050 due to increased irrigation needs (AQUASTAT, 2016; WWAP, 2012).
    Thus, accurate information on ET is required to balance water supply and water
    demand, and to ensure adequate water supplies for agricultural production, ecosystem
    needs, and other uses. Satellite observations in the thermal infrared and reflectance
    bands can be used to assess surface moisture and vegetation status governing evaporative
    losses over both natural and managed landscapes. MODIS 8 and 16-day ET products
    are systematically generated globally at 500-m resolution based on the Penman-Monteith
    model, and used in regional water use assessments (Abolafia-Rosenzweig et al.,
    2021; Mu et al., 2011). However, for many water resource applications, satellite
    data and derived ET products at <100-m resolution are required to capture variations
    in water use and plant stress at the stand or field scale (Anderson et al., 2012)
    (Fig. 6). Landsat is optimal for developing field-scale ET products because it
    provides well-calibrated, co-registered, and contemporaneous TIR and optical data
    at medium resolution (30-100 m). The aforementioned lack of Sentinel-2A and -2B
    TIR bands limits the use of their imagery standalone for ET estimation. Download

    Landsat-based OpenET ensemble average ET (Melton et al., 2021) difference between
    2021 and 2020 annual ET for Ferron and Castle Dale, Utah, in the Upper Colorado
    River Basin. Agricultural areas in the region are primarily flood irrigated from
    mountain front streams, and low winter precipitation in 2020-2021 negatively impacted
    irrigation deliveries as seen by reduced field-scale ET in 2021. Growing season
    precipitation was higher in 2021, resulting in higher ET within dryland areas
    than in 2020. Figure created using ClimateEngine.org, basemap Google. A variety
    of remote sensing approaches with different spectral and ancillary inputs, computational
    demands, and varying levels of complexity have been developed to map ET from Landsat
    data. Approaches that rely only on optical data commonly use crop type information
    and crop-specific NDVI transformations to estimate fractional cover, and ultimately
    instantaneous and 24hr ET (Melton et al., 2012; Pereira et al., 2020). Another
    class of models use surface energy balance approaches (Allen et al., 2007; Anderson
    et al., 2007), which account for the energy used to transform liquid water in
    plants and soil into vapor, and rely on thermal, optical, and weather data to
    estimate net radiation, sensible heat flux, ground heat flux, and latent heat
    flux, or ET. Simplified surface energy balance approaches that rely on thermal
    and optical data are sometimes preferred for computational efficiency, but in
    these, certain components of the energy balance are not estimated (Fisher et al.,
    2008; Senay, 2018). In each of these approaches, instantaneous ET retrieved at
    the time of the satellite overpass is typically upscaled to a daily (24hr total)
    value through the use of a scaling flux such as solar radiation, net radiation,
    or standardized reference ET, where daily ET = F * ETf, and F is the daily scaling
    flux (L/T) and ETf (unitless) is the instantaneous fraction of the daily scaling
    flux. When reference ET is used for F, ETf is analogous to a crop coefficient
    used by the agricultural engineering community (Hobbins and Huntington, 2016),
    but is representative of actual field conditions instead of well-watered conditions
    that traditional crop coefficients assume. To gain credibility within the user
    community, Landsat ET products require comprehensive and rigorous evaluation over
    a range of vegetation cover types (e.g., croplands, grasslands, forests, shrublands),
    climate conditions (humid to arid), and land-management strategies (e.g., irrigated
    and rainfed crops). Validation data sources range from “point measurements” (meter
    to kilometer scale) from lysimeters and eddy covariance (EC) flux towers to larger
    scale (e.g., watershed) estimates obtained via water balance. Each type of measurement
    requires careful treatment and consideration of potential sources of measurement
    uncertainty. EC tower fluxes must undergo rigorous post-processing and energy
    budget closure assessment with station flux footprints identified to pair with
    respective satellite fluxes (Volk et al., 2023). Water balance requires high quality
    precipitation and streamflow data, and good understanding of watershed dynamics.
    The model intercomparison study conducted under the OpenET project makes use of
    all types of measurements, and may serve as an example for future remote sensing
    ET product validation and benchmark efforts (Melton et al., 2021; Volk et al.,
    2023). QA flags should propagate from thermal and VSWIR inputs to the ET model,
    as well as quality of gridded input meteorological inputs if available. Errors
    in ST retrieval due to undetected clouds or cloud fringes will be a major source
    of non-algorithmic error to ET estimates. Although ETf and 24hr ET on Landsat
    overpass dates are essential products, land managers often require time-continuous
    information at daily, weekly or monthly time-steps. Gap-filling ET between Landsat
    overpasses can be accomplished by interpolating the instantaneous ETf retrieval
    on the overpass date to time-continuous values, then recovering the ET time series
    values at each time step i from the scaling flux time series: ET (i) = F(i) ×
    ETf(i). The time step for a desirable ET time series product will be constrained
    by computational capabilities and storage capacity. Errors in daily ET estimates
    due to temporal interpolation decrease as the interval between satellite overpasses
    decreases by about 20% on average between 16 days and 8 days. Therefore, use of
    multiple medium-resolution satellite platforms capable of simultaneous acquisition
    of thermal and optical data is ideal for increasing accuracy of monthly, seasonal,
    and annual ET estimates. QA flags would need to reflect the temporal density of
    direct retrievals used in the interpolation. 4. Aspirational future products In
    addition to the essential and the desirable products outlined above, there are
    opportunities for aspirational, future products, which will require further algorithms
    refinements, but could become feasible. What follows are a few examples of such
    products, not a comprehensive list. For land cover, there is proof-of-concept
    for the mapping forest types, or dominant tree species at the genus level if stands
    are fairly uniform, for both boreal (Astola et al., 2019; Hermosilla et al., 2023)
    and temperate (Hemmerling et al., 2021) forests. Similarly, forest structure has
    been successfully mapped for selected regions. For all of Canada''s forests, attributes
    including biomass, volume, canopy cover, and height, have been mapped using Landsat,
    with the generation of time series structural dynamics also demonstrated (Matasci
    et al., 2018a; Matasci et al., 2018b). In urban areas, medium-resolution satellite
    data can capture urban form and structure, and provide information on urban heterogeneity
    by using new spectral indices or subpixel mapping to characterize inter-urban
    variation (Chen et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2019c). For forest disturbances, insect
    defoliation of forests has been successfully mapped in case studies (Goodwin et
    al., 2008; Ye et al., 2021b). Similarly, medium-resolution satellite data capture
    wind-throw in forests well (Baumann et al., 2014), but distinguishing disturbance
    agents correctly is an area of active research (Sebald et al., 2021; Senf and
    Seidl, 2021). For burned area mapping, retrieval of the fraction of the pixel
    that burned and the combustion completeness is of interest for pyrogenic emission
    estimation, but they may be challenging to retrieve reliably over heterogeneous
    vegetation canopies and after post-fire exposure of soil (Roy et al., 2019). In
    terms of vegetation condition, crop yield estimates are fairly mature for some
    crops (e.g., maize, (Kang and Ozdogan, 2019)) and in some areas (e.g., North America
    (Johnson, 2014)), indicating that their yields could be monitored globally with
    Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, and yields of other crops may be possible to monitor
    routinely as well (Ferencz et al., 2004; Gaso et al., 2019). Similarly, the combination
    of Landsat and Sentinel-2 is frequent enough to capture mowing of temperate grasslands
    (Griffiths et al., 2020; Schwieder et al., 2022), thereby extending the mapping
    of grassland cover into grassland use. Using HLS data and a within-season emergence
    algorithm (Gao et al., 2020), crop emergence dates were mapped over the U.S. corn
    belt (Gao et al., 2021), inspiring early-season crop monitoring for a large area.
    For biodiversity, habitat heterogeneity as captured by image texture is an aspirational
    product. Habitat texture captures small-scale variability in reflectance among
    nearby pixels resulting from the heterogeneity in the vegetation (Kayitakire et
    al., 2006; Wood et al., 2012), and high image texture is correlated with high
    species richness (Culbert et al., 2013; Hepinstall and Sader, 1997), and species
    occurrences (Estes et al., 2008; St-Louis et al., 2010). A second aspirational
    product for biodiversity is the set of three winter habitat indices capturing
    spatio-temporal patterns of snow (Gudex-Cross et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2019a).
    The duration of snow cover, and variability of snow cover are both good predictors
    of species richness (Gudex-Cross et al., 2022), and high thermal heterogeneity
    of land surface temperature in winter is a proxy for the availability of thermal
    refugia (Elsen et al., 2020). For the cryosphere, melt ponds on glaciers and sea
    ice are captured by Landsat data (Kingslake et al., 2017) because ponds have low
    NIR and SWIR reflectance. Other aspirational products are snow grain size (Fily
    et al., 1997; Painter et al., 2009), and ice front position for ice sheet outlet
    glaciers (Howat and Eddy, 2011; Moon and Joughin, 2008). Regarding the biology
    and biogeochemical cycles of aquatic ecosystems, aspirational products include
    absorption by colored dissolved organic matter, source and fate of dissolved organic
    matter (Fichot and Benner, 2011), phytoplankton types (Mouw et al., 2017), organic
    and inorganic particle properties (Bukata et al., 1995; Estapa et al., 2012; Woźniak
    et al., 2010), and harmful algal bloom quantifications (i.e., estimating cyanobacterial
    biomass) (Matthews and Odermatt, 2015; Mishra et al., 2013). Furthermore, the
    combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data with other types of satellite data,
    offers exciting opportunities for more aspirational products. The suite of essential
    global Landsat and Sentinel-2 data products systematically generated with production
    QA and validation, combined with the availability of a global ARD, would accelerate
    the development of fusion products. For example, there is potential to gap-fill
    and perhaps improve forest structure retrieval by integration of Landsat and Sentinel-2
    data with lidar (e.g., GEDI, ICESat-2), and radar (e.g., Sentinel-1 and upcoming
    NISAR) data. Ultimately, most of these and other aspirational products could be
    feasible for systematic production in the next decade given further research and
    algorithm refinement. The list of aspirational products is likely to grow as innovation
    and ingenuity devises new applications for Landsat and Sentinel-2 data. 5. Discussion
    The time is right for the production of a suite of essential medium-resolution,
    global, systematic products. With an observation opportunity almost every second
    day, the current constellation of two Landsat and two Sentinel-2 satellites provide
    temporal frequency that is unparalleled and comes close to the daily observations
    that coarse-resolution satellites provide. The high frequency at which medium-resolution
    satellite data are now available offers major opportunities to generate timely
    information for many pressing global problems. There are clear and growing information
    needs related to a range of global change challenges that require a suite of medium-resolution
    products. Currently, these information needs are not met, which is detrimental
    to both, global change science and environmental management, and means that many
    of the potential benefits of the substantial investments into satellite sensors
    and ground segments have not yet been realized. Ultimately, the goal is to provide
    a broad suite of scientifically robust and socially relevant data products that
    are policy informative, not policy prescriptive. The information needs are greatest
    for the relatively short list of essential products (Table 2). These products
    should be the highest priority, and include land cover, land cover change, burned
    area, forest loss, vegetation indices, phenology, dynamic habitat indices, albedo,
    land surface temperature, snow cover, ice extent, surface water extent, and evapotranspiration.
    We recommend that all of these products are produced globally and at least annually,
    and some of them, for example, evapotranspiration, surface water extent, and burned
    area, should be produced at finer temporal resolution. The reason why we deem
    these products as essential is that there is a well-established and high level
    of demand from large and varied user communities. Furthermore, all of these essential
    products pertain to multiple global change challenges including climate change,
    biodiversity conservation, food security, sustainable natural resource management
    and ecosystem services, and natural hazards (Table 1). Furthermore, for the essential
    products, algorithms are mature, lessening technological hurdles towards production.
    In addition, we identified a longer list of desirable products because global
    change has many dimensions (Table 2). Examples of desirable products include leaf
    area index, land surface emissivity, ice sheet velocity, and surface water quality.
    Clearly, the desirable products meet many important information needs, and if
    sufficient resources were available, their production would be highly beneficial.
    However, the desirable projects either have currently a smaller user community
    or their algorithms are not as mature as the essential product algorithms. 5.1.
    Institutional and computational settings for product generation There are different
    institutional approaches via which these products could be generated, and we do
    not advocate for a specific one. Successful models for the generation of terrestrial
    satellite products include partnerships between science agencies and academia
    (e.g., NASA’s MODIS product suite), or by government research agencies (e.g.,
    the NLCD by the USGS) or between public and private entities (e.g., EU’s Copernicus
    Program). Research groups in academia play an important role developing algorithms,
    and demonstrating aspirational products, but such groups often struggle to maintain
    continuous funding to ensure the necessary long-term consistency and production
    of data products. Given that the combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite
    data will result in products with the most desired spatial and categorical features
    for applications of global interest, value could be found in an international
    collaboration to support the generation of these products. CEOS could be one organization
    to foster such a collaboration. Independent of the approach, multi-decadal funding
    is required to maintain product continuity, including support for routine quality
    assessment, periodic validation, and product reprocessing. Products should have
    sufficient algorithm and product documentation, including information on the upstream
    and ancillary data used in the product generation, to allow verification of scientific
    claims and allow others to reproduce the products. Sharing algorithms openly will
    foster the involvement of user communities in the generation and review of the
    products, which in turn will foster wider product use. User communities will embrace
    medium-resolution products more readily if their long-term availability is guaranteed.
    This is likely if products are generated with government agency support, or the
    support from multiple governments in an international collaboration. Indeed, laws
    and policy frameworks increasingly require the use of Earth observation data as
    compliance and performance tools, and once the essential medium-resolution products
    that we propose here become readily available, that trend will further accelerate.
    In this regard, rigorous and independent accuracy assessments of all products
    are also key, because they instill trust in the quality of the products and provide
    numeric estimates of the uncertainty in the products that are necessary to make
    informed decisions. The products should be hosted in long-term guaranteed archives
    and made freely and easily available. Both the Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite
    programs have plans for future launches and a commitment to continue with current
    open data policies. Although commercial satellite constellations do not provide
    a consistent global acquisition strategy and are not openly distributed without
    cost, the ability to request high-resolution acquisitions provides value-added
    information complementing long-term, medium resolution global data that are freely
    and openly distributed. In terms of the computing environment, cloud-computing
    makes the generation and reprocessing of high-level products more feasible. For
    example, the USGS recently used commercial cloud computing to efficiently reprocess
    the Landsat archive and enable direct cloud access of Landsat images including
    global surface reflectance and land surface temperature (Crawford et al., 2023).
    Similarly, Google Earth Engine has enabled a new community to process medium-resolution
    satellite data at continental to global scales. However, cloud computing does
    not change the need for systematic product generation, and we do not advocate
    for an on-demand-processing model. Aside from the computational overhead, systematically
    generated products are needed for governmental reporting needs, and to ensure
    that scientific results are reproducible. Furthermore, there is little research
    so far on how to conduct valid accuracy assessments or quality assessments for
    on-demand-processed products. The aforementioned reporting needs and need for
    reproducible results necessitates a well-designed collection strategy and versioning
    control due to the implications of changes in upstream products on those further
    downstream. 6. Conclusions We developed here a list of products to be derived
    from medium-resolution Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, which include land cover,
    land cover change, burned area, forest loss, vegetation indices, phenology, dynamic
    habitat indices, albedo, land surface temperature, snow cover, ice extent, surface
    water extent, and evapotranspiration. To create the proposed suite of essential
    products is a major undertaking, and requires that major challenges will have
    to be overcome, both in terms of securing long-term funding, creating the appropriate
    institutional and organizational setting, designing robust and efficient algorithms,
    and processing and storing very large volumes of data. However, producing these
    essential products would be a small undertaking in comparison to launching and
    operating the current constellation of medium-resolution satellites, and greatly
    leverage their value for much larger user communities. Serving these user communities,
    in turn, provides the strongest possible justification for future medium-resolution
    satellite missions, and the continuation of the Landsat and Sentinel-2 legacy.
    Two decades since MODIS products became available, and five decades after the
    first Landsat images were recorded, there is now the opportunity to produce freely
    available, standardized, and consistent products based on medium-resolution satellite
    imagery, which would be another major steps towards what inspired and sustained
    the Landsat program throughout its history. Declaration of Competing Interest

    Globally, the water resources have been deteriorated owing to a large number of
    highly persistent organic as well as inorganic contaminants are getting discharged
    continuously and constantly from various industries besides the municipalities
    into water bodies, in the form of dyes, heavy metals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals,
    personal care products, surfactants, etc (Tejada–Tovar et al., 2023). The uncontrolled
    discharge of such pollutants eventually contributes negative impacts on the ecosystems
    (Zulfiqar et al., 2019). To avoid this, there are several technologies conventionally
    have been applied in favour of the removal of wastewater pollutants predominantly
    via adsorption, chemical precipitation, coagulation–flocculation, electro–chemical
    treatment, flotation, ion–exchange, membrane filtration, reverse osmosis and solvent
    extraction for the removal of inorganic pollutants (Guillossou et al., 2020).
    Though, these techniques possess certain disadvantages in the aspect of inefficient
    removal of such pollutants at low concentration level and partial conversion of
    pollutants to biodegradable / low toxic by–products, etc., apart from the consumption
    of high energy as well as chemicals, complexity in operation, high maintenance
    and process costs (Enaime et al., 2020). In this aspect, bio–chars can be considered
    to be cost–effective / eco–friendly bio–materials that commonly procured by means
    of the agricultural–, forestry– and municipal–organic wastes and it has been attracted
    an increasing attention by its various environmental utilizations (Dai et al.,
    2019). Pyrolysis based solid bio–char can be obtained by high temperature biomass
    thermochemical degradation (mostly 600 °C) with the presence of little air / absence
    of oxygen. It is a form of semi–combustible charcoal, further its physical as
    well as chemical and structural characteristics like stability, ash fractions,
    cationic exchange capacity, dispersion, mineral contents, pore size, specific
    surface area (SSA), etc., principally depend on the feedstock type and mode of
    productivity like rate of heating, conditions of oxidation process, temperature,
    etc., and fulfil the necessities by activated carbons. Moreover, effective and
    economically feasible treatment methods should be required for both green environment
    and larger scale conversion of pollutants to biodegradable by–products. Further,
    the incorporation of cost–effective materials in various treatment techniques
    for the conversion of organic wastes into bio–char could obviously decrease the
    cost and improve the efficiency of the processes involved mainly viz HTC (hydrothermal
    carbonization), gasification, pyrolysis, as well as torrefaction (Enaime et al.,
    2020). The conventional carbonization is the pyrolysis, utilized frequently to
    produce the bio–char, although the bio–chars from gasification, HTC and torrefaction,
    mostly violate the specified bio–char guidelines by the EBC (European Bio–char
    Certificate) regardless of its superior characteristics like rich content of carbon,
    improved surface area, high exchanging capability for cations / anions, structural
    stability, etc (Enaime et al., 2020). Its application has been increasing as the
    availability of its raw materials (feedstock), ease of production, and their characteristics.
    The bio–char with its activated derivatives has been reported as exactly efficient
    materials for removal of numerous highly persistent organic as well as inorganic
    contaminants like dyes (Park et al., 2019) as well as heavy metals etc (Enaime
    et al., 2020). together with some pathogens (Kaetzl et al., 2020), from wastewater
    is linked straight to bio–char adsorption capability. This capability depends
    on the significant bio–char physico–chemical characteristics viz composition of
    elements, area of surface, pore size distribution, functional groups surface and
    exchanging capability for cations / anions. Such properties predominantly based
    on the feedstock nature and the methods of preparation and conditions (Clemente
    et al., 2017). Further, the characteristics of bio–char should be modified for
    a better efficient removal of the recalcitrant molecules that are present at low
    concentrations. Some common techniques utilized to bio–char modification could
    be regrouping into two types viz chemical and physical modifications, the first
    one mostly include modifications by means of acid, alkaline and oxidizing agents
    via gas purging performance. Even though bio–char has shown extensive applications
    in the remediation of wastewater, the negative impact in bio–char utilization
    should be also examined because type of the feed–stocks and the adopted techniques
    for conversion make the bio–char to comprise of several heavy metals along with
    some other contaminants, which all could be liberated in the course of its utilization
    for treating the aqueous solutions (Enaime et al., 2020). Consequently, further
    investigation is desirable to examine the stability of biochar and its relationship
    to the experimental conditions for the duration of producing the biochar. In this
    view, this article contains modern approaches in the biochar production, surface
    modification, and applications (Kurniawan et al., 2023). This review highlights
    on various feedstock materials for bio–char, methods of its production via traditional
    and modern techniques. The biochar characteristics and its modification through
    steam, gas purging, acidic, basic / alkaline, organo–solvent, electro– and magnetically
    modified techniques have been discussed. Further, biochar applications for water
    and industrial as well as wastewater treatment for adsorption of dyes, heavy metals,
    machine learning via image recognition, speech recognition, google maps, product
    suggestions by dissimilar entertainment and e–commerce organisations, self–driving
    automobiles, medical diagnosis, automatic language translation, microbial sensors,
    analyses on commercial and environmental profit and environmental concern with
    future directions have been reviewed. 2. Various feedstock materials for bio–char
    production and pretreatment techniques The effectiveness of biochar for removal
    of both inorganic as well as organic activates mostly depend on its area of surface,
    porosity, active (oxygen–containing functional) groups, and size of the sorbed
    moieties, though the biochar surface characteristics predominantly is determined
    by (i) kind of the raw materials used, (ii) their processing and (iii) the production
    conditions. The biochar can have broad applications towards the field of real
    water / industrial wastewater treatment. It has extensively been used as a preservative
    / catalytic support in AD (anaerobic digestion) process and as a biofilter towards
    abstraction of heavy metals, deprivation of dye stuffs, pathogens and suspended
    matters, which are recalcitrant. The availability of different feedstocks and
    their compositions are the primary factors in favour of proficient and commercial
    production of bio–char. Nevertheless, a huge availability of feed–stock materials,
    their appropriate classes and characterizations are indispensable for their proper
    applications. Thus, the section highlights some of the resourceful feed–stock
    materials with their compositions and availability. A variety of feedstock materials,
    which are being utilized in favour of bio–char production predominantly comprise
    of agricultural biomasses, animal and human excreta, aquatic biomasses, dairy
    and paper mill wastes, food and kitchen wastes, industrial wastes, paper wastes,
    poultry wastes, urban wastes, woody biomass, etc. Herein, a few of principal biomass
    sources viz agro–wastes, urban based wastes, paper wastes and aquatic based biomass
    materials for the production of bio–char have been discussed. All over the world,
    especially in developing countries a huge quantity of agricultural residues has
    been generated by agricultural operations. Across the world, the total land area
    is nearly about 13 Gha, in which 1.5 Gha could frequently be used for agricultural
    activities according to the report of the ICCEPT (J. Gabhane et al., 2020; J.
    W. Gabhane et al., 2020). The agro–based waste materials are principally comprised
    of celluloses, hemicelluloses and lignins (J. Gabhane et al., 2020). Amongst,
    the celluloses are the utmost plentiful organic materials on the earth as approximately
    4 × 1010 t of celluloses could annually be produced from the plants. The celluloses
    are mostly water insoluble and possess high flexural strength, tolerance towards
    microbial and chemical degradation as compared to both the glucose and starch.
    Naturally, celluloses are the linear polymers and comprising of thousands of (β–1,4)
    glycosidic linkages which connect the glucose units together. The cellulose is
    binding to hemicelluloses and lignins by means of H– (hydrogen) and –O– (ether)
    bondings, respectively (Patil and Yadav, 2019). The hemicelluloses are heterogeneous
    polymeric network of some pentoses (arabinose, mannose, galactose, etc., apart
    from xyloses) and structurally analogous to celluloses. Here, the pyrosyl units
    are connected by means of (β–1,4) glycosidic linkages. Further, the composition
    of softwood based (like grasses, coniferous tree, etc) and hardwood based (like
    forest wastes, woody biomass, etc) hemicelluloses are different. The softwood
    based hemicelluloses mainly comprise of arabino–galactans as well as xylo–glucans.
    Their main portion is comprised of gluco–mannans, a primary form of hemicelluloses,
    apart from arabino–glucuronoxylans, and galacto–glucomannans (J. W. Gabhane et
    al., 2020). Profoundly, the hemicelluloses assist the hydrolysis at low temperature
    that permits it to soluble in water with the presence of acids at high temperatures.
    Characteristically, the lignin polymers integrate aromatic alcohols (like coniferyl,
    p–coumaryl, sinnapyl, etc) in their structure and the lignins can definitely play
    a pivotal role in a number of ecological as well as biological functions. The
    hydrophobic lignins could fill the cell wall spaces among the celluloses, hemicelluloses
    and pectins, particularly for tracheid, sclereid, and xylem whereas play a vital
    role in conducting water through the stems of plants (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020).
    It was found that the composition of agro–wastes mainly involves 35–50,15–40 and
    15–25 % of celluloses, hemicelluloses and lignins, respectively (J. W. Gabhane
    et al., 2020; Patil and Yadav, 2019). The most frequently consumed agro–wastes,
    which are rich in celluloses for the production of bio–char are the biomasses
    of below–ground peanuts and switch–grass and some other biomass materials (J.
    W. Gabhane et al., 2020; Patil and Yadav, 2019, Wan et al., 2020). Beyond that,
    the shells of chestnut, coconut, hazelnut, palmyra nuts and grape seeds are normally
    utilized for the production bio–char via anaerobic burning at 400 °C (J. Gabhane
    et al., 2020). Furthermore, the agro–wastes based bio–char displays a noteworthy
    impact on uptake of nitrogen and some other nutrients from the soil biota, thereby
    increases the fertility of soil (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). Various feed–stocks
    used in biochar production for different experimental conditions are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Feed-stocks used in biochar production, employing varying experimental

    307–517 30–40 The urban wastes are the most effective feed–stocks for the production
    biochar and they are categorized as industrial wastewater, livestock, municipal
    solid wastes (MSWs), poultry wastes and sewage sludge. The MSWs have been becoming
    a big challenge for most of the developed and developing countries, owing to prompt
    urbanization and frantic population growth. The characteristics of biochar and
    its specific applications are represented in (Fig. 1). The biodegradable fractions
    of organic compounds are composed of leftover food, fruits, kitchen wastes, etc
    (Bhange et al., 2015). The non–biodegradable fractions of organic compounds contain
    bottles, electronic and plastic bag wastes, whereas the fractions of inorganic
    compounds contain electric, glassware, metals, sandstone wastes, etc., both the
    fractions are recyclable (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). In general, the MSWs have
    been utilized for the production of biochar, besides as an adsorbent to remove
    the dyes, minerals, impurities, toxicants, etc. The researchers have been utilized
    MSWs to prepare the biochar and a group of them (Agarwal et al., 2015, Ateş et
    al., 2013) prepared MSWs based biochar using pyrolysis at 400–800 °C by means
    of a custom–designed packed bed reactor, and can additionally be employed for
    the removal of azo dye. Some researchers (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020; Jayawardhana
    et al., 2016), utilized MSWs based biochar to prevent the pollution from landfill
    leachates. Correspondingly, the effect of MSWs based biochar was studied for the
    removal of As5+ ions in aqueous state from the wastewater (Agarwal et al., 2015).
    Further, the urban population increases urban waste generation by means of prompt
    industrial growth and accumulation of such wastes are burden of the municipalities
    to their appropriate management. The organic fractions of urban wastes are comprised
    of 30–45 % potentiality to yield predominantly the biochar, compost / manure,
    energy and nutrient–rich soil conditioner. In addition, the isolated organic fractions
    are utilized for the generation of biogas in many dumpsites; consequently the
    municipal corporations have immediately started the composting of organic wastes.

    Fig. 1. Characteristics of biochar and its specifc applications. The paper wastes
    considerably occupy both municipal and industrial wastes, even if the efforts
    on recycling processes have been supported strongly, these days. In a study, the
    MSWs constitute 7.0–12 % of paper wastes (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). As per
    the Agricultural Organization report (Mette Løyche Wilkie, 2010), about 1.9 ×
    109 kg paper wastes have obviously been reutilized repeatedly per year, though
    the left–overs are (nearly 4.8 × 109 kg) often dumped into landfills. The lignocellulosic
    biomass of the paper wastes are the exceptional sources of bio–ethanol as they
    contain significant underutilized celluloses. Further, Australia, Brazil, Canada,
    China, India, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Russian Federation,
    the United States of America and Sudan are mostly belonging to the forest regions
    with mega–biodiversity that eventually constitute about > 67 % of the total forest
    (Mette Løyche Wilkie, 2010). The FAO reports (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020), approximately
    3000–3500 MCT woody biomass are utilized towards craft and furniture industries
    as raw materials, besides the utilization as fodder, fuelwood, and valuable products.
    Further, the wood is a significant feedstock for the production of biochar of
    high quality as it possesses more calorific value because the existence of lignins,
    pectins, resins and some volatile materials (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). Nevertheless,
    the woody materials are worthy feed–stocks for the production of biochar, it ought
    to be handled with care since it can incite the deforestation. The aquatic biomass
    materials and the dry floors of water resources possess a source of such aquatic
    wastes. Among them, the algae prominently constitute such a source and are belonging
    to different groups of unicellular / microscopic / multicellular / macroscopic
    fast growing aquatic organisms, which are capable to grow in freshwater, seawater
    / damped oils. Likewise, a noteworthy quantity of wastes can be generated by fishing
    and other activities. Bird et al., (Bird et al., 2011) derived algal based biochar
    and found that it is nutrient rich [macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorous
    (P), potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), etc., and micronutrients: boron
    (B), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), selenium
    (Se), vanadium (V), zinc (Zn), etc., as compared to the lignocellulose based biochar.
    Though, the utilization of algae based biochar is limited (restricted) because
    of their cultivation and collection cost. The studies on the pretreatments of
    feed–stocks to biochar production are possibly still improving. Mostly, the pretreatments
    are depending on certain technologies feasibly viz (i) slow pyrolysis: it necessitates
    drying process, (ii) gasification by means of producing power: it needs drying
    and chipping coarsely, and (iii) fast pyrolysis through production of liquid fuels:
    it requires drying, coarse–chipping and grinding finely, further to maximize the
    yield of bio–oil, pacification process is applied (the addition of acids towards
    the neutralization of the catalytic effects of alkali metals) (Aguirre et al.,
    2023). For pacification, sometimes H3PO4 (phosphoric acid) has been utilized,
    the price of this acid could obviously be compensated by the biochar yield, and
    it has been used as a phosphorous fertilizer. In most cases, the pretreatment
    steps mainly involve drying and chipping processes (Zilberman et al., 2023). Anderson
    et al., (Nathaniel M. Anderson et al., 2017) shows a sort of feedstock prices,
    in which the low cost option ($0) might be a waste stream and it has yet to be
    chipped. While a high cost option ($80) signifies a dried and pre–chipped feedstock.
    Kung et al., (Kung et al., 2013) established the pretreatments by means of about
    6 % of total costs of production for both slow as well as fast pyrolysis processes.
    Shackley et al., (Shackley et al., 2015) revealed the biochar sensitivity analyses
    that shows woody materials are not essentially dried much, whereas need a lot
    of mechanical energy for the chipping process. Contrariwise, both the yard and
    sludge wastes necessitate a huge input of energy for drying process, but a little
    / no input for chipping. 3. Methods of bio–char production The production of bio–char
    ensues mostly the anaerobic conditions. Still, many production methods for the
    bio–char exist in the literature (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020), the appropriate
    grouping is not obtainable. Consequently, this section implies diverse approaches
    for the production of biochar. The production of biochar techniques are mostly
    classified into traditional and modern methodologies, based on their developments
    and renovation (Table 2). The determinations on bio–char standardization and quality
    assurance have eminently been supported out by voluntary biochar product standards,
    provided probably by the biochar standards namely IBI–BS (International Biochar
    Initiative–Biochar Standard) as well as EBC (European Biochar Certificate) which
    apply eventually towards the production and utilization of bio–char (Meyer et
    al., 2017).. The HTC process is the most prominent technique for the production
    of biochar, when compared to both torrefaction and gasification processes at a
    temperature range in between 220 and 240 °C, under high pressure of about 02–10
    MPa. The biochar modification, using base / alkaline obviously can improve the
    its surface area and thereby it possesses about 88–98 %, 106.2 m2 /g and 148.1
    mg/g removal efficiency for the heavy metals, toxic phenols and 2,4–dinitrophenols
    from the industrial aqueous solutions. Table 2. Biochar production, using different

    et al., 2020)]. Biochar production techniques Biochar production conditions Applications

    Over 2500 years ago, the utilization of biochar by humans was started and the
    Amazon Basin of South America (Glaser, 2007) first found it with three times high
    soil organic and nutrient contents that was referred as Terra Preta (J. W. Gabhane
    et al., 2020). In ancient times, the soil pits were covered by wood stacking for
    slow burn with limited / absence of air (Thines et al., 2017). Further, open space
    burning of the biomass was carried out along with the soil (J. W. Gabhane et al.,
    2020). Beyond the modification of soil, a liquid could also be produced by means
    of the woody biomass burning that is applicable to dead bodies / meat preservation,
    painting, waterproof sealing for wooden barrels, ship–building, attachment of
    arrowheads to spear shaft, etc (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020; Reilly, 1925). By
    the non–stop growth and innovation of technologies, some of the traditional approaches
    for the production of biochar could frequently be replaced by means of modern
    techniques (Table 2). The handmade–reactors like brick kilns, clay burners, firebrick
    pits, iron retorts were obviously utilized for the biochar production and the
    pits are enclosed by bricks (fire–brick pits and brick–kilns), clay, and metal
    burners (Iron–retorts). This kind of adapted technique for biochar preparation
    is convenient for the recovery as well as utilization of the so produced volatile
    compounds (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020; Reilly, 1925). The implementation of oven,
    made by steel for the production of biochar increases obviously the production
    rate, whereas the biochar refining takes place at standard quality level. While
    the pyrolysis, an anaerobic thermal degradation technique via hot–gases, –solids,
    –liquid, oxidation (Li et al., 2016) have been evolved for decades to produce
    several gaseous and aqueous products along with biochar at 300–700 °C (J. W. Gabhane
    et al., 2020; Suárez–Abelenda et al., 2017). It is divided further into slow and
    fast pyrolysis techniques besides, it depends upon certain reaction parameters
    viz. rate of heating, residential time and temperature. These days, modern approaches
    on pyrolysis via flash–, vacuum– and microwave– pyrolysis, gasification, HTC (hydrothermal
    carbonization), torrefaction have been employed for effective biochar production
    (Table 2). 3.2. Modern techniques for biochar production 3.2.1. Modified pyrolysis
    The modern pyrolysis has predominantly been carried out via flash, vacuum and
    microwave pyrolytic processes. Among them, the flash pyrolysis is a modified and
    improved form of fast pyrolysis. Here, the degradation of biomass occurs in a
    short period of time, generally is < a minute at high temperatures (>1000 °C)
    while, the rate of heating occasionally is about > 1000 °C / sec (J. W. Gabhane
    et al., 2020). Such technique is carried out industrially, using a fluidized–
    bed reactor with a twin–screw mixing reactor and its utilization is limited owing
    to the reactor assembly and operation at high temperatures by tremendously high
    rate of heating. Thus, the heating rate and vapour residence time (low) results
    in a good bio–oil yield, thereby a minimized yield of biochar is observed in this
    process (J. Gabhane et al., 2020). Further, the thermal degradative vacuum biomass
    pyrolysis in low pressure / vacuum has frequently been employed for the production
    of biochar. Also, the range of temperature and pressure throughout the vacuum
    pyrolysis can generally be controlled in between 450 and 600 °C and 0.05 to 0.20
    MPa, respectively (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020), it is similar to the traditional
    pyrolysis. Nevertheless, the condition as well as rate of heating are comparable
    to the slow pyrolysis and the final products are considerably unalike from each
    other. It is because of the actual abstraction of vapours for the duration of
    vacuum technique. In this pyrolytic process, only low pressure / vacuum usually
    is applicable for the elimination of the produced vapours, which obviously implies
    a signifcant influence on both the quality and yield of the product owing to the
    stoppage of devolatilized inorganic components (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020; Uras–Postma
    et al., 2014) One group of researchers (Uras–Postma et al., 2014) established
    that the dissimilar reactions during vacuum pyrolysis viz cracking and the interactions
    between volatile components and char are obvious for the bio–oil yield with moisture
    (high) along with biochar. Such a pyrolysis is most commonly employed to generate
    high–quality biochar that possesses a high porosity, thereby extremely valuable
    in the adsorption of minerals and N2 whereas, applicable to soil amendment practices
    (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). The microwave pyrolysis based biochar have been
    obviously produced via more rapid and material–selective microwave heating and
    is a promising advanced technique. This method has its own advantages over conventional
    heating since the microwaves can generate thermal energy by dielectric heating.
    The so produced energy has eventually been presented into the reactor at all deprived
    of any contact between the sources of energy and the reaction mixture (J. W. Gabhane
    et al., 2020; Patil and Yadav, 2019). This technology is attractive diligently
    for its thermal properties in favour of quick, specifically selective and constant
    heating whereas it presents a reduced sintering temperature to improve the process
    of steam gasification. The so produced biochar possesses more benefits, when compared
    to the conventional pyrolytic techniques, since it reduces the requirement of
    temperature through 200 °C (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). A group of researchers
    (Arafat Hossain et al., 2017) examined the process conditions towards a maximum
    production of both biochar and bio–H2 and they revealed that the best process
    conditions are temperature, microwave power and resident time are 450 °C, 400
    W and 4–6 min, respectively for the production of biochar. Though at 700 °C temperature,
    a maximum production of bio–H2 was obtained within a retention time of 4–6 min
    by usage of microwave power, about 400 W. They further studied the biochar quality,
    thereby revealed its high calorific value as compared to the conventional biochar.
    Similarly, Menedez et al., (2004) produced the biochar using four different wet
    sewages from unlike plants of wastewater treatment. They carried out the pyrolysis
    at about 800 °C, using a frequency of about 2450 MHz microwave for 4 min as the
    residence time. Further, Huang et al., (Huang et al., 2019) prepared rice straw
    based biochar within a frequency of about 2450 MHz with a device of single mode
    microwave frequency. Furthermore, the microwave pyrolysis based biochar could
    possibly be utilized for the adsorption of CO2. 3.2.2. Gasification approach The
    thermochemical gasification technique can provide larger volume of syn–gas and
    lower emissions from different resources of solid fuels, further bio–H2 is its
    main product apart from a considerable amount of biochar, when compared to other
    conventional processes, i.e., combustion, fermentation and pyrolysis (Guan et
    al., 2016). Additionally, the generated biochar possesses some significant applications
    like adsorption of chemicals, carbon sequestration, removal of dyes from wastewater
    and as an agent for soil amendment (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). Characteristically,
    the fossil based carbonaceous compounds can be effectively converted into bio–H2,
    CO and CO2 by means of gasification. Here, the reaction is carried out at high
    temperatures (>700 °C) under a controlled manner with a supply of steam as well
    as oxygen (Danesh et al., 2023) in the presence of a suitable gasifying agent
    (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020) to raise the heating value of syn–gas (Shen et al.,
    2015). In this gasification, transfer of heat increases the confined biomass temperature
    for the abstraction of water molecules, consequently followed through the successive
    discharge of volatile products. However, the biomass components (celluloses, hemicelluloses
    and lignins) with the extractives degraded at dissimilar temperatures, thereby
    the whole decomposition processes end–up nearly at the temperature range of about
    400–500 °C, here biochar is the major product. The produced biochar at a higher
    temperature can further be converted into fuels via some secondary decomposition
    processes to yield syn–gas, composed of both H2 and CH4 (J. W. Gabhane et al.,
    2020). A group of researchers (Sattar et al., 2014) generated both the bio–H2
    and biochar using sewage sludge though steam gasification at 800 °C and procured
    35–45 vol% H2 along with a noteworthy amount of biochar. Globally, the gasification
    plants have been utilized coal and petroleum coke as the key feedstocks for biochar
    production, besides the agricultural, industrial, municipal and sewage sludge
    solid wastes. They predominantly utilized miscanthus, rapeseed, sewage sludge,
    and wood pellets for the production of biochar via gasification by passage of
    steam within a tubular reactor, made of quartz. Correspondingly, other researchers
    (Yan et al., 2010) utilized pine sawdust via steam gasification and observed a
    rise in the volume of H2 and temperature on account of some additional cracking
    process at 850 °C temperature. 3.2.3. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) The feedstocks
    with high moisture like such sewage animal wastes, composts, sludge, etc., have
    eventually been converted into biochar by means of HTC technique (J. W. Gabhane
    et al., 2020; Titirici et al., 2007). The drying of biomass is not essential before
    processing in this method, here the mixture of wet biomass could be heated up
    to a temperature in between 220 and 240 °C, under high pressure of about 2–10
    MPa in the reactor for more than a few hours. This is functioned within rotary
    kilns / drum as well as stove. Mostly, the organic fractions of this process are
    in dissolved form, and converted into brownish–coal. This method is beneficial
    for the production of several materials of carbon with unalike size, shape, surface,
    and functional group, though mostly the initial carbon remnants are in their soluble
    forms (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). The significant HTC characteristics is that
    the produced biochar possesses some essential nutrients like N and P and are predominantly
    useful in soil fertility. The HTC process has the advantage of a noteworthy decrease
    in the ratio of O / C, upturn in calorific value, better grinding capability with
    enhanced hydrophobicity as compared to torrefaction / pyrolysis process for the
    production of biochar (Gao et al., 2013). The studies on HTC method for the production
    of biochar show their application in soil amendment (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020;
    Lynam et al., 2011). A group of researchers (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020; Lynam
    et al., 2011) generated the hydrochar, using loblolly pine at 200–260 °C temperature
    and reported that an increase (about 30 %) in calorific value. Similarly, Yang
    et al., (Yang et al., 2015) prepared nut husk–based biochar. Reza et al., (Reza
    et al., 2012) produced loblolly pine char pellets via HTC and this study shows
    the impacts of this process on biochar towards the abrasion resistance, density,
    and hydrophobicity, further they noted a substantial enhancement in biochar characteristics.
    Another researcher group (Kambo and Dutta, 2015) produced carbonized pellets with
    significantly superior physico–chemical characteristics on comparison to both
    the raw as well as torrefied pellet forms. Ercan et al., (Ercan et al., 2023)
    produced hornbeam wood chips–derived hydrochars at varying temperatures, ranging
    from 225 to 575 °C HTC process with a highest heating value of about 32.51 MJ
    kg−1, from the pyrolytic run at 575 °C. Kwapinska et al., (Kwapinska et al., 2023)
    produced biochar from the dairy processing sludge (DPS) at 160, 180, 200 and 220
    °C with a residence time of 1 h and observed that the biochars are similar to
    nitrogen and phosphorus organo–mineral fertilizers as the found nutrients are
    ranging from 13.90 to 26.70 % carried out HTC of Ricinus communis (RC) seeds as
    well as husks using acetone, at a temperature of about 120–250 °C, 1 h residence
    time with 2.0–40 bar autogenous water pressure. The observed yield is in between
    78 and 63 % at 120 and 250 °C, respectively, and the biochars showed HHVs of about
    19.47 and 23.72 MJ/kg. Chen et al., (Chen et al., 2023) produced biochar from
    the cabbage wastes and typical wet waste biomass under 190 °C and 260 °C, respectively.
    So produced biochar at 190 °C can improve the plant nutrition within a short period,
    whereas the biochar that produced at 260 °C could benefit towards the sequestration
    of carbon. Furthermore, it was observed that the biochar with > 90 % of meso /
    macropores could be conducive towards the storage of available plant–water. Youn
    et al., (Youn et al., 2023) produced the biochar using kenaf plant and observed
    an increase in carbon composition up to 65.19 %, whereas the ash composition was
    decreased to about 0.05 %. Furthermore, the heating value of biochar is found
    to be higher and increased up to 26.77 kJ g−1, results with an increase in a densification
    of energy to about 1.61. Consequently, there revealed that HTC process is the
    most prominent technique for the production of biochar when compared to both torrefaction
    and gasification processes. 3.2.4. Torrefaction The torrefaction is a process
    of low temperature burning (230 and 300 °C) of biomass under atmospheric pressure
    with no air for enhancement of the biomass characteristics, using fixed bed reactors
    besides, a thermochemical pretreatment process for improving their physical, chemical
    and biochemical properties (Tumuluru et al., 2011). Here, the formed torrefied
    wood–pellets of superior quality and more stable carbon–rich volatiles are taken
    place by means of degradation of the hemicelluloses of the agricultural and forest
    residues (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020), mainly like coffee residues, rice husk
    and sawdust whereas, all the biomass materials converted to more hygroscopic as
    compared to the raw biomasses. It was observed that the decomposition of hemicelluloses
    was more in the residues of coffee, and was confirmed via elemental, proximate,
    calorific, fibre, thermos–gravimetric, SEM and FT–IR analytical techniques (Chen
    and Kuo, 2010). One group of researchers (Chen and Kuo, 2010) torrefied four unlike
    biomass materials such as bamboo, coconut shell, willow and wood to observe the
    variation in their composition along with the impact of temperature. They have
    concluded that the decomposition of hemicelluloses was prominently taken place
    at a temperature of about 240 °C though, the decomposition of celluloses was observed
    at severe torrefaction temperature (>280 °C). 4. Biochar characteristics and its
    modification The physical characteristics of biochar certainly like density and
    size of the particles, porosity, surface area, etc., impact its environmental
    interactions (Brewer et al., 2014). The biochar of high porous and low dense particles
    might hold more water, conversely it can easily be removed by both wind and water.
    Further, biochar quality is mostly influenced by rate of heating, nature of the
    process and type of biomass (Al‐Wabel et al., 2018). The particle density of grass
    and wood based biochar are found to be in between 0.25 and 0.3 g/cm3 and s 0.47–0.6
    g/cm3, respectively (Adekiya et al., 2020; Francis Monnie, 2016) and the latter
    one possesses low bulk densities, medium to high surface area as well as porosity.
    The biochar of low bulk density can diligently be utilized for the remediation
    of wall gardens as well as compacted soils. The pore size can have categorized
    as macro–, meso– and micro–pores and it strongly effects on the interactions of
    biochar with the surroundings (Francis Monnie, 2016, Yang et al., 2021). Most
    woody biochar has low bulk densities, medium–to–high surface area and porosity.
    At low temperatures, the biochar become high hydrophobic and prolonged pyrolysis
    can reduce it, in turn diminishes the mixing capability of the biochar with soil.
    Moreover, its low HGI (hardgrove grindability index) value designates that the
    materials are harder to grind (Singh et al., 2023) and the HGI of 80–120 can definitely
    be achieved for wood–based biochar of 20 % of volatile contents, is generally
    succeeded at around 600 °C temperatures. The biochar structure is mostly composed
    by carbon ring structures with nitrogen and oxygen hetero atoms, predominantly,
    further, the ring sizes can eventually be determined by the processing temperature
    while the production of biochar. Its water soluble and mineralisable nature can
    definitely nourish the microbes and can enrich the soil nutrients. The bioavailability
    of the PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are in acceptable limits, it is
    found that a the most common (90 %) PAH is naphthalene (Singh et al., 2023). Small
    quantities of phenols, butenolide, fatty acids and PAH in biochar can boost the
    plant growth, else the high quantities bring hormesis. The adsorption capability
    of biochar is beneficial to take away the nutrients as well as pollutants from
    air soil and water some. The biochar treatment could be done by the way as it
    adsorbs a specific group of compounds and it effortlessly could remove some unwanted
    components from the environment. Such a modification of biochar characteristics
    (modified biochar) can be carried out by some chemical treatments, via steam,
    gas purging, acidic, basic, organo–solvent, electro– and magneto techniques, herein
    have been briefly discussed. 4.1. Steam and gas purging In the physical technique,
    the extensively used oxidizing agent for the modification of biochar characteristics
    is the water steam. Herein, the reactions by means of steam activation are presented
    below Eqs. (1), (2) (Liu et al., 2015). (1) (2) The process selectively can remove
    the most active carbons in the form of volatile materials from the original biochar
    structure, thereby can generate surface area as well as porosity as the temperature
    increases (Enaime et al., 2020). Certain parameters viz. flow rate of steam, properties
    of the precursor with its composition influence strongly the activation of steam,
    but still there is a lack of information about the mechanisms (Liu et al., 2015).
    Related to it, gas purging can also be applicable to structural modification of
    the biochar for increasing its surface area, consequently enhancing its adsorption
    capability. This process involves a feedstock pyrolysis as I step, monitored continuously
    and constantly by a purging II step by means of CO2 / NH3 gas. Such a modification
    by CO2 can obviously stimulate the biochar microporous structure, while –N hetero
    group can frequently be introduced on the biochar by NH3 modification (Enaime
    et al., 2020). Zhang et al., (Zhang et al., 2014) reported the cotton–stalk derived
    biochar modification by both CO2 and NH3 gaseous mixtures and observed that it
    is more efficient for increasing the surface area than the single modification
    either by CO2 or ammonia gas, separately. 4.2. Acidic, basic / alkaline and organo–solvent
    modification For the period of chemical activation, the biochar is impregnated
    with certain reagents mainly like acids (mostly HCl, HNO3, H2SO4, and H3PO4),
    bases / alkaline (KOH, NaOH, and K2CO3), oxidants (H2O2 and KMnO4), etc. The acidic
    modification introduces the biochar surface with new acidic groups on it. Peng
    et al., (Peng et al., 2016) modified the reed–based biochar using 1 M HCl and
    observed more sorption sites with hydrophobic nature for the pentachlorophenol.
    Further, they found the consumption of 1 M HCl obviously increases the biochar
    surface area from 58.8–88.4 m2 /g. However, a mixture of 30 % H2SO4 and C2H2O4
    (oxalic acid) brings a noteworthy distribution of pores in the biochar surface
    from 2.30–571 m2 /g. Mahmoud et al., (Mahmoud et al., 2012) modified kenaf fiber
    derived biochar by means of HCl and observed that an increase in surface area
    of about 289.5–346.6 m2 /g. The modification, using base / alkaline obviously
    can improve the biochar surface area and the key reaction involves the introduction
    of large number of O– containing functional groups (hetero– and active– functional
    groups) on the biochar surface eventually lead to (a) increase in the surface
    area and porous nature; (b) enhancement in the surface characteristics; (c) embedment
    of other materials into the biochar matrices. The solid olive wastes and olive
    mill wastewater mixture were utilized by Enaime et al., (Enaime et al., 2017)
    for the preparation of activated biochar by means of KOH (activating agent). It
    showed a micro–pore volume (0.52 cm3 /g), high surface area (1375 m2 /g) and high
    adsorption capability towards a dye namely, indigo carmine (599 mg/g). Jing et
    al., (Jing et al., 2014) used KOH to modify the municipal solid wastes based biochar
    and observed an improvement with the surface area from about 14.4–49.1 m2/g as
    well as introduction of –O hetero groups on the surface of biochar that results
    in an enhanced removal efficiency towards the As(V) ions. In contrast, Shen and
    Zhang (Shen and Zhang, 2019) reported that a shrinkage in the surface area from
    about 4.4–0.69 m2 /g, using KOH to modify the wheat–straw–derived hydrochar. Similar
    to KOH, the modification by NaOH for coconut shell based biochar considerably
    increases its surface up to 2885 m2 /g, and it is higher than the modification
    by KOH (1940 m2 /g) (Enaime et al., 2017). Iriarte et al., (Iriarte–Velasco et
    al., 2014) studied the impact on the properties of pork bone–derived biochar by
    acid and basic modification using certain agents like HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, NaOH,
    and K2CO3. They revealed that H2SO4 treatment produced high microporous biochar,
    similarly the treatment of both NaOH and K2CO3 increase the micro– as well as
    meso–pores in the structure of biochar, whereas the H3PO4 is exceptionally destructive
    towards the biochar porous structure. Further, the modification using some oxidizing
    agents like H2O2, KMnO4, etc., was also studied to upturn the introduction of
    –O hetero active groups in the biochar structure. Xue et al., (Xue et al., 2012)
    hydrothermally treated the peanut hull with H2O2 and produced hydrochar with –O
    hetero groups on the surfaces, even though there is no further enrichment, it
    was also reported by Tan et al., (Tan et al., 2017). But, the KMnO4 modification
    on hickory wood based biochar enhances the surface area from 101–205 m2 /g and
    then further enhances its adsorption capability towards the heavy metal ions like
    Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, etc (Wang et al., 2015). Jing et al., (Jing et al., 2014) studied
    the modification of biochar by organic solvents using the municipal solid wastes
    in methanol and found the esterification of the –C = O groups within the biochar
    structure. It results in a noteworthy enhancement for the capability in sorption
    towards tetracycline but still, practically the applications of organo–solvents
    can somewhat be limited by means of its high cost and its volatile characteristics.
    4.3. Electro– And magnetically modified biochar Electro–chemical treatment (electro–modification),
    a modern, simple and time saving approach includes the biochar mixing for 2–12
    h with impregnation of the metals mainly viz. Fe, Mg / Al by means of electric
    current, which might alter the existing functional groups on the pores surface
    to eventually improve specific adsorption of biochar (Wan et al., 2020). In this
    electro–chemical technique, certain strong oxidants like HOCl (hypochlorous acid)
    / OCl– (hypochlorite ions), Al+3 ions can be formed using the electrodes of aluminium
    within the range of acidic pH (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). Jung et al., (Jung
    et al., 2015) modified the biochar electro–chemically using the electrode, made
    by aluminum, here Laminaria japonica, a dried brown marine macroalga in 200 mL
    of deionized distilled water was the feedstock. This mixture was stirred for 5
    min at 150 rpm with a current density of about 0–100 V and about 0–12 A, consequently
    followed by filtration and 450 °C pyrolysis (5 °C min−1 rate) with an inert atmosphere.
    Subsequently, so prepared biochar shows enhanced surface with nano crystalline
    beohemite to improve the adsorption capacity for PO43– (phosphate) ions from the
    aqueous solution. Similar way, Jung et al., (Jung et al., 2015) utilized MgCl2
    to increase the textural properties of the biochar. Here, the nano–composites
    Mg–Al using Al(OH)3, and Al2O3 MgO, spinel MgAl2O4, assembling was effectively
    dispersed on the surface of biochar that results in a highly crystalline structure
    to improve the adsorption capacity of PO43– ions. Furthermore, the magnetically
    improved biochar illustrates incredible adsorption capacity to remove the pollutants
    completely from water. Magnetic biochar, from a number of biomass materials shows
    high surface area with good magnetic property and substantial morphology over
    different preparation techniques. Magnetically modified biochar can be prepared
    by Fe+3 ions addition on the biochar surface with a binding agent, and is obtained
    from microwave heating (450 °C) of the chestnut shell. A research group (Zhou
    et al., 2017) produced magnetic biochar by a mixture of Fe+3 ions as well as gelatine
    addition. Similarly, another research group (Thines et al., 2017) processed the
    biomass at 1000 °C in a programmable muffle furnace (Wise Therm model) under vacuum
    with the presence of certain iron compounds viz FeIII2O3, FeIISO4·7H2O and FeIIICl3·6H2O
    to produce the magnetic biochar. So produced magnetic biochar can be used for
    the adsorption of many pollutants like As3+ and Zn+2 ions from the wastewater
    (Zhou et al., 2017) as well as Cu+2 and Pb+2 from the industrial wastewater (J.
    W. Gabhane et al., 2020). Another research group (Zhou et al., 2017) established
    that an eco–friendly magnetic biochar, which is a cost–effective candidate of
    As3+ ions removal, when compared to the biochar prepared by the conventional techniques
    (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). 5. Recent biochar applications for real water, wastewater
    and industrial wastewater The biochar, which is heterogeneous and analogous to
    the activated carbon, has obviously been applied for wastewater treatment technologies
    as biofilters in the purpose of sorption of many inorganic and organic contaminants
    (Wang et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2023), when compared to the current wastewater
    treatment facilities by means of activated carbon, activated sludge, and some
    water treatment agents like disinfectants, flocculants etc. Kaetzl et al., (Kaetzl
    et al., 2019) and Perez–Mercado et al., (Perez–Mercado et al., 2019) utilized
    both the sand and bio–filters amended with biochar, similarly Chaukura et al.,
    (Chaukura et al., 2020) used biochar–clay composites to improve the engineered
    applications of the biochar and observed improvements in the performance of wastewater
    treatment notably. This system is highly effectual for the removal of mineral
    as well as organic contaminants from the wastewater cost–effectively, meanwhile
    this system has been promoted to real wastewater treatment in England, South Korea
    and USA. Dashti et al., (Dashti et al., 2023) performed four types of machine
    learning techniques with ANFIS (adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system), CSA–LSSVM
    (coupled simulated annealing–least squares support vector machine), ANFIS (PSO–ANFIS
    particle swarm optimization) and GP (genetic programming). They conducted this
    modelling with 44 different types of biochar, which were obtained from 353 datasets
    for the adsorption of heavy metals. Furthermore, the biochar can serve as a platform
    for microbial sensors (Álvarez-Ayuso and Abad-Valle, 2021, Chen et al., 2020,
    Lyu et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2023). These days, biochar have
    directly been used as a sorbent for both real water and wastewater treatments
    either for the abstraction of contaminants or for improvement of the water quality
    in CWs (constructed wetlands) as well as in the soil too (Amalina et al., 2023,
    He et al., 2022, Sanka et al., 2020). Herein, the removal of pollutants viz heavy
    metals, pesticides, antibiotics, indicator organisms and pathogens, inorganic
    ions (certainly NH4+, PO43–, NO3– and F–) from industrial wastewater. Further,
    the recent applications of biochar in the wastewater treatment for adsorption
    of dyes, heavy metals, machine learning via image recognition, speech recognition,
    google maps, product suggestions by dissimilar entertainment and e–commerce organisations,
    self–driving automobiles, medical diagnosis, automatic language translation, microbial
    sensors along with their limitations, and environmental concern with future directions
    have been discussed, hereunder. This study establishes the biochar scalability
    towards the engineered applications and affords some directions too. 5.1. Removal
    of inorganic and organic contaminants from real water, industrial wastewater and
    wastewater The rapid industrial development makes a dominant source of water contamination,
    it mainly depends on the industrial wastewater quantity and water contaminants
    types. The biochar based removal of divalent Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and hexavalent
    Cr ions have obviously been paid attention as their adversarial effects could
    bring the environmental issues (Ambaye et al., 2021, Fan et al., 2023). Chu et
    al., (Chu et al., 2023) derived tea wastes biochar, supported by MgO nanoparticles
    (MgO@TBC) and utilized as an operational adsorbent for the removal of hazardous
    o–CP (o–chlorophenol) from the industrial wastewater. They observed about 81.7
    % removal performance for o–CP from industrial wastewater. François et al., (François
    et al., 2023) aimed to study the effect of FeCl3 on the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller)
    surface area on biochar and its capability to upsurge bio–CH4 yield and to remove
    the contaminants from both the biogas and wastewater. Jagadeesh and Sundaram (Jagadeesh
    and Sundaram, 2023) reviewed the biochar capability on the removal of heavy metals,
    micro–plastics, some nutrients and organic pollutants like fertilizers, antibiotics,
    PAHs and PCBs. If, such pollutants in water knowingly reduce yield on crops, quality
    of the environment and human health. They noted that about 88–98 % removal efficiency
    of heavy metals from aqueous solution using adsorption isotherms and are found
    to be high as compared to the industrial (55–60 %) as well as municipal wastewater
    (J. W. Gabhane et al., 2020). Zhou et al., (Zhou et al., 2013, 2017) utilized
    chitosan for the modification of the biochar surface characteristics for the removal
    of three heavy metal ions (Cd2+, Cu2+, and Pb2+) from solutions. Boutsika et al.,
    (Boutsika et al., 2017) produced the MSR (malt spent rootlets) based biochar for
    the removal of Hg2+ ions from pure aqueous solutions with 100 % efficiency after
    24 h at a biochar concentrations of 1 g/L. Shi et al., (Shi et al., 2020) prepared
    a modified the biochar with ZnCl2–glue residue combination for sorption of Cr6+
    ions with the maximum sorption capacity of about 325.5 mg g−1. Liu et al., (Liu
    et al., 2014) prepared LS (lotus stalks) biochar in the presence of ZB (zinc borate)
    as a flame retardant for the removal of Ni2+ ions from the industrial wastewater.
    dos Reis et al., (dos Reis et al., 2017) carried out pyrolysis at 500 °C for preparation
    of sewage sludge based biochar, consequently followed by acidic treatment with
    HCl and observed a very high hydroquinone sorption, up to about 1218.3 mg g−1.
    Biochar can be applied for pesticide contamination remediation, distinctly (Dai
    et al., 2019). Zhang et al., (Zhang et al., 2018) studied the sorption of thiacloprid
    by the prepared maize straw based biochar at various temperatures (300, 500, and
    700 °C). They observed the sorption undoubtedly occurs by hydrophobic interaction,
    pore–filling and π − π interactions. Jin et al., (Jin et al., 2016) pyrolyzed
    the swine manure at 600 °C for preparation of biochar and observed its sorption
    capability for imidacloprid by means of pore–filling sorption mechanism. Klasson
    et al., (Klasson et al., 2013) produced almond shell based biochar by pyrolysis
    after carrying out of steam treatment, provides a larger specific surface area
    (about 344 m2g−1) along with about 102 mg g−1 sorption capacity for dibromochloropropane,
    a nematode insecticide. Zheng et al., (Zheng et al., 2010) investigated the sorption
    of triazine pesticides with the ability for atrazine and simazine were about 451–1158
    and 243–1066 mg g−1, respectively via a surface sorption mechanistic pathway.
    Uchimiya et al., (Uchimiya et al., 2010) produced biochar from broiler litter
    via pyrolysis (at 350 and 700 °C) for the removal of a stable atrazine metabolite
    from water, namely deisopropylatrazine. Further, they established that at 700
    °C the biochar provides a higher surface area with micro–pores along with non–carbonized
    fractions and more aromaticity. The adsorption of some extensively used antibiotics
    like SAs (sulfonamides), TCs (Tetracyclines), etc., from pharmaceutical wastewater
    by biochar are becoming significant, these days (Wang et al., 2020). The abstraction
    of TCs using the biochar–sawdust, doped with ZnCl2 / FeCl3 solution showed that
    the rate of removal is > 89 %, even after further three cycles (Zhou et al., 2017).
    Peiris et al., (Peiris et al., 2017) studied on the biochar sorption mechanism
    of SAs, and revealed that a strong interaction between π − π − EDA (electron–donor–acceptor)
    of the arene rings on the surface of biochar and SAs moieties along with some
    micro–pore filling on account of their smaller size. Further, they observed that
    the high production temperature of biochar makes high sorption ability at weak
    acidic conditions. Zhao et al., (Zhao et al., 2019) produced potato stems and
    leaves based humic acid–coated magnetic biochar for sorption of three characteristic
    FQs (fluoroquinolones) namely, ENR (enrofloxacin), NOR (norfloxacin) and CIP (ciprofloxacin)
    and observed some maximum sorption capabilities of about 8.4, 10.0 and 11.5 mg/g
    towards ENR, NOR and CIP mg/g, respectively. The high efficiency on the process
    of removal is because of not only electrostatic, hydrophobic and π − π–EDA interactions
    but also formation of the H–bonding. Table 3 presents the adsorption of antibiotic
    pollutants, using modified biochar and their removal efficiencies. Table 3. Adsorption

    hydrochloride; a L/kg; activated biochar (IA–BCs). From the urban storm–water
    runoff, the elimination of indicator organisms and pathogens predominantly could
    be achieved by biochar as filters and it has considerably been received attention.
    Because, the urban storm–water runoff with contaminants eventually reaches streams,
    lakes, etc., like surface water systems, thereby the irrigation practice might
    add some microbial contamination into vegetation. So, the biochar as filters towards
    the removal of microbes from surface water systems should be given importance.
    Kaetzl et al., (Kaetzl et al., 2019) investigated the biochar capability, obtained
    from both the pyrolyzed and non–pyrolyzed rice husk by means of cost–effective
    filtration process in favour of the purification of wastewater. Furthermore, the
    filtered wastewater can sequentially be utilized for lettuce irrigation. The involved
    mechanism of the removal process is obviously by means of filtration and sorption
    of the pathogens via bacterial cells that are of negatively charged (Wang et al.,
    2020). Likewise, Perez–Mercado et al., (Perez–Mercado et al., 2019) filtered diluted
    wastewater by utilization of biochar of minimum particle size (d10 = 1.4 mm) and
    Saccharomyces cerevisiae of about > 1 log10 CFU was effectively removed (a minimum
    1 log10 CFU of the microbes) at the on–farm irrigation conditions. Alagha et al.,
    (Alagha et al., 2020) used date–palm biochar with MgAl–augmented double–layered
    hydroxide (biochar–MgAl–LDH) nano–composite for the adsorption of PO43– and NO3–
    from the source of real water. Sadhu et al., (Sadhu et al., 2021) used watermelon
    rind (Citrullus lanatus) based biochar (WMRBC) for defluoridation. Yu et al.,
    (Yu et al., 2023) prepared the acid modified biochar from corn cobs, stalks, and
    reeds sulphuric biochar and observed that the corn cobs derived biochar has a
    highest BET (101.6 m2/g) with a sorption capability of about193.1 mg/g for Na+
    ion from the sources of real water. Fan et al., (Fan et al., 2019) investigated
    on hydrous bamboo–derived biochar for NH4+ sorption and found that a maximum sorption
    capacity of about 6.4 mM/g. Hu et al., (Hu et al., 2020) revealed the sorption
    mechanism that negatively charged biochar with a higher pH can easily sorb the
    NH4+ by means of electrostatic forces of attraction, subsequently followed by
    the weakening of both –OH and. –C = O linkages via surface complexation process.
    Furthermore, the exchange ions in between NH4+ ions and the negatively charged
    functional groups like –OH, –COO–, etc., results in the sorption of NH4+. Though,
    sorption by the bamboo based biochar for NO3– ions follow multiple interactions
    mechanisms, primarily via electrostatic forced of attraction as well as ionic
    bonds (Wang et al., 2020). Yin et al., (Yin et al., 2019) utilized the co–pyrolyzed
    walnut shell and sewage sludge based biochar for sorption of PO43– from eutrophic
    water and observed a perfect sorption (about 303.5 mg g−1). Ajmal et al., (Ajmal
    et al., 2020) studied on the comparison of the removal efficiencies for PO43–
    ions from the wastewater by means of magnetically modified biochars and observed
    the sorption capability that is twice (25–28 mg/g) as compared to the un–modified
    one (12–15 mg/g). The mechanism predominantly follows electrostatic forces of
    attraction, then by surface precipitation and complexation. The steps in the three
    zones for the adsorption of certain pollutants mainly involve (i) physico–sorption
    (clean zone: no adsorption; the adsorbates settle on the surface of the adsorbent),
    (ii) complexation followed by precipitation (mass transfer zone; the adsorbates
    deposit on the surface of the adsorbent; and finally (iii) pore–filling (the exhausted
    zone: the adsorbates are condensed and trapped into the pores of the adsorbents,
    in which equilibrium is attained (Ambaye et al., 2021). Biochar from various biomasses
    have intensively been utilized as sorbents for organic contaminants, mainly focused
    on phenols and dyes of real water and wastewater. The pyrolyzed (at 300 °C) macroalgae
    derived biochar have effectively been applied to eliminate some textile dyes like
    Congo red, crystal violet, malachite green, etc. which are resistant to aerobic
    digestion (Chen et al., 2018). The switchgrass based biochar was pyrolyzed at
    very high temperatures (>900 °C) and were effectively utilized to sorb certain
    dye stuffs like Congo red, methylene blue, orange G, etc., as it possesses considerably
    enhanced surface area (Park et al., 2019). The cationic dyes (like methylene blue)
    were sorbed highly as compared to the anionic dyes (like Congo red, orange G,
    etc), the results indicated. It is attributed to the slight molecular weight of
    cationic dyes and their electrostatical properties as well as strong π–π interactions
    with the surface of biochar. Similar way, the biochar has also been utilized as
    an exceptional adsorbent of phenols from the wastewater sources (Thang et al.,
    2019). Thang et al., (Thang et al., 2019) examined the potentiality of chicken
    manure derived biochar (possesses high stability up to five cycles) to remove
    toxic phenol (106.2 m2/g) along with 2,4–dinitrophenol (148.1 mg/g) from the aqueous
    solution. The mechanisms involve (i) surface sorption, (ii) ion exchange, (iii)
    electrostatic interaction, (iv) complexation and (v) precipitation. Further, some
    kind of interactions like electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding and π–π bonding
    under different conditions are often taken place (Ambaye et al., 2021, Thang et
    al., 2019). Oh and Seo (Oh and Seo, 2019) removed the ionisable halo phenols from
    aqueous solution, using polymer biomass–derived biochar. Here, pH of the solution
    plays an important role for regulating the deprotonation and hydrophobicity of
    the sorbed compounds. Qiu et al., (Qiu et al., 2009) evaluated the effectiveness
    of straw–based biochar for the removal of reactive brilliant blue and rhodamine–B
    dyes and observed that high affinity to sorb both dyes at pH values of 3.0 and
    6.5, respectively while it sorbs rhodamine B faster because of the improvement
    in the π–π interactions via its surface functional groups. Table 4 establishes
    adsorption capacities of various biochar as adsorbents for the removal of different
    dyes from wastewater. Ferreira et al., (Ferreira et al., 2016) studied on the
    comparison of the paper mill sludge based biochar performances with commercially
    produced activated carbon via an eco– friendly process towards the removal process
    for fish anaesthetics, from the recirculating water of aquaculture systems. But
    they observed that a low adsorption capacity (53–109 mg/g) as compared to the
    activated carbon (289–631 mg/g), Moreover, the recent studies show that biochar
    have excellently been utilized to remove heavy metals from wastewater and its
    sorption capacity widely depends on the characteristics of both the biochar and
    target metals (Enaime et al., 2020). The biochar sorption capacity is effectively
    because of the prevailing surface functional groups mainly like carbolic acid,
    carboxyl, hydroxyl, etc., its porous nature and large surface area (Zhao et al.,
    2019). Pan et al., (Pan et al., 2013) compared the adsorption capacity of biochar,
    derived from straws of canola, rice, peanut and soybean for Cr3+ ion. They observed
    a consistency in the adsorption capacities and is owing to the biochar acidic
    functional groups, then found the following sorption order: peanut > soybean >
    canola > rice. Similar way, Zhao et al., (Zhao et al., 2019) compared the characteristics
    of chicken manure, rice straw and sewage sludge–derived biochars for the removal
    efficacy of Pb2+ and Zn2+ ions. They revealed that the maximum adsorption capacity
    of rice straw derived biochar for Pb2+ ions is due to high carbon and hydrogen
    contents, the presence of functional groups like –OH and –C = C– / –C = O, etc.,
    high pH values, the most negative surface charge and the high physical stability.
    Further, the proposed mechanisms for adsorption of heavy metals mainly involve
    both precipitation and ion exchange reactions. Likewise, Park et al., (Park et
    al., 2019) investigated on the rice straw based biochar towards Cu2+ and Zn2+
    ions removal capacity. Additionally, Liu and Fan (Liu and Fan, 2018) examined
    the rice straw based biochar for the sorption of Cd2+ ions and they observed that
    the biochar surface with Mg and Ca minerals obviously could exchange their cations
    with Cd2+ ions by a precipitation reaction. Samsuri et al., (Samsuri et al., 2013)
    evaluated As3+ and As5+ adsorption using Fe–coated biochars, obtained from empty
    fruits bunch and rice husk. They observed that enhancement in the sorption capacity
    for both As3+ (from 19 mg/g to 31 mg/g), and As5+ ions (from 5.5 to 7.1 mg/g to
    15.0–16.0 mg/g) can be provided by Fe–coating through complexation process of
    both the ions in the presence of Fe on the biochar surface with formation of the
    species (As3+: H3AsO3 and As5+: H2AsO4− and HAsO42−) in the pH range of 2–9. Beyond
    the characteristics of biochar, the sorption of heavy metals mainly depends on
    the type of the metals and biochar sorption sites. Several techniques have eventually
    been utilized for the removal of heavy metals from water by means of adsorption,
    electrochemical / chemical precipitation, ion exchange, and membrane filtration.
    Each technique has its own inherent advantages and disadvantages for its applicability
    (Manna and Bhaumik, 2021). Table 4. Sorption capacities of various biochar adsorbents

    learning and various machine learning algorithms have been used for the prediction
    of adsorption onto biochar. There have frequently been many attempts to apply
    the machine learning for biochar (Paula et al., 2022) via reviewing machine learning
    applications like automatic language translation, Alexa, image / speech recognition,
    email spam / malware filtering, Google assistant and Google Maps, medical diagnosis,
    online fraud detection, product recommendation, self–driving cars, stock market
    trading, traffic prediction, etc., (Ukoba and Jen, 2023) and reviewing biochar
    (Wang and Wang, 2019). Though, there is inadequate study that describing the machine
    learning review for biochar applications. Till now, the machine learning aided
    concurrent biochar engineering has not been studied, but a comparison on traditional
    trial and error technique that adopts the optimized algorithms towards the prediction
    of machine learning models are available (Zhu et al., 2023). It can efficiently
    assist the optimized schemes in the case of the production of biochar, further
    such schemes suggestively diminish the production cost, laboratory work, and processing
    time. The machine learning will find a new path to the researchers for optimization
    of the experimental techniques in favour of designing the biochar materials. Precisely,
    the optimized multi target prediction of machine learning model will be used to
    plan the design of pyrolysis parameters for the selected biomass for production
    of biochar (Li et al., 2023). 5.3. In microbial sensor applications Biochar is
    an effective matrix for soil amelioration as it possesses highest internal as
    well as external porosity to conserve abundant nutrients, thereby making microbes
    like bacteria can thrive, a platform for bioremediation (Ali et al., 2020, Chen
    et al., 2020, Ok et al., 2022, Phillips et al., 2022). Consequently, both the
    plant growth and immobilization of Cd metal is supported directly by the biochar
    and bacteria combination (Li et al., 2022). Though, no research has extensively
    been carried out (Do et al., 2020, Fang et al., 2021) for the impact of such a
    combination on soil fertility, functions and Cd immobilization. But, the MICP
    technique (Microbially induced calcite precipitation) has been employed for ureolytic
    bacteria (i.e., Sporosarcina pasteurii) to decompose the soil urea and produce
    CO32–: carbonate ions, which induce heavy metal (like Cd) combination to remediate
    predominately the contaminated paddy soils by suitably constructing biochar–bacteria
    (2B) system that is incubated for about 20 days. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA technique
    has eventually been utilized to assess the short–term impact on the community
    structure of soil–microbe and there are no any negating effects on the critical
    functions of the soil. The high light absorption efficacy of biochar–soils enables
    the sorption of cellular communications, which can assist properly the microbial
    growth as well. But it is uncertain that there is the probability of binding biochemical
    signals whether occurs or not. The existing microbial biosensors are proficient
    to synthesize the fluorescent reporters, subsequently they can be imaged, while
    encountering the biological signals inside the rhizosphere (DeAngelis et al.,
    2007). Such reporters have a tendency to absorb and emit the light in the visible
    range and is inappropriate for imaging the cells within biochar–amended materials
    of highest light absorption. Simultaneously, the synthesized flavonoids by plants
    can regulate perfectly the microbial performances certainly like the root nodules
    establishment, synthesis of nodulation signals, and plant hormones, etc., (Shaw
    et al., 2006) whereas, such functions throw impact on the plant growth and uptake
    of the nutrients. The miscellany signals of the environment encounter the causality
    attribution for specific intercellular preservation. The biochar effects on cellular
    signals under different pyrolytic temperatures (about 300, 350, 400, 450, 550,
    600 and 700 °C) influence obviously the detection of signals in a synthetic microbial
    system (Basu et al., 2005). Herein, the utilization of a microbial sensor is necessary
    to determine the signaling molecules, under a level that can be detectable to
    bacteria with the presence of dissimilar biochars because, the signals detectability
    are opposed by the fraction of signals that are chemically–extractable from the
    soil. Thereby, the attention towards a signaling molecule namely N–3–oxo–dodecanoyl–L–homoserine
    lactone that is a member of the AHL (acyl–homoserine lactone) family, are generally
    applicable for intra–species communication as well as quorum sensing by means
    of many gram–negative bacteria with some pathogens and nitrogen fixing plant symbionts
    that cause plants soft rot, often (Churchill and Chen, 2011). 6. Analyses on commercial
    and environmental profit From the above points of view, biochar has potentially
    applied for the industrial pollutants elimination too. Though, large–scale application
    involves optimizing some of the parameters for improving the commercial viability
    of the processes via biochar type, raw materials availability, pyrolytic temperature,
    industrial scale reactors availability, recycling approaches and life span. Dai
    et al., (Dai et al., 2019) revealed that a maximum benefit and a long–term industrial
    manufacturing of the produced biochars by slow as well as fast pyrolytic conditions
    worth of 18.30 and 8.14 US$/ton, respectively for users. According to IBI 2013
    (International Biochar Initiative) survey stated that globally the biochar average
    price is from about 80.00 US$/ to 13,480.00 US$/ton, for sellers. Nevertheless,
    recently the survey of 23 biochar industries revealed the average price is of
    about 2512.00 US$/ton. Dai et al. (Dai et al., 2019) reported the recent standards
    chart for the biochar development, established by the IBI and the European Biochar
    Certifcate. Generally, the biochars applications towards the removal of contaminants
    have discussed from the past years, but still the research on market of biochar
    / biochar cost is in infant stage, so more research should be carried out in the
    future to significantly predict the commercial biochar cost and its commercial
    profits towards the pollutants removal capacity at larger scale. The applications
    of biochar to alleviate the influence on change of climate and to improve sustainably
    both the development of agricultural and ecological systems are the recent approaches
    (Oliveira et al., 2017) since, both the global warming and GHGs (greenhouse gases)
    are persisting (Wang and Wang, 2019, Wang et al., 2020). The environmental impacts
    as well as the reduction of GHGs are basically driving forces of the research
    for the development of new eco–friendly materials to restrain the carbons from
    the bio cycle that involves dynamic to an inactive system, using the biochar.
    Liu et al., (Liu et al., 2014) established that the CO2 emission can be minimized
    using biochar from 0.10 to 0.30 billion tons/year. It means that the biochar contribution
    for the reduction of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and that leads to further
    reduction in GHGs emission. Else, Dai et al., (Dai et al., 2019) revealed that
    the emission of N2O (about 310 times higher than that of CO2) can be minimized
    by the biochar–modified soil, more certainly. A number of studies describe the
    biochar applications for climate change, production of energy, soil remediation
    and sustainable waste management, from the last two decades. Such a bio resource
    technology includes four main synergistic social as well as commercial applications,
    viz (i) improvement of soil productivity, (ii) mitigation of change in climate,
    (iii) production of energy and (iv) sustainable management of wastes. Nevertheless,
    the biochar applications to remove inorganic / organic contaminants and some other
    environmental pollutants predominantly depend on the way of biochar utilization.
    On the basis of biomass pyrolysis and its longevity (mineralization of biochar
    over time) in soil, biochar is capable to sequester the carbons in soil for capturing
    atmospheric CO2, thereby generation of biogas. It is necessary to research (i)
    the relationship in between the production technique / conditions, (ii) the type
    of feedstock and (iii) the stability of biochar with its micro–structure, over
    decades. Further, numerous methods could frequently be utilized to evaluate the
    longevity of the biochar via FT–IR, NMR, and biomarkers. Though, it is unavoidable
    that the eco–toxicological effects might arise from the biochar longevity, by
    itself. In this view, specifically the biochar should be investigated. 7. Limitations
    and future directions This review systematically provides an overview on various
    feedstock materials and methods of biochar production via traditional as well
    as modern approaches by means of modified pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal
    carbonization (HTC) and torrefaction. In the meantime, current environmental concerns
    on biochar application have been well presented in the features of cost, co–contaminant
    performance, stability, and sustainability. The above findings show that the HTC
    process is the most prominent technique for the production of biochar as compared
    to both torrefaction and gasification processes at a temperature from 220 to 240
    °C, under 2–10 MPa pressure. The biochar modification, using base / alkaline obviously
    could obviously improve its surface area and thereby it possesses about 88–98
    %, 106.2 m2 /g and 148.1 mg/g removal efficiencies for the heavy metals, toxic
    phenols and 2,4–dinitrophenols from the industrial aqueous solutions. Up to now,
    mostly the research widely have focused on the single contaminant sorption from
    aqueous solution. Though, usually applications on the real water involves removal
    of the co–existing contaminants via both the synergistic as well as antagonistic
    sorption effects, because the existing multiple contaminants eventually lead to
    potent ionic interference that opposes the sorption sites, thereby an ultimate
    minimization in the efficiency for the removal performance. The biochar has not
    widely been utilized in some developing countries as there are lack of comprehensive
    industrial chains and still it is in the researching stage only. Right now, the
    production as well as application of biochar is not applied completely, due to
    several substantial environmental concerns while practically applying the biochar.
    In such cases, strenuous research should be carried out to resolve such environmental
    issues to increase the biochar applications, which can assist to pursue the best
    solutions. For instance, the cellulose biochar possesses micro–pores of about
    280 m2/g and is high as compared to the lignin biochar (200 m2/g) on carbonization
    at similar temperatures. Since, the lignin resistance makes the cellulose biomass
    to be appropriate than lignin biomass towards the biochar production. But, Li
    et al., (Li et al., 2014) established high temperature pyrolysis for the pinewood
    biochar, and revealed that the existence of well–developed surface area and pore
    structure by means of a complete lignin carbonization. Some potential environmental
    concerns with propositional future research directions are briefly depicted in
    Fig. 2. Though, feedstocks to produce biochars are wide–ranging and easily available,
    and such raw materials can be prepared by means of pyrolysis after cleaning, grinding,
    and drying processes. Further, the surface modification steps should also be obligatory
    for improving the sorption effect. When compared to the conventional charcoal,
    the treatments on biochar would inexorably increase the cost of production. Thereby,
    future research should be attempted to compromise the optimization of processes
    of production and maximize the biochar applicability for minimization of the price
    (Sizmur et al., 2017). For the meantime, care should be provided towards the feedstocks
    selections, process conditions, and approaches for modification are precarious
    to acquire the biochars of improved performances. Further, for the practical biochar
    applications stability of the biochar and its composite forms must be given importance
    because the stability of biochar usually denotes its carbon structural stability
    (Wang and Wang, 2019, Wang et al., 2020). The impact of carbonization on the process
    conditions, carbon content and pore structure need to be studied, further. For
    instance, the biochar produced by hydrothermal carbonization shows a higher carbon
    than that by gasification as well as pyrolysis (Funke and Ziegler, 2010). Farther,
    monitoring constantly the water quality is recommended strongly throughout the
    life–cycle application of the sorbents. Huang et al., (Huang et al., 2019) established
    that the complexation with heavy metals leads possibly to a complete dissolution
    of organic matters, starting from the biochar. Thereby, an increased carbon content
    in the water as the organic matters possess high aromaticity as well as stability.
    Besides, the sewage sludge based biochars comprise of high heavy metal content
    that might percolate out (leaching) in the course of biochar application, leading
    to further heavy metal pollution (Wang and Wang, 2019, Wang et al., 2020). There
    is a chance of leaching out the embedded materials from the biochar based composite,
    through the biochar matrices if uncertainly they are not well fixed. Wang and
    Wang (Wang and Wang, 2019, Wang et al., 2020), proposed leaching / toxicity experiments
    with algae, fish / luminous bacteria and water fleas to regulate the dissolution
    process of toxic components from the biochar. Download : Download high-res image

    future research directions. Presently the sorption of co–contaminant is limited,
    and so a concurrent establishment of sorption models could disclose both the synergistic
    / antagonistic sorption mechanistic paths. For simplification of such studies,
    the biochar sorption reports ought to possess adequate information about the sorbent
    characteristics and conditions in the case of future directions. For which, laborious
    efforts have been reported certainly like simulated molecular equations to understand
    co–contaminant competitive sorption as well as develop possible new sorption models
    (Bahamon et al., 2017), meta– and in–depth analyses (Tran et al., 2019, Wang and
    Wang, 2019, Wang et al., 2020). While the biochar is low–cost, renewable, and
    sustainable when compared to the activated charcoal, but it is compromise to attain
    the sustainability that for cost–intensive desorption processes of the waste biochar
    magnetization is required to separate the loaded biochar with various contaminants
    from water by means of applying an external magnetic field. Conversely, the contaminants
    sorbed on biochar cannot be recovered effectively by desorption, so waste biochar
    recycling process seeks some other ways. For instance, biochar loaded with N /
    P has potential been utilized as a slow release fertilizer for agricultural /
    ecological remediation (Roy, 2017). Consequently, biochar loaded with Cu / Zn
    can eventually be utilized as a micro–nutrient fertilizer, in addition. Yet, attention
    must be paid for the release of any harmful components from the biochar that could
    obviously be sorbed by crops and accordingly enter into the food chain thereby,
    the precaution is necessary while applying waste biochar into soil for further
    evaluation. 8. Environmental benefits and global biochar industry The overall
    anthropogenic emissions in the year of 2010, were about 49.0 ± 4.5 Gt CO2e. One
    of the objectives in Paris Agreement to minimize the global warming, below 2 °C,
    is about 120 Gt CO2e essentially to be caught and stockpiled from the year of
    2015 to 2050. In the view of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, biochar
    is to be estimated as a maximum potential offset of about 1.8 Gt CO2e per year,
    and sustainably suggested that all the harvested biomass over the globe can obviously
    be converted to biochar by means of slow pyrolysis, followed by low–emissions,
    with high yield of bioenergy (Zilberman et al., 2023). The literature reveals
    that carbon sequestration potential of biochar is about 0.7–1.3 Gt CO2e (Smith
    et al., 2016). The environmental benefits of biochar can be recognized mostly
    via the sequestration of carbons in agricultural practices and applications, besides
    a simultaneous production of bioenergy. The derived bioenergy, followed by reduced
    emissions if coal is possibly replaced by 15 % and the observed net emissions
    will be low (Zilberman et al., 2023). Dickinson et al., (Dickinson et al., 2015)
    estimated that in the tropical regions, sub–Saharan Africa (SSA), the yield increases
    per crops that ranges from 0.18 to 1.00 ton ha−1 year−1, whereas in the temperate
    regions, northwest Europe (NWE), it ranges from 0.07 to 0.28 ton ha−1 year−1.
    The estimated prices of the biochar grains are ranging from 196 to 333 USD t−1,
    in NWE and 142–211 USD in SSA, from the year 2012–2027 t−1 (Zilberman et al.,
    2023). Presently, for SSA the total value is of about > $700 with about 10 years
    biochar longevity and in between $1500–$2000 with 40 years longevity, it is depending
    on nature of the feed–stocks. Further, the benefit range of biochar is worth of
    $250–$400 in NWE, for 10 years biochar longevity and $550–$750 for 40 years longevity.
    The Labrador of Canada produces biochar from potato and forest biomass. The yield
    is ranging from 2.90 to 11.40 Mg ha−1 that obviously leading to an average net
    return / annum with variable costs of about $4953 ha−1. It is four times higher
    than that of the average return ($965.48 ha−1) (Keske et al., 2020). Globally,
    the crop residues can produce nearly 3758 million tonnes of CO2 per year, and
    is equivalent to that can produced approximately by 7560 million barrels of fossil–derived
    oil. Furthermore, energy of such feed–stocks are estimated as about 69.9 EJ (Panwar
    et al., 2019). As the straw burning is a general issue on the Asian continent,
    Gupta et al. (Gupta et al., 2004) observed the particulates obtained by means
    of burning one tonne straw that produce about 60, 1460, 199 and 2 kg CO, CO2,
    and ash contents. Besides, Gadde et al., (Gadde et al., 2009) determined the annual
    contribution of crop residues by burning to about 0.10, 0.96, 379, 23, 0.68 Tg
    of SO2, NO2, CO2, CO and CH4. Such emission of gases and aerosols unfavourably
    affects the local environments and is accountable for the global change of climate.
    Thereby, harvesting of excess crop residues to produce renewable energy, the forest
    and agro–industrial wastes has obviously been utilized to lessen the greenhouse
    gases (Goldemberg, 2007). Roberts et al., (Roberts et al., 2010) established a
    lifecycle valuation on the stover, switchgrass and yard wastes–derived biochar
    applications. They revealed that it releases very low greenhouse gases and the
    process costs of about 30, 45 and 1.5 euros / tonne CO2e for stover, switchgrass
    and yard wastes based biochar, respectively. Additionally, Cowie et al., (Cowie
    and Bird, 2013) determined poultry litter biochar potentiality to mitigate the
    greenhouse gas emission, similarly reported for maize crops derived biochar with
    a reduction in emission of about 3.2 kg CO2 per kg of biochar. 9. Conclusions
    This review provided various aspects biomass types, methodology and mechanism
    for biochar production and applications in various environmental niches. Further
    exploration and consideration should be paid on modification of biochar for improving
    its enactment via increasing the surface area, porous surface sorption sites on
    the biochar. Additionally, the future research directions such as carbon credits,
    restoration of soil quality, and beyond should be inspected. Declaration of Competing

  description: Soil ecosystems are crucial for providing vital ecosystem services
    (ES), and are increasingly pressured by the intensification and expansion of human
    activities, leading to potentially harmful consequences for their related ES provision.
    Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs), associated with releases from various human activities,
    have become prevalent in various soil ecosystems and pose a global threat. Life
    Cycle Assessment (LCA), a tool for evaluating environmental performance of product
    and technology life cycles, has yet to adequately include MNPs-related damage
    to soil ES, owing to factors like uncertainties in MNPs environmental fate and
    ecotoxicological effects, and characterizing related damage on soil species loss,
    functional diversity, and ES. This study aims to address this gap by providing
    as a first step an overview of the current understanding of MNPs in soil ecosystems
    and proposing a conceptual approach to link MNPs impacts to soil ES damage. We
    find that MNPs pervade soil ecosystems worldwide, introduced through various pathways,
    including wastewater discharge, urban runoff, atmospheric deposition, and degradation
    of larger plastic debris. MNPs can inflict a range of ecotoxicity effects on soil
    species, including physical harm, chemical toxicity, and pollutants bioaccumulation.
    Methods to translate these impacts into damage on ES are under development and
    typically focus on discrete, yet not fully integrated aspects along the impact-to-damage
    pathway. We propose a conceptual framework for linking different MNPs effects
    on soil organisms to damage on soil species loss, functional diversity loss and
    loss of ES, and elaborate on each link. Proposed underlying approaches include
    the Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) for translating ecotoxicological
    effects associated with MNPs into quantitative measures of soil species diversity
    damage; trait-based approaches for linking soil species loss to functional diversity
    loss; and ecological networks and Bayesian Belief Networks for linking functional
    diversity loss to soil ES damage. With the proposed conceptual framework, our
    study constitutes a starting point for including the characterization of MNPs-related
    damage on soil ES in LCA.

    loss 1. Introduction Over the last few decades, an increasing amount of plastic
    has made its way into terrestrial environments. This plastic input undergoes a
    number of degradation mechanisms, including photo-decomposition and hydrolysis
    (Wong et al., 2020), resulting in the fragmentation into smaller pieces known
    as microplastics (Andrady, 2011; Auta et al., 2017). As this process continues,
    the size of the plastic particles can reach nanometer dimensions (Mitrano et al.,
    2021), in combination referred to as micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs). MNPs exhibit
    significant variation in form, chemical properties, texture, color, density and
    size (Rochman et al., 2016). These particles have been found to affect a diverse
    array of organisms form different habitats, trophic levels, sizes, feeding mechanisms,
    and behaviors (Kukkola et al., 2021). Consequently, MNPs have emerged as a significant
    pollutant. MNPs pollution has been found to be ubiquitous, spanning from the equator
    to the poles (Lusher et al., 2015) from sea to land (Hu et al., 2022; Imhof et
    al., 2017). Recent evidence suggests that MNPs are present in various terrestrial
    ecosystems, including soil, and can enter through multiple pathways such as sewage
    sludge, irrigation, littering, atmospheric deposition, flooding, and plastic coverings
    (Xu et al., 2020), as shown in Fig. 1a. In Europe and North America, compost and
    sewage sludge are commonly used as fertilizers, and they are a significant source
    of soil plastic pollution in these regions. Additionally, China, Japan, and Korea
    account for 80 % of all plastic mulch, indicating that soil may be a large sink
    for MNPs (Geyer et al., 2017; Ng et al., 2018). Recent estimates suggest that
    that the annual input of MNPs from agricultural lands ranges from 63 to 430,000
    tons in Europe and 440 to ~300,000 tons in North America (Guo et al., 2020). Furthermore,
    studies indicate that MNPs may be 4 to ~23 times more abundant on land than in
    the ocean (Nizzetto et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res image (767KB)

    (MNPs) and pathways into soil ecosystems (a), Environmental behavior of MNPs in
    soil (b); potential LCIA modeling framework for MNPs impacts in soil ecosystems
    (c); and functional attribute dimensions of soil ecosystems. A high abundance
    of MNPs in soil has the potential to spread throughout various components of the
    soil ecosystem, including soil properties, fauna, microorganisms, and even functional
    traits within the plant community (Fig. 1b). This can result in potential threats
    to both the structure and function of the soil ecosystem. Due to their size similarity
    to algal or mineral particles, MNPs can easily be ingested by organisms at different
    trophic levels and accumulate in the food chain. Upon accumulation in organisms,
    MNPs may cause numerous negative effects, such as lethality, reduced feeding activity,
    inhibition of growth and development, endocrine disruption, energy metabolism
    disruption, oxidative stress, immune and neurotransmission dysfunction, and genotoxicity
    (Xu et al., 2020). Studies by He et al. (2021) and Liang et al. (2023) have highlighted
    the implications of this phenomenon, including its potential of MNPs to enter
    the food chain through trophic cascades. Soil is essential for proving essential
    ES that support both human and ecosystem needs (Pereira et al., 2018). ES have
    direct and indirect contributions to human well-being but are under constant pressure
    from the intensification and expansion of human activities (Carpenter et al.,
    2009; Nelson et al., 2013). These services have social, ecological, economic,
    cultural and spiritual dimensions, and perform functions such as support, provisioning,
    regulation and cultural services (Fig. 1d). Soil plays a critical role in biomass
    production, environmental purification, climate change mitigation, biodiversity
    maintenance, natural cultural heritage conservation, and landscape tourism resource
    development (Ananyeva et al., 2021; Comerford et al., 2013; Jónsson and Davíðsdóttir,
    2016). Furthermore, 13 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are directly
    or indirectly related to soils. Numerous studies have shown that soil organisms
    play an important role in the performance of ES (Lazarova et al., 2021). According
    to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), soil biodiversity
    refers to the diversity of subsurface organisms (Costantini and Mocali, 2022;
    Orgiazzi, 2022), including both genes, species and their constituent communities,
    as well as the ecological complexes to which they contribute and to which they
    belong, including soil microhabitats and landscapes (Christmann, 2022). LCA (Life
    Cycle Assessment) is a recognized quantitative decision support tool to identify
    options or solutions that have the lowest potential environmental impact, supporting
    the assessment and improvement of the environmental sustainability of products
    and technologies throughout their lifespan. LCA aims to quantify the pathway from
    stress to damage to ecosystems (Dieterle et al., 2022; Finnveden and Ekvall, 1998;
    Woods et al., 2018), including ecotoxicological impact pathways associated with
    chemical releases during the product life cycle (Fantke et al., 2018; Henderson
    et al., 2011; Oginah et al., 2023). A growing body of research highlights that
    MNPs is the form of plastic pollution with a high potential to cause negative
    environmental impact. Therefore, characterizing the effects that indicate the
    harmfulness of MNPs to soil ecosystems needs to be integrated as an important
    component of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) (Fig. 1c). However, current LCIA
    methods do not yet include the damage to soil ecosystem functions, or damage to
    ES associated with MNPs-related effects (Pavan and Ometto, 2018). Within LCA,
    recent efforts aimed at linking environmental impacts to the consequent damage
    on ecosystem services (Alejandre et al., 2019; Rugani et al., 2019). However,
    the integration of MNPs in this context is still missing. Notably, while ecotoxicity,
    a relevant component of MNPs, is acknowledged as an impact category within LCA,
    the connection between ecotoxicity and the consequential damage to ecosystem services
    remains insufficiently addressed (Oginah et al., 2023). This challenge arises
    from the complexity of quantifying and assessing the intricate interactions between
    stressors like MNPs and the varied ecosystems they influence. Consequently, there
    is a urgent need to refine existing methodologies and collect damage-related data
    for MNPs at ecosystem level, in conjunction with their related chemical ecotoxicity,
    and finally integrate that into the existing LCA framework. The preliminary methods
    designed to correlate environmental impacts with damage to ecosystem services
    have yet to integrate MNPs. In summary, in MNPs'' research, LCA is becoming more
    and more relevant. Although some methodologies can approximate damage to ecosystem
    services within LCA (Alejandre et al., 2019; Rugani et al., 2019), there is a
    plethora of review articles delving into MNPs in LCA (Gazal and Gheewala, 2020;
    Tan et al., 2023; Zhao and You, 2022). However, an evident gap exists in damage
    modeling, emphasizing the urgency of examining the implications of MNPs on terrestrial
    ecosystems and the associated detriment to soil ecosystem services. To quantify
    the damage caused by the effects of MNPs to the soil ES, it is necessary to define
    the basic pathway of from sources of MNPs to damage on species and functional
    diversity in soil ecosystems and link them to ES damage. To address this gap,
    the present study aims (a) to provide conceptual framework of linking MNPs sources
    to impacts and further to damage on ES, (b) to provide an overview of sources,
    fate, effects of MNPs on soil ecosystems, and (c) to discuss methods to link impacts
    to damage on soil species diversity, functional diversity and ES. This manuscript
    aims to address the gap by extending LCA to include MNPs and their damage on soil
    ecosystems and ecosystem services, partly building on existing reviews that so
    far focus only on the link of MNP emissions to effects on species, while not considering
    the link from effects to damage on related ecosystem services. 2. Methodology
    for identifying key literature We employed a systematic approach for our review
    by using the Web of Science core collection database, focusing on articles in
    English published up until February 2023. Initially, we extracted a total of 1896
    articles on soil MNPs. To further refine our search, we incorporated keywords
    such as “microplastics”, “life cycle assessment”, and “cascade model”, yielding
    73 articles, 27 of which specifically dealt with soil ecosystems. In a subsequent
    refinement stage, we revisited the initial 1896 articles and added the keywords
    “species diversity”, “functional diversity”, and “ecosystem services”, which resulted
    in 36 additional relevant articles. After manual review and the exclusion of unrelated
    articles, we yielded a set of 57 papers that were particularly focused on LCA
    in relation to soil MNPs. These selected articles formed the foundation of our
    analysis. 3. Conceptual framework of linking micro- and nanoplastics sources to
    damage on soil ecosystem services We propose a conceptual framework for linking
    MNPs impacts on soil organisms to related ES damage in LCA (Fig. 2). To quantify
    the damage on services provided by soil ecosystems, it is crucial to clarify the
    cascade relationship between the structure-function-services damage of MNPs on
    soil ecosystems, propose a feasible quantitative expression assessment method,
    and discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and possibility of data for each step
    from MNPs impacts to soil ES damage. Download : Download high-res image (555KB)

    Oginah et al. (2023). 4. Sources, fate and effects of micro- and nanoplastics
    in soil ecosystems 4.1. Sources of micro- and nanoplastics in soil ecosystems
    Multiple human activities introduce various types of MNPs into soil ecosystem
    as conducted by Zhao et al. (2022). These include the use of mulch in agriculture,
    utilization of sludge and solid waste composting in municipal sewage plants, sewage
    irrigation, plastic waste disposal, atmospheric deposition, and rainwater runoff
    as shown in Fig. 1(a). Agricultural mulch and greenhouse cultivation enhances
    crop yield, they also increase soil MNPs level, which pose a serious threat to
    soil quality (Arsene and Fyama, 2021; Huang et al., 2020). Mulch films made mainly
    of polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and sometimes as thin as 8–50
    μm, leave behind hard-to-recover residues, which degrade into MNPs due to factors
    like tillage and UV radiation (Yuan et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2022). The use
    of sewage sludge in agriculture has introduced substantial MNPs amounts (Geyer
    et al., 2022; Rolsky et al., 2020), with the abundance rising with increased sludge
    application (Tian et al., 2022). Moreover, the abundance of MNPs in the products
    of fermentation or composting from different sources of solid waste (with different
    substrates) varies and can enter the soil system directly (Golwala et al., 2021).
    Another major route for plastics to enter the soil environment is through waste
    disposal (Horton and Dixon, 2018), which results from waste disposal activities
    associated with construction, agricultural and consumerism. Consequently, these
    activities cause the emission of MNPs into the soil. Kawecki et al. (2021) highlighted
    that waste disposal is the main pathway for plastics to enter the environment,
    with 40 times the mass flux of plastic entering the soil than water bodies. Furthermore,
    MNPs can be transported to remote areas by atmospheric circulation and subsequently
    impacted by dry and wet atmospheric deposition (Szewc et al., 2021), which are
    then transported via wind to aquatic ecosystem or deposited on agricultural surfaces.
    MNPs can enter the soil through rainwater runoff (Sang et al., 2021; Wang et al.,
    2022) and atmospheric dust fall. Activities like sewage discharge, irrigation,
    and agricultural mechanization further enhance MNPs'' introduction into soils
    (Choi et al., 2021; Katsumi et al., 2021; Yi et al., 2021). It should be emphasized
    that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated a significant amount of masks and medical
    waste globally, constituting another important source of soil MNPs that cannot
    be neglected (Torres-Agullo et al., 2021). In essence, both human-made and natural
    processes contribute to the diverse sources of MNPs in soil, ultimately affecting
    the ecosystem''s functionality. 4.2. Environmental fate and exposure processes
    of micro- and nanoplastics in soil Soil is a crucial sink MNPs, influenced by
    the accumulation, migration, and transformation. These process within depicted
    in Fig. 3, determine how MNPs get retained in soil, biota, and ultimately move
    up the food chain, presenting potential human health risk to. Alternatively, MNPs
    may disperse into the atmosphere and water bodies. Download : Download high-res

    processes of micro- and nanoplastics in soil. 4.2.1. Adsorption and desorption
    MNPs including Polystyrene (PS), Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene (PE), effectively
    adsorb contaminants like antibiotics, heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls
    (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorine pesticides
    (i.e., Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, DDT; Hexachlorocyclohexane, HCH) from
    their ambient environment (Bank et al., 2020; Horton et al., 2017) from the surrounding
    environments due to various mechanisms like hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic
    interactions, pore filling, van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions
    (Horton et al., 2017). Several factors, including plastics properties, pollutant
    characteristics and environmental conditions (Bhagat et al., 2021; Khalid et al.,
    2021), influence this adsorption. While sorption behaviors of non-degradable MNPs
    are better understood, studies have recently suggested that degradable plastics
    might exhibit greater affinity to contaminants (Fan et al., 2021). 4.2.2. Transformation
    MNPs undergo transformations via fragmentation and degradation, primarily through
    physical, chemical, and biological processes means, as illustrated in Fig. 3.
    Ultraviolet (UV) induced chemical degradation is the dominant initial transformation
    at the soil surface, resulting in various structural changes and producing smaller
    fragments and NPs (Jin et al., 2022; Tian et al., 2022). UV exposure combined
    with irradiation forces boosts MNP fragmentation, allowing for subsequent microbial
    degradation (Amobonye et al., 2021; Ranjan et al., 2021). Some insects, such as
    yellow mealworms and earthworms, also contribute to the degradation of MNPs (Jin
    et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2014). 4.2.3. Migration and transport MNPs'' distribution
    within soil is influenced by abiotic factors, such as wind effects, soil erosion,
    and surface runoff, and biotic factors including plants, soil fauna and microbial
    activity (Xi et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2022). Soil water dynamics and plant-root
    activities affect vertical MNPs migration (Rillig et al., 2017a). Earthworms activities
    influence MNP movement, with smaller particles migrating deeper (Lwanga et al.,
    2017; Rillig et al., 2017b). Plastic particle type, size and density also influence
    the vertical movement of MNPs in soil. Moreover, soil microbes alter MNPs migration
    patterns by modifying their properties (particle size, density, and surface properties,
    etc.) and structure (He et al., 2020; He et al., 2022). This migration of MNPs
    presents potential risks of contamination to humans and ecosystem, with certain
    organisms in soil food chain influencing MNP movement (Zhu et al., 2018). 4.3.
    Negative effects of micro- and nanoplastics on soil organisms Soil organisms,
    including microorganisms and soil animals, are vital components of the soil ecosystem
    with diverse roles (Brussaard, 1997; Coleman et al., 2012; Wurst et al., 2012).
    MNPs have been found to negatively affect soil organisms through toxicity, physical
    damage, biological disruption, and soil properties alterations. MNPs not only
    release toxic substances harmful to microorganisms and worms but also affect their
    growth, reproduction, and overall health. Changes induced by MNPs in soil environment
    further affect nutrient cycling, plant growth, and overall soil health, as illustrated
    in Fig. 4 (Liu et al., 2023). Download : Download high-res image (249KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Conceptual illustration depicting the potential
    effects of soil micro- and nanoplastics pollution on soil organisms (microbiota
    and fauna) from Liu et al. (2023). 4.3.1. Physical and chemical effects MNPs present
    various physical challenges to soil organisms, including ingestion by soil invertebrates,
    leading to internal blockages and organ damage (Cheng et al., 2021; Dong et al.,
    2021). They modify soil structure and nutrient availability, and reduce oxygen
    and water availability, disrupt microbial activity and nutrient cycling (Dong
    et al., 2021). Chemical effects arise from MNPs'' additives that might leach,
    presenting environmental hazards (Gudeta et al., 2023; Khalid et al., 2021), and
    their ability to accumulate pollutants like heavy metals and organic chemicals.
    NPs, with their increased reactivity and mobility, pose higher potential toxicity
    than MPs. They can influence soil structure and microbial activity (Kim et al.,
    2023; Vaccari et al., 2022) and act as carriers of diseases and invasive species.
    MNPs provide a substrate for microorganisms carrying plant pathogens, enabling
    the spread of plant diseases (Gkoutselis et al., 2021). They can also transport
    invasive species, like insect eggs or seeds, over long distances, leading to the
    establishment of new populations in previously unaffected areas. Summing up, MNPs
    present varied threats to soil health, including physical, chemical, and nano-level
    impacts, coupled with disease spread and invasive species. Their influence on
    ecosystems is a rising concern, warranting further research. 4.3.2. Ecotoxicity
    effects MNPs harm a range of soil fauna, including earthworms, nematodes, and
    mites (Chae and An, 2018; Huerta Lwanga et al., 2017). Soil fauna can ingest MNPs,
    leading to toxicity effects. MNPs may accumulate in food chains, inducing toxic
    impacts on organisms across various trophic levels (Rillig, 2012). Most research
    has concentrated on earthworms, revealing decreased survival and organic matter
    processing abilities (Yao et al., 2020; Zeb et al., 2020). Earthworms exposed
    to MNPs exhibit reduced growth, weight, and increased mortality (Lwanga et al.,
    2016; Boots, 2022). Large PE MPs inflict both pathological and immune damage on
    these earthworms (Rodriguez-Seijo et al., 2017). Smaller MNP degradation products
    can be ingested more easily by fauna, affecting their ecological functions (Ding
    et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). When combined with other pollutants, MNPs can
    intensify toxicity and shift soil microbe communities (Mao et al., 2022), though
    some findings show no marked combined impacts (Gaylor et al., 2013). A holistic
    understanding of MNPs'' effects on soil fauna is crucial, factoring in diverse
    environmental and biological components (Ding et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2020).
    Current studies, mostly laboratory-based, might not represent real-world scenarios
    (Wang et al., 2022). Future research should focus on the combined ecological impact
    of MNPs. Soil microorganisms are essential in the transformation and cycling of
    soil nutrients (Machado et al., 2018). MNPs influence enzyme activity, microbial
    biomass, and community diversity. The duration of plastics in the soil alters
    microbial community patterns (Fan et al., 2022; Zang et al., 2020). Specific MNP
    types can modify bacterial communities and soil properties, impacting essential
    functions like nitrogen and carbon cycling (Li et al., 2022). MNPs can favor certain
    microbes over others, changing microbial dynamics and critical ecological processes
    (Gao et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2021). These plastics can also
    intensify soil CO2 emissions and modify bacterial community structures, but their
    effect on eukaryotic communities is less pronounced (Gao et al., 2021; Li et al.,
    2023). They influence denitrification processes and can boost certain fungi, which
    affects phosphorus cycling (Chen et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021). 5. Methods
    to link micro- and nanoplastics impacts to damage on species diversity, functional
    diversity, and soil ecosystem services To evaluate the impact of MNPs on soil
    ecosystems within the LCA framework, it is necessary to establish a linkage between
    the effects of MNPs and the resulting damage on species diversity, functional
    diversity, and soil ES. The adverse consequences of MNPs on soil ecosystems, when
    overlooked, can cause a ripple effect. Such cascading effects have the potential
    to disturb not only the biophysical elements but also influence socio-economic
    components, considering how deeply human communities are intertwined with these
    ecosystems. The urgency to understand these connections spurred the advent of
    the cascade modeling concept (Brink et al., 2016; Haines-Young and Potschin, 2010;
    Liu et al., 2020; Rugani et al., 2019). Originally, the cascade model was conceptualized
    to elucidate the connections between ecological structures, functional processes,
    and the ensuing benefits and values for humans (Haines-Young and Potschin, 2010;
    Maes et al., 2012). It has since evolved to provide a spatially explicit quantitative
    assessment of ecosystems, including the services and benefits they offer (Costanza
    et al., 2017; Spangenberg et al., 2014). Furthermore, researchers have refined
    and expanded the model for better application to socio-economic processes that
    result in changes to ecosystem structures, or for integration into broader causal
    frameworks like the Driving-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework (Bakshi
    et al., 2015; Burkhard et al., 2014; Ramos-Quintana et al., 2018). The DPSIR-framework
    analyses the causal links between human and environmental processes, encapsulating
    Driving force, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response (Miranda et al., 2020; Ta
    and Babel, 2023). For soil MNPs, the driving force encompasses increased global
    plastic usage and inadequate waste handling. This leads to the pressure of plastic
    accumulation in terrestrial areas. As plastics break down, they create a state
    where soils are saturated with MNPs, which both interact with and modify soil
    properties. This results in impacts like altered microbial activity, soil health
    decline, and MNPs acting as pollutant carriers, even infiltrating food chains
    through organisms like earthworms. Addressing these effects requires responses
    like better waste management, anti-single-use plastic policies, research on MNPs
    degradation, and public awareness. Noteworthy, while the framework does not specifically
    target “damage”, its “impact” pathway approach relates to various environmental
    consequences. The evidence on the presence of MNPs in various terrestrial habitats
    and their potential toxicity and other effects has accentuated the need to integrate
    them into existing ecological models. Without a robust representation of MNPs
    in these models, we risk underestimating their potential impacts on soil biodiversity
    and the cascading effects on ecosystem services. Emerging literature accentuates
    the demand for a more comprehensive, dynamic, non-linear model to decode the intricate
    interplay between ES and human well-being (Costanza et al., 2017; Othoniel et
    al., 2016; Othoniel et al., 2019; Weidema et al., 2018). Such a paradigm ought
    to excel at distinguishing between services and benefits. It should valorize the
    multifaceted functions of ecosystems while deciphering the entangled matrix of
    ecosystem functions and their relationships to human well-being (Costanza et al.,
    2017). This enhanced cascade model shares numerous similarities with the causal
    model employed in LCA and is proposed to link LCIA impact pathways to damage modeling
    for assessing ES (Brink et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2020; Rugani et al., 2019).
    Ideally, such framework for linking impact pathways to damage on ES encompasses
    the full spectrum of impact category indicators used in LCA, their target beneficiaries,
    their interconnectedness at the conservation area level, and their spatial and
    temporal variability. While the existing cascade model already links several impact
    categories to ecosystem services in LCA, impacts from MNP emissions to soil are
    currently not considered. In the following sections, we will explore the requirements
    and potential approaches to connect MNP-induced effects to soil ecosystem service
    degradation within the LCA framework. 5.1. Linking soil micro- and nanoplastics
    related effects to damage on species diversity A holistic assessment of MNPs-related
    damage on species diversity necessitates leveraging innovative, robust, and methodologically
    rigorous techniques. The TITAN (Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis) is one such
    promising approach tailored to quantify the effects of environmental stressors,
    including MNPs on soil ES diversity (King and Baker, 2014). Fundamentally, TITAN
    is anchored on identifying and harnessing the potential of indicator taxa — organisms
    that are inherently sensitive to specific environmental perturbations. The abundance
    of these taxa can serve as an effective proxy for gauging overall species diversity.
    Implementing TITAN offers a quantifiable metric of the damage to soil ES diversity
    caused by the MNPs. The TITAN method is suitable for translating predicted effects,
    such as physical and ecotoxicological effects of MNPs, into quantitative measures
    of damage to species diversity (Oginah et al., 2023). TITAN is a statistical approach
    that identifies a threshold level of stress at which there is a significant decrease
    in the abundance of sensitive indicator taxa, which are selected based on their
    known sensitivity to the stressor in question. The difference in the abundance
    of indicator taxa above and below the threshold level is used as a measure of
    the impact of the stressor on species diversity. Beyond TITAN, a range of analytical
    techniques can be used to link MNPs'' organism effects to damage on species loss
    in soil ecosystems. Quantile Regression can be an effective tool for understanding
    the relationship between MNPs effects and species loss (Cade and Noon, 2003; Chen
    et al., 2021). It captures the entire distribution of responses, allowing for
    a more comprehensive understanding of the potential impact on species diversity.
    Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD) is another statistical method that could
    be used to understand the relationship between MNPs effects and species loss (Proctor,
    2019; Song et al., 2022; Sørensen et al., 2020). SSDs estimate the variation in
    sensitivity to a particular stressor (e.g., MNPs) across a range of species, thereby
    being able to capture different effect types. The output can provide information
    on the proportion of species likely to be affected at different levels of exposure
    to MNPs (Mehinto et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023). Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB)
    models can simulate the uptake, internal distribution, and effects of MNPs on
    the physiology of individual organisms, thus linking toxicological effects to
    population-level impacts (Catarino et al., 2022; Kashkooli et al., 2020). This
    can then be extrapolated to potential species loss. Finally, another potential
    approach is DNA metabarcoding to quantify changes in soil microbial community
    diversity in response to MNPs (Nelms et al., 2019; Santaella and Plancot, 2020).
    This approach involves analyzing the DNA of soil microorganisms to identify the
    different species present and can provide information about the changes in microbial
    community structure and diversity caused by the MNPs. 5.2. Linking species loss
    to damage on soil functional diversity Assessing the damage to functional diversity
    caused by MNPs impacts on soil ecosystems can be done by using the trait-based
    approach (Chelinho et al., 2014; Oginah et al., 2023). This approach focuses on
    the traits of the species present in the ecosystem and their contributions to
    ecosystem functioning (Mason and De Bello, 2013). For instance, consider nitrogen
    fixation, a pivotal functional trait executed by specific species in the soil
    ecosystem. If MNPs negatively influence the abundance or activity of nitrogen-fixing
    organisms, the implications span various dimensions. This can result in diminished
    soil fertility, hampering plant growth, and eventually affecting ecosystem services
    like crop yield. Within LCA, such reductions in ecosystem services would equate
    to an enlarged environmental footprint for crop production, given the need for
    supplementary synthetic fertilizers. Moreover, organisms such as earthworms, instrumental
    in organic matter decomposition and soil aeration, can serve as another benchmark.
    Their traits, like burrowing behavior, influence water infiltration and soil structure.
    A MNPs-induced decline in earthworm populations or alterations in their behavior
    could hence disturb water regulation functions and the soil''s capacity to nurture
    plant life. In LCA terms, a decline in earthworm activity due to MNP emissions
    will lead to damage on ecosystem services, such as water regulation in soil. The
    initial step in this approach is to pinpoint the functional traits of species
    crucial for the ES provided by the soil ecosystem, such as the ability of a species
    to fix nitrogen or decompose organic matter. Subsequently, the trait-based approach
    assesses the prospective loss of functional diversity attributable to MNPs'' varied
    impacts on soil species. This is achieved by calculating the functional richness
    and evenness of the species within the ecosystem. Functional richness refers to
    the number of different functional traits present in the ecosystem, while functional
    evenness refers to the evenness of the distribution of these traits among the
    species (Mason and De Bello, 2013; Villéger et al., 2008). A decrease in either
    functional richness or functional evenness can indicate a loss of functional diversity.
    To quantify the damage to functional diversity, the trait-based approach can be
    combined with a weighting method that assigns a value to each functional trait
    based on its importance for the provision of ES (de Souza et al., 2013). This
    can allow for a more accurate assessment of the various types MNPs effects on
    the functions provided by the soil ecosystem. To quantify the damage to functional
    diversity resulting from species diversity loss, one approach is to simulate the
    removal of species from the ecosystem and assess the resulting change in functional
    diversity (Echeverri et al., 2020). This can be done using mathematical models
    or experimental manipulations in the field or laboratory experiments. Another
    alternative is to scrutinize how species diversity shifts relevant ecosystem functions,
    for instance, nutrient cycling or soil structuring, followed by quantifying the
    damage to functional diversity (Brussaard, 1997; Trivedi et al., 2012). This can
    be done by measuring changes in functional diversity metrics following experimental
    manipulations or modeling the impact of species loss on ecosystem functions (Lazarova
    et al., 2021). Incorporating the trait-based approach into LCA''s damage assessment
    for MNPs is possible by leveraging midpoint or endpoint indicators (Antón et al.,
    2016; Sala and Goralczyk, 2013). Blending trait-based evaluation with Species
    Sensitivity Distributions (SSDs) provides a method to predict species loss risk
    from MNPs. By using SSDs in conjunction with trait-based studies, we can identify
    species with critical functional traits that are at the highest risk. Integrating
    this information into an LCA can help shed light on potential long-term impacts,
    specifically in terms of functional loss within the soil ecosystem. 5.3. Linking
    functional diversity loss to damage on soil ecosystem services Understanding the
    potential damage of MNPs on soil ES requires a bridge between the loss of functional
    diversity and the consequential damages on soil ES. Incorporating ES assessments
    into LCA brings about a comprehensive perspective on this relationship (Sun et
    al., 2021; Vaccari et al., 2022). By quantifying the provision of soil ES, such
    as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and water regulation, studies can determine
    how changes in soil biodiversity and function may affect soil ES. Such studies
    could help identify, which ES are most vulnerable to the impacts of MNPs, and
    which management strategies may be most effective in minimizing related ED damage.
    ES assessments can therefore help link the impacts of MNPs on soil ecosystem species
    and functional diversity to damage on soil ES (Adhikari and Hartemink, 2016).
    To integrate soil ES assessments into LCA, it is necessary to identify the links
    between soil ecosystem species and functional diversity on the one hand and the
    provision of ES on the other hand. A practical illustration lies in the role of
    diverse soil organisms for nutrient cycling. These organisms, from the smallest
    bacteria to larger fauna like earthworms, influence the breakdown and cycling
    of organic and inorganic materials. Disruptions caused by MNPs can affect these
    processes. If beneficial microbes responsible for nitrogen fixation are reduced
    due to MNPs, the downstream impact might be a decline in soil fertility, necessitating
    increased fertilizer use with all its associated negative ecosystem service implications.
    To translate functional loss to ES damage, a variety of approaches can be used
    as a starting point. (1) Functional trait-based approach focuses on linking functional
    traits of species with ES (Waldén et al., 2023; Weiss and Ray, 2019). In this
    approach, key functional traits associated with specific ES are identified to
    quantify the impact of functional loss on those services. For instance, some fungi
    facilitate plant root absorption through mycorrhizal associations. The degradation
    of these fungi due to MNPs can result in plants having diminished access to essential
    nutrients. (2) Ecological network-based approaches focus on the relationships
    between species and their interactions within an ecosystem. By understanding the
    interconnectedness of species within ecosystems, we can visualize the cascading
    consequences of functional diversity loss (Felipe-Lucia et al., 2021; Windsor
    et al., 2021). Consider soil mites, which feed on detritus, aiding decomposition.
    A decline in these mites might affect larger predator populations and the overall
    rate of decomposition, thereby influencing soil organic matter levels and carbon
    storage capacities. (3) Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) are graphical models that
    can be used to represent complex causal relationships between variables. BBNs
    can be applied to link functional loss to ES and estimate the probability of damage
    to specific services (Ouyang et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2021). For instance, BBNs
    could model how a decline in soil fauna responsible for pore creation might affect
    soil water retention, aeration, and, in turn, plant health and productivity. 6.
    Challenges for practical implementation Assessing MNPs'' damage on soil ES demands
    an integration of laboratory studies with field data at various levels. Typically,
    ecotoxicology employs field-derived ecological concepts and laboratory toxicity
    assessments. A synthesis of these methods offers a nuanced understanding of chemical-related
    impacts of MNPs, factoring in their degradation, soil interactions, and potential
    to absorb other pollutants (Hu et al., 2022; Imhof et al., 2017). MNPs'' diverse
    properties, such as size and polymer type, further influence varied ecological
    outcomes. It is essential to analyze both individual species reactions and broader
    ecological consequences to enable linking MNP effects to soil ES damage. Effective
    assessment necessitates aligning predicted damages with field observations to
    validate LCA models (Fantke et al., 2018; Henderson et al., 2011; Oginah et al.,
    2023). For instance, while lab results might indicate MNPs stunting soil bacteria
    growth, field studies could show faster degradation, reducing impact (Fan et al.,
    2022; Li et al., 2022). MNPs can alter soil attributes like water retention and
    porosity and hint at continuous ecological threats. The study of MNPs'' bioavailability
    and soil distribution is vital. They can serve as pollutant carriers, and combined
    with other contaminants, shape soil biology (He et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2023).
    Factors like soil type and climate further determine MNPs risks across different
    terrains. Comprehensive insights into MNPs effects on soil demand a strategic
    fusion of ecological theory, fieldwork, and lab research, which all needs to be
    aligned with the boundary conditions of LCA, thereby constituting a considerable
    practical challenge. Effective ES management hinges on insights from biomonitoring
    and rigorous analysis. Monitoring MNPs in soil and their implications for ES degradation
    is hence vital. MNPs differ in type, size, and source, making them distinct from
    common pollutants (Liu et al., 2023). Their origin, be it agricultural runoff
    or urban wastewater, impacts their degradation and interaction with soils. Their
    degradation might release other pollutants, altering soil functions, highlighting
    the complexity of MNPs pollution. This constitutes a practical challenge, since
    it requires considering interactions across different impact categories in LCA
    (e.g. ecotoxicity and MNP impacts). In addition to stressor interactions, different
    stressors exhibit spatial and temporal variations; hence, an integrated approach
    becomes indispensable for a complete understanding of their collective influence.
    For example, research conducted in the Mediterranean highlighted that areas exposed
    to both pesticides and MNPs experienced a significant drop in soil fertility,
    suggesting a combined stressor effect assessment (Llorca et al., 2020). The environmental
    science realm is rife with challenges, particularly in ES monitoring. These range
    from combining diverse ES monitoring data to incorporating various socio-cultural
    values and knowledge (Liu et al., 2020; Rugani et al., 2019). For MNPs, unique
    challenges arise due to their varied properties. These characteristics often call
    for specialized monitoring and analytical tools. Overcoming these challenges requires
    improving data collection methods, refining analytical frameworks, and crafting
    tools that merge ES monitoring data with evolving stressor trends. The ultimate
    goal is to develop an LCA framework that fully addresses direct and indirect impacts
    of soil MNPs on ES. Therefore, our task is to continuously optimize the model
    to ultimately achieve the desired value between the theoretical damage prediction
    and the actual damage. 7. Conclusion and future research In the present study,
    we provide an overview of sources, fate and effects of MNPs on soil ecosystems,
    and propose different approaches for linking these effects to damage on soil species
    loss, functional diversity loss and ultimately to damage on soil ES for inclusion
    into the LCA framework. Current methods do not include MNPs and their related
    effects on soil ecosystem quality, such as damage on species diversity, functional
    diversity, and soil ES. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate new approaches
    within this framework to encompass MNPs-related damages. To link the effects of
    MNPs to soil species loss, several methods have been introduced. Threshold Indicator
    Taxa Analysis (TITAN), for example, identifies shifts in species distribution
    across environmental gradients, offering a comprehensive view of potential MNPs
    impacts. Other techniques such as Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD), Dynamic
    Energy Budget (DEB) models, and DNA metabarcoding provide different yet effective
    ways of understanding the relationship between MNPs effects and soil species loss.
    To assess the damage on soil functional diversity, a trait-based approach has
    been suggested. This focuses on the traits of the species present in the ecosystem
    and their contributions to ecosystem functioning, giving insights into potential
    loss of functional diversity due to MNPs. Finally, to link functional loss to
    damage on soil ES, a variety of approaches can be applied, including functional
    trait-based approaches, ecological network-based approaches, and Bayesian Belief
    Networks (BBNs). These techniques allow to represent complex causal relationships
    and estimate the probability of damage on specific soil ES. In summary, these
    approaches help linking MNP effects on soil species to related loss of soil ES
    for integration into the LCA framework. However, more research is needed to refine
    these methods and consistently combine them for use in LCA damage modeling. Funding

    Introduction Over the decades, increasing demands for supplying agri-food products
    have influenced agriculture patterns worldwide. Additionally, changing human lifestyles
    and increasing human population and urbanization have directly impacted the production
    and consumption of agri-food products [1]. The financial value of strategic plants
    and the scarcity of natural resources for agriculture have spurred plant producers
    and agriculture researchers to discover new ways to overcome the food crisis.
    Thus far, various modern technologies and efficient strategies have been implemented
    in the agri-food sectors [2]. However, reports indicate a need to find and/or
    improve the current agri-food tools to overcome the hunger problem and demand-supply
    gap by increasing production efficiency. Therefore, on a global scale, “the question
    of whether the scientific discoveries are able to sustainably and effectively
    feed everyone by 2050” is the primary concern regarding the future of the agri-food
    sector [1]. The implementation of digital technology can provide “versatile technology
    that will revolutionize food production in most critical areas around the world”
    [2]. Generally, Digital Agriculture (DA) is currently understood as using modern
    tools, data monitoring and analytics, and data-driven solutions in agriculture
    to improve and/or optimize farming systems, increase crop quality and yield, reduce
    waste, and manage pest and disease pressure [2]. By using DA, agricultural producers,
    and researchers are able to use information and communication technology (ICT)
    by collecting data, which are achieved from satellites, sensors, connected objects,
    smartphones, storage, and data transfer protocols (3G/4G/5G coverage, low-speed
    terrestrial or satellite networks, clouds) [3]. DA could be used across different
    agricultural ecosystems and at different levels of its production, whether on
    the farm (optimization of cropping operations), in support services (new agricultural
    advisory services based on automatically collected data), or more broadly at the
    territorial level (water management). It also can be used in the value chain (enhancing
    inputs such as seeds, improving harmony between production and the market) [3].
    The general understanding of what is meant by “digital technologies in agriculture”
    is primarily focused on expanding data gathered “in the field,” the contribution
    of artificial intelligence, connectivity protocols and automation [1]. Many operations,
    including planning farming operations, financing, reporting, monitoring numerous
    operations, and performances, are simplified by digital technologies. Digital
    technologies in agriculture have been deployed in various segments of farming,
    including farm equipmentation, animal handling facilities, agronomy, and communication
    [4]. Interestingly, DA widely covers diverse aspects of the agri-food sector from
    basic application, like using mobile device to get technical assistance and monitoring
    the farms, to a more comprehensive implementation, like using satellites and Global
    Positioning System (GPS) to predict the weather conditions and mapping the fields
    [1]. At the advanced level, specialized Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS)
    and Farm Management Software (FMS) help producers to control their farm or nursery
    from a centralized platform, including tasks such as crop rotation, planning,
    inventory management, and financial tracking [3]. The first history of DA dates
    back to the mid-20th century, when computers were used to analyze data of farms
    and satellites were used to monitor crop growth. Nonetheless, DA finds its own
    way in the 21st century, when the powerful and affordable computing systems and
    technologies, including GPS, smartphone, drones, and sensors, are becoming increasingly
    available [5]. Precision Agriculture (PA), which was developed in early 1900s,
    is the basis of DA. More recently, new technologies of DA, such as Internet of
    Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain were introduced [1].
    IoT, AI, wireless sensors, robotics, mechanization, sensors and data analytics
    have the potential to boost productivity, improve the utilization of water and
    other farm resources. These technologies can aid in fostering resilience and long-term
    sustainability in crop and livestock production [5]. Based on the current understanding
    of DA implementation and its potential applications across various food production
    systems, the following research questions are relevant: • Which digital technologies
    have been used in agriculture? • How these technologies can affect the agricultural
    industry in regards to sustainable food production? • What is the adoption status
    of these technologies? • What are the challenges of deploying these technologies
    in agriculture? The objective of this review is to elaborate the potential advantages
    and obstacles of using DA, and to clarify ways in which these technologies can
    be leveraged to support agricultural sustainability, efficiency, and productivity.
    To the best of the author’s knowledge, this review is a comprehensive documentation
    of DA as a potentially reliable approach to improve agricultural outcomes and
    to address global agri-food issues. 1.1. Research motivation This review was motivated
    by the potential benefits of digital technologies in agricultural systems, which
    can provide strategic solutions for improving the efficiency and effectiveness
    of farm production. In addition, digital transformation can enable the adoption
    of modern food production techniques such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics,
    including vertical farming, which can help address food scarcity challenges. However,
    there are issues and constraints related to this transformation that must be carefully
    addressed in order to fully realize the potential of DA, as highlighted elsewhere
    [6]. Several studies have addressed the emerging trends in DA by providing some
    description on the significant applications, benefits, and associated research
    challenges of smart farming [7,8]. These studies were limited to explaining the
    general aspects while focusing on one or a few digital technologies aimed at improving
    the performance of agricultural supply chains, promoting sustainable agronomy
    through precision agriculture, or suggesting a smart farming framework. Therefore,
    it is crucial to examine the evolution of DA from various viewpoints to encourage
    discussion in the field. This study aims to elaborate the potential advantages
    and obstacles of using DA, and to clarify ways in which these modern technologies
    can be leveraged to support agricultural sustainability, efficiency, and productivity.
    2. Material and method The following sources of information was used for literature
    review: Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/), Springer Link (http://link.springer.com/),
    Science Direct (http://www.sciencedirect.com/) and the National Agricultural Library
    (https://www.nal.usda.gov/). Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) was
    also used to extend the research for potentially useful publications that were
    not indexed in the sources mentioned above. This study chose to use the most prominent
    databases of academic research, such as Scopus, due to their extensive coverage
    of global and local academic journals and their reliability. These databases were
    selected because they contain essential metadata and allow for easy data extraction
    compared to other databases. Scopus was searched using the following key search
    terms: “Digital Agriculture, Precision Technologies, Digital Farming, Precision
    Agriculture, Intelligent Agriculture, Digital Agriculture Technologies.” Each
    search was documented in a table containing the keyword used, the source, and
    the number of publications found. An initial review was conducted to identify
    potentially relevant publications for this research by evaluating the abstracts
    of each publication. The decision to include or exclude a publication as potentially
    relevant was made after each review. After the partial review of potentially relevant
    publications, an in-depth analysis of each publication was conducted by reading
    the entirety of the publication to determine whether it addressed any of the research
    questions. The relevant information from the publication was extracted where applicable.
    2.1. Threats to validity The methodology used in this study followed the standard
    procedures of a literature review, which involves a search strategy, record extraction,
    and result reporting [9]. This type of review is suitable as a research method
    when the aim is to provide a broad view of research in various fields on a particular
    subject and to analyze research advancements or compare research on the topic
    across disciplines. This approach can be applied to investigate themes, theoretical
    perspectives, or particular issues within a research field or discipline, aiming
    to identify new ideas or approaches as well as theoretical perspectives or issues.
    A good review must be independently replicable, which gives them greater scientific
    value [10]. The presented literature review is susceptible to threats to validity
    because the search was conducted using only five online repositories. It is possible
    that additional relevant publications may have been missed by not exploring other
    sources. If this literature review is replicated, it is possible that different
    publications may be found. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps, but it is highly unlikely
    that the overall findings would change. 3. The challenges facing agriculture The
    agri-food sector is experiencing increased pressure due to worldwide shifts from
    traditional to modern lifestyle. Additionally, there is a growing population that
    has to be fed, even though their diets are shifting [7]. In order to ensure the
    long-term sustainability of agriculture, it is imperative that the industry expedites
    its adaptation process and develops innovative crop and livestock production methods
    that effectively minimize environmental impact, promote animal welfare, contribute
    to the sequestration of carbon dioxide, and preserve biodiversity [3]. Over the
    past seven decades, the dynamics of agriculture has consistently favoured intensification
    and specialization. Globalization has made the widespread phenomena of competitive
    pricing in the agricultural industry (farm sector) much more severe. In essence,
    farmers are victims of unequal power dynamics between parties with disparate,
    if not opposing, interests [6]. Additionally, farming is practiced in regions
    that, in many cases, have evolved into specializations, creating imbalances. As
    a result of the specialization and interdependence, there is a significant increase
    in complexity, which magnifies instability, increases the probability of failure,
    and ultimately poses a significant barrier to change [2]. Therefore, it is essential
    to implement strategies as soon as possible to enhance production methods and
    approaches to structure the agri-food system so as to strengthen its resilience
    [1]. 4. Digital agriculture (DA) DA is based on the following five levers for
    action which, when mobilized together, lead to innovation: (1) abundance of data
    due to the development of sensors (from nano sensors to satellites) and facilitated
    communication and storage, (2) increase in computing power, which makes it possible
    to implement artificial intelligence and new modelling methods, (3) connectivity
    and information exchange interfaces, (4) knowledge management and engineering
    for decision support in agriculture, (5) automation, control and robotics [5,11].
    In the past three decades, farming practices have been revolutionized by the widespread
    adoption of technologies such as automation and control systems, data analysis
    tools, web-based and mobile applications. The primary goal of these innovations
    has been to maximize productivity of agricultural lands and resources. From the
    early 1990s until 2010, growers monitored their field and identified deficiencies
    using GPS, satellite maps, and local sensing equipment such as data loggers. This
    approach is known as Precision Agriculture (PA). Moving forward, PA and smart
    farming practices have evolved toward digitalization with the emergence of Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), long-range wireless sensors, and IoT devices. This has
    offered new hope to increase the sustainability of food supply. The fundamental
    components of digital farming are depicted in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res
    image (414KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The fundamental components
    of DA from cell phone to blockchain technology. To identify problems and enhance
    agricultural productivity by effectively utilizing available resources, PA uses
    the available data collected from various sources, such as satellite photos and
    mobile sensing platforms. Simultaneously, smart and digital agriculture utilize
    robotics, wireless systems, mobile applications, and IoT-based automation to detect,
    assess, and control the condition of the soil, water supplies, and weather fluctuations
    on croplands to increase field efficiency and minimize expenses [11,12]. In the
    field of automation, the deployment of smart irrigation, water loss control, and
    continuous identification of soil nutrient levels in remote places have all benefited
    from wireless sensors and IoT devices [12]. The adoption and use of DA technologies
    vary across different regions of the world, and there are several factors that
    influence this variation. In Europe, there is a relatively high level of adoption
    and use of DA technologies, particularly in countries with a high level of agricultural
    production, such as France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The European Union has
    also been promoting the adoption of PA practices through its Common Agricultural
    Policy [13]. In North and South America, the adoption and use of DA technologies
    are relatively high, and the United States, Brazil, and Canada being among the
    leading countries in this area. These countries have been early adopters of PA
    practices and have been investing in research and development of new technologies.
    In Asia, the adoption and use of DA technologies are growing rapidly, and China
    being a leading country in this area. The Chinese government has been promoting
    the use of PA technologies to increase crop yields and reduce environmental impact
    [14]. In Africa, the adoption and use of DA technologies are still relatively
    low, due to various factors such as limited access to technology and infrastructure,
    and low levels of investment in research and development. However, there are initiatives
    aimed at promoting the use of DA technologies in Africa, such as the African Agricultural
    Technology Foundation''s Digital Agriculture Services project [15]. Overall, the
    adoption and use of DA technologies vary across different regions of the world,
    and are influenced by factors such as access to technology and infrastructure,
    government policies and initiatives, and investment in research and development
    [16]. 5. Significant technological advancements in digital agriculture Because
    of digitalization, farmers can now manage their farms and agricultural operations
    more efficiently from a distance. Agriculture sensors, actuators, and gadgets
    will all be connected in the near future by IoT, enabling automatic real-time
    interaction, controlling, and decision-making. This can reduce the need for human
    labour, which in turn, increases productivity and revenue [17]. Cloud-based farm
    management tools like SmartFarm and Agrivi strive to combine this information
    from various sources and incorporate it into their decision-making processes.
    The combination of these factors provides farmers with data for dynamic management
    planning that was previously only available to large-scale megafirms [18]. 5.1.
    UAV-based remote sensing UAV-based remote sensing is considered as the application
    of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to collect images and information of the earth''s
    surface (in this report referring to agriculture field) from above [17]. This
    technology is equipped with different types of sensors such as radar, lidar, thermal,
    multispectral, hyperspectral sensors which facilitate the capture of high-resolution
    data from water bodies, vegetation, land, and man-made as well as natural features.
    Compared to photos obtained from satellites, the datasets collected by drones
    that are integrated with high-resolution imaging sensors can provide farmers with
    higher precision. UAV-based remote sensing is primarily used to observe soil characteristics
    and crop stress [19]. This generates valuable information that can be used to
    develop decision support systems for smart pest control, fertilization, and irrigation
    management. There is a wide variety of UAVs, for instance fixed wing (planes),
    single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system (vertical take-off and landing), and
    multirotor (drone) [20]. Among these, drones (multi-rotor technology) which are
    lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become
    increasingly popular in the agriculture sector due to their mechanical simplicity
    in comparison to helicopters, which rely on a much more sophisticated plate control
    mechanism [21]. Remote sensing is a powerful tool for digital agriculture which
    can be used for a variety of purposes. For example, large-scale data can be used
    in forecasting the impacts of undesirable weather and pathogenicity of disease
    on crop productivities in the field [19]. Farmers can combine remote sensing with
    other technology including big data analysis, IoT, and AI to improve farm management
    [22]. All the detailed data and forecasting can help farmers to enhance productivity
    by reducing crop stress through effective pest and disease as well as nutrient
    management. The high accuracy of remote sensing-based sensor devices has made
    it possible to obtain more detailed information about specific soil-based compounds,
    molecular interactions, crop stress and crop biophysical or biochemical characteristics
    [23]. Such plant growth related measurements allow for determining nutritional
    requirements of plants, nutrient content in soil, plant water demands and needs
    for weed control [24]. In addition, remote sensing not only improve productivity,
    but also protect the environment, since it can allow farmers to find a better
    match between crop growth and water/nutrient uptake. There are many discussion
    regarding the traditional use of remote sensing, but very little discussion about
    its combination with other technology [20,25]. Recently, UAV-based remote sensing
    has become more popular due to the advances in sensor system and availability
    of low-cost drones which makes it a valuable agriculture tool for plant-producers,
    scientists, and researchers. Table 1 shows the pros and cons of UAV based remote
    sensing in agriculture. Table 1. Advantage and disadvantages of UAV-based remote
    sensing. Advantage Disadvantage Improved crop monitoring: It can provide detailed
    information on crop health, growth patterns, and stress, allowing farmers to detect
    issues early and take corrective action. Battery and flight time: At the moment,
    lithium-ion batteries are being used because their capacity is larger than that
    of conventional batteries. But an increase in battery capacity increases the drone
    weight. Better resource management: It can help farmers optimize the use of resources
    such as water and fertilizer, reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact.
    Technical complexity: The data generated by remote sensing technology can be complex,
    which can make it difficult for farmers to interpret and apply to their operations.
    Increased productivity: By providing detailed and timely information, it can help
    farmers make more informed decisions, leading to higher yields and improved profitability.
    Data quality: The quality of remote sensing data can vary, depending on the equipment
    used and the conditions in which the data was collected, which can lead to uncertainty
    around the effectiveness of the technology. Efficient land use: it can help farmers
    identify areas of their land that are underutilized or overused, allowing them
    to make better use of their resources and maximize productivity. Limited access:
    Limited access to reliable and high-quality data can be a challenge for many farmers,
    particularly in developing countries or remote areas. Accurate mapping: It can
    provide accurate mapping of agricultural land, allowing farmers to better understand
    their land and make more informed decisions about planting, harvesting, and other
    activities. Privacy and security concerns: There may be concerns around the privacy
    and security of data collected through remote sensing technology, particularly
    as it relates to sensitive information Notwithstanding the advancement in the
    UAV-based remote sensing application, the adoption UAV-based remote sensing into
    the agri-food sector is slow due to issues such as [20]: • Cost: The cost of acquiring
    and maintaining remote sensing equipment can be high, which can be a barrier for
    many farmers. • Complexity: The data generated by remote sensing technology can
    be complex, which can make it difficult for farmers to interpret and apply to
    their operations. • Standardization: There is a lack of standardization for data
    collection and analysis, which can make it difficult to compare data across different
    sources or technologies. • Data quality: The quality of remote sensing data can
    vary, depending on the equipment used and the conditions in which the data was
    collected. This can lead to uncertainty around the effectiveness of the technology.
    • Access: Limited access to reliable and high-quality data and internet connection
    can be a challenge for many farmers, particularly in developing countries or remote
    areas. • Privacy and security: There are concerns around the privacy and security
    of data collected through remote sensing technology, particularly as it relates
    to sensitive information such as crop yields and land use. Overall, these issues
    have slowed the adoption of remote sensing technology in agriculture, but efforts
    are underway to address these challenges and increase the adoption of this technology.
    5.2. Agricultural production with the use of electronic tractors and robots The
    development of electrical systems is mainly driven by the ever-increasing demands
    for reducing noise and exhaust emissions. Robots and electrical tractors that
    run on renewable energy sources are being used in DA as modern machinery for boosting
    sustainability and minimizing inputs prices. By using such machinery or robots,
    numerous farms can produce electricity using renewable sources [26]. The European
    Innovation Partnership Agricultural Productivity and Sustainability''s SunBot
    project is an illustration of this strategy in action (EIP-AGRI). The project,
    which started in late 2018, has focused on automating a solar-powered tractor
    and mower for efficient utilization of resources in berry orchards [27]. The goal
    of the project is to automate an emission-free electrical tractor, which eventually
    will lead to improved harvest quality. The proposal calls for a universal two-wheel
    drive orchard tractor with an all-electric drive that run on lithium iron phosphate
    (LiPO4) batteries and has a driving output of between 20 and 30 kW. The e-tractor
    must be equipped with front and rear three-point linkage C1 in order to support
    implements, as well as an electrically driven double-blade mower (400 kg/10 kW)
    which is supported by an AEF electric power connector [26]. Electrical tractors
    and mobile robots are replacing human drivers and human operators with artificial
    intelligence, which is contributing to the digital transformation of agriculture.
    Despite this potential contribution, these technologies are still in the experimental
    phase of their development and are pending implementation on a commercial or large
    operational scale [28]. In agricultural production, a collaborative system between
    robots and humans can be employed to achieve common goals. This co-robotic approach
    has proven to be efficient in weed management, resulting in a reduction of more
    than 50% in human labor requirements [29]. The use of robotics can significantly
    enhance the effectiveness of repetitive tasks [30]. In response to the COVID-19
    pandemic, certain businesses have transitioned from utilizing human cutters to
    utilizing robots in order to facilitate social distancing measures. This transition
    has the potential to not only decrease labor costs, but also improve efficiency
    and accuracy in agri-food operations [31]. There are significant obstacles that
    hinder the full utilization of robotics in the agricultural industry. The current
    prototypes and commercially available platforms are restricted to carrying out
    specific tasks, and their adaptability to different crops or environments is questionable
    [32]. Moreover, the agricultural robotics industry faces numerous challenges related
    to interoperability and standardization, including communication between different
    platforms and safety concerns. These obstacles pose significant barriers to progress.
    It is imperative to broaden the scope of robotic capabilities beyond laboratory
    and greenhouse environments to outdoor settings, where they can sense and operate
    effectively in harsh and unpredictable conditions [31]. Regardless of the technical
    barriers, there is considerable scepticism related to social, economic, and ethical
    challenges in agricultural robotics. Labor shift from repetitive tasks to high-skilled
    engineering jobs and the imbalanced adoption of agri-technologies by farmers is
    expected to create social implications. Advanced intelligence and decision-making
    capabilities of robots results in debates about moral aspects and, overall, who
    has the responsibility for these actions [27]. In addition, the high cost of advanced
    technologies and the need for resources and infrastructure to implement robotics
    in the field will present significant feasibility challenges to the widespread
    adoption of agricultural robotics. However, as the industry moves towards an era
    of intelligent systems, robotic platforms will become an essential component of
    agricultural operations [29]. The agricultural robotic platform has the ability
    to automate some practices in outdoor and indoor farms - including seeding, watering,
    fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring and phenotyping [33]. The agricultural
    robots use a combination of emerging technologies such as computer vision, wireless
    sensor networks, satellite navigation systems, AI, cloud computing and IoT, thereby
    enhance the productivity and quality of agricultural products [34]. 5.3. Automated
    processes using wireless sensing and IoT An IoT-based automation system comprises
    sensor nodes, several repeaters, and receivers that are interconnected across
    the field to increase the productivity and profitability of digital agriculture
    through a better understanding of the interactions between soil, crop, and weather
    [31]. Data access is limited in a wireless monitoring system because the receiver
    node saves data on a local host. In contrast, the receiver node in IoT-based monitoring
    systems uploads data to a web server so that any client device connected to the
    internet may access it [35]. Measurements obtained from a multitude of wireless
    sensors are input into a traditional Decision Support System (DSS) or crop growth
    model, powered by AI algorithms, through the utilization of internet connections
    and cloud-based streaming systems in large-scale agriculture, with the end goal
    of maximising both production efficiency and profitability [36]. IoT gadgets have
    shown to be useful for enhancing agricultural resource management and boosting
    output sustainability [35,36]. Fig. 2a represents field measurement and data collection
    using wireless sensor networks and devices, and Fig. 2b demonstrates IoT monitoring
    and cloud-based data analysis. The range of the distance between the sender and
    the monitoring device in wireless sensor networks is usually between 1-m to 100
    km. However, this distance becomes unlimited when using IoT and cloud-based data
    analysis. Download : Download high-res image (401KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. A) Schematic demonstration of field measurement and data collection
    using a wireless sensor network and B) IoT monitoring and cloud-based data analysis.
    To ensure continuous data collection, large-scale farms require careful consideration
    of factors such as number of sensor nodes, repeater sites, power usage, operating
    frequencies, and distance between transmitters and receivers [37]. Developing
    an IoT architecture and successfully implementing its transmitters and receivers
    in the field can be intrinsically challenging. Most gateways utilize single-board
    computers equipped with ARM processors, while most software applications are intended
    for x86 processors. This results in compatibility concerns and unexpected behaviours
    [38]. WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), LoRaWAN, SigFox, NB-IoT, and LTE are the
    radio protocols that have the most widespread application for IoT [[35], [36],
    [37]]. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending on the
    environment where they are deployed. These include Terrestrial Wireless Sensor
    Networks (TWSNs), Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs), Underwater Wireless
    Sensor Networks (UWSNs), Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs), and Mobile
    Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) [39]. In agricultural applications, TWSN and
    UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground surface,
    consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second variant of
    WSNs is its underground counterpart, WUSNs, where sensor nodes are planted inside
    the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through the soil,
    whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [37,40]. Therefore, the network
    requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of the limited
    communication radius. Many research articles are available in the literature that
    discuss the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor applications, such as
    irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental monitoring.
    These studies have focused on developing WSN architectures that are simplified,
    low cost, energy-efficient and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with
    WSNs need further attention, such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant
    architecture, and interoperability [37,40]. Adoption of automated processes using
    wireless sensing and IoT in DA comes with several challenges. Many farmers may
    not be aware of the potential benefits of wireless sensing and IoT devices, making
    them unwilling to invest in these technologies [41]. Wireless sensing and IoT
    devices may be complex and require specialized knowledge to set up and use effectively,
    which can be a barrier for many farmers who may not have access to technical support.
    Additionally, some farmers may not have access to the necessary infrastructure,
    such as reliable internet connectivity, to support wireless sensing and IoT devices
    [42]. There may be concerns around the privacy and security of data collected
    through wireless sensing and IoT devices, particularly as it relates to sensitive
    information such as crop yields and land use. Furthermore, regulatory barriers
    may also prevent the use of wireless sensing and IoT devices in agriculture, such
    as restrictions on the use of certain frequencies for wireless communication [43].
    Addressing these adoption issues is critical to ensure effective and widespread
    adoption of automated processes using wireless sensing and IoT in DA. This can
    be achieved through increased awareness and education, addressing cost and infrastructure
    challenges, ensuring data privacy and security, and establishing standard protocols
    and regulations to support interoperability and data compatibility [44]. 5.4.
    Big data analysis Rapid developments in IoT and cloud computing technologies have
    increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to as Big
    Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured, and unstructured),
    and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [45]. The process of examining
    this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer
    preferences, and other useful information is referred to as big data analytics
    (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according to five dimensions defined
    by five Vs, which are: (1) Value, (2) Volume, (3) Velocity (4) Variety, and (5)
    Veracity [46]. The paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new,
    but the trend of this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring
    a revolutionary change in the food supply chain and food security through increased
    production. Agricultural BD is usually generated from various sectors and stages
    in agriculture, which can be collected either from agricultural fields through
    ground sensors, aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and
    sensors; from governmental bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from
    private organizations through online web services; from farmers in the form of
    knowledge through surveys; or from social media [47]. The data can be environmental
    (weather, climate, moisture level), biological (e.g. plant pest/disease, plant
    nutrient), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural domain and differs in
    volume, velocity, and formats. The gathered data is stored in a computer database
    and processed by computer algorithms to build relational assessments of seed characteristics,
    weather patterns, soil properties, marketing and trade operations, consumer behavior,
    and inventory management [45,48]. A summary of the tools and services used to
    decipher BD in agriculture is given in Table 2. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, Modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques. Particularly,
    machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, pre-processing,
    and visualization [45]. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in the existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various
    agricultural issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and
    indoor vertical farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops
    in outdoor and indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to
    assist farmers in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for
    policymakers to assist them in decision making regarding the sustainability of
    the physical ecosystem. Most systems are still in the prototype stage [49]. Table

    adoption of BDA in DA has been steadily increasing in recent years. Many agricultural
    companies and organizations are now using advanced analytics and machine learning
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets, such as weather
    data, soil samples, and satellite imagery. These insights can help farmers make
    more informed decisions about crop management, such as when to plant, irrigate,
    and harvest, as well as identify potential issues such as disease outbreaks and
    yield losses. They can also support a more efficient use of resources, such as
    water, fertilizer, and energy [50,51]. 5.5. Artificial intelligence in agriculture
    Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the development of theory and computer systems
    capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception
    and decision-making [50]. Combined with cloud computing, IoT, and BD, AI, particularly
    in the facets of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), is regarded as
    one of the key drivers behind the digitization of agriculture. These technologies
    have the potential to enhance crop production and improve real-time monitoring,
    harvesting, processing, and marketing [51]. Several intelligent agricultural systems
    have been developed using ML and DL algorithms to detect weeds, predict yield,
    or identify plant disease. These systems are discussed in the next two sub-sections.
    5.5.1. ML in agriculture ML techniques are broadly classified into three categories:
    1) supervised learning (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression,
    Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression),
    2) unsupervised learning (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection,
    neural networks (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis,
    a-priori algorithm and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement
    learning (Markov decision process and Q learning) [52]. ML techniques and algorithms
    are implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease and
    weed detection, rainfall prediction, soil physico-chemical estimation (type, moisture
    content, temperature, pH, nutrients), water management, fertilizer optimization
    and livestock production and management [53]. Crop yield prediction is a widely
    explored area of research. Linear regression, neural network, random forest, and
    support vector machine are the most used ML techniques in the domain of smart
    farming. Some of the use cases are still in the research phase with no reported
    commercial usage. AI techniques are sparsely explored in greenhouse and indoor
    vertical farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics.
    Considering cyber-security and data privacy challenges, new approaches such as
    federated learning and privacy-preserving methods are being developed to enable
    DA [54]. These approaches build ML models from local parameters without sharing
    private data samples, thus mitigating security issues. 5.5.2. DL in agriculture
    DL represents the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (classification
    and prediction) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [55]. Different DL algorithms include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks, RecurrentNeural Networks (RNNs), Generative
    Adversarial Networks (GANs), Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs), Multi Layer
    Perceptrons (MLPs), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Self Organizing Maps (SOMs),
    Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), and autoencoders.
    A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures, and training
    platforms is available at various sources [56]. In the agriculture sector, DL
    algorithms are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key variables, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions including the detection
    of diseases, pests, and the identification of plant species [57]. Computer vision
    is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction in
    recent years due to the surge in CNNs. Among DL algorithms, CNNs or Convet and
    its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural applications. The variants
    of CNNs are region-based CNNs (RCNNs), FastRCNNs, Faster-RCNNs, YOLO, and Mask-RCNNs,
    among which the first four are mostly used to solve object detection problems.
    Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation problems
    [57]. Few studies have also used other DL techniques. Most DL models are trained
    using image data sets while a few models are trained using sensor data gathered
    from fields. This shows that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets.
    Though DL has the potential to enable DA, most systems are still in the developmental
    phase. Additionally, the new challenges imposed by cyber-security and privacy
    issues require optimization of current DL and computer vision approaches [58].
    5.5.3. Decision Support System (DSS) in agriculture A DSS can be defined as a
    smart system that supports decision-making for specific demands and problems by
    providing operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful
    information extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models.
    DSS can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and
    knowledge-driven [59]. Due to the progression of DA, the amount of farming data
    has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical knowledge,
    platforms like agricultural DSS are required to make precise evidence-based decisions
    regarding farm operation and facility layout [60]. Over the past few years, agricultural
    DSS has gained much attention within the agriculture sector. A number of DSSs
    have been developed focusing on a variety of farming components, such as farm
    management, water management, and environmental management. Most agricultural
    DSSs, however, do not consider expert knowledge, which is highly valuable as it
    facilitates development of systems as per user needs. Other issues with some of
    the agricultural DSSs are complex Graphical User Interface (GUI) and inadequate
    re-planning components, lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and lack of
    ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting that
    the majority of agricultural DSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems. Application
    of agricultural DSSs for indoor soilless farming is still very much unexploited
    [61]. 5.5.4. Agricultural Cyber Physical System (CPS) As a key technology enabling
    DA, a CPS refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes
    with communication networks and computing infrastructures [62]. There are three
    standard CPS reference architecture models, namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and
    their detailed description is available in Ref. [63]. Among these, the 5C is a
    well-known reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists
    of five levels which are presented in Table 3. Table 3. 5C architecture for cyber-physical
    systems (adapted from [64]). Implementation space Levels of 5C Function Physical
    space Configuration level Self-configuration for resilience, self- configuration
    for variations, self-optimization for disturbance. Cyber space Cognitive level
    Integrated simulation, decision making support system, collaborative diagnostic
    and visualization. Cyber level Cyber-twin and big data Modeling. Data to information
    conversion level Algorithm for smart data analytics, and performance forecast.
    Physical level Smart connection level Sensor networks, data acquisition. CPS benefits
    from a variety of existing technologies such as agent systems, IoT, cloud computing,
    augmented reality, BD and ML [65]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability,
    autonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security improvements. Agricultural
    CPSs use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [66]. Agricultural CPSs collect
    essential and appropriate data about climate, soil and crops, with high accuracy
    and use it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health. Most of the CPSs developed
    for agriculture, are still at the conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are
    conducted for outdoor farms, with only a few works published related to soil-based
    greenhouse systems. No study is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming
    systems. CPSs has attracted significant research interest because of their promising
    applications across different domains. Deploying CPS models in real-life applications
    is still a challenge as it requires proper hardware and software [67]. 6. Blockchain
    technology in agriculture 6.1. From ICT to blockchain Blockchain is a distributed
    transaction ledger. It allows members of the community to exchange data with other
    services without the involvement of a third party and trace the transaction. Rather
    than keeping the information on a single server, it is distributed among multiple
    servers, making it extremely difficult to change or remove the records. The tamper-proof
    features a trademark, as well as a method that assures all data entered into the
    blockchain is authentic and encourages community confidence [68]. Peer-to-peer
    networks are used to distribute and maintain blockchains. It can exist without
    a centralized authority or server controlling it since it is a distributed ledger,
    and its data quality can be maintained using database replication and computational
    trust. To create a safe and valid distributed consensus, not all distributed ledgers
    use a chain of blocks. The blockchain’s structure distinguishes it from other
    types of distributed ledgers. On a blockchain, data is gathered together and encrypted
    [69]. A distributed ledger is a database that spans several nodes or computing
    devices. Each node duplicates and saves a copy of the ledger. Each network member’s
    node updates itself independently. The cost of trust is significantly reduced
    by distributed ledger technology. Distributed ledger designs and structures can
    help us reduce our reliance on banks, governments, attorneys, notaries, and regulatory
    compliance officials [70]. Blockchain technology can monitor food provenance and
    help build trustworthy food supply chains and boost customer trust. It enables
    using data-based technologies easier to make farming a more smart way to store
    data confidentially. It can also allow for prompt payment between stakeholders,
    which can be triggered by changes in the blockchain data in conjunction with smart
    contracts [71]. 6.2. Potential blockchain technology benefits for agriculture
    Through blockchain technology, peer-to-peer transactions can be completed openly
    and without a third party, such as a bank (in the case of cryptocurrencies) or
    a middleman in the agriculture sector. As a result of the elimination of the need
    for a central authority, trust is now provided to peer-to-peer architecture and
    cryptography rather than an authority. It contributes to restoring trust between
    producers and customers, lowering transaction costs in the agri-food sector [70].
    A robust method of tracking transactions between anonymous individuals is provided
    by blockchain technology. Thus, fraud and errors can be found immediately. Furthermore,
    incorporating smart contracts also enables the real-time reporting of issues [72].
    Due to the complexity of the agri-food system, this helps solve the problem of
    tracing goods along the extensive supply chain. Thus, blockchain technology enables
    the elimination food quality and safety issues, that are of great concern to consumers,
    and other stakeholders [73]. Blockchain technology increases transparency among
    all relevant parties and enables the gathering of reliable and verifiable data.
    From its production to its demise, the value chain of a product can be recorded
    using blockchain technology. The development of data-driven infrastructure and
    insurance solutions that make farming smarter and less susceptible, depends heavily
    on reliable data on the farming process [70]. 6.3. Applications of blockchain
    technology in the agriculture and food sector Four categories of blockchain applications
    in the agricultural and food industry are covered in this section: (1) agricultural
    insurance, (2) smart farming, (3) food supply chain, and (4) transactions of agricultural
    products [74]. These categories are discussed in the following sections. 6.3.1.
    Agricultural insurance Index insurances are increasingly valuable as a tool for
    risk management, especially for farmers who have a keen interest in mitigating
    basic risks. The index insurance industry may benefit from blockchain technology
    in two ways. Firstly, a smart contract can ensure that payments are issued on
    schedule and without human intervention, such as when weather conditions are met
    [75]. Secondly, an intelligent oracle may automate the integration of meteorological
    data and other sources of data, such as plant growth data or data acquired by
    farm machinery, to better mitigate basic risks and streamline index computation
    and pay out. It has been shown that smart contracts that employ smart oracles
    to include external data can be pretty valuable in different crypto-economic contexts
    [76]. The initial prototypes of smart index insurance contracts have already been
    developed or released. For instance, the Swiss business Etherisc1, which uses
    blockchain technology, offers decentralized crop insurance with payments based
    on weather data in decentralized insurance protocol tokens as a native currency
    [70]. Aside from the benefits of decentralized insurance based on smart contracts
    that make automated pay outs, the applicability of cryptocurrency pay outs to
    compensate farmers must be demonstrated in the field. Furthermore, farmers in
    underdeveloped countries may lack access to the necessary infrastructure to participate
    in a decentralized blockchain-based insurance scheme. As a first option, Etherisc,
    for example, suggests that third-party companies provide payment channels and
    integrations that eliminate the end customer''s need to possess cryptocurrency
    [77]. 6.3.2. Smart agriculture Agri-food systems are supported by data and information
    on natural resources that sustain all types of farming. Fig. 3 illustrates the
    flow of data and information, the flow of products from input to output through
    various value-adding stages, and the flow of money from output to input. It shows
    how and what type of blockchain is used on different kind of platforms (Ethereum
    or Hyperledger) along with various consensus mechanism might be suitable to collecting
    data and information at different stages in crop agri-food systems [78]. Download

    Data and information flow along the food value chain. Multiple actors and stakeholders
    produce and manage data and information depending on their capacities and needs.
    Utilizing ICT, IoT, and a variety of contemporary data collection and analysis
    tools, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), sensors, and machine learning,
    are critical components of smart agriculture [79]. Creating a comprehensive security
    system that facilitates data use and management is a crucial component of smart
    agriculture. Traditional methods manage data in a centralized manner and are vulnerable
    to cyber-attacks, inaccurate data, data distortion and misuse. For instance, data
    from environmental monitoring is typically managed by centralized government agencies
    with special interests. They can influence decisions made in relation to data.
    Environmental monitoring data, for example, is generally collected by centralized
    government entities with special interests. They can influence data-driven decision-making
    [80]. Throughout the entire value-added process, from seed to sale, of producing
    an agricultural product, various actors and stakeholders generate data and information
    that can be stored using blockchain technology. This guarantees that all recorded
    data are immutable and that the data and information are transparent to all parties
    involved. Unlike methods, which rely on “security of obscurity,” blockchain technology
    produces security through decentralization [79]. The combination of IoT and blockchain
    technology has led to the development and implementation of several smart agricultural
    schemes. For example, a lightweight blockchain-based architecture for smart greenhouse
    farms is proposed by Refs. [42,81]. IoT sensors in greenhouses function as a local,
    private blockchain that the owner centrally controls. A smart agricultural framework
    based on blockchain and IoT is proposed by Lin [78] for large scale implementation.
    The primary purpose of the platform is to build trust between parties utilizing
    blockchain. Agents involved in the selling of plantation products can access the
    data recorded in the blockchain using mobile devices. For application at the local
    and regional levels, Ref. [82] suggest a blockchain-based ICT e-agriculture model
    in which each actor has a piece of real-time water quality data kept in the blockchain.
    Additionally, farm organizations are utilizing blockchain to improve their farming
    practises and make it smarter. For example, Taiwan''s agricultural irrigation
    groups use blockchain to store data collectively and improve communication with
    the public [81,83]. 6.3.3. Food supply chain From the producers'' standpoint,
    using blockchain technology fosters a connection of trust with customers and enhances
    the reputation of their products by clearly presenting specific product information
    in the blockchain. Companies can boost their competitiveness by effectively achieving
    the value of their products. As a result, it would be challenging for sellers
    of low-quality products and frauds to maintain their market presence. It would
    be necessary for all sellers to raise the calibre of their goods across the board
    in the agriculture and food industries. Blockchain provides customers with accurate
    and trustworthy information on the production and distribution of food. It addresses
    customers'' concerns about food safety, quality, and environmental friendliness
    [84,85]. The use of blockchain enables consumer-producer interactions since customers
    can comprehend the food production process in greater depth and with greater convenience.
    Lowering trade barriers helps customers feel more secure in the products they
    buy and the integrity of the food supply chain. From the regulatory authorities''
    point of view, blockchain facilitates the dissemination of credible and accurate
    data necessary for the implementation of well-informed and efficient rules [86].
    The whole history of a product, from its point of origin to the end of the sale,
    can be recorded and verified using blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed
    ledger technology that can safely and permanently store information gathered at
    the source of a product''s development, such as the genetic makeup of cattle or
    the levels of pesticides on grain or vegetables. Any participant in the product''s
    supply chain can review and verify such data. The availability of such data can
    aid in identifying illegal activities, such as the 2013 horse meat scandal in
    Europe [87,88]. Having blockchain in place ensures that all manufacturing, processing,
    storing, and distribution data is authentic and cannot be tampered with. Using
    blockchain technology and IoT, Caro [71] proposed a system that can track the
    product''s origins and destination. In October 2016, Wal-Mart, Tsinghua University,
    and IBM piloted the hyper ledger blockchain system''s applicability to food supply
    chain management by investigating the Chinese pig supply chain and the United
    States mango supply chain. Together with Australia Post, Alibaba investigated
    blockchain technology in March 2017 to prevent food tampering [70]. Wal-Mart,
    Nestlé, Dole, and Golden Food were among the ten top food and fast-moving consumer
    goods (FMCG) suppliers in the world when they partnered with IBM in August 2017
    to integrate blockchain into their supply chain to detect food supplier fraud
    efficiently. IBM''s blockchain platform is used in this partnership to aid food
    producers in increasing supply chain transparency and reducing food safety risks
    [87]. 6.3.4. E-commerce of agricultural products There are significant issues
    that need to be addressed in the e-commerce and trading of agricultural products.
    According to the research conducted by Oliveira [89], customers who have a high
    level of confidence in institutions, in general, are more likely to purchase online.
    However, consumers may have trouble verifying and trusting the basic information
    about agricultural products. In the meantime, the most significant difficulties
    for online retailers, especially those operating in developing countries, are
    cash on delivery and logistics service [90]. In addition, e-commerce stores have
    to deal with time-consuming small orders with a wide range of items, which results
    in significant operational costs for businesses [91]. Many of these issues may
    find satisfactory solutions through blockchain technology, viz. (1) information
    security: To fulfil authentication needs, blockchain technology offers private
    key encryption, a powerful technique for addressing this need [92]. As a result,
    it can reliably connect data from all phases of agricultural production, from
    planting to harvesting. (2) Supply chain management: By reducing the cost of sending
    and receiving signals between nodes, blockchain technology has the potential to
    make supply chain management more efficient than the current monitoring method
    [93]. Each part of the supply chain, from the manufacturer, the point of origin,
    the shipping company, the final destination, multimodal transport, storage facility,
    and the last mile, represents a “block” of information that can be tracked individually
    or as a whole for greater transparency, control, efficiency, and reliability [94].
    (3) Payment methods: Blockchain technology enables a digital payment system with
    no transaction fees. Additionally, using cryptocurrencies in the trade of agricultural
    goods will significantly reduce transaction costs [49]. (4) Consumer confidence:
    Blockchain''s distributed accounting system is time-stamped through a decentralized
    process, making all data stored therein verifiable and irreversible. Freed from
    the threat of counterfeit goods, consumers will once again have faith in the convenience
    and security of online shopping [89,90]. (5) Reduce farmers'' costs: Households
    create a wide variety of agricultural goods. Traditional e-commerce is unable
    to or unwilling to serve these customers because of their low transaction volume
    and limited scale. Therefore, they are cut off from the market. Blockchain technology
    has the potential to significantly lower transaction costs and reintroduce them
    to the market [95]. 6.4. Challenges for blockchain implementation The preceding
    discussion indicates the increasing adoption of blockchain technology in the supply
    chain industry. While blockchains and distributed ledger technology hold the potential
    to resolve most of the challenges, it is crucial to note that they are not a cure-all
    [96], particularly considering the critical and often high-pressure nature of
    the agricultural supply chain. Additionally, the implementation of blockchain
    technology must consider a range of societal, technical, and financial factors
    [97]. Burke [98] observes the potential societal impact of blockchain implementation
    in the agriculture industry, noting that this sector has its own set of unwritten
    rules and delicate relationships that should not be disrupted. The agri-food supply
    chain is highly intricate and hesitant to adopt blockchain technology due to following
    reasons. • The low level of technological knowledge among many stakeholders; •
    The complex transformations that products undergo throughout the chain; • The
    heterogeneous roles and businesses of the many stakeholders involved; • The fact
    that the food supply chain is distributed over large geographical areas, sometimes
    spanning different continents, which creates interoperability and deployment obstacles.
    Issues related to data management, particularly data ownership and data retention
    within the blockchain, are also important and have to be carefully considered
    [99]. From a technical viewpoint, while blockchains can serve as unalterable ledgers,
    there is no assurance of the precision of data entered by sensors or individuals.
    Therefore, if a sensor fails to operate correctly, the information recorded on
    the blockchain is not reliable [100]. Generally, there are challenges in monitoring,
    integrating, and evaluating specific types of data within the agricultural supply
    chain. For instance, obtaining and analyzing environmental data using objective
    methods is challenging [101]. The selection of the proper type (public, private,
    permissioned) of blockchain and its implementation can also be an associated issue.
    A large number of research works use public blockchains, and the same applies
    to some of the commercial products (e.g. IBM food trust). However, The performance
    trade-offs of using public blockchains in agri-food supply chains are not always
    fully discussed. This is because transactions involving multiple actors require
    a significant amount of time and computing power to be completed on a public blockchain
    [97]. Careful selection of blockchain type is crucial as it can impact the traceability
    performance. From a financial aspect, the adoption of blockchain technology in
    the food supply chain may enhance transparency and consumer trust, but it comes
    with significant expenses. Companies are required to invest a substantial amount
    of money and time to train all the relevant personnel and acquire the necessary
    equipment [102]. Conversely, the expenses associated with such investments in
    terms of time and money can be substantial and may surpass the product''s cost,
    both in the short and long run. Behnke [103] studied the challenges of blockchain
    applications in the agriculture and pointed eighteenboundary conditions for food
    traceability, five of which directly applied to blockchain technology. Accordingly,
    a significant number of the bottlenecks are related to regulatory requirements,
    internal supply chain and production processes, which require significant organizational
    changes in order to support the full benefits of traceability. In the same context,
    Kamilaris [104] analyzed the impact of blockchain on the agriculture supply chain.
    The main challenges highlighted include the accessibility to blockchain technology,
    governance and sustainability, policy and regulation, technical challenges and
    design decisions that must be taken, as well as bridging the digital gap between
    developed and developing countries in order to achieve successful. Kamilaris [104]
    also referred to the important role of governments to lead the way by digitalizing
    public administration. 7. Impact of DA solutions on food security DA has been
    identified by scientists as one of the “ten best innovations for adaptation in
    agriculture” that can help achieve food security in the face of climate change
    while delivering co-benefits for environmental sustainability, nutrition, and
    livelihoods [105]. Using big data approaches to solve development problems more
    quickly, better, and at a larger scale, this technology can enhance the impact
    of agricultural development [106]. Some countries, notably Australia, are stepping
    up efforts to assure long-term food security through precision-based digital farming
    or smart farming [107]. Incorporating interactive technology and data analytics
    into farming can boost precision, production, and profitability for small-scale
    farmers and help them better prepare for climate change while reducing future
    adverse environmental effects [108]. Integrating additional data and digital tools
    into agriculture to increase productivity has various potential advantages, such
    as increased input efficiency and enhancement of value derived from farming a
    unit of land, thus reducing the motivation to convert more land for agricultural
    use (a major contributor to the emission of greenhouse gas). Digitalization allows
    for new links with markets, which helps improve value chain coordination and reduce
    post-harvest loss by using productivity-related data for analysis and sustainability
    planning at the landscape or system level [109]. As a result of various digital
    technologies in the food system, customers and producers are now more educated
    and engaged, and farms are becoming more intelligent. Blockchain technology for
    value chain traceability and various configurations of precision and digital agriculture
    are just a few examples of the cutting-edge tools available today [106]. The following
    are the most significant benefits of precision and digital agriculture: • Improvement
    of the food system''s performance, which is critical to achieving sustainable
    development goals, • Improvement of food system outcomes in rural and urban locations
    by way of expanding digital opportunities for all, including farmers and agribusinesses,
    • Farmers and growers can minimize their costs, make informed decisions, and have
    better access to information, knowledge, and markets [106,110,111]. 8. Challenges
    in the development of digital technology in the agricultural industry The advancement
    of digital technology in society and the changes it brings are inherently accompanied
    by a set of hazards intrinsic to the situation. Similar concerns are being expressed
    about whether DA can live up to expectations, what challenges it may pose and
    what weaknesses it would highlight in the agricultural industry [112]. It is believed
    that the advancement of digital technology in agriculture introduces some concerns,
    despite the numerous potential it provides [113]. These concerns include i) not
    meeting expectations in terms of improving the environmental friendliness of agricultural
    and food systems, ii) loss of autonomy and rising inequality and iii) maintaining
    food sovereignty. An excessively complicated food system exacerbates vulnerability,
    weakens governance, and reduces crop yields. Investigating these threats will
    allow farmers, residents, and researchers to evaluate their methods, decisions,
    and priorities so that digital technology can serve the stakeholders responsibly
    [112]. Failure to address the desire for a more ecological agriculture is the
    first danger. While advances in digital technologies have opened up new opportunities,
    some drawbacks are evident, i.e., the inability to easily switch to a different
    solution and the difficulty of implementing systematic changes to organizational
    structure which are necessary to fully realize the environmental and financial
    benefits [113]. In addition, the widespread adoption of digital interfaces between
    farmers and plants or animals, in the context of growing technologicalization
    of agricultural production, could also weaken connections to nature (especially
    the human-animal connection). Still, society today is undoubtedly looking for
    a type of agriculture that is more closely connected to the living world around
    us. The growth in equipment and processes for data collection, transport, storage,
    and computation might aggravate the environmental effect. Additionally, digital
    technology has a distinct ecological footprint that is not fully understood yet
    [114]. The social repercussions of using digital technology to accelerate industrialization
    and the concentration of production in larger and more productive farms can also
    pose potential complications. This trend carries the risk of excluding agricultural
    practices used by minority farmers with minimal productivity strength [115]. Advancement
    in robotics may lead to insecure employment in agriculture, especially for low-income
    populations of migrant workers [116]. Challenges in obtaining access to digital
    technology may also contribute to agricultural exclusion; this might be the case
    with either the individual (lack of skills) or territorial (underdeveloped digital
    infrastructure level. There is concern that farmers would be reduced to “data
    workers” as a result of digitalization, which could impact their decision-making
    autonomy (when using DSS) [117]. The shifting power dynamics between agricultural
    upstream and downstream industries is another issue that may be caused by digitalization.
    Due to the growing prevalence of upstream industries, digital technologies can
    potentially influence both the comprehension and use of production tools, resulting
    in a dependency on particular inputs of a specific kind [118]. With implications
    for sharing, governance, and the danger of subsidiary creation driven by downstream
    parties, new data technologies might alter the roles of some entities (such as
    businesses in the digital industry) across the value chain. With the emergence
    of monopolistic players and tools, digitalization of the food chain may be inevitable
    [115]. Data control is an element of digital sovereignty, and there is a possibility
    that providers of digital technology or services might take possession of information
    related to agriculture. In order to foster innovation, the exchange of agricultural
    data must be organized, and the governance of this data must be made clear [118].
    Linked items (e.g. sensors, robotics), the availability of geolocation systems,
    and the issue of avoiding piracy of agricultural data are all important factors
    that need consideration. Our food systems are extremely important and have mostly
    been unaffected up until now, making them potential targets in the future [119,120].
    The digitalization of the agriculture and food system may lead to an increase
    in the resource dependency among the various actors within the system [80]. May
    expose the in a broader sense, it is important to emphasise that agriculture,
    together with its upstream and downstream industries, comprise a complex sociotechnical
    system, and within this system, the cost of energy as a whole is increasing [121].
    It is crucial that this does not overshadow the expected advantages of digitalization.
    Digital technology advancements have the potential to magnify the dynamics of
    increasing complexity, thus it is important to prevent them from igniting a technological
    frenzy that would trap us in an uncontrollable complexity cycle [122,123]. Seizing
    the opportunities offered by digital technology for agroecology and rebalanced
    value chains while identifying and anticipating the risks also poses scientific,
    technical, economic, organizational, and political challenges [124]. We will focus
    in detail on the scientific and technological challenges and the associated human
    challenges to respond to four main types of issues for the sustainable food system:
    (i) improving collective management and incorporating the territorial level, (ii)
    improving farm management, (iii) rebalancing the value chain between upstream
    and downstream and (iv) creating and sharing data and knowledge [125,126]. 8.1.
    Providing digital tools for collective management at a regional level Three key
    areas have been identified for overcoming the obstacles linked to the use of digital
    technology for land management. 8.1.1. Measurement and monitoring on a large scale
    The ambition to make agriculture less artificial, get the most out of local assets,
    and reuse natural resources, will be determined by the capacity to take advantage
    of material flow, the potential of biological regulation, and functions beyond
    the farm (e.g., ecosystem services and land ecology). Many of the different interactions
    can only be understood through a systemic approach [127]. (i) Some characteristics,
    such as the extent to which a piece of land may be traversed, can only be understood
    on a regional scale. In contrast, others must be considered over time, such as
    the capacity for resilience and speed of recovery when faced with climatic threats.
    Therefore, if we want to employ the principles of agroecology, we must quantify
    parameters that are difficult to detect such as biodiversity, soil quality water
    quality, greenhouse gas emissions [124]. Information theory depends on the adjustment
    of sampling frequency (temporal and spatial). Systems either frequently collect
    data at varied temporal and geographical resolutions (sensor networks) or sporadically
    (non-sensor networks) through crowdsourcing or mobile applications to manage heterogeneous
    data. This results from diversity in terms of the objects observed, sensing and
    collection techniques (including crowdsourcing), stakeholders, parameters measured,
    formats (value, images, localization), and metrological properties (precision,
    frequency). Data governance is also an issue that is exacerbated in multi-source
    data systems [128,129]. 8.1.2. Data visualization Visualization methods will need
    to be revolutionized for data management at a significant regional level. Given
    its particularities, the agricultural sector has raised research questions with
    no current equivalents in the field of visualization, such as [130]: (i) Visualizing
    multi-scale, heterogeneous data, symbolic data, temporal data, variable data,
    incomplete data, quantitative data, and qualitative data depending on variations
    in structure such as mapping in a geographic information system (GIS) and imagery
    from satellites or drones. (ii) Visualizing extreme data scales from short- or
    long-range, connecting them in a fluid and clear manner, and developing suitable
    and appropriate tools for aggregation and statistics [131]. (iii) Revealing new
    information semi-automatically by comparing maps or time series data, highlighting
    symmetries, regularities, trends and correlations. (iv) Meeting contradictory
    needs such as visualizing massive data, but with mobile applications, or guiding
    users while respecting their autonomy. (v) Finding innovative ways of representing
    complex objects, dependencies or models capable of being used by individuals from
    diverse backgrounds. These questions open up new prospects for certain basic subjects,
    including the visualization of uncertainties and advanced visualization [125,132].
    Nevertheless, there has not been much discussion on issues pertaining to privacy
    and usage rights for data [131]. 8.1.3. Digital devices for participation, mediation,
    and governance The multi-actor approach is essential at a regional level and requires
    support tools. The knowledge production mode is changing, with transdisciplinary
    research requiring significant contributions from external stakeholders, which
    may be easier in the digital era [124]. In sectors operating at a regional level,
    it is increasingly common for individual and collective interests to come into
    conflict with each other [133]. New digital devices from regional engineering
    are anticipated to facilitate dialogue within the world of agriculture and with
    other regional stakeholders. 8.1.3.1. Systems for monitoring animals, plants,
    and their environment The common difficulty in farming is in ensuring that farmers
    have quick, easy-to-understand information regarding the status of their cropping
    or animal husbandry which can allow for early detection of problems and facilitate
    timely intervention. Acquisition of massive data sets has the potential to boost
    large-scale phenotyping on farms, which is essential for expanding the overall
    understanding of agroecology [133]. In the context of agroecology, one key issue
    is detecting malfunctions, with the compromise of “coverage” (the area covered
    by the detection system) versus specificity. Specific measurements (e.g., detecting
    a virus or bacteria) are complex due to the need to establish contact, cost, energy
    supply, and the issue of false alarms in livestock breeding [134]. Research on
    acquisition systems, sensors and IoT, data management systems, and associated
    digital models linked to farming could focus on [135]: (i) Creating new sensors
    while respecting constraints typical of agriculture (i.e., frugality, cost, energy
    use). In order to improve understanding of the agroecological systems, it is becoming
    increasingly clear that we must take into account the physical parameters of an
    environment and its biological parameters (animal/soil microbiota), which would
    generate needs in terms of omics methodologies. (ii) Optimize the data transfer
    mode, so that data can be transferred automatically to the processing center.
    Research aimed at building responsible digital technology for sustainable agriculture
    must absolutely incorporate (i) a comprehensive perspective on agriculture and
    the impacts of digital technology implementation, (ii) the search for cost-effectiveness
    both in terms of economics and environment, (iii) the search for resilience rather
    than economic optimization in food systems, and protection of farmers'' autonomy,
    and (iv) cybersecurity (i.e., attacks via the IoT, data hijacking, geolocation
    jamming), a topic that is all the more essential as it affects food sovereignty
    [136,137]. Table 4 summarizes the current challenges in the development of digital
    technology for agriculture. Table 4. Challenges in the development of digital

    was to describe the cutting-edge digital technologies that are being integrated
    into the agricultural industry and to forecast the future direction of DA. Upon
    extensive analysis, it can be concluded that certain technologies such as big
    data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, and cyber-physical systems have
    not been extensively studied in the agri-food domain. The high cost of implementing
    complex and advanced technologies in the agriculture sector during the early stages
    of adoption could be one of the primary reasons for this gap. The findings of
    this review also demonstrate that IoT has gained significant traction in farms.
    This is primarily attributed to the diverse range of functions that IoT offers,
    including monitoring, tracking, tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision
    agriculture. Although, IoT is a significant area of focus in DA, very few studies
    have taken into account aspects such as data security and reliability, scalability,
    and interoperability in the development of intelligent agricultural systems. Our
    analysis indicate that the majority of use cases in the agricultural sector are
    still in the prototype stage. This is likely due to the fact that agricultural
    processes involve living organisms such as animals and plants, as well as perishable
    products, which make developing systems more challenging compared to non-living
    systems. Nonetheless, agriculture has been relatively slow to adopt technological
    advancements due to the complex and multi-disciplinary nature of the industry.
    Digitalization of agricultural systems is complicated due to variation in plant
    or crop species and growth conditions. This emphasizes the necessity for significant
    research and development efforts in specific areas to guarantee successful implementation
    of DA in both developed and developing countries. The potential of blockchain
    technology to assist the agricultural industry was also examined. The application
    of blockchain technology can benefit the agricultural sector by providing immutable
    and irreversible storage of data. Moreover, blockchain technology can enhance
    credibility and contribute significantly to the sustainable agri-food industry.
    While blockchain has the potential to ensure food traceability, there are still
    several limitations to be taken into account, such as regulations, stakeholder
    relationships, data ownership, and scalability. To enhance comprehension of the
    technology and enable the creation of novel applications, it would be advantageous
    for researchers and developers to establish a comprehensive assessment model.
    The adoption of new technologies by stakeholders in the agricultural sector is
    only possible when they are made easy to use, enhances productivity, and delivers
    additional value to end users. Therefore, the implementation of new technologies
    in a traditional agricultural setting is a major challenge that should be approached
    gradually and efficiently, with the active involvement of stakeholders who are
    directly affected throughout the supply chain. The complexity of the agriculture
    ecosystem gives rise to a set of interrelated obstacles that impede the complete
    integration of digital technologies for DA implementation. Therefore, it is crucial
    to identify possible challenges to formulate strategic solutions to overcome them.
    This review aimed at examining these challenges. The various advantages that can
    encourage farmers and stakeholders to embrace the adoption of digital technologies
    in the agricultural sector were identified and compiled in Table 5. These benefits
    possess the potential to optimize farm productivity, improve product quality,
    and ultimately contribute to boosting food security. Table 5. Added value of DA.
    Benefits Explanation Improved agility Digital technologies enhance the flexibility
    and responsiveness of farm operations. By leveraging real-time monitoring and
    predictive systems, farmers or agricultural specialists can promptly respond to
    any potential changes in environmental and water conditions to protect crops from
    stress. Green process Digital platforms can enhance the efficiency of resource
    utilization by optimizing the quantity and quality of agricultural output while
    reducing the consumption of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides. Time and
    cost savings Digital technologies enable considerable time and cost savings by
    automating various operations, such as sowing, harvesting, irrigation, and regulating
    the application of pesticides or fertilizers. Asset management Digital technologies
    enable instantaneous monitoring of agricultural properties and equipment to prevent
    theft, expedite replacement of components, and carry out regular maintenance.
    Product safety The application of digital technologies ensures sufficient farm
    productivity and assures a safe and healthy supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraudulent activities related to adulteration, counterfeiting, and artificial
    enhancements. 10. Future perspectives of DA The possibility of using advanced
    technologies to improve plant production under normal and stress conditions can
    promote the development of digital farms in a scalable manner to sustain livelihood
    and increase food supply [106,110]. Although digital technology has enormous potential
    to contribute significantly to crop production and protection, the application
    of this modern technology also comes with risks, such as the lack of privacy,
    the over-concentration of service providers, exclusion and even job losses for
    specific occupations, and cyber security breaches [141,142]. Even though digital
    technologies offer numerous advantages, they should not be considered a final
    solution. The importance of other branches of plant science like plant biotechnology
    and breeding to produce new varieties or improve the defence mechanisms of available
    plant varieties against adverse condition should be considered. In addition to
    these, the role of infrastructure and the importance of investments, such as better
    roads, uninterrupted electricity, post-harvest storage facilities, and improved
    logistics for connecting farmers to markets, cannot be overstated. A more favourable
    investment climate and enhanced governments policies could boost the deployment
    of digital technologies in agriculture [106]. 11. Conclusion Modern industrial
    farms and enhanced agricultural production methods are becoming necessary due
    to the growing concern over the world''s food security crisis. The Industry Revolution
    4.0 agenda, which pioneered the proliferation of data-driven approaches, has equipped
    the agricultural sector with a wide range of creative solutions to boost agricultural
    yields, lower prices, reduce waste, and maintain process inputs. This review presents
    a comprehensive analysis of the current state of prevailing digital technologies
    in the agriculture sector. Our assessment indicate that big data and analytics,
    wireless sensor networks, and cyber-physical systems are in still the preliminary
    phase. Most use cases are in the developmental stage and have not yet reached
    the market for commercial use. Also, incorporating blockchains can prove advantageous
    for farmers by enabling the irreversible and immutable storage of data. The utilization
    of blockchain technology for securing food traceability and data storage across
    the supply chain appears to hold great promise. In addition certain challenges
    are identified, which must be carefully examined and addressed to achieve digitalization
    of the agriculture industry. This review highlights and elucidates the added value
    of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. It is envisaged that this
    review will contribute a valuable resource to the ongoing research on DA. This
    review has two primary limitations. Firstly, the literature search was restricted
    to only five online repositories, (Scopus, Springer Link, Science Direct, National
    Agricultural Library, Google Scholar). Secondly, there is a possibility that using
    additional keywords and synonyms could have resulted in the identification of
    more relevant studies for inclusion in this review. Nevertheless, in either scenario,
    the likelihood of altering the overall conclusion of this study is minimal. Additional

  description: Satellite data show the Earth has been greening and identify croplands
    in India as one of the most prominent greening hotspots. Though India’s agriculture
    has been dependent on irrigation enhancement to reduce crop water stress and increase
    production, the spatiotemporal dynamics of how irrigation influenced the satellite
    observed greenness remains unclear. Here, we use satellite-derived leaf area data
    and survey-based agricultural statistics together with results from state-of-the-art
    Land Surface Models (LSM) to investigate the role of irrigation in the greening
    of India’s croplands. We find that satellite observations provide multiple lines
    of evidence showing strong contributions of irrigation to significant greening
    during dry season and in drier environments. The national statistics support irrigation-driven
    yield enhancement and increased dry season cropping intensity. These suggest a
    continuous shift in India’s agriculture toward an irrigation-driven dry season
    cropping system and confirm the importance of land management in the greening
    phenomenon. However, the LSMs identify CO2 fertilization as a primary driver of
    greening whereas land use and management have marginal impacts on the simulated
    leaf area changes. This finding urges a closer collaboration of the modeling,
    Earth observation, and land system science communities to improve representation
    of land management in the Earth system modeling.

    satellite observations show the Earth has been greening (increasing greenness
    or green leaf area)1,2,3,4,5,6. This global scale land surface change can lead
    to significant consequences in the Earth’s energy, water, and carbon cycles5,
    and has been recognized as highly credible evidence of intensified terrestrial
    biosphere activity in response to anthropogenic climate change7. Recent studies
    attributed the satellite-observed vegetation changes to environmental drivers
    and identified CO2 fertilization, climate change, nitrogen deposition, and land
    cover/use changes (LCLUC) as underlying drivers of global greening in the order
    of contribution5,8,9,10. Despite the consensus on the potential role of CO2 fertilization
    on the observed greening, a comprehensive understanding of the satellite-observed
    vegetation changes and their associated mechanisms is still lacking and debated6,11,12.
    One of the most important but understudied drivers of global greening is human
    land use and management, especially over global croplands6. Cropland is the most
    pervasive anthropogenic biome occupying approximately 1244 Mha (about 9.5% of
    ice-free land mass) of the Earth’s land surface11. Studies based on satellite
    remote sensing have identified six global breadbaskets as greening hotspots: India,
    USA, Canada, Europe, Brazil, and sub-Saharan regions6,13,14. This prominent greening
    of croplands underscores the overlooked role of human land use and management
    in global greening research, thereby necessitating a comprehensive investigation
    into how land management practices have triggered a significant increase in leaf
    area on a large scale. Notably, special attention should be directed towards investigating
    Indian croplands, as they alone contribute to over 11% of the total net increase
    in global leaf area and these croplands exhibit the most extensive greening, encompassing
    69% of the total vegetated regions in India6. Given the challenges faced by India’s
    agricultural system due to changing climate and water resources, it becomes crucial
    to understand the underlying drivers of this cropland greening. Such understanding
    will enable us to better project future changes in Indian agriculture systems
    and consequently prepare for ensuring food security. Agriculture in India is the
    primary source of livelihood for more than 58% of India’s 1.4 billion population
    and it thus plays important roles in the social and political economy15. There
    are two dominant cropping seasons in India based on monsoon, i.e., Kharif (June–October,
    wet season) and Rabi (November–May, dry season). The Kharif season crops (e.g.,
    rice, maize, etc.) are grown with the onset of monsoon and generally require more
    water. Crops in the Rabi season (e.g., wheat, barley, etc.) are generally sown
    in winter and harvested before monsoon season. Rabi crops need cold weather for
    growth and need less water than the Kharif crops. Despite the lower water demands
    of Rabi crops, drier Rabi season without monsoon necessitates substantial water
    inputs requiring an irrigation-assisted cropping system. Irrigation stands as
    India’s most crucial land management practice in agriculture since the Green Revolution,
    serving as a tool to alleviate drought stress and thus increase crop yield and
    production16,17. Notably, the country boasts the world’s largest irrigated area18.
    This irrigation-associated crop yield enhancement can be anticipated as a key
    driver in the observed Indian cropland greening19. Yet, the spatiotemporal dynamics
    of how irrigation has changed the satellite-observed greenness as well as the
    national crop yield remains unclear. Subsequently, the degree to which land surface
    models (LSMs), which have been used for the greening attribution studies, accurately
    represent the changes in leaf area associated with human land management is not
    fully understood. In this study, we formulate and address the following research
    question: What is the role of irrigation as a human land management practice in
    the observed greening patterns in Indian croplands? We incorporate satellite remote
    sensing and survey-based Indian agriculture statistics to investigate the satellite-observed
    greening patterns and explore the underlying mechanisms. We further utilize the
    results from experiments using the state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation
    models (DGVMs) factorial simulations to attribute the leaf area changes to underlying
    drivers and examine the identified roles through comparisons to the satellite
    measurements and national statistics. Results Rapid dry season greening in India
    We use 19 years of NASA Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) data to detect changes in greenness over India’s
    croplands (Methods). During the last two decades, the annual MODIS LAI record
    shows a widespread greening (increasing) trend across Indian croplands (Fig. 1).
    The observed greening is prevalent over northwestern provinces, especially, Punjab,
    Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh (Fig. 1a). About 64.6 % of the
    Indian croplands reveal a greening trend (p < 0.1) whereas 0.9 % of the croplands
    display a browning (decreasing, p < 0.1) trend. The rate of annual LAI change
    at the national scale is estimated by 0.069 ± 0.021 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1 (p < 0.001).
    The spatial patterns of the observed increasing green leaf area in the Rabi (dry)
    and Kharif (wet or monsoon) seasons are noticeably different (Fig. 1b, c). For
    instance, central India (Madhya Pradesh) displays a strong increase of LAI (0.131 ± 0.031
    m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1) during the Rabi season whereas a weak increase of LAI (0.022 ± 0.019
    m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1) during the Kharif season. Punjab, known as the most fertile
    region in India, shows a strong greening signal in both the Rabi and Kharif seasons.
    Overall, LAI change in the Indian croplands during the Rabi season is 0.082 ± 0.021 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1
    (p < 0.001) and it is 38% greater magnitude of change compared to the Kharif season
    LAI change (0.059 ± 0.020 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1d). The observed
    greening extent of the Rabi season LAI (64.6 % of the cropland) largely overlaps
    with the patterns of annual LAI change, and it is much larger than the Kharif
    season greening (40.6% of the cropland) (Fig. 1e). Note that about 2.5 % of the
    croplands display a decreasing LAI trend during the Kharif season while only 0.9
    % of the regions exhibit declining LAI trends in the Rabi season. Our analysis
    further differentiates to what extent the seasonally varying greening in Indian
    cropland is associated with different crop types (Fig. 1f). We find that wheat
    is predominantly responsible for half of the cropland areas exhibiting the Rabi
    season greening (64.6% of total cropland area), while rice (27.1%), pulse (12.7%),
    millet (10.7%), and maize (10.3%) are associated with 61% of the Kharif season
    greening area (40.6% of total cropland area). The greening over wheat-cropped
    areas during the Rabi season consistently emerges as a strong greening region
    in terms of annual-scale LAI changes (Fig. 1a, b). These results from satellite
    observations indicate that the dry season greening is more prevalent and dominates
    overall (annual) Indian cropland greening during the last two decades. Fig. 1:

    Full size image Role of irrigation in dry season greening The role of irrigation
    in modulating leaf area changes over Indian croplands is evaluated using irrigated
    and unirrigated area maps18 (Supplementary Fig. 1). According to the irrigation
    maps, 87.8 Mha of the Indian croplands is irrigated. Indo-Gangetic Plain and foothills
    of Himalayas are the primary irrigated croplands. Over croplands across India,
    we observe distinct and different LAI seasonality over irrigated and unirrigated
    regions (Fig. 2a, b). Monthly composited MODIS LAI data reveals that irrigated
    croplands generally have double cropping systems and show higher LAIs in both
    dry (Rabi) and wet (Kharif) seasons, whereas the unirrigated (rainfed) regions
    display a single peak seasonality during the wet monsoon season indicating a primary
    cropping activity during a year. This difference in seasonality indicates an irrigation-driven
    increase in cropping intensity in Indian croplands20,21. There are other noticeable
    differences in seasonal changes of LAIs (Δ MODIS LAI in Fig. 2a, b) between areas
    irrigated and unirrigated. While we observe comparable increases of seasonal leaf
    area over both irrigated and unirrigated areas during the Kharif season, in the
    Rabi season, we find a greater degree of LAI increase over irrigated croplands
    compared to the unirrigated lands. Our time series analysis accords with these
    patterns (Fig. 2c, d). It indicates a comparable degree of LAI increase during
    the Kharif season (June–October) over both irrigated (0.066 ± 0.027 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1,
    p = 0.002) and unirrigated (0.055 ± 0.017 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1, p < 0.001) croplands.
    However, the increase of LAI in the Rabi season (November–May) is 35 % greater
    than the LAI increase in the Kharif season: irrigated (0.096 ± 0.022 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1,
    p < 0.001) and unirrigated (0.071 ± 0.024 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1, p < 0.001). Wheat
    is the most extensively irrigated crop type in India’s agriculture. About 95%
    of the total wheat cropping area has been irrigated. Our results shown in Fig.
    1f indicate that most of the greening during the Rabi season is linked to regions
    where wheat is cultivated. This independent evidence further bolsters the argument
    for irrigation-driven greening in India. Note that both irrigated and unirrigated
    croplands share similar interannual variation during dry and wet seasons suggesting
    a large-scale response of croplands to strong climate variability (e.g., 2015–16
    drought)22. Fig. 2: Changes in seasonal MODIS LAI in irrigated and unirrigated
    Indian croplands. a Seasonal variation of LAI in the irrigated Indian croplands.

    and unirrigated (red) croplands. d Same as c but for the Kharif season. Full size
    image We hypothesize that irrigated croplands are more resistant to water stress
    (or variability) so that the increases in LAI associated with irrigation are greater
    in drier regions16,17,23. We categorize croplands based on aridity levels (Supplementary
    Fig. 1a, arid, semi-arid, dry sub-humid, and humid; see Methods) to investigate
    the role of irrigation in the satellite-observed greening over Indian croplands
    (Fig. 3). We find that irrigation assisted croplands display the greatest increase
    of LAI over the arid environment where aridity value (i.e., ratio between precipitation
    and evapotranspiration) is lower than 0.2. and its degree of increasing trend
    is gradually declining in less-water-limited environments (Fig. 3a). In contrast,
    unirrigated croplands do not show statistically meaningful differences in the
    decadal LAI trends over varying aridity levels. We use the difference between
    LAI trends in irrigated and unirrigated croplands as an indicator of irrigation
    effectiveness. Our analysis confirms that irrigation is highly effective in arid
    environments. The trend estimates over the arid regions show a two times higher
    rate of LAI changes over irrigated croplands compared to unirrigated croplands.
    There are negligible trend differences observed in dry sub-humid and humid environments.
    Further analysis evaluating the dependence of LAI changes on precipitation variability
    confirms a less sensitive response of irrigated regions to rainfall variability
    compared to the unirrigated croplands. It implies a higher effectiveness of irrigation
    in promoting cropland greenness over water-limited environments. Fig. 3: Effectiveness
    of irrigation on MODIS LAI changes over different aridity levels. a Decadal LAI
    trends over irrigated (blue line) and unirrigated (red line) croplands by different
    aridity levels, i.e., arid, semi-arid, dry sub-humid, and humid. Red bar represents
    the difference in LAI trends between irrigated and unirrigated croplands. b Correlation
    coefficient estimates between LAI and precipitation at different irrigation practices
    and aridity levels. The correlation coefficient is calculated by partial-correlation
    analysis with other climate variables (temperature and solar radiation). Full
    size image Shift in Indian cropping system We further examine linkages between
    satellite remote sensing and independent survey-based Indian agriculture statistics
    to ensure the satellite-observed greening patterns and understand their underlying
    mechanisms. We first compare annual LAI to annual yield estimates (Fig. 4a). Our
    comparison indicates that historical MODIS LAI data can capture national statistics
    of annual crop yield (R2 = 0.63) conforming to the continuous increasing greenness
    and yield trends during the last two decades. This agreement supports that remote
    sensing-based national crop yield estimation is feasible and the observed spatial
    pattern of greening over the Indian croplands is valid. Indian agricultural statistics
    reveal a strong positive co-variation (Rcorr = 1.00, p < 0.001) between total
    production (36.51 ± 1.50 MT∙decade-1, p < 0.001) and yield (293.46 ± 13.05 kg∙ha-1∙decade-1,
    p < 0.001), both exhibiting an upward trend from 1960s onwards (Fig. 4b). While
    the increases in cropping area played an important role in shaping the correlation
    (Rcorr = 0.95, p < 0.001) between 1960s and 1980s, their contribution later became
    weaker (Rcorr = –0.15, p = 0.339) between 1990s and 2010s (Fig. 4c). As total
    production is a function of yield and cropping area, strong coupling between irrigation
    and yield (R2 = 0.98) indicates a significant role of irrigation in increasing
    crop yield and total crop production in India (Fig. 4d). A one percent increase
    in irrigated area is estimated to increase crop yield by 43.17 ± 0.77 kg∙ha-1.
    This strong linkage between irrigation and crop yield supports a water-driven
    crop yield enhancement in India16,24. Fig. 4: Historical changes in yield, production,

    Full size image India has maintained stable total cropping areas (~120 Mha) during
    the last five decades but contrasting changes of the relative proportions of Rabi
    and Kharif season cropping areas have been observed (Fig. 5a). In the 1960s, the
    Rabi-season cropping area was responsible for ~32% of total cropping areas in
    India. Continuous increase of the Rabi-season portion (2.77 ± 0.24 Mha∙decade-1,
    p < 0.001) reached 44% of total cropping areas in the 2010s, whereas the Kharif
    season cropping area gradually declined over time (⎯2.84 ± 0.42 Mha∙decade-1,
    p < 0.001) indicating a significant expansion of Rabi-season cropping area (2.21 ± 0.13
    %∙decade-1, p < 0.001) in India. The observed expansion of the Rabi-season cropping
    area is closely associated with the increasing irrigation practices (Fig. 5b).
    These changes lead to the significant enhancement of crop yield and total grain
    production during the Rabi-season (Fig. 5c). We find that the rate of increasing
    yield in the Rabi season (353.09 ± 13.16 kg∙ha-1∙decade-1, p < 0.001) is 45% greater
    than the rate in the Kharif season (242.09 ± 12.360 kg∙ha-1∙decade-1, p < 0.001).
    It is worth noting that recent total production in the Rabi season surpasses Kharif’s
    total production (Fig. 5d). This is a noticeable change because total grain production
    during the Rabi season was only half of the Kharif season production in the 1960s.

    irrigation practice. a Changes in total areas of Rabi (yellow bar) and Kharif

    in Rabi (red) and Kharif (blue) season total production. Full size image Contrasting
    crop-specific changes in cropping areas and irrigation practices are observed
    in India (Supplementary Table 3). For instance, the cropping area of wheat (Rabi
    season crop) has increased by 0.26 Mha∙decade-1, whereas the aerial extents of
    nutrient cereals and jowar (Kharif season crop) have decreased by –0.47 and –0.27
    Mha∙decade-1, respectively. Though we see diminished cropping areas in some crop
    types, a significant increase in crop yield together with tight association with
    growing irrigation practices is prevalent across all major crop types in India
    (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Earth system models under-represent irrigation-driven
    greening in India In addition to the first-order investigation, our multivariate
    statistical analysis supports the primary role of irrigation in the historical
    increase of crop yield in India (Fig. 6a). We find that 638.8 ± 203.2 kg∙ha-1
    of the crop yield increase is attributable to the growing irrigation practice,
    while CO2 fertilization and fertilizer use are responsible for 198.6 ± 160.8 kg∙ha-1
    and 162.6 ± 226.4 kg∙ha-1 increase, respectively. Maximum temperature is identified
    as a negative stressor (–159.6 ± 56.1 kg∙ha-1), suggesting that recent warming
    and extreme heat events could result in a significant crop yield reduction25,26.
    The effectiveness of irrigation on crop yield enhancement is higher in drier regions
    compared to wetter environments confirming the MODIS-based sensitivity analysis
    presented in Fig. 3 (Fig. 6b). This varying level of irrigation effectiveness
    is also observable in a temperature gradient, i.e., the expanded irrigation on
    hotter regions has promoted greater yield increase compared to cooler regions.
    Fig. 6: Drivers of historical crop yield changes in India. a Total effect size
    of irrigation, fertilizer use, CO2, precipitation, radiation, and maximum temperature
    on the observed changes in historical crop yield. b Interaction of irrigation
    and climate conditions on crop yield (left: precipitation, right: maximum temperature).
    Note that we use the 1985−2017 period of the data for this analysis due to the
    shorter period of fertilizer use record. Full size image We further analyze the
    simulation results from the dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) that participated
    in the project named \"Trends and drivers of the regional-scale sources and sinks
    of carbon dioxide\" (TRENDY)27. Our examination aims to assess how well the state-of-art
    land surface models capture the observed dry season greening in India and how
    they attribute the LAI changes to different underlying drivers, i.e., CO2 fertilization,
    climate change, and LCLUC (Fig. 6). This analysis identifies three discernable
    differences between observations (satellite and national statistics) and model
    simulations. First, the irrigation-driven double cropping system (dual peaks,
    Fig. 2a) is not properly reproduced by TRENDY DGVMs (Fig. 7a). Second, the simulated
    annual LAI changes (mean ± std of models: 0.203 ± 0.145 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1) in
    India during the MODIS era (2000–2017) are two times smaller than the observed
    MODIS LAI change (0.069 ± 0.021 m2 ∙ m-2∙decade-1, p < 0.001) though inter-model
    variations exist (Fig. 7b). The magnitude of the simulated annual LAI changes
    during the longer-term period (1967–2017) is even lower than that observed for
    the MODIS era, which is inconsistent with the comparable degree of crop yield
    changes observed in both periods. Note that the trends of crop yield during the
    periods 1967–2017 and 2000–2017 are 293.5 ± 13.0 kg∙ha-1∙decade-1 and 340.0 ± 76.6 kg∙ha-1∙decade-1,
    respectively. Third, factorial attribution analysis of the TRENDY DGVM results
    identifies CO2 fertilization as the primary driver of Indian greening whereas
    climate and LCLUC have marginal impacts on the LAI changes. Though the TRENDY
    DGVMs presented in Fig. 7b account for irrigation practice (see Supplementary
    Fig. 4 for the TRENDY DGVMs without considering irrigation as a land-use management),
    the models identify the CO2 fertilization effect is a primary driver for the simulated
    greening in India. The CO2 fertilization effect is more prevalent in the long-term
    simulation result while climate and LCLUC have mostly negative effects on the
    LAI change. Yet, our results from MODIS and national agriculture statistics recognize
    the significant role of land management (i.e., primarily irrigation) in the observed
    greening and yield enhancement, while acknowledging a non-negligible role of CO2
    fertilization effect on crop yield increase (Fig. 6a). Note that the total effect
    of irrigation on the historical crop yield changes is 3.2 times larger than the
    one of CO2 fertilization effect. These all collectively suggest that the TRENDY
    DGVMs tend to underestimate LCLUC contribution but overestimate CO2 fertilization
    effect on cropland greening in India. Fig. 7: Comparison between satellite-derived
    and simulated seasonal LAI variation and long-term trends. a Seasonal LAI variation

    Vegetation Models (DGVM): green, ensemble mean of all DGVMs accounting irrigation

    component are included in this plot (see Supplementary Fig. S4 for the DGVMs without
    incorporating irrigation as a land management practice). The trends inferred from
    the DGVMs are attributed respectively to rising CO2, climate change, and land
    cover/use change (LCLUC) from factorial simulations. Two sets of LAI trend attribution
    results are presented for the periods of MODIS (2000−2017) and national statistics
    (1967−2017) records. Note that only DGVMs accounting for irrigation are considered
    in this comparison. The box stretches from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile
    of all DGVMs. The median and mean values are shown as the solid and dot lines,
    respectively. Only cropland is considered in this comparison. Full size image
    Discussion The advantage of using time series of satellite records, compared to
    coarser scale grain production statistics, is that they can show details of spatial
    and temporal patterns of vegetation changes in croplands (Figs. 1 and 2)16. The
    observed patterns of seasonally resolved LAI change and its association with irrigation
    practices confirm the importance of human land management in the observed global
    greening phenomenon6. Particularly, the dry (Rabi) season greening and crop yield
    enhancement in India are significant. Earlier studies appreciated the importance
    of irrigation in the observed changes in greenness in India, but they often neglected
    the seasonally varying patterns of the changes6,19. This overlooked aspect is
    one of the important findings in this study, which suggests a continuous shift
    in India’s agriculture toward an irrigation-driven dry season cropping system.
    Agricultural production is governed by many economic, technological, and environmental
    factors. Thus, determining the precise contribution of each factor is generally
    extremely difficult and beyond the scope of this study. There are several other
    factors that could also be involved in the observed greening and increasing grain
    production that have not been considered in this study. For instance, fertilizer
    use, and mechanization could also be playing a significant role in the recent
    greening in India28. Nonetheless, without discounting the other contributing factors,
    this study clearly suggests a strong contribution of irrigation to the crop yield
    enhancement and greening trend in India by providing consistent evidence from
    independent multi-scale datasets. This study clearly suggests that human land
    management activities have been important drivers for landscape greening and crop
    yield enhancement. However, the TRENDY DGVMs identify CO2 fertilization as a primary
    driver of increasing LAI over India and find climate and LCLUC as marginal or
    even negative contributors (Fig. 7b). This result from the TRENDY factorial simulations
    is well in accordance with the relevant previous studies, including TRENDY, Multi-scale
    Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), Coupled Model
    Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
    Phase 6 (CMIP6)8,9,10,29, but counter to our findings. According to the national
    statistics, Indian crop yield has increased by 327 % compared to the initial measure
    in the 1960s with changing atmospheric CO2 levels from 322.2 ppm to 408.7 ppm
    (+86.5 ppm) during the last five decades. Previous studies have reported that
    CO2 fertilization effect on crop yield per 100 ppm CO2 increase can range from
    1 to 17% by regions and from 0 to 33 % by crop types30,31. Also, long-term free‐air
    CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments have shown that elevation of CO2 by ca. 200
    ppm causes a ca. 18% increase (ca. 9% per 100 ppm) in yield under non‐stress conditions32.
    Given survey-based statistics and previously reported CO2 fertilization effect
    estimates, the CO2 fertilization effect alone may not explain such significant
    upward trends in Indian crop yield during the last five decades. Our statistical
    analysis also supports that the increase of atmospheric CO2 concentration has
    positive effects on the historical crop yield enhancement but is not a primary
    driver as the models simulate (Fig. 6a). Such a large discrepancy between the
    model simulation and empirical investigations implies that the current DGVMs may
    have limited capability to realistically reflect processes of land use and management,
    and thus correctly attribute the LAI changes to the underlying drivers33,34. Another
    explanation of the discrepancy we find from the comparison between the simulated
    and MODIS LAIs is a potential issue in human-management forcing data. Our complementary
    analysis shows that Land-Use Harmonization (LUH) Version 2 which was used for
    LCLUC forcing in the TRENDY gives 18.6 ± 2.0 % less irrigated croplands in India
    (Supplementary Fig. 7). We also find that the change rate of percent of irrigated
    area inferred from LUH and the national statistics quite differs. The rate of
    change in the last two decades (2000–2018) from the national statistics is about
    3.4 ± 0.7 %·decade-1 but LUH-based change rate (1.5 ± 0.6 %·decade-1) is half
    of the actual changes in India though its changing rate (2.9 ± 0.1 %·decade-1)
    in earlier period (1967–1999) is greater than the survey-based statistics (2.3 ± 0.3
    %·decade-1). These limitations may explain why we see different LAI seasonality
    and greening patterns in the Rabi and Kharif seasons from the MODIS and the DGVMs
    (Fig. 7). This finding holds significant implications for interpreting the large-scale
    leaf area increase and its consequences for Earth’s carbon, water, and energy
    cycles. For instance, the enhanced seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 concentration
    during the last decades has been proposed to be a result of vegetation growth
    stimulated by higher concentrations of CO2, as well as by changing climate35,36.
    However, these mechanisms have proven insufficient in explaining the full range
    and magnitude of the observed increase in seasonal CO2 amplitude. An alternative
    hypothesis is that the intensification of agriculture through human land management
    primarily contributes to the seasonal changes in CO2 exchange between the biosphere
    and the atmosphere37,38. Extensive greening across global croplands further underscores
    the significance of our findings6,13,14, thereby providing additional evidence
    in support of the alternative hypothesis. Another important implication of our
    findings relates to strategic planning for mitigating climate change39,40 and
    ensuring food security41. Our results suggest that the expected response of vegetation
    to rising atmospheric CO2 levels may be smaller than previously thought, indicating
    that the carbon sequestration capacity of terrestrial ecosystems could be less
    significant than earlier estimates. This has critical implications for our current
    climate change mitigation strategy, which is built upon prior understanding. Furthermore,
    the potential costs associated with ensuring food security could be higher than
    previously anticipated. This is because the reduced crop yield enhancement from
    CO2 fertilization implies the need for significant additional land management
    to sustain the continuous increase in crop yield and production. These collectively
    underscore the previously overlooked role of human land use and management in
    global vegetation changes and highlight its potential implications across various
    Earth systems, including the human system. Human land use and management has emerged
    as an important process in the earth system modeling framework as not only it
    has decisive impacts on the Earth system but also it can be a tool to mitigate
    global climate change7. However, as reported in this study, land management (here
    irrigation) has not been well incorporated into the land surface models34. A few
    of the TRENDY DGVMs used in this study (namely CLM5.0, LPJ-GUESS, and SURFEX)
    incorporate an irrigation practice as a process of land management (Supplementary
    Table 2), however, the observed irrigation-driven dry season greening is not reproduced
    by these models (Supplementary Fig. 3). Progress has been slow in incorporating
    land use and management processes into the earth system modeling frameworks, often
    limited by technical and data availability challenges34. For instance, information
    on soil management, crop varieties, crop rotations, and actual irrigation amounts
    and schemes is presently either not available or only incompletely so. It is also
    challenging to acknowledge and address errors in various processes, such as gross
    primary production, respiration, allocation of photosynthate, soil dynamics, and
    crop stress response, which can compensate for each other in the formation of
    yield and leaf area. These challenges suggest further model development and improvement,
    thereby urging a continuous and closer collaboration among the modeling, Earth
    observation, and land system science communities to better represent land use
    and management in LSMs. Continuous irrigation practice and yield enhancement have
    raised an important concern regarding its sustainability because the observed
    irrigation-induced greening can have discernable impacts on India’s groundwater42,43.
    India is the world’s largest consumer of groundwater and groundwater provides
    ~60% of the nation’s irrigation supply. Recent studies have found that the intensified
    irrigation in India depletes groundwater44. Current trends in groundwater depletion
    in India are becoming a threat to food security because it leads to a decrease
    of cropping intensity by 20% nationwide and by 68% in groundwater-depleted regions42.
    The projected worsening of water resources in India suggests that the observed
    dry season cropping/greening will become increasingly susceptible to interannual
    rainfall variability, potentially leading to its diminishment. It thus becomes
    more uncertain to what extent and how long the observed Indian greening lasts
    under current groundwater depletion rates and changing climate. Similar situations
    may arise in other observed greening hotspots over the global breadbaskets as
    emerging studies point to challenges in water management in these regions45,46.
    This suggests that continuous monitoring of cropland greenness (or yield) is essential
    for sustainable water resource management and ensuring national and global food
    security. Methods MODIS LAI The latest version (Collection 6, C6) of NASA Terra
    and Aqua MODIS LAI products (MOD15A2H and MYD15A2H) is used in this study47,48.
    These LAI datasets (2000–2018) are provided as 8-day composites with a 500-m sinusoidal
    projection. The datasets are refined by rigorous checking of the quality fags
    of the LAI products and of the simultaneous vegetation index products, following
    the previously described methods49. This filtering provides the highest quality
    MODIS LAI observations that minimize any residual contamination from clouds, aerosols,
    snow, and shadow 6. The two LAI datasets (that is, four 8-day composites) are
    then combined into a 16-day composite by taking the mean of all valid LAIs (temporal
    average). The quality of C6 MODIS LAI datasets has been comprehensively evaluated
    against ground-based measurements of LAI and through inter-comparisons with other
    satellite LAI products50,51. These datasets represent the latest and highest-quality
    LAI products that are currently available. This study uses the time series of
    19-year MODIS LAI data averaged over the Rabi (November–May), Kharif (June–October),
    and annual time period. Indian agriculture statistics Spatially aggregated historical
    annual and seasonal (Rabi and Kharif season) food grain production, yield, cropping
    area, and irrigation statistics are extracted from the Ministry of Agriculture,
    Government of India52. The data from 1967 to 2018 is used in this study. Food
    grain production refers to the total production of rice, wheat, corn, coarse grains
    (sorghum and millet), and pulses (beans, dried peas, and lentils). Crop-specific
    data for major crops (rice, wheat, pulses, maize, jowar, bajra, and nutrient cereal)
    is also prepared to investigate how individual crop’s yield, cropping area, total
    production, and irrigation statistics have changed differently during the last
    five decades. Cropland fraction, irrigation, and crop type map We define the geographic
    distribution of croplands based on both MODIS Land Cover product (MCD12Q1) and
    International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) cropland fraction
    data53. In this study, we only keep pixels that satisfy two following conditions
    as croplands: (a) MCD12Q1 equals 12 (Croplands) or 14 (Cropland/Natural Vegetation
    Mosaics), (b) IIASA cropland fraction > 50 %. We also define the irrigated and
    unirrigated (i.e., rainfed) croplands in India by overlaying the global irrigated
    and rainfed cropland area maps18. We further introduce seasonally resolved crop
    type maps to understand to what extent the seasonally varying degree of changes
    in Indian cropland is associated with different crop types54. These crop-type
    maps were developed using MODIS 250 m surface reflectances (and derived spectral
    indices) and quantitative spectral matching techniques, resulting in mapped accuracies
    ranging from 72% to 97%. The crop types derived from remote sensing explained
    variability in national statistics ranging from 63% to 98%. Aridity and climate
    data Aridity is usually expressed as a generalized function of precipitation,
    temperature, and reference evapotranspiration. It is considered an indicator of
    quantified precipitation availability over atmospheric water demand. The aridity
    index used in this study was calculated as a ratio between mean annual precipitation
    and reference evapotranspiration55. The precipitation data was obtained from the
    high-resolution WorldClim2 data while the reference evapotranspiration was modeled
    using the FAO Penman-Monteith method. In this study, we employed the UNEP aridity
    classification scheme: arid (<0.2), semi-arid (0.2–0.5), dry sub-humid (0.5–0.65),
    and humid (>0.65). For assessing relations between MODIS LAI and climate data,
    we obtained monthly temperature, precipitation, and radiation data from CRU TS
    (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) Version 4.04 data56. TRENDY DGVM
    LAI DGVMs simulate key physical and biological processes of the land system in
    interaction with the atmosphere. DGVMs provide a deeper insight into the mechanisms
    controlling terrestrial energy, hydrological, and carbon cycles, as well as the
    drivers of phenomena ranging from short-term anomalies to long-term changes57.
    DGVM simulations under constant environmental conditions have been performed within
    the project TRENDY (Trends and drivers of the regional-scale sources and sinks
    of carbon dioxide)27. In this study, we use 10 TRENDY v7 DGVMs including CABLE-POP58,
    CLM5.059, JSBACH60, JULES61, LPJ-GUESS62, LPX-Bern63, ORCHIDEE64, SDGVM65, SURFEX66,
    and VISIT67 (Supplementary Table 1). A set of three experiments driven by either
    constant or varying climate data and other inputs such as atmospheric CO2 and
    LCLUC forcing were designed in the TRENDY project to differentiate the role of
    CO2, Climate, and LCLUC (Supplementary Table 2). The TRENDY v7 models were forced
    by gridded climate data (either monthly CRU or 6-hourly CRU-JRA55), atmospheric
    CO2 concentrations based on ice core measurements (pre-1958), and stationary observations
    from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (post-1958), and
    Land-use Harmonization (LUH) Version 2 data68. The TRENDY models provided three
    types of simulations: (a) one that considers the variability in atmospheric CO2
    (S1), (b) one that considers the variability in CO2 and climate (S2), and (c)
    one that considers the variability in CO2, climate, and historical LCLUC (S3).
    We aggregate the DGVM simulated monthly LAIs to the Rabi (November–May), Kharif
    (June–October), and annual LAI time series. Analytical approaches We evaluated
    each LAI time series (Rabi, Kharif, and annual LAI) for the presence of a monotonic
    trend using a rank-based Mann–Kendall trend test69 and determined the slope of
    each time series using a non-parametric Theil–Sen slope estimator70 as implemented
    using the zyp package71 in R. This approach for robust trend assessment accounts
    for potential temporal autocorrelation and has been used in prior studies that
    evaluated changes in target variables including remote sensing and climate variables
    6. We classified pixels (or aggregated time series) with a positive LAI trend
    (p < 0.1) as greening or a negative LAI trend (p < 0.1) as browning. The role
    of irrigation in modulating leaf area changes is evaluated using irrigated and
    unirrigated area maps18. We also further categorize croplands based on aridity
    levels (arid, semi-arid, dry sub-humid, and humid) to investigate the role of
    irrigation in the satellite-observed greening across varying aridity levels. We
    compare trend estimates between different irrigation practices and/or aridity
    conditions. In this study, we further apply a partial-correlation analysis to
    evaluate the responsiveness of MODIS LAI to precipitation variability after statistically
    controlling for the covarying effects of MODIS LAI and climatic variables (temperature
    and solar radiation). These climatic variables are all derived from the CRU TS4.04
    datasets. We quantify trends in total production, yield, cropping area, and irrigation
    statistics of both food grain and major crop types (rice, wheat, pulse, maize,
    jowar, Bajra, and nutrient cereal) in India, and evaluate relations between each
    variable using Pearson correlation coefficient. In this analysis, we further split
    the statistics into two time periods (Earlier 20 years: 1967–1986, Later 20 years:
    1999–2018) to investigate how the trends and correlations evolve in the earlier
    and later periods. We also use multivariate regression analysis to quantify the
    effect size of irrigation, fertilizer, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and climate
    (temperature, precipitation, and radiation) on historical crop yield changes.
    Time series of the dependent and independent variables are prepared for this analysis.
    Given the limited availability of historical fertilizer use records, we only use
    the data from 1985 to 2017 for this analysis. To further investigate interactions
    between irrigation practice and climate factors, we include interaction terms,
    i.e., irrigation × precipitation (ppt) and irrigation × maximum temperature (tmax).
    Our general model of crop yield, which includes 5 covariates and 2 interaction
    terms, is: $${{{{{{\\mathrm{Yield}}}}}}} \\sim \\, {{{{{{\\mathrm{Irrigation}}}}}}}+{{{{{{\\mathrm{Fertilizer}}}}}}}+{{{{{{{\\mathrm{CO}}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\mathrm{2}}}}}}}+{{{{{{\\mathrm{ppt}}}}}}}\\\\
    +{{{{{{\\mathrm{tmax}}}}}}}+{{{{{{\\mathrm{rad}}}}}}}+{{{{{{\\mathrm{Irrigation}}}}}}}
    \\! \\! :{{{{{{\\mathrm{ppt}}}}}}}+{{{{{{\\mathrm{Irrigation}}}}}}} \\! \\! :{{{{{{\\mathrm{tmax}}}}}}}$$
    To quantify the individual contribution of CO2, climate, and land cover/use changes
    (LCLUC) to changes in LAI, we follow a factorial simulation approach using three
    different simulations of DGVMs in TRENDY27,72. The effect of CO2 on the LAI change
    is represented by a trend of S1 (CO2 only) results; the S2 (CO2 + Climate) results
    show a trend that is the sum of CO2 and climate effects, and the S3 (CO2 + Climate + LCLUC)
    simulations include trends from time-varying CO2, climate, and land use/cover
    change. For simplicity, the effect of “climate” as used in this paper includes
    the synergy of CO2 and climate, and similarly the effect of “LCLUC” also includes
    the synergy terms. Therefore, the effects of CO2, climate, and LCLUC are then
    quantified as the trend for S1, the trend of S2 minus the S1 trend, and the trend
    of S3 minus the S2 trend, respectively. All trends are evaluated by the non-parametric
    Theil–Sen slope estimator70. Data availability MODIS LAI (MOD15A2H & MYD15A2H)

  description: 'Predicting pesticide residue masses in environments requires time-
    and cost-efficient fate models, particularly for high-throughput simulations of
    hundreds of active ingredients registered for use in agriculture. Due to the adaptability
    of first-order kinetics-based models for simulating the fate of pesticides in
    environments of varying scales, we conduct a review of these models in the present
    investigation. We discuss the application of first-order kinetics-based fate models
    in different types of compartments, such as environmental media, plant tissues,
    and animal bodies, and at different levels, such as the product-oriented life
    cycle impact assessment and the chemical-oriented health risk assessment. In addition,
    the first-order kinetics-based rate constants of pesticides provide process- and
    scenario-specific information on the fate, transport, and transformation of pesticides,
    which is essential for predicting pesticide residue masses in different environmental
    compartments. By varying the level of model complexity and site-specific rate
    constants of pesticides, the first-order kinetics-based fate models can be used
    as either comparable or absolute tools for conducting the life cycle impact assessment
    or the health risk assessment of pesticides, respectively. Bioconcentration, bioaccumulation,
    and biomagnification of pesticides may be evaluated with the aid of an inventory

    that indicate reduced microbial activity and thus also facilitate the detection
    of C2H4. It could be detected 3.5 times more often in spruce than in beech stands,
    indicating that plant species plays a role and was not found to follow any distinct

    period and large dataset of this field study allowed valuable insights into C2H4
    occurrence in forest soils under natural conditions supporting the theory that
    the plant hormone C2H4 is produced as a warning for anaerobic soil areas that
    are limiting root growth.

    ethylene (ethene; C2H4) detection in most soils is difficult. The knowledge about

    for a forest soil Article Open access 28 July 2017 Introduction Most of the studies
    on soil gases in forest soils focus on soil respiration and other greenhouse gases.
    However, other trace gases can also provide indicators for important soil ecological
    processes and point to stress-related climate consequences (Conrad 1996). In plant
    physiology, the gaseous plant hormone C2H4 plays an important role throughout
    the whole life cycle in plants, from seedling to mature plants (Bakshi et al.
    2015; Sisler and Yang 1984). Being associated with the ripening process (Reid
    1995), C2H4 can induce abscission (enhanced dropping of leaves, flowers, and fruits)
    or senescence (accelerated aging of the plant). Plants produce C2H4 (Sisler and
    Yang 1984), whereas microorganisms and fungi can produce and degrade it (Fukuda
    et al. 1993; Primrose 1979). If C2H4 concentrations in the soil gas phase exceed
    certain thresholds, plants will be negatively influenced. Even though threshold
    values depend on plant species, C2H4 concentrations >0.01 μmol mol−1 were identified
    to already have effects on plant growth, whereas C2H4 concentrations >10 μmol
    mol−1 cause severe plant damages (Primrose 1979; Smith and Russell 1969). C2H4
    induces distinct changes in plant growth and morphology known as “triple response”
    (Binder 2020; Bleecker and Kende 2000; Zhong et al. 2014). These responses collectively
    enable plants to adapt to stressful conditions caused by mechanical obstacles
    or anaerobic soil atmosphere (Abeles et al. 1992). In soils, the occurrence and
    concentration of C2H4 are affected by several physical and chemical soil properties.
    Smith and Dowdell (1974) list soil temperature, oxygen (O2) availability, and
    soil water content (SWC) as most important factors, which alter the production
    and diffusion of C2H4 in and out of soil. These factors and additionally soil
    organic matter content (SOM) and soil pH (Otani and Ae 1993), change the rhizosphere
    microbial composition influencing C2H4 production dynamics. Roots can produce
    C2H4 under low-oxygen conditions, such as waterlogged or flooded soil since oxygen
    deprivation activates specific enzymes involved in C2H4 biosynthesis, leading
    to increased ethylene production (Drew 1997) and C2H4 degradation is inhibited
    (Smith and Restall 1971). This response helps plants cope with oxygen-deficient
    conditions. Physical damage or mechanical stress to roots, such as compaction,
    root displacement, and contact with stones can also stimulate C2H4 production
    (Mattoo et al. 1991). This also results in a positive correlation of soil bulk
    density (BD) to C2H4 detection (Danish et al. 2020; Smith and Restall 1971). In
    response to mechanical stress, C2H4 production helps coordinate root growth and
    morphology, allowing the plant to navigate and adapt to its environment. C2H4
    production varies throughout the different developmental stages of roots (Negi
    et al. 2008). Further positive correlations with C2H4 occurrence were found to
    SWC (Dowdell et al. 1972), soil temperature (Xu and Inubushi 2009), and CO2 concentration
    (Cornforth 1975). However, when related to SWC, increased C2H4 production was
    also observed during drought stress contributing to the regulation of plant growth
    (Sharp et al. 2000). On the contrary, other effects like tree type (Elsgaard 2001),
    OM content (Cornforth 1975; Goodlass and Smith 1978), and soil pH (Lindberg et
    al. 1979; Zechmeister-Boltenstern and Smith 1998) on C2H4 are not consistent between
    studies. The C2H4 is a particularly reactive gas, normally consumed directly in
    the vicinity of its production and for this reason concentrations are generally
    low and accumulation of C2H4 occurs mostly in hot spots, making detection particularly
    difficult. Apart from incubation experiments, the detection of C2H4 in the field
    depends not only on the amount produced but also on the conditions that favor
    the accumulation of the trace gas in the soil and delay its degradation. Dowdell
    et al. (1972) conducted a field study to investigate C2H4 occurrence in natural
    forest soils. Hunt et al. (1981), Meek et al. (1983), Otani and Ae (1993), and
    Smith and Dowdell (1974) conducted field studies with additional treatments of
    soil samples in the laboratory. Yet, a comprehensive field investigation of C2H4
    occurrence in soil has not been conducted. One reason for the paucity of (field)
    studies is the rare and accidental occurrence of C2H4 in non-compacted, well-aerated
    soils which mainly act as a net sink of C2H4 (Abeles et al. 1971; Arshad and Frankenberger
    1990; Hendrickson 1989). The rare and accidental occurrence of C2H4 challenges
    the concept of short-term (<4 years) studies and requires long-term data series
    to get reliable results of C2H4 occurrence and contribute to a better understanding
    of C2H4 influencing factors in forest soils. Our study will report on field observations
    of C2H4 occurrence and quantity in soil gas phase at forest sites. Our objectives
    were to quantify the occurrence of C2H4 in well-aerated forest soils with different
    tree species, artificially compacted soil, waterlogged forest sites, limed soils
    and to identify the influencing factors. The investigated soils provide properties
    which have so far been identified primarily in laboratory experiments as potential
    factors influencing C2H4 production, C2H4 degradation and transport in the soil
    ecosystem. Material and methods Study sites and plots Data from 24 study plots
    set up at 14 sites in southwest Germany (Fig. 1) were used, originating from long-term
    soil gas monitoring (n = 13), and project studies (n = 11) on liming and soil
    compaction including in total 50,922 analyzed soil gas samples. The large number
    of plots allows us to investigate the effect of various soils, treatments, and
    stands on ethylene occurrence (Fig. 2). Fig. 1 Locations of the 24 study plots
    in Baden-Württemberg, southwest Germany. Symbols refer to their study category
    assignment Full size image Fig. 2 The different soils, treatments, and site characteristics
    of the evaluated study categories, in which C2H4 in field experiments has been
    measured Full size image The plots have a mean annual temperature between 7.4
    and 9.6 °C and a mean annual precipitation total of 700 to 1385 mm. They are located
    at altitudes ranging from 172 to 816 m a.s.l. The acid topsoil (0-5 cm) had pH
    (KCl) values ranging from 2.9 to 4.1 and in humus from 2.6 to 5.0. Sites on carbonate
    rock or with clay texture are not included in the study. Each site has at least
    one plot area with one adjustment of multiple passive soil gas samplers. Long-term
    environmental monitoring plots (LTEMPs) Soil gas data of 13 plots at 6 different
    sites (Table 1) originate from long-term environmental monitoring plots (LTEMP)
    which are part of the International Cooperation Program Forests (ICP Forests).
    Five of the six sites have an adjacent beech plot (Fagus sylvatica L.) to the
    spruce plot (Picea abies L.), and two of the sites have additional liming plots.
    More detailed information on the long-term soil gas monitoring concept is presented
    by Maier et al. (2020). During establishment, permanent soil gas sampling positions
    were mapped with neighboring roots and trees, allowing for subsequent identification
    of root-influenced gas samplers. In addition to the general site characteristics
    (Table 1), monitoring data on soil temperature, soil water content, as well as
    climate and soil gas diffusivity are available. The discretization of the SWC
    was modeled with LWF Brook 90 (Schmidt-Walter et al. 2020), and the soil temperature
    was modeled in Hydrus 1D (Maier et al. 2020; Simunek et al. 2005) Table 1 General
    information on site data and soil of the investigated plots of the associated
    studies/treatments Full size table Project studies: soil compaction studies Soil
    compaction studies were conducted at SM (Horn et al. 2007) and MU (Schäffer 2012)
    to investigate the effect of artificial soil compaction on soil functions. In
    these studies, the soil was compacted by typical forestry operations (e.g., operation
    of heavy forestry machinery). Soil gas was sampled within, and next to, wheel
    tracks as well as in nearby, non-compacted control areas as reference (Fig. 7).
    In WW and FO, the soil compacted by heavy machinery was afforested. The soil at
    the ST site (Schack-Kirchner and Hildebrand 1998) was also compacted by heavy
    machinery. However, after 4 years, when soil gas was sampled, surficial signs
    of deformation were no longer detected. Additionally, temporary waterlogging and
    O2 deficiency were evident in the appearance of distinct hydromorphic features,
    typical for a Stagnosol, which is why the ST site was also assigned to the compaction
    study. General soil gas data (e.g., greenhouse gas fluxes) were already discussed
    in former publications (Schack-Kirchner and Hildebrand 1998; Schäffer 2012; Schäffer
    and Von Wilpert 2004), but C2H4 was largely omitted. Project studies: liming trials
    The study sites of the liming trials (BW, HW, HO) had previously been subject
    to intensive analysis after liming, which showed increased soil pH values and
    enhanced base saturation in limed soils (Jansone et al. 2020) compared to a corresponding
    unlimed reference plot nearby. Soil gas data should reveal a changing diffusivity
    of the soil due to liming. Sampling and analyzing soil gas samples The measurement
    results were obtained from all plots via the analysis of soil gas samples that
    were collected at regular intervals. To collect soil gas, passive soil gas samplers
    were used according to methods described by Schack-Kirchner et al. (1993) (Fig.
    8). An artificially perforated steel tube was placed in the soil, acting as a
    macropore and, thus, allowing diffusive gas transport via a cannula into a gas
    vial (4 ml) initially filled with helium. Although all gas samples were collected
    and analyzed in the same way, there is no uniform experimental design for the
    plots as our study is only an evaluation of existing data sets. As a consequence,
    the definition of the measurement depths was done according to the objectives
    of the study at that time. In well-aerated forest soils (LTEMP and liming trials),
    the focus was on microbial active topsoil, so gas samplers were only installed
    in humus (+3/+2 cm) and at depths of 0 cm (at the humus/mineral soil interface),
    −5 cm, and −10 cm. At each depth level, there are at least three (though typically
    five) replicates resulting in about 20 soil gas samplers on each of the plots.
    For the compaction study plots, the focus shifted to deeper soil layers. In order
    to capture the totality of soil changes in these plots, gas samplers were located
    at −15 cm, −20 cm, −25 cm, −30 cm, and −35 cm (Table 2). The exact position and
    number of gas samplers here can be seen in Fig. 7. Table 2 Spatial distribution
    of the C2H4 occurrence in compacted soils Full size table As gas exchange between
    soil pore space and the gas vial is passive, the gas composition in the vials
    represents the average soil gas atmosphere of the most recent hours; however,
    it is possible for the vials to still contain components of the soil gas atmosphere
    of the previous day if high SWC slowed down the gas exchange. Similarly, if the
    cannula is clogged or there is water in the perforated steel tube of the samplers,
    the gas exchange with the soil gas phase cannot be completed. During the subsequent
    determination of the soil gas composition, a remaining helium content is then
    determined. These vials were then eliminated from further evaluation. The gas
    vials were collected in a regular and at least 4-week cycle, and the soil gas
    composition (N2, O2, Ar, CO2, CH4, C2H4, N2O) was immediately analyzed in the
    laboratory with a gas chromatograph (GC) Clarus 680 GC (Perkin Elmer, Waltham,
    MA, US). In the GC, C2H4 was separated by a CP-SilicaPLOT column (Agilent Technologies)
    and determined by a flame ionization detector (FID). The respective GC system
    that was used did change over the years; however, the configuration of the GC
    system remained the same (more details in Maier et al. (2020)). The limit of quantification
    (LOQ) for C2H4 measurements was 0.12 μmol mol−1 (10 × standard deviation (SD)
    of C2H4 scattering of the calibration gas), and the limit of detection (LOD) was
    0.036 μmolmol−1 (3 × SD). LOD and LOQ values were validated by mixing and testing
    the signal to noise ratio of an artificial air mix, with C2H4 concentrations two
    times higher than the LOQ. Statistical analysis The C2H4 concentration dataset
    is left-censored and contains a high proportion of true-zero measurements (96%).
    Since a proper approach could not be found in related studies dealing with true-zero
    and left-censored data simultaneously (Brown 2008; Guideline 2005; Proctor 2008),
    an in-house procedure was developed based on Blackwood (1991), Helsel (2011),
    and Zuur et al. (2009), who developed their methodology mainly for the evaluation
    of the most prominently censored datasets from survival studies. Using the in-house
    methodology, 22% of values >0 μmol mol−1 were below LOD and 58% were below LOQ.
    Concentrations below LOD or LOQ were not excluded from analysis or substituted
    by artificial values in order to avoid artificial assumptions or bias that could
    lead to incorrect results or blur information contained in the measurements (Brown
    2008; Helsel 2011). Statistical analyses were conducted using the open-access
    software R (version 4.0.3; R Development Core Team ), with a significance level
    set to 5%. For an initial assessment, the total data set was divided into multiple
    classes. Firstly, data was classified as “C2H4 detection” (C2H4 >0 μmol mol−1)
    or “no C2H4 detection” (C2H4 = 0 μmol mol−1), which allowed for the determination
    of promoting and inhibiting factors on C2H4 occurrence. To check for significant
    differences, the non-parametric Wilcoxon test (also known as Mann–Whitney-U-test)
    was conducted. For non-parametric Spearman correlation analysis, C2H4 values >0
    μmol mol−1 and <LOD were set to 0.02 μmol mol−1 and values ≥LOD and <LOQ to 0.07
    μmol mol−1. As suggested by Helsel (2011)values between different measurement
    limits were set to equal numbers respectively enables to treat data as the same
    ranks with a degradation of values <LOD (lower) and <LOQ (higher). The dataset
    was further divided into five classes: “0 μmol mol−1,” “>0 μmol mol−1 <LOD,” “≥
    LOD < LOQ,” “≥ LOQ < 1 μmol mol−1,” and “>1 μmol mol−1”. To identify environmental
    influencing factors such as air temperature or precipitation amount, a Kruskal–Wallis
    test, as a non-parametric correspondent to an ANOVA, was conducted. If a significant
    difference was detected, Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction was run to identify
    groups responsible for difference. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) approach
    was used to conduct summary statistics, which performed well for our data when
    excluding zero values and with a censored data share between 50 and 80% (Helsel
    2011). In order to apply the MLE approach, the data were tested for lognormal
    distribution. The implementation of MLE in R utilizes the NADA packages developed
    to handle censored data. As evaluation with NADA allows the use of only one reporting
    limit, LOD was selected, and concentrations ≥LOD were, thus, treated as absolute
    values, knowing that values between LOD and LOQ cannot be determined correctly
    in concentrations. For checking differences of C2H4 concentrations between groups,
    a censored data adapted t-test for 2-factor variables and a censored data adjusted
    ANOVA for > 2-factor variables were conducted. The equivalent of both tests in
    R is censored regression. If there are no more censored data in partial data sets
    (e.g., ST), the MLE approach or censored regression was no longer necessary. To
    identify correlations to other soil gases for the overall data set, a classification
    approach of logistic regression was used (Nwanganga and Chapple 2020). The graphical
    result is an s-curve, representing the range of an event’s occurrence probability
    between 0 and 1 (Nwanganga and Chapple 2020). For quantifying the effect of a
    predictor variable, an odds ratio is used. It represents the probability that
    an event occurs relative to the probability of the event’s non-occurrence (Peng
    et al. 2002). The higher the odds ratio, the higher the influence of a predictor
    variable. The model is validated by a chi-squared <0.05 and R2. With test and
    training data sets, and accuracy of predicted probabilities, it can further be
    stated whether the fitted model leads to reasonable results (Nwanganga and Chapple
    2020). Results Long-term environmental monitoring plots LTEMPs data represent
    80% of the samples. C2H4 was detected at least once on every LTMEP. In proportion
    to the total number of gas samples, C2H4 was detected most frequently at ESS (2.55%)
    and least frequently at ESB (0.07%) (Table 6). Analysis of all 13 LTEMPs combined
    shows an average C2H4 detection frequency of 1.3%. The range of measured C2H4
    concentrations is from <LOD (0.01 μmol mol−1) to 23.9 μmol mol−1, with a mean
    value of 0.78 μmol mol−1. Six out of 13 plots showed median C2H4 concentrations
    <LOQ. Censored regression showed a significant depth gradient in mineral soil,
    with decreasing C2H4 concentration as depth increases (Table 3). However, when
    root-induced C2H4 release (mainly registered in the humus layer at ESs) is excluded,
    the differences between C2H4 concentrations in the mineral soil and humus layer
    were no longer significant (“(excl.)” line in Table 3). Table 3 Depth distribution
    of C2H4 occurrence in soil at all LTEMPs combined Full size table During the establishment
    of the plots in 1998, field maps were made in which the position of samplers and
    also strong roots in the near environment (<1 m distance) were registered. At
    these three plots (ESS, COS, ASS), episodes of clustered ethylene detection were
    observed at the gas samplers located closest to the roots (Fig. 9). Therefore,
    root influence is clearly influencing C2H4 hot spots and is the most important
    factor influencing spatial patterns. When analyzing the temporal evolution of
    C2H4 occurrence (Fig. 9), most years show no, or minimal C2H4 occurrence frequency
    but, overall, single intensive periods of C2H4 release. The dataset divided into
    classes was compared to different environmental parameter values (e.g., air temperature,
    SWC, precipitation) by conducting a Kruskal–Wallis test. The analysis was site
    specific. Overall, an influence of the climatic parameters on the ethylene occurrence
    showed no significance when considering the total time series. Trends are recognizable
    for some short-term periods, but when considering different locations at the same
    time, or the full time series, the trends are no longer present or contrary. Consequently,
    general conclusions could not be drawn regarding temperature or moisture being
    the main influencing factors for the temporal variability of many other soil gases.
    To identify the tree-species effect, only the period of time from 2010 onward,
    when samples were taken on adjacent LTEMPs of different forest stands, was considered.
    At spruce sites, C2H4 was detected in 1.17% of the samples, with simultaneously
    elevated concentrations (Fig. 3), which represents a significant difference (Spearman’s
    rho: −0.110; p < 0.05) compared to the samples of beech sites, which had a C2H4
    detection frequency of only 0.33% as well as lower C2H4 concentrations. This effect
    is also visible in a pairwise comparison of neighboring spruce and beech plots
    at the same site (Fig. 10). Low frequencies of occurrence on some plots, however,
    permitted statistical analysis of the pairwise comparison. Fig. 3 C2H4 occurrence
    (%) and concentrations (μmol mol−1 logarithmic transformation – log10) in soil
    air under spruce and beech. Mean, median, and SD were calculated with the MLE
    approach (only C2H4 concentrations > 0 μmol mol−1). LOD and LOQ are represented
    by the dashed lines Full size image For a quantitative analysis of the effect
    of soil texture on C2H4 occurrence, the LTEMPs dataset was classified according
    to the sites’ main soil texture group (Table 1). The frequency of C2H4 occurrence
    was slightly higher in sandy soils (1.36% compared to 1.04% in silty soils). Median
    and mean C2H4 concentrations were higher in silty soils (median: 0.14 μmol mol−1)
    than in sandy soils (median: 0.05 μmol mol−1) and the difference was found to
    be significant (p < 0.05; censored regression). It must be noted that no clayey
    and less-sandy soils were included. Total pore space (TPS), air-filled pore space
    (AFPS), and bulk density (BD) showed no significant effect when examining LTEMPs’
    soils. Liming studies The effect of liming was studied based on LTEMPs, including
    limed and non-limed reference plots in HD and OC. An influence of soil pH or carbonate
    content could not be identified for either the humus or the mineral soil. C2H4
    occurred slightly less (not significant) on limed plots (1.30%) than on non-limed
    plots (1.41%) when the areas of both sites are evaluated together. The difference
    between C2H4 concentrations caused by liming was significant in censored regression
    analysis (p < 0.05), with C2H4 concentrations being slightly lower on limed plots
    (median: 0.04 μmol mol−1; mean: 0.13 μmol mol−1) compared to non-limed plots (median:
    0.06 μmol mol−1; mean: 0.40 μmol mol−1). The three sites of the liming study (BW,
    HO, and HW), with a duration of 1.5 years, did not show sufficient C2H4 detection
    for statistical analysis, since C2H4 could only be measured in 5 of almost 2000
    samples. Compaction studies Considering all five compaction study sites together
    (SM, MU, WW, FO, ST), C2H4 detection frequency was 11.24%—almost ten times higher
    than the detection frequency at the LTEMPs (Table 6). To investigate the compaction
    effect, the individual gas samplers were divided into “compacted” and “non-compacted”
    according to their position and the bulk density of soil samples collected there
    (Table 4). C2H4 shows significantly higher (p < 0.001; censored regression) occurrence
    (Fig. 11) and concentrations in compacted soils (14.75%, median: 0.41 μmol mol−1)
    than in non-compacted soils nearby (6.95%, median: 0.12 μmol mol−1) (Fig. 4).
    There is also a positive correlation between C2H4 occurrence and bulk density
    (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon test), with samples showing C2H4 concentrations > 0 μmol mol−1
    having higher BD values (1.53 g cm−3) than samples without C2H4 detection (1.44
    g cm−3). Fig. 4 C2H4 concentration (μmol mol−1, logarithmic transformation–log10)

    SM and MU showed the highest C2H4 occurrence right after the artificial compaction
    of the forest soils in 2001 (20.37%)/2002 (27.53%) and in 2009 (0.91%), respectively.
    In the following years, the number of C2H4 measurements decreased to zero. At
    WW and FO, the analysis of temporal patterns was difficult due to short measurement
    time as well as large temporal gaps (Table 1). C2H4 occurred preferentially in
    the summer months from April to August. To examine the depth gradient in compacted
    soils, ethylene results were pooled by study site and depth (Table 3), considering
    only gas samplers in compacted soils (Table 4). As the WW site was only sampled
    at the −30 cm depth level, these data are for comparison only. The heaviest machine
    in the soil compaction study at SM caused the most frequent C2H4 detection (Table
    3) and the highest C2H4 concentrations underneath the tracks. This effect also
    emerged within the SM plots, where different driving operations were carried out,
    resulting in an effect of machine weight and track position on ethylene detection
    frequency (Table 5 and Fig. 12). Contrary to the results of LTEMPs, all compacted
    plots where soil gas was sampled at different soil depths (SM, MU, and FO in Table
    3) show rising C2H4 occurrence frequencies with increasing depth. C2H4 concentrations
    in mineral soil (median: 0.09 μmol mol−1; mean: 0.39 μmol mol−1) differ significantly
    from C2H4 concentrations in humus (median: 0.03 μmol mol−1; mean: 0.06 μmol mol−1;
    p < 0.001; censored regression). However, there are large variabilities in C2H4
    occurrence frequencies and concentrations between the study sites (Table 3). When
    examining a depth gradient, it must be noted that the sampling depths are not
    uniform. Temporary waterlogged site Because of the predominant Stagnosol soil
    type, and the fact that the temporary water influence still overlaps the effects
    of compaction, the ST site was analyzed separately from the other compaction studies.
    This fact is also reflected in the highest C2H4 detection frequency for ST, with
    a C2H4 detection frequency of 26.98% (Table 6), which was also the highest of
    all 24 monitoring plots. All C2H4 measurements exceeded the LOD (Fig. 4), and
    therefore, the MLE approach was not applied. C2H4 correlated with O2 (Spearman’s
    rho: −0.345; p < 0.05) and CO2 (Spearman’s rho: 0.284; p < 0.05). Both gases differ
    significantly in samples with and without C2H4 detection (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon test).
    Anaerobic soils with low oxygen concentrations and correspondingly elevated CO2
    levels showed higher occurrence and concentrations of C2H4 (Fig. 4). Combined
    analysis of all plots Using the dataset of all 24 study plots, we could show that
    C2H4 was positively correlated (p < 0.001; Wilcoxon test) with CO2, CH4, and N2O.
    Concentrations of the latter gas species are not only different in samples with
    and without C2H4 detection but also changes with rising C2H4 concentrations if
    only samples with > 0 μmol mol−1 C2H4 are considered (Fig. 5) when tested with
    the Spearman correlation. Quantitatively, a higher C2H4 concentration is detected
    in samples of higher CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations. Above a CO2 concentration
    of 0.3 mol mol−1, the C2H4 detection frequency seems to rise (Fig. 5). There is
    a significant positive correlation (p < 0.001) between CO2 and C2H4 detection
    frequency if all data are included (Spearman’s rho: 0.111) and if only C2H4 concentrations
    > 0 μmol mol−1 are included (Spearman’s rho: 0.391). Additionally, there is a
    1.18 times higher chance of detecting C2H4 if CO2 concentration rises by 1 mol
    mol−1 (odds ratio). With logistic regression, it is shown that CO2 concentration
    must be >21.05 mol mol−1 to detect C2H4 by a probability >50%, which is hardly
    reached in our upland forest soils. The Chi2 for the test model was <0.05 and
    R2 was 0.2. Furthermore, the correlation of CH4 and N2O concentrations to C2H4
    detection frequency was significantly positive (p < 0.001) for the whole dataset
    (Spearman’s rho: 0.172 (CH4) and 0.077 (N2O)) and for C2H4 measurements >0 μmol
    mol−1 (Spearman’s rho: 0.172 (CH4) and 0.105 (N2O)). The analysis of all monitoring
    plots combined was only conducted for the gas composition, as plot specific factors,
    such as compaction or soil type, overlay the singular influence of individual
    site parameters. Fig. 5 C2H4 detection frequency depending on the CO2 (a, mol
    mol−1) and CH4 (c, μmol mol−1) and N2O (d, μmol mol−1) concentration in soil gas
    divided into classes and the graphical visualization of the logistic regression
    of C2H4 occurrence with CO2 concentration (b, mol mol-1). Data of all 24 study
    plots were considered Full size image Discussion Temporal and spatial occurrences
    C2H4 field measurements showed that C2H4 could potentially be measured at all
    sites if the observation time is sufficiently long. This confirms the assumption
    that C2H4 is always produced in soil even under aerobic conditions (Jäckel et
    al. 2004). Furthermore, it suggests that the local C2H4 degradation rate is far
    higher than the C2H4 production rate in soils with high O2 concentration, so much
    so that C2H4 emitted by any source will be directly consumed in the vicinity of
    the source (Hendrickson 1989). Well-aerated soils, therefore, serve primarily
    as a sink for C2H4 (Arshad and Frankenberger 1990). Our study confirms that C2H4
    occurrence is characterized by a high spatial variability, affirming the results
    of the only pure field study on C2H4 conducted by Dowdell et al. (1972). The high
    C2H4 concentrations observed in the laboratory study by Smith and Russell (1969)
    are far from the mean C2H4 occurrence in 1.3% of the gas samples observed in well-aerated
    forest soils of our study. Our findings on factors influencing ethylene occurrence
    are summarized in the diagram Fig. 6. Significantly, more C2H4 can be observed
    in forest ecosystems with soil compaction, and this is further increased by the
    influence of waterlogging in soils. Concerning the depth distribution of C2H4,
    no clear pattern could be identified. While the C2H4 occurrence at the LTEMPs
    decreased with soil depth, the compaction study sites showed a higher ethylene
    occurrence frequency in deeper soil layers. The only clear spatial pattern of
    C2H4 was the enhanced C2H4 detection around roots, owing to C2H4 release by forest
    tree roots. Fig. 6 Important site specific, physical, and chemical soil properties
    influencing C2H4 occurrence and concentration Full size image The episodes of
    increased ethylene detection in the near vicinity of woody roots, which often
    occurred many years after installation of the samplers, do not have to be caused
    by root-related C2H4 production. Increasing radial growth of the roots can compact
    the soil, too, resulting in increased C2H4 release due to local soil compaction.
    Fixed measurement installation positions prevent a clear understanding about the
    current root penetration of the surrounding forest soil. Oxygen effect and the
    correlation with other gas compositions Our analysis confirms that low oxygen
    concentration correlated negatively with C2H4 occurrence at the temporary waterlogged
    Stagnosol site (Fig. 6), with an average O2 concentration in soils with C2H4 detection
    of about 6%. The oxygen effect, could not be observed in the total data set, as
    80% of the gas samples originate from well-aerated forest soils with O2 concentration
    >18%. Anaerobic conditions are considered to be the most important factor influencing
    the increased C2H4 production in soils (Elsgaard 2001; Primrose 1979; Xu and Inubushi
    2009; Zechmeister-Boltenstern and Nikodim 1999). It is assumed that the accumulation
    of C2H4 results from the suppression of the aerobic process of microbial decomposition
    of C2H4 (Arshad and Frankenberger 1990; Cornforth 1975; Smith and Restall 1971).
    The O2 concentration must be very low to have an influence on C2H4 (Hunt et al.
    1981; Meek et al. 1983; Smith and Restall 1971). Besides the oxygen effect, we
    found a significant positive correlation of C2H4 with CO2, CH4, and N2O (Fig.
    6). The positive correlations with these trace gases indirectly confirm the findings
    of low O2 concentrations leading to C2H4 accumulation, as the increase in CO2,
    CH4, and N2O indicates a reduced gas exchange (Pandey et al. 2021). Consequently,
    as the gas exchange is limited, this also leads to an accumulation of C2H4. High
    CO2 concentrations of more than 1 to 2% indicate poor soil aeration, which are
    typically detected in compacted soils (Schack-Kirchner and Hildebrand 1998; Schäffer
    2012), whereas, in our field study, the effect of a more frequent C2H4 detection
    could already be observed at much smaller CO2 concentrations. C2H4 was preferentially
    detected in the subsoil of the compaction study plots, an outcome we interpret
    again as an effect due to low O2 concentrations. Our observation of methane being
    positively correlated with C2H4 is in line with results of Jäckel et al. (2004)
    and Xu et al. (2008), who explained this by the inhibition of methane-oxidizing
    bacteria in an environment of C2H4 accumulation. Furthermore, methanogenic microbes
    are more likely found in anaerobic soils (Conrad 1996), being favorable for C2H4
    accumulation. Similarly, N2O concentrations are positively correlated with C2H4
    occurrence and concentration, as N2O is formed under suboxic conditions during
    denitrification (Bremner and Blackmer 1978), which are favorable conditions for
    C2H4 evolution as well. Compaction effect Although LTEMPs did not show any effect
    of BD on C2H4 occurrence, data of the compaction study sites clearly did (Fig.
    6). The rather low BD in the topsoil of the LTMEPs prevents the accumulation of
    ethylene; thus, the effect of BD does not appear on these plots. Soil compaction
    leads to a twofold increase in the frequency of C2H4 occurrence (7% to 15%) and
    significantly higher C2H4 concentrations compared to reference plots (Fig. 11).
    This effect can be explained by a reduction of the gas diffusion in soils as TPS,
    and more importantly, AFPS are reduced (Pandey et al. 2021). Considering the study
    results of Pandey et al. (2021) on plant growth, this could confirm the theory
    that the release of the plant hormone C2H4 is a warning signal to prevent root
    growth into compacted soil areas. Tree-type effect Due to the common observation
    time of more than 10 years, a clear tree-type effect, with 3.5 times more frequent
    C2H4 detection under spruce than under beech, could be observed. Studies on C2H4
    in coniferous and deciduous forest soils already indicated that C2H4 degradation
    is faster in deciduous forest soils (Zechmeister-Boltenstern and Smith 1998),
    whereas coniferous forest soils show a higher probability of C2H4 accumulation,
    especially under wet conditions (Rigler and Zechmeister-Boltenstern 1999; Sexstone
    and Mains 1990), which lead to contrary results on the tree type effect (Fig.
    6). Reasons for the observed tree species effect could be the combination of gas
    measurements being only down to 10 cm depth and differences in rooting. Whereas
    spruce consists of a shallow root system, beech is a deep-rooted tree (Schmid
    and Kazda 2005). Spruce stands therefore show an enhanced detected root release
    of C2H4 in the upper soil areas, as root density decreases exponentially from
    the upper to the lower soil layers (Schmid and Kazda 2001). This is validated
    by the fact that only spruce plots show patterns of C2H4 root release, which could
    be identified as the main source of C2H4 in soil. Roots are thus the most important
    factor influencing spatial heterogeneity of C2H4 in soil, followed by microbial
    C2H4 production (Hendrickson 1989). The tree species effect was significant using
    the entire LTEPM dataset (Fig. 3) but also evident in a pairwise comparison of
    neighboring beech and spruce plots (Fig. 10). However, the observed root density
    at our plots was surprisingly the same and partly even lower on spruce sites compared
    to beech sites. An increased rooting of the spruce sites in the topsoil could
    therefore not be proven (Fig. 10). However, measuring root densities by counting
    root tips in soil profiles includes a high inherent uncertainty. More obvious
    is a microbial component/contribution of the tree species effect. Arbuscular mycorrhizal
    fungi (AMF) communities are different for tree species (Rożek et al. 2020). AMF
    on spruce roots could be specialized in C2H4 production, whereas AMF on beech
    roots adapted to C2H4 degradation. Yet this was not tested, nor is there clear
    evidence of this in the literature. Finally, it was shown that soils under beech
    and spruce differ in CO2 respiration rate (Berger et al. 2010), resulting in the
    assumption that beech sites have higher C2H4 oxidation rates than spruce sites.
    In combination with the observed higher SOM-content, identified as influential
    on the C2H4 occurrence among others by Goodlass and Smith (1978), beech sites
    may provide a more microbial activity in soil (Achilles et al. 2021), leading
    to rapid degradation of C2H4 by microorganisms in the soil and complicating detection.
    The different characteristics of soils under beech and spruce were no object in
    our study. Additional physical and chemical soil parameters For pH, SOM-content,
    and liming, no effect on C2H4 could be detected (Fig. 6). This coincides with
    the result of the study conducted by Lindberg et al. (1979). Findings of laboratory
    studies in pH having a negative correlation with C2H4 concentrations (Arshad and
    Frankenberger Jr 1991; Zechmeister-Boltenstern and Smith 1998; Zechmeister-Boltenstern
    and Nikodim 1999) were not confirmed in our study. This is probably because all
    our sites are acidic, and soil pH values do not differ substantially between the
    monitoring plots. Furthermore, there are probably other relevant site characteristics
    having an impact on C2H4 that possibly mask the effect of soil pH. Unfortunately,
    the analysis of the data of our liming plots did not yield reliable results, since
    the overall occurrence of CH4 was too low, or the monitoring period was too short.
    Analysis of air and soil temperature effects on C2H4 at the LTEMPs led to ambiguous
    results. Reported heat activation by microorganisms producing C2H4 (Lynch 1975;
    Sexstone and Mains 1990; Smith and Cook 1974; Smith and Dowdell 1974; Smith and
    Restall 1971; Xu and Inubushi 2009) could only be partially detected due to a
    partial preferential occurrence in the summer months in the data of the project
    studies. Typical repeated temporal or even seasonal pattern could not be detected.
    The impact of precipitation and SWC on C2H4, by contrast, seems to confirm the
    findings of other studies (Dowdell et al. 1972; Hunt et al. 1981; Lindberg et
    al. 1979; Otani and Ae 1993; Zechmeister-Boltenstern and Nikodim 1999). C2H4 measurements
    >0 μmol mol−1 were predominately observed after rainfall, which can be explained
    by a reduced O2 concentration in wet soils; thus, lower decomposing rates of C2H4
    (Sawada et al. 1985; Zechmeister-Boltenstern and Smith 1998), as well as a reduced
    gas diffusion in the air-filled soil pore space (Lynch 1975). Since sandy soils
    showed a higher C2H4 detection frequency than silty soils, but C2H4 concentrations
    were higher in silty soils, there is a contrary effect of soil texture on C2H4.
    Results of the study of Van Cleemput et al. (1983), stating that C2H4 preferentially
    occurs in sandy soils, can thus only be partly validated. It must be noted that
    clayey soils were not present in our study. Conclusion The analysis of our extensive
    dataset (more than 50,000 from 1994 to 20201 on 24 plots) showed that the detection
    of C2H4 is extremely infrequent in forest soils, and, except for sampling gas
    next to main roots, it does not exhibit distinct temporal and spatial patterns.
    The investigation of the temporal and spatial distributions did not show any systematic
    or seasonal patterns. Therefore, a direct influence of environmental parameters,
    such as soil temperature and moisture, could not be observed. Nevertheless, C2H4
    does not occur randomly in soils. A cluster structure with hot moments (C2H4-rich
    years) and hot spots (C2H4-rich plots) is evident, though thus far it cannot be
    explained. The most important soil-related and exogenous factors influencing C2H4
    occurrence are soil compaction and high water contents, leading to low O2 and
    elevated CO2 concentrations in the soil. Both factors inhibit microbial activity,
    allowing accumulation of produced C2H4 in anaerobic soils. Furthermore, the tree
    species had a clear effect on C2H4. Soils under spruce show an increased C2H4
    occurrence than soils under beech. A reason for this might be the different root
    system or higher microbial activity in beech stands, which leads to faster degradation
    of C2H4 and reduces the C2H4 detection frequency. In well-aerated upland forest
    soils, in turn, high oxygen levels usually prevail, and an unhindered gas exchange
    can take place. This leads to the rapid diffusion and degradation of C2H4 with
    low probability of C2H4 accumulation in soil. Furthermore, the study presents
    a statistical approach for the challenging evaluation of left-censored data sets
    with a high number of zero measurements, which could provide reliable results
    about the factors influencing C2H4 occurrence even in well-aerated forest soils.
    Although the scope of our study on ethylene occurrence is unique, the importance
    of long term monitoring programs must be emphasized. Each additional measurement
    facilitates the statistical analysis and identification of natural influencing
    factors. Data Availability The authors confirm that the data supporting the findings
    of this study are available within the article or its supplementary materials.

  description: Wastewater treatment plants play a significant role in minimizing environmental
    pollution by treating wastewater and reducing the release of contaminants into
    the environment. However, their operation can still have an environmental footprint.
    Therefore, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of wastewater treatment provides a comprehensive
    framework to quantify the environmental impact of plants across various categories.
    By conducting LCA assessments, the environmental impacts of different scenarios
    or treatment technologies can be compared, enabling decision-makers to identify
    the most environmentally friendly options. This information helps in optimizing
    the plant's design, operation, and resource allocation to minimize their environmental
    burden. The current research hypothesis was to conduct an LCA of a typical activated
    sludge plant in Greece, considering three different scenarios in order to provide
    an innovative take on wastewater treatment plant foam waste and utilize them for
    the production of biogas through anaerobic digestion. The assessment was carried
    out using OpenLCA software as well as EcoInvent v3.3. database. The study focused
    on the impact assessment of five categories (eutrophication potential, acidification
    potential, global warming potential, ozone depletion, and photochemical ozone
    creation). The results indicated that the baseline scenario had the highest impact
    on these categories, followed by Scenario I, while Scenario II had the least impact.
    Additionally, the cumulative energy demand assessment showed that the baseline
    scenario required significantly more energy compared to Scenarios I and II. However,
    Scenario II, which involved fine screens and utilization of biogas, exhibited
    the highest energy production, thereby reducing the overall energy demands for
    the system. Based on these findings, it is crucial for wastewater treatment facilities
    to actively pursue energy demand mitigation strategies by implementing energy-efficient
    technologies and utilizing biogas. These measures not only contribute to environmental
    protection but also promote a greener and more sustainable future for WWTP operations.

    impactBiogas 1. Introduction Waste and wastewater management and treatment has
    been a crucial sector of society and civilization throughout time (Biancardi et
    al., 2023). The first wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was introduced in the
    early 18th century by Robert Thom in Scotland (AET, 2019). In the mid-19th century
    in Europe, the first WWTP was established and is generally evidence of sociological
    aspects and technological advancements (Gallego-Schmid and Tarpani, 2019). The
    increasing urbanization and industrialization of the last century has increased
    the volume of municipal wastewater production worldwide while by 2050, 62% of
    the global population is expected to live in urban areas according to the United
    Nations department of Economic and Social Affairs (United Nations, 2018; Zorpas,
    2011). Wastewater treatment market worldwide reached 281 billion USD in 2021 and
    expected to rise to 490 billion USD by 2029 (Statista, 2022a). Respectively, wastewater
    treatment equipment market size value in 2021 reached 5324 billion USD globally
    and is expected to grow to 85 billion USD until 2030, fueled by rising demand
    of clean water access worldwide (Statista, 2022b). In developed countries, wastewater
    collection and treatment are adequate, covering usually over 80–99% of the population
    in each country. According to (Prochaska and Zouboulis, 2020), Greece has accomplished
    wastewater infrastructure constructions for 91% of the population. At the same
    time, Germany has a highly efficient wastewater management system, with nearly
    99% of the population having access to adequate wastewater collection and treatment
    services while France also boasts a comprehensive wastewater collection and treatment
    system, with over 95% of the population (Eurostat, 2022; Yang et al., 2019). Sanitation
    and good quality wastewater with low concentrations of pollutants, following the
    legislative guidelines, keeps the environment and citizens safe thus, urban sanitation
    has been a priority for years (Symeonides et al., 2019). The presence of heavy
    metals or potentially toxic element pollution in urban soils can have severe impact
    on human health (Aslanidis and Golia, 2022). Contamination of crops and water
    sources by metals like lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and chromium can lead
    to neurological disorders, developmental delays, kidney damage, increased cancer
    risks, and respiratory issues (Bost et al., 2016; Chasapis et al., 2020). Ensuring
    good quality wastewater treatment and sanitation services in urban areas has been
    a long-standing priority due to its significant impact on public health, environmental
    preservation, and sustainable development. The provision of quality sanitation
    services in urban areas contributes to sustainable development by fostering economic
    growth, improving living conditions, and reducing healthcare costs associated
    with water-related illnesses. Moreover, proper sanitation practices protect the
    environment by preventing water pollution and preserving ecosystems. Additionally,
    sustainable water management is promoted through wastewater recycling and reuse,
    thereby conserving freshwater resources (Jaladhi et al., 2016). Still, even if
    improvements have been made, obstacles and shortcomings remain on a global scale
    where sufficient sanitation services of wastewater still lack quality (Gallego-Schmid
    and Tarpani, 2019). Such obstacles include but are not limited to lack of sufficient
    infrastructure, financial constraints, limited technical capacity, population
    growth and climate change as well as public behavior and awareness (Obaideen et
    al., 2022). According to Statista (2022d), in 2020 44% of domestic wastewater
    flow is not safely treated, a percentage that also varies according to the area
    under investigation. 80% of household wastewater is treated safely in North America
    and Europe while less than 30% is treated safely in Africa (Sub-Saharan region)
    and Central/Southern Asia (Statista, 2022c). At the same time, Veolia Environmental
    S.A., one of the leading waste management companies worldwide, collected 5.2 billion
    cubic meters of wastewater in 2021 while 4.6 billion cubic meters were treated
    (Statista, 2021, 2022d). Furthermore, according to Eurostat (2022), in 2020 the
    Netherlands have the highest percentage of the population connected to at least
    a secondary wastewater treatment (99.52%) followed by Austria (99.10%) and Luxembourg
    (98.30%). On the same scale, Greece had 94.20% of the population connected to
    at least secondary wastewater treatment in 2020, while in Cyprus, 82.65% was connected
    in 2018 (Eurostat, 2022). On the other end, Albania (30.90%), Serbia (13.77%)
    and Malta (6.54%) have the lowest percentage of connected population to secondary
    treatment in 2021. The European Environment Agency (EEA) has published a new interactive
    map of the status of all WWTPs in Europe, based on data from 2020 in EU-27 (2020)
    countries plus Iceland, which were reported by countries in 2022 (European Environment
    Agency, 2023). Moreover, the connection of households to WWTPs per country level
    can be found in the OECD relevant platform (OECD, 2023). According to EEA map,
    20116 WWTPs performing in EU, receiving effluents from 539 million PE, and covering
    96% of the total population. Austria and the Netherlands are fully compliant to
    Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, some member states like Spain, Portugal
    and Ireland are having difficulties with the implementation of the Directive,
    while for some countries there are no data available. Besides the European database
    of WWTP''s a global database of 58,000 WWTP''s exists from HydroWASTE combiningnational
    and regional data sets (Ehalt Macedo et al., 2021). About 1.2 million km of the
    global river network contains treated wastewater from upstream WWTPs, while about
    90000 km of this network receives effluent from treatment plants that only provide
    primary wastewater treatment. In recent years, the efforts to optimize the performance
    of WWTPs has shifted from obtaining good effluent to ensuring sustainability and
    economic viability. WWTPs are considered as the highest municipal energy consumers
    (Panepinto et al., 2016). Aerobic processes are highly energy-demanding techniques
    with an average energy input reported to range from 0.30 to 1.89 kWh/m3 depending
    on the treatment method used and the influent properties (Gu et al., 2017a). Secondary
    aeration accounts for about 50% of the total electricity demand and 25–40% of
    the plant operating costs (Gu et al., 2017b; Henriques and Catarino, 2017). This
    issue is becoming crucial since the overall energy demand by WWTPs in European
    countries is estimated at 27 TWh/yr (Statistical Office of the EU, 2017). Therefore,
    main environmental concerns arising from WWTPs are greenhouse gasses (GHGs) emissions
    and energy consumption. GHGs emissions from WWTPs are mainly carbon dioxide (CO2),
    methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) during the biological wastewater treatment
    processes while CO2 is also present in the required energy produced for the operation
    of the plant. Regarding N2O, it is generally produced by nitrification/denitrification
    processes for the removal of nitrogenous compounds from wastewater. The production
    results mainly from the activated sludge unit and the sludge storage tank by 90%
    and 10% respectively (Campos et al., 2016). In the United States alone, there
    are 1480 WWTPs treating 32345 million gallons/day on average, adding over 21 million
    metric tons of GHGs emissions each year. Energy consumption of WWTPs represents
    30% of total operation/maintenance cost and 80% of the GHGs emissions of the plants.
    At the same time, sewage sludge byproduct requires treatment that includes at
    least thickening, mechanical stabilization followed by centrifugation before the
    final disposal accounting to about 30% of the operation cost, while anaerobic
    digestion (AD) is commonly used for sludge treatment and the production of biogas.
    When not managed properly, biogas production constitutes a a main source of GHGs
    emissions from the WWTPs. Thus utilization of biogas production and optimization
    of the production line is significant for reducing the environmental footprint
    of the plant (Shen et al., 2015). Moreover, adequate management of the biosolids
    at a WWTP is important for the amount of produced energy (Gikas, 2014). In countries
    of the European Union (EU), upgrades of the wastewater treatment facilities and
    equipment are already in place (Lehtoranta et al., 2022). The EU has made several
    steps to ensure clean water and sanitation as well as safe wastewater treatment
    which would be aligned with the European Green Deal for carbon neutrality by 2050
    and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) (Ali et
    al., 2023). Specifically, optimization of WWTPs sustainability contributes to
    the distribution of clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), ensuring the health of
    the general public (SDG 3), ensures industry and infrastructural innovation (SDG
    9) and the creation of sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11) (Loizia et
    al., 2021; United Nations, 2015). At the same time, according to the Water Framework
    Directive (2000/60/EC) the protection and sustainable management of water resources
    in the EU is vital, with a primary objective to achieve and maintain good water
    status for all inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters, and
    groundwater (Official Journal of the European Communities, 2000). Thanks to the
    Urban Wastewater treatment directive (UWWTD) (91/271/EEC, UWWTD), established
    in 1991, an objective to protect the environment from the effects of urban wastewater
    treatment was introduced. The directive concerns the collection, treatment and
    discharge of wastewater (i.e. domestic, industrial) and requires, among other,
    the treatment of all discharges from agglomerations over 2000 population equivalents
    (p.e.), advanced treatment from over 10000 p.e., monitoring of performance of
    the treatment plants, control of sewage sludge and reuse where appropriate (Official
    Journal of the European Communities, 1991). In the recent proposal for a recast
    of the UWWTD, presented by the European Commission in October 2022, specific concerns
    were identified aiming to turn the wastewater treatment sector energy, resource
    and climate neutral (European Commission, 2022). More specifically, the recast
    updated the existing directive to address emerging challenges and align it with
    new environmental goals, expanding into the scope of microplastics and emerging
    contaminants, implementing stricter treatment standards to improve the removal
    of pollutants, enhancing implementation and monitoring mechanisms, promoting resource
    recovery and the circular economy, and considering climate change adaptation in
    wastewater management (D''Adamo, 2019). In order to be aligned to European Green
    Deal, additional efforts are claimed in this document on the reduction of GHG
    emissions from wastewater treatment facilities accounting to around 34.45 million
    tonnes CO2 eq./year corresponding to 0.86% of the total EU emissions and the decrease
    in the sector energy consumption representing around 0.8% of the total energy
    use in the EU. Therefore, considerable work is needed to identify efficient methods
    for energy auditing and for the implementation of appropriate measures to address
    the new guidelines. Towards that direction, research efforts are focused on the
    use of alternative resources to increase the energy production through biogas
    formed during anaerobic digestion. Such as approach is becoming significant, considering
    the high energy content of influent wastewater, accounting to about 14.7 kJ/g
    chemical oxygen demand (COD), which is about nine times higher than the corresponding
    energy demand by aerobic degradation (Ioannis and M, 2004). Potential sources
    for energy harvesting therefore, could be found among the products collected during
    pre-treatment and primary treatment of wastewater, such as screenings and fats,
    oil and grease materials (FOG) collected usually in the aerated grit removal tank:
    it has been reported that screenings from a 15 mm screen in a municipal WWTP had
    a net biochemical methane production (BMP) exceeding 700 L methane/kg volatile
    solids (VS) (Tsiakiri et al., 2021). The valorization of the energy content of
    these materials is not usually considered, since they are produced in small daily
    amounts, although contributing to about half of the organic matter of the raw
    wastewater (Le Hyaric et al., 2009). Moreover, other sources for energy production
    are identified in the fine solid fraction of influent to a WWTP, with diameters
    as low as 300 μm (Lemonidis et al., 2022). Screens with opening of at least 5
    mm are often applied in conventional WWTPs, while fine mesh screens of smaller
    diameters, 350 to 850 μm, are applied in certain countries, such as Norway, as
    the single step for the treatment of influents without any biological stage (Rusten
    and Lundar, 2006). On the other hand, fine screens removal is a prerequisite as
    a measure to address membrane fouling due to cake layer formation, in the advanced
    Membrane Bioreactor processes (Schier et al., 2009). Therefore, considerable work
    is taken place to develop appropriate methods for the extraction of the energy
    content of raw wastewater, aiming to turn it from an energy consuming to zero
    energy system, or even to power producer. However, the holistic environmental
    impact of the integrated process has not been identified, including the techniques
    for the separation of solids, their transportation and the following valorization
    by anaerobic digestion, as well as the expected gains in biogas production, in
    order to evaluate the alignment to the new EU energy policy. The aim of the current
    work is the determination of the environmental footprint of an activated sludge
    process that includes appropriate measures for the energy valorization of primary
    solids received from raw wastewater, and the identification of the additional
    benefits expected by the implementation of these measures compared to a conventional
    system. Towards that objective, the assessment of the environmental impact will
    be carried out utilizing the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. 1.1. State
    of the art (LCA and WWTPs) To monitor the adverse effects of wastewater treatment
    and comply with environmental legislations, LCA methodology is often used. LCA
    is an environmental tool used to examine and analyze the entire life cycle of
    a process, system, or product to find potential environmental impacts from raw
    material acquisition, use, end-of-life treatment, recycling and disposal (Tsangas
    et al., 2020). According to the International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO), specifically ISO 14040:2006 for Environmental Management and LCA principles,
    there are four main steps for conducting a reliable and valid LCA (ISO, 2006).
    Firstly, the goal and scope of the study must be defined including the determination
    of the functional unit (FU), the system boundaries and the level of the analysis.
    Secondly, the collection of necessary data for the study system is to be performed
    in the second stage, namely through the life cycle inventory (LCI). To gather
    information for the results of the LCI data and assess the environmental impact
    of the system, the third stage is the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA). Lastly,
    the life cycle interpretation phase ensures the analysis and discussion of LCI
    and LCIA results (Gallego-Schmid and Tarpani, 2019). LCA has been used to quantify
    the environmental impact of WWTPs. LCA is deemed useful in the evaluation of WWTP
    technologies and processes as it captures trade-offs along different categories
    of environmental concern (i.e. water use, energy consumption, emissions etc.).
    It serves as a useful decision-making support tool to examine alternative scenarios
    of operation alongside and during strategic planning of the wastewater sector
    (Corominas et al., 2020). Different environmental performance optimization analysis
    has been conducted in order to evaluate wastewater treatment. Particularly, environmental
    impact through LCA has been focused on WWTPs using membrane bioreactor technologies
    (MBR) (Buyukkamaci, 2013; McNamara et al., 2016; Piao et al., 2016; Raghuvanshi
    et al., 2017; Rodriguez-Garcia et al., 2013; Santucci et al., 2012; Tabesh et
    al., 2019). Mahmood et al. (2013) gave an overview of previous LCA studies regarding
    membrane technology, identifying that membrane processes of WWTPs contribute to
    the environmental impact and electricity consumption. Yet, their study did not
    give a specific range of impact values. Nevertheless, through their discussion,
    Mahmood et al. (2013) indicated and analyzed the tools used to analyze and evaluate
    the sustainability levels like Eco Indicator 95, Eco Indicator 99, Green Pro,
    and the Life Cycle Index (LInX) (Mahmood et al., 2013; Razman et al., 2022). Monticelli
    and Zanelli (2016) reviewed the architectural aspects of membranes, focusing on
    the pre-use phases of membranes and identifying than the design stage is key component
    in improving sustainability efficiency of WWTPs. Lastly, used LCA to quantitatively
    provide an inventory of consumed resources during MBRs and estimate emission production
    during construction, operation as well as end-of-life treatment of MBR units (Razman
    et al., 2022; Rodriguez-Garcia et al., 2013). In order to improve effluent quality
    and reduce energy consumption, Borzooei et al. (2019) used a multi-step simulation-based
    methodology and a scenario-based optimization approach are used while Sun et al.
    (2019) defined environmental impact scores in order to evaluate WWT discharge.
    They performed the evaluation by considering the volume and quality of wastewater
    in main processes of the treatment. In combination with economy efficiency, LCA
    has been used by Piao et al. (2016), 2016 to propose alternatives for sludge treatment
    and management in urban areas. The methodology has also been found appropriate
    for assessing the sustainability of WWTPs design in decentralized systems located
    in rural areas (Machado et al., 2007). Nguyen et al. (2020) analyzed the environmental
    impact of the construction phase investigating building materials and transport
    for civil works (Nguyen et al., 2020) while Zepon Tarpani and Azapagic (2018)
    assessed advanced WWT technologies for the removal of pharmaceutical products.
    Through the literature, the impact categories of LCA analysis for WWTP revealed
    that energy consumption is the subject under investigation in most studies (Adibimanesh
    et al., 2023; Aghabalaei et al., 2023; Ferrentino et al., 2023; Pesqueira et al.,
    2020). Several of them, evaluate GHGs emissions, eutrophication and toxicity while
    the global warming potential (GWP) is a very commonly calculated impact category
    (Banti et al., 2020; Buyukkamaci, 2013). Furthermore, ozone depletion potential,
    photochemical ozone creation potential and acidification potential are also mentioned
    throughout these studies. Through these categories, a range of environmental implications
    affected by different stages of the WWT (i.e. construction, operation, demolition)
    to treat influent are analyzed (Fang et al., 2016; Ioannou-Ttofa et al., 2016;
    Li et al., 2013; Machado et al., 2007; McNamara et al., 2016; Rodriguez-Garcia
    et al., 2013; Tabesh et al., 2019). 2. Methodology 2.1. Goal and scope The goal
    of the current study is to investigate and analyze the environmental implications
    of different treatment approaches for energy valorization of the energy content
    of raw wastewater products in a WWTP. The boundaries of the system under study
    are presented in Fig. 1. This system is representative of an activated sludge
    unit, including pretreatment and primary treatment stages consisting in coarse
    screens and grit removal, secondary treatment involving an aeration tank followed
    by sedimentation, while anaerobic digestion is applied for the stabilization of
    excess sludge. Download : Download high-res image (992KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. System boundaries. LCA will be performed comparing three
    different alternative operation scenarios, that were selected based on the available
    experimental data from previous works, and aiming to provide the integrated assessment
    of the corresponding processes that can be utilized for valorization of influent
    wastewater solids, reducing the energy demand of the target WWTP. The three examined
    scenarios were the following: Scenario 0 (Baseline Scenario- BLS): Collection
    of screenings and floaming from entrance works and transportation to a sanitary
    landfill. Scenario I (SI): Collection of primary screenings and foaming, following
    to grinding and pumped to the existing sludge anaerobic digester. Scenario II
    (SII): Installation of fine screens after sand collection for the removal of small
    diameter (≤500 μm) and utilization to anaerobic digestion. That approach is expected
    to benefit from the additional biogas production, as well as by the reduction
    of aeration energy demand in the activated sludge tank, due to the lower oxygen
    uptake rate of effluents from the fine screens. The three scenarios are to be
    compared as such: Scope 1: BLS vs SI. Scope 2: BLS vs SII. Scope 3: BLS vs SI
    + SII. Scope 4: SI vs SII. The system will be assessed and used by WWTP designers,
    policy makers, Sewage treatment plant (STP) experts, consultants, and operators
    for the reduction of the environmental footprint of WWTP and to optimize energy
    recovered from anaerobic digestion (Cucchiella et al., 2011). 2.2. Functional
    unit (FU) The FU will reflect a marketable product. To mathematically normalize
    and for easier comparison and measurement, the functional unit will be measurable
    and determined clearly (ISO, 2006). According to many researchers (Banti et al.,
    2020; Machado et al., 2007; McNamara et al., 2016; Raghuvanshi et al., 2017; Tsangas
    et al., 2020), the FU for wastewater treatment LCA can be the influent generated
    per person equivalent, one population equivalent, inflow quantity per day etc.
    The FU to be used in the current LCA for the data collection and inventory formulation
    will be 1 m3 of influent wastewater. This FU has been used in the past with satisfactory
    results (Dimitra C. Banti et al., 2020; Ioannou-Ttofa et al., 2016; Piao et al.,
    2016). Piao et al. (2016), used the FU of 1 m3 of influent to normalize the results
    of an LCA on three WWTPs considering their different treatment capacities, processes,
    and influent compositions. The combined total treatment capacity of the three
    WWTPs was 1100000 m3, which served as the reference for evaluating the proposed
    integrated sludge management system. This integration involved combining the sludge
    treatment processes of the three WWTPs into a single, unified system. Similarly,
    Ioannou-Ttofa et al. (2016), used the FU of 1 m3 of influent wastewater, which
    was tied to the efficient treatment of urban wastewater and the elimination of
    a specific antibiotic compound, sulfamethoxazole. Thus, the selected FU represented
    the \"effective treatment of 1 m3 of urban wastewater\" to accurately capture
    the scope of their analysis. 2.3. Data collection The primary data have been directly
    collected from a typical WWTP in Greece employing the method of activated sludge.
    The data were collected by direct contact with the personnel of the plant operator,
    covering a period of three years using a questionnaire. The questionnaire was
    created made using Google Forms and distributed to staff and members of the WWTPs.
    In brief, the questionnaire comprised of questions in line with the data needed
    to complete the LCI like electricity consumption in each process, waste, influent,
    effluent, chemicals and others. An initial General Data Protection Regulation
    (GDPR) statement and brief description of the research was given while the survey
    was designed and conducted according to Greek and Cypriot legislation and institutional
    requirements. Participants signed an informed consent form before participation
    and distribution of their results among the research team while the termination
    of their anonymous participation could be imminent whenever they decided. Furthermore,
    secondary data (background data) have been obtained by LCA databases (ecoinvent,
    ecospold etc.) and the literature. Tertiary data have been calculated using principal
    engineering concepts (mass and energy balance systems). 2.4. Impact categories
    Similarly, to previous researchers, all potential environmental impacts of the
    operation of the system under study will be covered, including effects on air,
    water and soil (Dimitra C Banti et al., 2020; García-Sánchez and Güereca, 2019;
    Machado et al., 2007; Piao et al., 2016; Tabesh et al., 2019). Therefore, the
    main environmental impact categories chosen for analysis in LCIA for the three
    scenarios are the eutrophication potential (EP) given in kg PO4-eq_FU−1, the acidification
    potential (AP) given in kg SO2-eq_FU−1, the GWP given in kg CO2-eq_FU−1 over a
    100 years period, the ozone depletion potential (ODP) given in kg CFC-11-eq_FU−1
    and the photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) in kg C2H4-eq_FU−1. 2.5.
    Unit under study The treatment plant has a design capacity of about 42000 m3/day,
    corresponding to a population equivalent of 210000 persons. The plant is located
    in Central Greece and services an area with mixed activities, urban, rural and
    agro-industrial. The flow diagram of the subsequent treatment steps includes the
    following steps: at the pretreatment stage influents are passed through a 50 mm
    bar screen, followed by a 15 mm mechanical bar screen system consisting in three
    units. Wastewater is then fed to three aerated grit removal chambers, each one
    with volume 165 m3 for the removal of sand, debris and floating materials (fats,
    oils). Primary treatment includes two pairs of circular sedimentation basin of
    25 m diameter for the removal of smaller particles. Wastewater then is fed to
    the activated sludge unit consisting of four orthogonal aeration tanks with a
    total volume of 22090 m3. Each tank consists in an anaerobic bio-selector compartment
    for phosphorous removal, an anoxic denitrification zone for nitrates reduction,
    and an aeration compartment for organic carbon oxidation. Aeration provided by
    surface aearators in the two aeration tanks and by immersed diffusers in the other
    two. The mixed liquor from each pair of aeration tank is fed to a pair of secondary
    settling basins, each one with 37 m diameter. The supernatant from the sedimentation
    tanks is subjected to chlorine disinfection prior to its discharge through two
    meandric type 900 m3 contact tanks. Sludge from the primary settling tanks is
    pumped to two similar 600 m3 mechanical thickeners, while secondary excess sludge
    is fed to two mechanical centrifuges each one with a capacity of 40 m3/h. Thickened
    sludge is then fed to a 460 m3 homogenization tank, and then to four cylindrical
    anaerobic digesters, each one of 1600 m3 volume. Anaerobic digestion is carried
    out at the mesophilic temperature, at around 38 °C. Gas produced from anaerobic
    digestion ranges from 80 to 120 m3/h and is purified through a sand filter for
    the removal of moisture, an alkaline stripping unit for hydrogen sulfide removal
    and a ceramic filter for particulates removal and then is fed to two Jenbacher
    gas generators of 330 kW electric power and 421 kW thermal power. Digested sludge
    is stored in two 400 m3 tanks, while produced biogas is stored in two gas tanks
    with a total volume 800 m3. At the final stage sludge is fed to two filter pressed,
    each one with 20 m3/h capacity, while leachates from sludge treatment are recycled
    at the primary treatment stage of the plant. The characteristic properties of
    influent and effluent from the plant are provided in the following Table 1. Concerning
    wastewater conductivity, it usually follows the corresponding of surface waters,
    although values as high as 15 mS/cm have been measured seasonally at various WWTP
    due to salt intrusion in the collection sewage network and the main transportation
    pipe to the plant (Sá et al., 2022). Table 1. Characteristic parameters of influent

    the open-source free software OpenLCA was used, developed by GreenDelta. Free
    and commercial LCA databases and LCIA methods can be uploaded and used with this
    software while it also offers the ability to connect LCI elements and quantify
    LCIA (Banti et al., 2020; Weidema et al., 2013). 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

    the system under investigation. For all systems under study, the LCA includes
    all input and output data collected from the WWTPs by their daily operation. The
    data collected involved materials, energy, electricity requirements, production
    per day, biogas production, waste production and transport. Many elements of the
    LCI have been collected from LCA databases like Ecoinvent while where no data
    were available, similar elements were chosen to fill in the missing information.

    and assessment of primary data, questionnaires and surveys were used while secondary
    data were obtained using trustworthy LCA databases. Data quality assessment is
    depicted in Table 3 for primary and secondary data, including average results
    from all three scenarios prepared according to guidelines by Ecoinvent v3.3 (Weidema
    et al., 2013). The five quality indicators used were: reliability, completeness,
    temporal correlation, geographical correlation and further technological correlation,
    scaled from 1 to 5 (1 being the best correlation and quality of data). Primary
    data constitute high quality inputs while secondary data arising from databases
    and concern background systems could be substantially improved. One of the main
    areas lacking data quality is the fact that even if Mediterranean areas are included-for
    the most part-in the databases, there were no available data for Cyprus and thus
    the authors had to choose data concerning areas with similar climatic conditions
    (i.e. Spain, France). One major issue concerned the origin of the electricity
    mixed used. Due to the lack of data, the assumption was made that the electricity
    mix for all three scenarios comprised of 75% oil and coal and only 25% of renewable
    energy sources, according to literature. At the same time, the sludge used from
    the Nexus database was assumed to contain 22–33% dry matter as an average of dewatering
    technologies. Furthermore, authors had to use basic engineering and chemistry
    calculations in order to provide adequate conversions according to the data available.
    Further assumptions included the composition of municipal wastewater as well as
    the brand of machinery used (i.e. lorry, digestion, aeration tank) which could
    not be specified from LCA databases but were chosen in close proximity with the
    questionnaires provided. Regarding the composition of municipal wastewater influent
    as well as screenings and foaming composition, the authors found a large gap of
    data concerning the quantified composition of them. In this regard, the authors
    could not find specific flows for sanitary textiles for bulky screening. Therefore,
    it was assumed that sanitary textiles comprised only sanitary towels, which were
    100% made from Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Simultaneously, the authors assumed
    that the amount of digestate produced accounts for 70–90% of the feedstock weight,
    thus calculating the outflow from the aeration treatment process of the system.

    In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have employed LCA to evaluate
    the environmental impact of WWTPs (Ioannou-Ttofa et al., 2016; Kalboussi et al.,
    2022; Mahmood et al., 2013; Pesqueira et al., 2020; Tabesh et al., 2019). It is
    important to acknowledge that the results of LCA related to WWTPs are specific
    to each individual case. These outcomes can vary depending on factors such as
    system design, process selection, scale, wastewater quality, and other considerations
    (Zang et al., 2015). Nevertheless, certain general conclusions can still be drawn
    regarding the factors that contribute to each impact category in WWTPs. According
    to the results presented in Table 4 and Fig. 3, the BLS exhibited much higher
    values in the five impact categories. The biggest difference the impact categories
    for the BLS, SI and SII was depicted for GWP which was 0.57271, 0.36077 and 0.20708
    CO2 eq/FU respectively, as shown in Table 4. In the context of global warming,
    it appears that the most impactful energy factor is the use of environmental credits
    associated with electricity usage and energy released from anaerobic digestion.
    Conversely, research suggests that WWTPs contribute to global warming potential
    comparable to electricity generation based on fossil fuels (Daskiran et al., 2022;
    Zang et al., 2015). Table 4. Impact assessment of the five impact categories for

    for all three scenarios. According to Li et al. (2021) after conducting a statistical
    analysis of 89 case estimates, it was observed that electricity consumption in
    the studied context ranged from 0.036 to 2.17 kWh/m3. In terms of various environmental
    impact categories, there were 109 estimates for GWP with a range of 0.055–5.3
    kg CO2-eq/m3. Additionally, there were 79 estimates for EP ranging from −1.63
    × 10−4 to 1.07 kg PO43−eq./m3, 78 estimates for AP ranging from −6.60 × 10−5 to
    0.23 kg SO2 eq/m3, 29 estimates for ODP ranging from −0.79 × 10−8 to 1.58 × 10−7
    kg CFC−11eq/m3, estimates for POCP ranging from −1.40 × 10−6 to 4.05 × 10−3 kg
    ethylene eq./m3 (Li et al., 2021). As depicted in Table 4, the results of this
    study fall in line with the general values of the impact categories chosen for
    WWTPs. Regarding EP, it is widely recognized as one of the significant impacts
    of WWTPs, although these systems typically aim to mitigate eutrophic emissions.
    Numerous studies have identified wastewater effluents from WWTPs as major contributors
    to eutrophication due to the presence of residual nutrients, particularly nitrogen
    and phosphorus (Li et al., 2021; Machado et al., 2007; Pintilie et al., 2016;
    Zang et al., 2015). Other potential factors that may contribute include the consumption
    of fossil-based electricity and chemicals, as well as nutrient runoff from soil
    to water when sewage sludge is applied to agricultural land (Notarnicola et al.,
    2023; Pintilie et al., 2016). According to Golia et al. (2021), sewage sludge
    derived from urban and industrial WWTPs has traditionally been disposed of in
    landfills, either in its raw form or after undergoing incineration. However, due
    to its high concentration of nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sulfur
    (S), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), and calcium (Ca), there has been an interest in
    utilizing it as an agricultural amendment to enhance soil fertility and structure.
    Nonetheless, sewage sludge also contains potentially harmful substances, including
    heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, which can pose long-term risks
    of soil contamination. While the primary focus of WWTPs is to treat wastewater
    and reduce its environmental impact, certain activities within the treatment process
    can contribute to AP. The presence of organic acids and acid-forming compounds
    as well as in some cases the incomplete removal or neutralization of acidic components
    during the treatment process can lead to elevated AP. Additionally, anaerobic
    digestion can generate acidic byproducts if not properly controlled. Insufficient
    alkalinity buffering capacity and imbalanced pH control within the treatment system
    can also contribute to increased AP (Banti et al., 2020; Guven et al., 2018).
    Furthermore, the energy consumption associated with WWTP operations, including
    electricity use for pumps, aeration, and other processes, can indirectly contribute
    to acidification potential. The generation of electricity from fossil fuels releases
    sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which can lead to acid rain when
    these pollutants combine with atmospheric moisture (Preisner et al., 2021; Rahmberg
    et al., 2020). According to existing literature (Banti et al., 2020; Guven et
    al., 2018; Rashid and Liu, 2020), WWTPs do not directly contribute to ozone ODP
    and POCP since ozone-depleting substances are not typically used or emitted in
    the wastewater treatment process. However, indirect contributions to ODP may occur
    through certain aspects of WWTP operations. One potential indirect contribution
    to ODP is the use of chemicals in the treatment process. Although ozone-depleting
    substances are not commonly employed in WWTPs, certain chemicals used for disinfection
    or odor control purposes may have ozone-depleting properties. If these chemicals
    are released into the atmosphere during their production, use, or disposal, they
    can contribute to ozone depletion (Nguyen et al., 2020). Furthermore, the energy
    consumption associated with WWTP operations can indirectly impact ODP. The generation
    of electricity for running pumps, blowers, and other equipment may involve the
    use of substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons
    (HCFCs) in the cooling or insulation systems of power plants. Leakage or improper
    management of these substances can lead to their release into the atmosphere,
    contributing to ozone depletion (Venkatesh and Brattebø, 2011). WWTPs are recognized
    as energy-intensive sectors, often associated with substantial energy usage. Numerous
    processes within these plants necessitate energy input, such as water pumping,
    aeration, sludge dewatering, transportation, and various equipment. Reports indicate
    that the energy-related operations of wastewater treatment comprise approximately
    3% of total electricity consumption in the United States, 0.8% in Japan, and 0.4%
    in China (Venkatesh and Brattebø, 2011; Walker et al., 2021). According to Li
    et al. (2021) WWTPs in China exhibit higher intensity in various environmental
    categories, such as energy use, GWP, EP, AP, POCP, freshwater ecotoxicity potential
    (FETP), and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential (TETP), in comparison to other regions.
    The results suggest the need for energy conservation and emission reduction strategies
    within the wastewater treatment industry in China. (Li et al., 2021). Compared
    to SI, electricity used throughout the system seemed to have the highest impact
    on the five impact categories as depicted in Table 5 this was due to the fact
    that the energy produced throughout system (0.048 KWh/FU), was much lower than
    both SI (0.092 KWh/FU) and SII (0.2952 KWh/FU). At the same time, SI diverted
    screenings and foam to the anaerobic digestion, producing more biogas and thus
    larger amounts of energy. The energy was then diverted back into the system for
    reuse, thus decreasing the overall need for energy consumption. Table 5. Effect
    of electricity usage for the three scenarios on the five impact categories chosen.
    Impact categories BLS SI SII EP (kg PO4-Eq) 1.05 × 10−3 9.71 × 10−4 5.58 × 10−4
    AP (kg SO2-Eq) 2.85 × 10−3 2.65 × 10−3 1.52 × 10−3 GWP (kg CO2-Eq) 0.388 0.361
    0.207 ODP (kg CFC-11-Eq) 1.48 × 10−8 1.38 × 10−8 7.92 × 10−9 POCP (kg ethylene-Eq)
    8.51 × 10−5 7.91 × 10−5 7.66 × 10−6 This can also be depicted for all three scenarios
    by the cumulative energy demand assessment performed (Table 6). As depicted, BLS
    demanded much higher values of energy for six different energy assessments: non-renewable
    energy from fossil fuels, renewable biomass, non-renewable biomass, non-renewable
    nuclear energy, renewable energy (wind, solar and geothermal) and renewable energy
    from water, all measured in megajoules. Specifically, the BLS demanded in all
    cases 4.28–178% increase in energy usage compared to SI and SII. Table 6. Cumulative
    energy demand assessment of the three scenarios. Impact Categories BLS SI SII
    Non-renewable, fossil (MJ) 3.08116 1.96714 1.13 Renewable, biomass (MJ) 0.0483
    0.0226 0.01296 Non-renewable, biomass (MJ) 3.47 × 10−5 1.20 × 10−5 6.88 × 10−6
    Non-renewable, nuclear (MJ) 0.1914 0.0169 0.0097 Renewable, wind, solar, geothermal
    (MJ) 0.09522 0.09131 0.04667 Renewable, water (MJ) 1.01428 0.84842 0.48698 At
    the same time, for all three scenarios, primary aeration treatment and anaerobic
    digestion seemed to have the highest impact on all impact categories. Specifically,
    for the BLS primary aeration treatment contributed 45.27% to all impact categories
    (due to the consumption of electricity), while anaerobic digestion contributed
    19.73%. For SI, the percentage impact for primary aeration treatment and anaerobic
    digestion were 57.41% and 28.49% respectively, but represented a much lower value,
    due to the fact that the overall impact of the system due to electricity consumption
    was smaller, as depicted in Table 6. The same was true for SII, where the contribution
    of primary aeration treatment and anaerobic digestion was 41.2% and 52.56% respectively,
    with an overall production of 0.1476 m3/FU of biogas and 0.2952 KWh/FU of energy,
    diverted back into the system. 4. Conclusion The research involved the LCA of
    a typical wastewater treatment facility in Greece, involving three different scenarios:
    the baseline scenario, where screenings and foamings were collected from entrance
    works and transportation to a sanitary landfill, Scenario I where screenings and
    foaming was collected, grinded and pumped to the existing sludge anaerobic digester,
    and scenario II where fine screens were installed after sand collection for the
    removal of small diameter (≤500 μm) and utilization to anaerobic digestion. The
    functional unit used was 1 m3 of influent. The impact assessment of the five categories
    (eutrophication potential. Acidification potential, global warming potential,
    ozone depletion and photochemical ozone creation) revealed that compared to Scenario
    I and II, the baseline scenario had much greater impact on these categories, followed
    by scenario I, while Scenario II had the least impact compared to the other two.
    This was also depicted through the cumulative energy demand assessment, where
    the baseline scenario required 4–178% more energy to operate compared to Scenarios
    I and II. As the energy produced from the biogas in Scenario II (0.2952 KWh/FU)
    was much higher than the other two scenarios (0.048 KWh/FU for baseline, 0.092
    KWh/FU for Scenario I), the energy produced was diverted back into the system,
    thus decreasing energy demands for the whole system. According to the results
    of this research, WWTPs operations must actively work towards mitigating their
    energy demand. By implementing energy-efficient technologies and processes, such
    as anaerobic digestion and biogas utilization, and diversion of energy production
    back into the system, WWTPs are reducing their overall energy consumption and
    environmental footprint (Ferella et al., 2019). These energy-saving measures contribute
    to the sustainability of WWTP operations while also minimizing GHGs emissions.
    The combination of environmental protection and energy demand mitigation makes
    WWTPs vital players in promoting a greener and more sustainable future. At the
    same time, similar results from other LCA analysis can be used by both WWTPs stakeholders
    and urban policy makers, in order to create a synergy of action based on similar
    repository of data for informed and targeted development of strategies. Author''s

    very long-chain FA 1 INTRODUCTION Lipids are widespread in our daily food. Some
    are rich in lipids, like fats and oils, whereas others, such as fish, fruits,
    and vegetables, contain less fat. Several lipids, such as certain fatty acids
    (FAs) and fat-soluble vitamins, are essential nutrients because our body cannot
    synthesize them, whereas others mainly serve as a source of energy. Importantly,
    they all exert immense health effects and are essential components of healthy
    diets (Custers et al., 2022; Lawrence, 2013; Li, 2022). However, the lipid fraction
    in foods includes a great variety of molecules, with very distinct structures,
    and diverse nutritional characteristics and functionalities. They can also range
    quite variable in amount depending on the foodstuff, ranging from traces to almost
    98%–99%, in the case of oils or butter. It is most important to gain a detailed
    understanding of the dynamic lipid composition of foods and to characterize their
    lipidomes. The specific lipidomic signature of each food is paramount for attesting
    quality as well as for authenticity and traceability, which is essential for food
    security. Several analytical approaches have been used to address the challenge
    of exploring the food lipidomes. Few recent and elegant reviews have addressed
    this subject (Chen et al., 2017; Sun, Wang et al., 2020; Wang, Wang, et al., 2019;
    Wu et al., 2021), in addition to previous ones (Hyötyläinen et al., 2013; Murphy
    & Nicolaou, 2013), and they detailed mostly the methodological and analytical
    aspects based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) strategies, with
    systematic examples of foods (Chen et al., 2017). However, these reviews have
    focused on the profiling of FAs and glycerophospholipids (GP), triglycerides (TGs),
    and sphingolipids (SPs), scarcely addressing the analysis of other food lipid
    classes or the changes in lipids associated with processing, and how food lipidomics
    can contribute to food safety. In fact, the complexity and diversity of the food
    lipidome are quite challenging, and one single methodological approach cannot
    address the global lipidome; thus, specific approaches are needed to address the
    challenges of the plethora of lipids found in food. This review will address the
    immense variety of food lipids and lipophilic compounds, and specific analytical
    challenges. A wide range of lipid classes will be covered following LipidMaps
    classification: FAs, endocannabinoids, waxes, C8 compounds, GPs, glycerolipids
    (GL, i.e., glycolipids, betaine lipids, and TGs), SPs, sterols, secosteroids (vitamin
    D), isoprenoids (i.e., carotenoids and retinoids (vitamin A)), quinones (i.e.,
    coenzyme Q, vitamin K, and tocochromanols), terpenes, oxidized lipids, and oxylipins
    (Figure 1 and Table 1). For each class, its unique features including chemical
    properties, structure–function relationships, examples of food products and concentrations,
    and most established health-related benefits as well as specific and most advanced
    analytical procedures will be highlighted. Relevant aspect of modification of
    lipid composition with various processing and storage conditions will also be
    discussed. A critical overview of the analytical methods and the challenges aiming
    for a global lipid profile is provided, from the perspective of challenges in
    the analysis, alongside detailed practical guidelines for data processing as well
    as the computational aspects of lipidomics. Future perspectives and critical remarks
    will be discussed enhancing the trends in food lipidomic analysis in an emerging
    research area heading over the next few years. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer

    are carbon chain carboxylic acid, with a diverse number of carbons and with the
    presence, or not, of double bonds (Figure 2). Depending on the length of the acyl
    chain, they can be short-chain FAs (SCFAs) (with 2–6 carbon atoms), medium-chain
    FAs (MCFAs) (with 6–14 carbon atoms), long-chain FAs (LCFAs) (with 14–21 carbon
    atoms), and very long-chain FAs (VLCFAs) with 22 carbon atoms or more. They can
    be saturated (SFA) or with one (monounsaturated FA, MUFA) and up to six double
    bonds (polyunsaturated FA, PUFA) (Belitz & Grosch, 2013; McClements & Decker,
    2008; O''Keefe, 2002; Xiang et al., 2019). MUFA and PUFA can further be classified
    by the position of the double bond, for example, omega 3, 6, or 9 (Belitz & Grosch,
    2013; McClements & Decker, 2008). Branched-chain FAs (BCFAs) have one or more
    methyl branches at the central carbon chain (typically with 13–18 carbon atoms).
    Accordingly, they are categorized as mono-, di-, or multi-methyl BCFAs. FIGURE
    2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic representation and structural examples
    of the fatty acyls classes as fatty acids, fatty amides, fatty esters, and C8
    compounds. Most FAs are bound to many other complex lipids, for instance, esterified
    to a glycerol backbone in GP and GL as well as in saccharolipids and sterols to
    form sterol lipids (ST). Furthermore, according to the LIPID MAPS classification,
    they can be linked to SPs through amide bond formation, or to other groups (e.g.,
    fatty acyl conjugates). They can exist in their oxidized form (e.g., eicosanoids)
    (Fahy et al., 2005, 2009). Overall, they play a fundamental role in the chemistry
    and structure of these lipids. Only a minor fraction is usually present as free
    FAs with FAs playing an essential role in biology by influencing the properties
    of biological membranes, providing storage for energy, and participating in cell
    signaling. In food, FAs are one of the main nutrients and are responsible for
    many food key characteristics, from the texture to taste and nutritional value
    (Belitz & Grosch, 2013; McClements & Decker, 2008; O''Keefe, 2002). In their esterified
    forms, they are responsible for the texture of food and can act as key aroma components
    or their precursors (Qin et al., 2014). Many key aroma compounds responsible for
    typical food flavors are formed by the oxidation of the linoleic and linolenic
    FAs (Shahidi & Hossain, 2022). Moreover, FAs, for example, in the form of TGs,
    are essential for nutrition and provide large amounts of chemical energy. In addition,
    some PUFAs (FA 18:2, 18:3), are essential for humans, as they cannot be synthesized
    by the human body (Chen et al., 2022). Accordingly, FAs play a role in almost
    all key characteristics of food. The SCFAs are mainly found in bovine and ovicaprid
    milk, butterfat, and related products. Moreover, they are volatile and are responsible
    for the aroma of these food products (O''Keefe, 2002; Rauf et al., 2021; Ríos-Covián
    et al., 2016). The MCFAs are abundant in coconut oil and related products, for
    example, the abundance of lauric acid (C12:0) is 51.5% and that of myristic acid
    (C14:0) is 19.1% (Deen et al., 2021). MCFAs are quickly metabolized in the liver
    and are therefore less obesogenic. In parenteral nutrition, MCFAs are frequently
    used to provide a fast-release accessible source of energy other than carbohydrates
    (Grego & Mingrone, 1995; Xiang et al., 2019). The LCFAs are the largest and most
    diverse group of FA and are commonly found in various types of foods derived from
    animals, plants, or marine organisms. Moreover, the most abundant FAs usually
    found in food, namely, SFA palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, and the
    MUFA oleic acid (C18:1), are part of this group. Unsaturated VLCFAs include omega
    FA such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6 n − 3) and nervonic acid (C24:1 n
    − 9) are also found in food primarily found in fish and fish oil, whereas saturated
    analogs are often found in vegetable oils, although in low concentrations, that
    is, usually below 1% of the total FA profile. Peanut oil is an exception with
    a high amount of behenic acid (C22:0, 2.62%) and lignoceric acid (C24:0; 1.39%)
    (Fabiszewska & Białecka-Florjańczyk, 2021). The presence or absence of double
    bond shape de properties and value of the FA and lipids. SFAs are solid at room
    temperature and esterified in TGs; saturated SCFAs and MCFAs are primarily found
    in animal products (e.g., butter and lard), coconut, shea, cocoa, mango seed,
    kokum, and palm kernel fat. In their free form and esterified with low molecular
    weight alcohols, they comprise up to 60% of the seed (Żyżelewicz et al., 2014).
    SFAs have desirable effects on food texture and flavor, and owing to their high
    prices, they are also industrially synthesized from UFAs, by partial hydrogenation,
    to form margarines, but this process can generate undesirable trans-FA (Adhikari
    et al., 2010; Patel et al., 2016). Palm oil is the main source of saturated/hydrogenated
    fat (Ayompe et al., 2021). There is increasing evidence that SFAs are impacting
    cardiovascular disease (Blekkenhorst et al., 2015; Malhotra, 2013). Reducing the
    dietary intake of SFAs and replacing them with UFAs can reduce the risk of developing
    coronary heart diseases (Blekkenhorst et al., 2015; Farvid et al., 2014). Therefore,
    the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting the intake of SFAs to
    ∼10% of the total kcal intake. In addition, many of the LCFAs are unsaturated
    (e.g., FA 18:3 and FA 20:4 and 20:5) but can be further modified by autoxidation
    and enzymatic oxidation (Christie & Harwood, 2020; Osborn & Akoh, 2002; Willenberg
    et al., 2015). MUFA and PUFA are important nutrients in our diet. Although n −
    6 PUFAs are mostly found in animal fat, n − 3 PUFAs are found in many plant oils
    (e.g., olive oil) and marine organisms, including algae (Belitz & Grosch, 2013;
    McClements & Decker, 2008). From a dietary perspective, MUFAs have a wide range
    of beneficial cardiovascular effects, including on the blood–lipid profile. Some
    PUFAs are essential FAs and are precursors of various potent lipid mediators,
    such as oxylipins and eicosanoids. Both n − 3 and n − 6 PUFAs are essential FAs
    because the human body cannot synthesize the important linoleic acid and α-linolenic
    acid. The two essential FAs, linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid, are abundant
    in plant oils. Moreover, animal fat and meat often contain large quantities of
    arachidonic acid (C20:4 n − 6). Some n − 3 PUFAs with a higher degree of unsaturation
    as well as long chain lengths (long-chain PUFA [LC-PUFAs]), for example, eicosapentaenoic
    acid (EPA; C20:5 n − 3) and DHA (C22:6 n − 3), are found primarily in marine food
    (Tocher et al., 2019). LC-PUFAs are required components of a healthy diet owing
    to their beneficial effects on the neural and cardiovascular systems and inflammation,
    thus mitigating a range of pathological conditions (Tocher et al., 2019). Dietary
    guidelines also refer to the n − 6:n − 3 ratio as it possesses wide health-related
    implications, recommending an increased n − 3 FA consumption (Harris, 2018). Few
    conjugated PUFA can be found in in dairy products and meat of ruminants, such
    as conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) (Gilbert et al., 2011; Weiss et al., 2004).
    CLAs are formed in the rumen by bacteria and further incorporated into the lipid
    profile of the animal. CLAs are bioactive lipids and have various positive effects,
    such as anti-obesity or anti-carcinogenic (Benjamin & Spener, 2009). However,
    adverse effects of CLAs (e.g., fatty liver and spleen) have been reported (Benjamin
    & Spener, 2009). BCFA can be found in dairy products, like milk with approximately
    2% of all FAs, and in the meat of ruminants. The phytanic acid (3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadecanoic
    acid) and pristanic acid (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecanoic acid) can also be
    found in the meat of ruminants and are originally formed from the phytol of chlorophyll
    that is liberated by microorganisms in the rumen (Fabiszewska & Białecka-Florjańczyk,
    2021; Vetter & Schröder, 2010). Both phytanic and pristanic acids have health-related
    effects, for example, cancer prevention properties (Bobe et al., 2020; Wanders
    et al., 2011). 4,8,12-Trimethyltridecanoic acid (TMTD) is another phytol-derived
    isoprenoid BCFA, found mainly in marine foods (Luo et al., 2013). Moreover, BCFAs
    are frequently found in fermented foods, such as sauerkraut and miso, because
    the bacterial membrane contains BCFAs (Wang, Yang, et al., 2019; Ran-Ressler et
    al., 2014). Additionally, BCFAs with very long chains exist in other foodstuffs
    (e.g., chia seeds); some with chain lengths of up to 35 carbon atoms with iso-
    and anteiso-configurations have been found (Wang, Wang, et al., 2020). As most
    FAs are bound in complex lipids, and only low amounts are present in their free
    forms, different methods can be used either to identify the total FA, the esterified
    FA, or the free FA. To analyze the free FA fraction, extensive sample cleanup
    and/or enrichment is necessary because of the matrix complexity and the low abundance
    of analytes (Bazina & He, 2018; Zhu et al., 2019). After the extraction, free
    FAs can be analyzed by LC–MS without derivatization or analyzed by gas chromatography
    (GC) with a flame ionization detector (FID) or MS detection after derivatization
    into FAs methyl esters to increase their volatility (Table 2). However, from a
    food chemistry perspective, the total FA profile is also important. For that,
    the total FAs are derivatized to form methyl ester using acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed
    methods. In acid-catalyzed derivatization, BF3 or HCl/H2SO4 is used as the acid
    catalyst and esterification, or trans-esterification occurs in methanol to yield
    methyl esters. In base-catalyzed esterification, KOH, (CH3)3S(OH), or CH3NaO is
    used as the base catalyst (Ostermann et al., 2014) (Table 2). FA methyl esters
    are then analyzed by GC–FID or GC–MS (Table 2). However, although no methylation
    is required for LC-based total FA profiles, the sample still has to be saponified
    prior to analysis to release all the FA as free FA (Koch et al., 2021). TABLE

    of fatty acid Waxes are fatty esters (Table 1 and Figure 2) and in food are mainly
    originated from cuticular wax, the outmost layer of plant organs, for example,
    fruit and leaves, visible as a surface coating (Chu et al., 2018). This layer
    is the plant''s first protective barrier against environmental stresses (e.g.,
    limiting water loss) and thus also plays a role in stress and postharvest quality
    and is concomitantly affected by them (Dimopoulos et al., 2020; Lewandowska et
    al., 2020). Wax composition varies between species and varieties (Zeisler-Diehl
    et al., 2018), organs, developmental stages, and wax types (epicuticular vs. intracuticular)
    (Buschhaus & Jetter, 2011), but generally, wax is a mixture of VLCFAs and their
    derivatives, for example, alcohols, n-alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, and esters,
    in addition to secondary metabolites, such as triterpenoids, sterols, tocopherols,
    and phenolic compounds (Trivedi et al., 2019). Cuticular wax biosynthesis starts
    with the de novo synthesis of C16 and C18 FA, elongated to VLCFAs of C20 to C36,
    and then modified via two major pathways: the alcohol- and the alkane-forming
    pathways. All plant foods contain waxes, from legumes (Yao et al., 2013), through
    cereals (Harron et al., 2017), to fruits (Wu et al., 2018), and leafy greens (Ku
    et al., 2020). Wax concentrations vary dramatically, between 23 and 377 μg/cm2
    in berries to 0.46–2.44 mg/cm2 in pears (Wu et al., 2018) and 0.2%–0.3% (w/w)
    in sorghum kernels (Taylor et al., 2006). Waxes affect texture, maintaining firmness
    and sensory properties in food. In addition, waxes, including candelilla and carnauba
    wax, are used to prepare edible films and coatings for maintaining the freshness
    and quality of fruits, including fresh-cut (de Freitas et al., 2019). Importantly,
    innovative wax-based oleogels have been suggested as a low-calorie fat replacement
    (Doan et al., 2018). Wax analysis is challenging owing to the hydrophobicity and
    low polarity of waxes, leading to their low solubility in most organic solvents.
    In addition, waxes lack chromophores (Harron et al., 2017). Typically, waxes are
    analyzed using high-temperature GC–MS (Chai et al., 2020), despite low volatility
    and high masses limiting effectiveness (Table 2). They can be analyzed by LC,
    with specialized detectors, such as the LC-evaporative light scattering detector
    and charged aerosol detector (CAD). High-performance LC (HPLC) columns with specialized
    packings, such as silver ions, have allowed the detection and quantification of
    some wax components. Compared with GC-based methods, LC–MS-based methods enable
    the identification of some waxes, although soft ionization, such as electrospray
    ionization (ESI)–MS and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI)–MS, cannot
    ionize easily the hydrocarbon waxes, which limits analyte fragmentation and identification
    (Moreau, Harron, et al., 2018), (Table 2). 2.1.3 C8 compounds C8 compounds are
    aliphatic chains containing eight carbon atoms, for example, the abundant 1-octen
    3-ol, known as “mushroom alcohol” (Table 1, Figures 1 and 2) (Combet et al., 2006).
    They are ubiquitous in filamentous fungi (Combet et al., 2006) and have been found
    in many mushroom species (Du et al., 2021; Tietel & Masaphy, 2021), although also
    reported in algae and other organisms (Chen et al., 2019). In fungi, C8 compounds
    act as signaling chemicals in ecological communication with the environment (Holighaus
    et al., 2014; Pennerman et al., 2021), while also participating in fungus physiology
    and development (Herrero-Garcia et al., 2011; Tsitsigiannis & Keller, 2007). C8
    compounds play a key role in the characteristic mushroom aroma, described as mushroomlike,
    sweet, and musty. Their concentrations are above their thresholds, varying between
    0.004 and 0.48 ppm (Combet et al., 2006), thus greatly contributing to the overall
    aroma (Aisala et al., 2019). Linoleic acid is their biosynthetic precursor, as
    a substrate for a lipoxygenase (LOX) (Brodhun & Feussner, 2011), although the
    biosynthetic pathways have not yet been fully elucidated (Sun, Zhang, et al.,
    2020). As PUFA oxidation products, C8 compounds are relatively stable and resistant
    to further oxidation (Pennerman et al., 2021). Nevertheless, owing to their low
    boiling point, they may be eliminated under high-temperature and vacuum conditions,
    hence being unstable during mushroom processing, for example, cooking and drying,
    resulting in an undesirable loss of typical aroma and off-flavor formation (Sun,
    Zhang, et al., 2020). As volatile compounds, C8 are analyzed using volatile analysis
    methods, for example, head-space solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME), liquid–liquid
    extraction (LLE) or liquid–solid extraction, stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE),
    and static HS sampling, followed by GC–MS or GC–FID analysis. GC columns are generally
    nonpolar, for example, HP-5 with a medium inner layer (0.25 μm), and preferably
    long (60 m) to allow good separation. SPME fiber selection can be optimized to
    present a wide range of compounds by considering the specific profile as well
    as to reduce noise and enhance sensitivity (Tietel & Masaphy, 2018). GC–oven temperature
    should be initially low (40–50°C) to enable a good separation of the early-eluting
    compounds and gradually increase to 250°C at 3.5–5°C/min to avoid co-elution.
    2.2 Complex lipids Complex lipids comprise a wide variety of classes of lipids,
    even though this is not a specific lipid category (https://cyberlipid.gerli.com/description/complex-lipids/).
    It includes the neutral lipids classes such as TGs, as well as the polar lipids
    as GPs, the glycolipids, betaine lipids, and the SPs (Figure 3). They are widely
    present in all foods in high amounts but are represented by different lipid classes
    depending on the food matrix (Table 3). Complex lipids are widely identified in
    lipidomics approaches based on LC–MS (Table 2), as described in recent reviews
    (Matsuzawa et al., 2021; Sun, Wang, et al., 2020). In the following section, a
    critical overview will be presented, particularly considering the relation lipid
    chemistry, type of food, and nutritional and health benefits. FIGURE 3 Open in

    GPs, also called phospholipids (PLs), have a glycerol backbone esterified to two
    FAs, and a substituted phosphate polar head group, which composition define the
    several PL subclasses (Figure 3). The respective forms with one FA (monoacyl)
    correspond to the subclasses of LysoPLs. PLs are the main components of cell membranes
    and are also signaling molecules. PLs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum
    (ER) and cardiolipin (CL), where two phosphatidic acid (PA) moieties are connected
    through a glycerol backbone, and are synthesized in the mitochondria. They are
    widely found in all foodstuff, but the proportions of different PL classes vary
    depending on the food type, ranging from a higher abundance in for instance meat
    and fish and to a very low abundance in others such as oils (Table 3 and 5). Usually,
    phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are the most abundant class, followed by phosphatidylethanolamines
    (PEs) (Figure 3). In products of plant origin, phosphatidylglycerols (PG) as well
    as PA can also be the most abundant PLs, as for example in macroalgae Ulva where
    PG is the most abundant PL (Lopes et al., 2021, 2019), and PA is abundant in olive
    (Alves et al., 2016, 2019). Few PLs classes with three FAs were also identified,
    namely, the N-acyl-phospholipids, for example, N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine,
    (PE-N(FA)), and N-acyl-phosphatidylserine (PS-N(FA)), where a third FA is esterified
    at the free amine group. The N-acyl-PLs are essentially signaling molecules and
    not only are little reported in foods, such as olive oil (De Luca et al., 2019),
    olive seeds (Alves et al., 2021), and lupin seeds (Bianco et al., 2020), but also
    found in animals. The N-acyl FAs can be cleaved by phospholipase D, releasing
    signaling molecules, such as anandamide, an important regulator of the central
    nervous system. PE-N(FA) and PS-N(FA) are released in the small intestine and
    then into the bloodstream during digestion and are known to regulate appetite
    (Lin, 2018). PLs have attracted the attention in the nutritional point of view
    as the major carrier of PUFAs, especially of marine origin, being more bioavailable
    from PL than those esterified to neutral lipids (Canelli et al., 2022). PLs are
    also associated with intrinsic bioactive properties and have well-known beneficial
    health effects, namely, against cardiovascular disease, and also as anti-inflammatory
    antioxidant agents, among others (Lordan et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2018). They
    are also important components of lecithin, natural emulsifiers, and have been
    gaining increasing interest as natural antioxidants to control lipid oxidation
    (Cui & Decker, 2016). 2.2.2 Glycerolipids: glycolipids Glycolipids (Table 1 and
    Figure 3) are found in the plastids and thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. Plants
    and algae use glycolipids to adapt to environmental conditions, such as light
    and temperature variations. The main classes of glycolipids are monoglycosyldiacylglycerols
    (MGDGs), diglycosyl diacylglycerols (DGDGs), sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerols (SQDG),
    and their monoacyl (lyso) forms. MGDGs and DGDGs are neutral glycolipids with
    one and two galactose molecules in their polar heads, respectively. SQDGs are
    sulfur-containing acidic lipids with an esterified sulfoquinovosyl group in their
    polar heads. Noteworthy GLs from algae are esterified to content with high n −
    3 FAs and thus considered a sustainable source of n − 3 FAs for the diet and an
    alternative to fish. In addition, glycolipids have been described as important
    bioactive phytochemicals with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antitumor
    activities (Cheng-Sánchez & Sarabia, 2018; Guo & Wang, 2022; Ishii et al., 2017).
    However, these classes of lipid, in spite of being widespread in food from plant
    kingdom, are less studied than PLs but deserve further exploitation, particularly
    considering that they are main components of algae and are highly recommended
    for sustainable and healthy diets (da Costa et al., 2016). 2.2.3 Glycerolipids:
    betaine lipids Betaine lipids are a group of non-phosphorous zwitterionic polar
    lipids with two FAs esterified at sn-1 and sn-2 positions in the glycerol backbone
    and a betaine group in the polar head (Table 1 and Figure 3). There are three
    classes of betaine lipids depending on the structure of the polar group: diacylglyceryl–trimethyl–homoserine
    (DGTS), diacylglyceryl–hydroxymethyl–trimethyl–alanine (DGTA), and diacylglyceryl–carboxy–hydroxymethyl–choline
    (DGCC). Betaine lipids are mainly present in algae (Lopes et al., 2021; Rey et
    al., 2022), not in higher plants, but have been identified in olives (Alves et
    al., 2019) and olive oil (Alves et al., 2016). Betaine lipids are still poorly
    studied, although there is an acknowledged interplay between DGTS and PCs in cell
    membranes in algae. In certain algal species, such as Ulva spp. and Chlamydomonas
    spp. (Tietel, Wikoff, et al., 2020), DGTS are very abundant, whereas PCs are not,
    and thus, DGTS is assigned to maintaining the structure and function of cell membranes
    instead of PC. Therefore, DGTS is critical in plants for adaptation to growing
    conditions. However, the knowledge on their nutritional and bioactive properties
    are still unknown. 2.2.4 Glycerolipids: triacylglycerides, diacylglycerides, or
    monoacylglycerides Triacylglycerides (TGs) are nonpolar GLs with one glycerol
    esterified to three FAs (Table 1 and Figure 3). They are the main energy reserve,
    accumulating as lipid droplets in plants or in the adipose tissue of animals,
    and are synthesized in the ER. The FA composition of TGs greatly depends on the
    food origin, for example, triolein (TG 18:1/18:1/18:1) is the main TG in olive
    oil, and TG comprising n − 3 FAs are found in foods of marine origin or flaxseed.
    TGs are the main components in oils and key nutrients in foods as main carriers
    of FA and as energy sources. FAs are released through the action of lipases in
    food and after digestion, leading to the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and
    monoacylglycerol (MAG). Such hydrolysis of TGs after ingestion gives rise to 2-MAG
    and free FAs, which are then absorbed and used mainly for the in vivo synthesis
    of TGs and chylomicron (Hansen, 2014). Dietary 2-MAG plays a role in the secretion
    of anorectic intestinal peptides through the activation of the G protein-coupled
    receptor (GPR119) (Hansen & Vana, 2019), which is mainly expressed in β-cells
    of the human pancreas and enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract
    (Overton et al., 2008). 2.2.5 Sphingolipids SPs are a category of polar lipids
    that have a sphingoid base, which can be linked to fatty acyl chains, such as
    ceramides (Cer), to PC in the case of sphingomyelin (SM), or to glycosylated polar
    heads in the case of glycosphingolipids (Table 1 and Figure 3). The main class
    of SP found in animal foods is SM, but it is barely found in higher plants (Mamode
    Cassim et al., 2020). Glycosylceramides, such as hexosylceramides (HexCer), have
    also been found in several starch-rich, water-rich, and oil-rich foods (Table
    3) and have been related to health benefits (Li, Song, et al., 2020; Wang, Li,
    et al., 2020). Anionic glycosphingolipids and gangliosides are also found in milk,
    meat, and fish (Ma et al., 2021; Ali et al., 2022). Gangliosides are acidic glycolipids
    with a negatively charged glycosidic moiety linked to the Cer backbone. Glycosphingolipids
    are synthesized in the ER and then modified in the Golgi apparatus, where additions
    of carbohydrates occur. Gangliosides are still little explored in food, although
    consumed gangliosides have been shown to reduce pro-inflammatory signaling in
    the gut, enhance immunity, and prevent infection (Yamashita et al., 2021). 2.2.6
    Complex lipids: from analysis to food composition GPs, GLs, and SPs are identified
    and quantified using global lipidomics approaches based on LC–MS and MS/MS, without
    the need of any derivatization (Table 2). Different foods have a typical composition
    of complex lipids. Profiling is important to address the nutritional value, to
    screen bioactive lipids, and to infer alteration of lipids and lipid composition
    due to food processing or storage, or alternatively adulteration. In fact, reversed-phase
    (RP) LC–MS and MS/MS approaches allowed to have a larger coverage of the full
    profile of complex lipids, including TG, DAG, MAG, PLs, and SP (Table 2). Hydrophilic
    interaction LC (HILIC)–MS and normal phase (NP)–LC–MS and MS/MS is usually used
    for the analysis of polar lipids, as PLs and SP, but not so compatible for analysis
    of neutral acylcglycerolipids (Table 2). Low technology methodologies can be used
    to obtain some information about the composition of glycerol lipids, namely, the
    use of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to obtain information about the type of
    classes in the lipid pool. FAs esterified to glycerol lipids are analyzed after
    hydrolysis and derivatization by GC–FID or GC–MS, as reported in Section 2.1.
    However, this analysis gives the information of Fas’ nutritional value but not
    from complex lipid perspective. This is a drawback considering that several complex
    lipids have intrinsic nutritional, bioactive, and healthy properties. Several
    cutting-edge lipidomic approaches have been used to characterize the complex lipids
    of different foodstuffs, namely, starch-, protein-, water-, and oil-rich foods
    (Table 3). Wheat (Jin et al., 2021) and rice (Zhang, Duan, et al., 2021) are examples
    of starch-rich foods with identified lipidomes, by C18 RP-LC pinpointing PL, glycolipids,
    Cer, and TG. The lipid classes HexCer and acylsterolglycosides (ASG) were identified
    in rice (Zhang, Duan, et al., 2021). Water-rich foods, namely, milk (bovine, goat,
    donkey, and human milk), have been extensively studied. Milk lipids consist almost
    exclusively of TGs (over 98%), whereas SMs and PLs are among the minor lipids
    found in milk, with among species a great diversity in classes and differences
    in abundances. Water-rich foods are characterized by lipidomes of diverse compositions,
    although all share PLs, especially PC and PE. Such foods include fruits and vegetables
    and some beverages, such as green tea and beer (see Table 3). Fruits and vegetables
    contain mainly PLs, SP, and TGs. Green tea (Li et al., 2021) and Irish ale (Tsoupras
    et al., 2020) contain PL and SP from different classes. This difference occurs
    because, in tea, lipids come from the leaves, and in beer, lipids originate in
    cereals and yeast, such as 1-phospho-ceramide (Cer-P) and 1-phosphorylethanolamine-ceramide
    (PE-Cer). Mushrooms additionally contain betaine lipids (Yang et al., 2021). The
    lipidome of several protein-rich foodstuffs, meat, fish, eggs, and lately, insect
    meal (Tenebrio molitor) has also been studied. As with water-rich and starch-rich
    foods, there is variability in lipid classes depending on the food, with some
    common features (Table 3). Several PL classes were identified in all studied foods,
    whereas TGs are found in some lipidomic studies of meat, fish, eggs, and yellow
    mealworm (see Table 3). The findings of lipidomics-based LC–MS studies also depend
    on the purpose of the study. For example, although one study only identified TGs
    (Xie et al., 2020), another only focused on the phospholipidome (Zhou et al.,
    2021) of egg yolk. Wang et al. (2021) focused on identifying the PC, PE, and PS
    plasmalogen species in shellfish, highlighting that marine foods are very rich
    in these types of PLs. Oil-rich foods comprising oils, nuts, oily fruits, and
    seeds have high content in TGs, as seen in sweet chestnuts (Cerulli et al., 2021)
    and yellow lupin seeds (Calvano et al., 2020); however, PLs are detected in lower
    contents. PE-N(FA) were identified in sweet chestnuts (Cerulli et al., 2021),
    yellow lupin seeds (Calvano et al., 2020), and olive seeds (Alves et al. 2022).
    Analysis of polar lipids PLs and GLs in oil-rich foods was done by types of solid-phase
    extraction (SPE) prior to LC–MS (Alves et al., 2018). Although less reported in
    recent years, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight–MS was
    used for the analysis of TGs in virgin olive oils (Alves et al., 2016). Direct
    injection–MS analysis of polar lipid classes previously separated by TLC was also
    done for a plant-derived matrix with a wide range of polar lipid classes, as illustrated
    for olive seeds (Alves et al., 2021) (Table 2). Other food matrices as interesting
    sources of lipids are coffee beans, wherein PLs and TGs have been identified (Silva
    et al., 2020). Similarly, marine algae (Lopes et al., 2021) and halophyte plants
    (Salicornia ramosissima and Halimione portulacoides) (Maciel et al., 2020) include
    PLs, GLs, and betaine lipids in their composition. The relative abundance of these
    lipids varies depending on the type of marine plant and the growing conditions.
    In these lipidomic analyses, extraction methods employ methanol with other organic
    solvents, and an HPLC–MS of lipid extracts uses C18 or HILIC columns. 2.3 Sterol
    lipids STs are among the most discussed lipids, owing to their role in atherosclerosis
    and cardiovascular disease and cholesterol intake regulation (Bai et al., 2021;
    Boren et al., 2020; Sikand & Severson, 2020). They are neutral lipids that share
    a steroid ring system consisting of A–D rings. The A–C rings are made from six
    carbon atoms, whereas the D ring is constructed from five carbon atoms (Figure
    4 and Table 1). In addition, STs have a hydroxyl group at position 3 and a double
    bond in the B ring, commonly between C5 and C6. Both sterols and stanols share
    the same steroid core structure, differing only in the double bond in the B ring,
    which is saturated in stanols (Li, Dutkiewicz, et al., 2019). FIGURE 4 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic representation and structural examples of the
    sterols lipids as the sterols, secosteroids, and conjugated sterols. Sterols are
    found in animals (zoosterols), plants (phytosterols), and fungi (mycosterols).
    Cholesterol is the major sterol found in animals (Duong et al., 2019), whereas
    plants’ phytosterol profile is more complex, and often campesterol, stigmasterol,
    and β-sitosterol are the dominating species (Phillips et al., 2002; Zuorro et
    al., 2013). In most edible fungi, ergosterol is the main mycosterol (Phillips
    et al., 2011). In addition to their free form, sterols can be esterified to FAs,
    or hydroxycinnamic acids (e.g., ferulic and coumaric acid), or occur as glycosides
    and acylated glycosides (Moreau, Nyström, et al., 2018). The amount and pattern
    of STs can be very specific for plant oils (Uddin et al., 2018; Zuorro et al.,
    2013), for example, brassicasterol is typically found in oils from Brassicaceae,
    whereas pumpkin seed oil has abundant sterols with a double bond between C7 and
    C8 in the B ring (Mandl et al., 1999). Hence, these can be used to identify adulteration
    and authenticity (Azadmard-Damirchi, 2010; Pereira et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2014).
    Sterols are rather stable and show low oxidation rates (González-Larena et al.,
    2011), even under heating (Menéndez-Carreño et al., 2008). Cholesterol is less
    resistant to oxidation than plant sterols (Menéndez-Carreño et al., 2008), whereas
    β-sitosterol oxidizes in a higher proportion than campesterol and stigmasterol
    (Espinosa et al., 2015). Essentially, all food items of animal origin contain
    cholesterol, from moderate quantities (up to 400 mg/100 g fresh weight) in meat,
    fish, and butter, to high quantities in egg yolk (up to 1500 mg/100 g) and entrails,
    such as kidney, liver, and brain (up to 2000 mg/100 g) (Belitz & Grosch, 2013;
    Piironen et al., 2002a). Plant oils are generally a good source of phytosterols,
    with typical quantities ranging from 50 mg/100 g in palm oil to 800 mg/100 g in
    rapeseed oil (Phillips et al., 2002; Verleyen et al., 2002). In addition, cereals,
    nuts, and seeds contain appreciable quantities (up to 200 mg/100 g) (Esche et
    al., 2013; Phillips et al., 2005; Piironen et al., 2002b). The principal source
    of ergosterol and other mycosterols are edible mushrooms in which quantities of
    approximately 100 mg/100 g fresh weight can be found (Simon Hammann et al., 2016;
    Phillips et al., 2011). Importantly, ergosterol acts as provitamin D2. Food products
    enriched in phytosterols, containing several fold higher quantities, are consumed
    as functional foods, as phytosterols compete cholesterol in absorption but are
    not absorbed, thus mitigating blood-cholesterol levels (European Food Safety Authority
    [EFSA], 2008; Moreau, Nyström, et al., 2018). Another class of STs is ASGs. These
    lipids are sterol derivatives that have an FA linked at the C-6 position of the
    sugar residue of sterol glycosides (Gómez-Coca et al., 2012). ASGs are dietary
    components that can effectively lower the levels of cholesterol and can partly
    reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (Nyström et al., 2012). These lipids
    have been identified in various plant-derived foods, such as rice (Zhang, Duan,
    et al., 2021), fruit seeds, olive oil (De Luca et al., 2019), and green tea (Li
    et al., 2021). Usually, STs are analyzed by LC–MS or after derivatization by GC–FID
    or GC–MS (Li, Dutkiewicz, et al., 2019; Lütjohann et al., 2019; Vladimirov et
    al., 2020) (Table 2). However, analytical methods must be adjusted to the lipid
    source and expected sterol conjugates. Saponification hydrolyzes ester bonds in
    sterol FA esters and hydroxycinnamic acid esters, but not steryl glycosides. In
    addition to the total sterol content, the compositions of individual conjugates
    or even intact conjugates are sometimes of interest, requiring dedicated methods
    (Lagarda et al., 2006). 2.4 Vitamin D Vitamin D is a group of secosteroids formed
    through UVB-light-mediated cleavage of the B ring from sterols, with two conjugated
    double bonds between C5 and C6 as well as between C7 and C8 (Figure 4 and Table
    1). The two forms with major significance in food are vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol),
    derived from 7-dehydrocholesterol, and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), derived from
    ergosterol. According to their respective precursor sterol source, vitamin D3
    is mainly found in animal-derived food, whereas D2 can be found in edible mushrooms.
    Humans are able to synthesize vitamin D3 through the UVB irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol
    in the skin (Nair & Maseeh, 2012). Vitamin D is pivotal for bone development as
    well as calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. The active metabolite calcitriol can
    bind to vitamin D receptors in the intestine, leading to improved calcium and
    phosphorus absorption via active transport. The principal consequences of vitamin
    D deficiencies in childhood are disturbed development of the skeleton and rickets,
    whereas adulthood chronic deficiency can lead to osteomalacia, osteoporosis, muscle
    weakness, and an increased fracture risk (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition,
    and Allergies, 2016; Holick, 2007; Holick & Chen, 2008). While unlikely through
    diet or excessive sunlight exposure, pathologically elevated levels of vitamin
    D can occur with vitamin D supplementation, leading to impaired calcium homeostasis
    with elevated calcium levels and subsequently increased calcium depositions in
    bones and kidneys (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies,
    2016; van Staveren & de Groot, 2011). Highest concentrations in Vitamin D3 of
    300 μg/kg can be found in fish and fish products, particularly in fish livers,
    with reported values exceeding 1000 μg/kg, for example, in cod liver oil (Schmid
    & Walther, 2013), historically given to children to prevent rickets (Bartolucci
    et al., 2011; Bell & Christie, 1973; Rajakumar, 2003). In comparison, the vitamin
    D content in meat and dairy is low, generally less than 10 μg/kg, whereas eggs
    contain between 8 and 30 μg/kg. These values increase when the animal feed is
    vitamin D–supplemented (Schmid & Walther, 2013). In nonanimal products, mushrooms
    are a valuable source of ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), particularly after UV treatment,
    which converts ergosterol into ergocalciferol. Vitamin D2 contents varied between
    0.3 and 60 μg/kg in untreated mushrooms, whereas UV-treated samples contained
    >200 μg/kg (Phillips et al., 2011). Similarly, Matilla et al. showed that wild
    mushrooms contain significantly higher quantities than those cultivated in the
    absence of sunlight, and that the vitamin D2 contents of two mushroom species
    increased 9-fold and 140-fold within 2 h of UV irradiation at 254 nm (Teichmann
    et al., 2007). Although vitamin D and its main metabolites can be analyzed using
    a range of bioassays, chromatographic techniques offer higher selectivity. However,
    GC methods are unsuitable because of vitamin D thermal instability and the need
    for derivatization (Bell & Christie, 1973) (Table 2; Jäpelt & Jakobsen, 2013).
    Therefore, LC coupled to ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) or diode array detector
    (DAD) is mainly used (Byrdwell et al., 2008). In particular, RP-LC–MS/MS in combination
    with stable isotope-labeled internal standards can be used to achieve high sensitivity
    and improved quantification. One challenge is the relatively poor ionization efficiency
    of vitamin D and its metabolites (Table 2). Although ESI and APCI seem to offer
    similar sensitivities, atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI) outperforms
    APCI, suggesting that APPI is the ionization technique of choice for vitamin D
    analysis (Volmer et al., 2015) (Table 2). Pre- and post-column derivatization
    procedures, such as the reaction with 4-phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione (PTAD),
    can be used to improve ionization and thus the limit of detection (Ding et al.,
    2010) (Table 2; Jäpelt & Jakobsen, 2013; Volmer et al., 2015). 2.5 Isoprenoids
    2.5.1 Terpenes Terpenes (Table 1) are the largest, most chemically, structurally,
    and functionally diverse group of natural products, with over 80,000 compounds
    (Zhou & Pichersky, 2020). In addition to their presence in most unprocessed foods,
    terpenes (hydrocarbons) and terpenoids (oxygen-containing terpenes) are extensively
    used in the food industry, for example, as natural flavoring as sweetening agents,
    preservatives, and functional food ingredients (Caputi & Aprea, 2011; Liang et
    al., 2021). Most terpenoids are found in plants, wherein they participate in physiology
    and defense (Ninkuu et al., 2021; Gershenzon & Dudareva, 2007). Structurally,
    these compounds contain linear hydrocarbons in addition to carbocyclic skeletons,
    originating from oxygenation, hydrogenation, or dehydrogenation (Figure 5) (Ninkuu
    et al., 2021). Terpenes are classified by the number of isoprene units (C5H8),
    a five-carbon building block constructed from isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and
    dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (Zhou & Pichersky, 2020). These C5 compounds
    are biosynthesized by both the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) and the
    mevalonate (MVA) pathways (Zhou & Pichersky, 2020). IPP and DMAPP are condensed
    head-to-tail by trans-prenyltransferases (TPTs), resulting in a multitude of intermediates
    from C10 to C30 (Oldfield & Lin, 2012; Pazouki & Niinemets, 2016). Terpene synthases
    (TPSs) further remove the diphosphate group sculpting the backbone of the mono
    (C10), norisoprenoids (C13), sesqui (C15), di (C20), tri (C30), tetra (C40), and
    polyterpene (Degenhardt et al., 2009; Zhou & Pichersky, 2020). FIGURE 5 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic representation and structural examples of the
    prenol lipids as the isoprenoids, quinones, and polyprenols. In food, terpenes
    play a significant role in the sensory properties of foodstuff, for example, grape
    berries and wine (Li, Howell, et al., 2020; Yang, Jin, et al., 2019), citrus (Alquézar
    et al., 2017; Tietel et al., 2011), and herbs and spices (Bound et al., 2016;
    Salha et al., 2019), thus serving as a quality trait. Their aromas are described
    as citrus, woody, fresh, fruity, and soapy (Kreutzmann et al., 2008; Mudge et
    al., 2019). Monoterpenes (e.g., citral, limonene, thymoquinone, and linalool),
    sesquiterpenes (e.g., β-caryophyllene, α-humulene, and α-farnesene), diterpenes
    (e.g., carnosic acid, andrographolide, and paclitaxel), and triterpenes and their
    glycosides and saponins (e.g., squalene, ursolic acid, glycyrrhizin, and ginsenoside)
    are present in foods in high concentrations, up to 804 μg/kg (Dziadas & Jeleń,
    2010; Yang, Jin, et al., 2019) and even as high as 53.8 mg/g in various spices
    (Triaux et al., 2021). In volatile mono- and sesquiterpenes, these levels are
    usually above their sensory threshold concentrations, resulting in aroma activity
    and significant impact on food organoleptic properties (Wojtunik-Kulesza et al.,
    2019). Terpenes contribute to food functionality (Gouda et al., 2018) owing to
    their health-related bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory (de Santana Souza
    et al., 2014), antioxidant, and antidiabetic properties. Terpenes also play a
    major role in food safety owing to their antibacterial properties (Gallucci et
    al., 2009) and have been suggested as natural preservatives in the food industry
    (Falleh et al., 2020; Lyu et al., 2019). Terpenes are sensitive to light and temperature
    and, furthermore, are easily oxidized and degraded during processing and storage
    (Bitterling et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2007). Moreover, some compounds (e.g.,
    carvone; Bitterling et al., 2021) and forms (e.g., glycosylation; Yazaki et al.,
    2017) are more stable than others, also depending on the specific plant matrix
    (Yang et al., 2007). For terpene identification and quantification, extraction
    methods designed for volatile compounds, including HS–SPME, SBSE, and LLE, are
    used for sample preparation, and GC is subsequently applied for analysis (Jiang
    et al., 2016; Ali et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2020), although for higher molecular
    weight terpenes, for example, terpene lactones, LC methods may also be applied
    (Rossi et al., 2011) (Table 2). 2.5.2 Carotenoids Carotenoids are structurally
    diverse lipophilic isoprenoids (tetraterpenoids, Table 1) with important roles
    as photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants as well as sources of color, odor,
    and taste (Britton et al., 2004; Maoka, 2020; Sandmann, 2019; Young & Lowe, 2018).
    Nutritionally, carotenoids are indispensable for human health, as vitamin A precursors
    and efficient lipophilic antioxidants (Bhatt & Patel, 2020; Maoka, 2020) (Figure
    5). Carotenoids are synthesized exclusively by photosynthetic organisms to protect
    photosynthetic apparatus against photooxidation (Frank et al., 2006). In the human
    body, dietary carotenoids are further modified to apocarotenoids by enzymatic
    or reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered oxidative cleavage to retinoids, vitamin
    A precursors (Maoka, 2020). Carotenoids are divided into two main groups depending
    on their structures (Britton, 2008; Maoka, 2020): oxygen-free carotenes and oxygen-containing
    xanthophylls. Carotenes, including β-carotene and lycopene, are hydrocarbons,
    whereas xanthophylls contain different functional groups, namely, hydroxy (e.g.,
    lutein and zeaxanthin), keto (e.g., astaxanthin and canthaxanthin), epoxy (e.g.,
    violaxanthin and fucoxanthin), and methoxy (e.g., spirilloxanthin) (Maoka, 2020).
    These oxygen-containing functional groups make xanthophylls more polar than carotenes
    and affect their bioavailability, biological functions, and solubility (Schweiggert
    & Carle, 2017). In nature, most carotenoids are found in all-trans (all E) configurations
    (Arunkumar et al., 2020), although heat, pH, and gastric microflora can induce
    isomerization, producing Z isoforms (von Lintig et al., 2020), affecting absorption
    and bioavailability (Schweiggert & Carle, 2017). Currently, 1204 natural carotenoids
    have been characterized (http://carotenoiddb.jp; Fernandes et al., 2018; Yabuzaki,
    2017). Synthetic and natural carotenoids are widely used as natural food colorants
    and as supplements (Langi & Kiokias, 2018). Nevertheless, most ingested carotenoids
    are obtained directly from food, where they are generally more stable (Britton
    & Khachik, 2009). Carotenoids’ content in food ranges between low (0–0.1 mg/100
    g) and very high (>2 mg/100 g) (Britton & Khachik, 2009), and can vary significantly
    depending on environmental conditions, cultivation practice, maturity, and storage
    conditions (Saini & Keum, 2018). Specifically, food carotenoids may be lost and
    altered by enzymatic or nonenzymatic (ROS) oxidation and geometrical isomerization
    (Britton & Khachik, 2009). Changes induced by exposure to air/oxygen, light, and
    heat, for example, during processing or cooking, may also alter their structure
    and bioactivity. Leafy and dark-green vegetables contain relatively high concentrations
    of β-carotene, lutein, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin. Yellow, orange, and red plants,
    such as carrot, sweet potato, and cantaloupe, are common sources of β-carotene;
    tomatoes and watermelon of lycopene (5–10 mg/100 g fresh weight); sweet corn,
    broccoli, and yellow/green peppers of lutein; and red peppers, oranges, and papayas
    of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin (Britton & Khachik, 2009). Dairy products, eggs,
    fish, and seafood can also have a significant carotenoid content (Britton & Khachik,
    2009)—the pink color of salmon and trout as well as the red color of crustaceans
    results from accumulated astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, produced by algae and
    cyanobacteria (Arunkumar et al., 2020; Galasso et al., 2017). Because carotenoids
    are sensitive to heat, light, oxygen, and acids, quick handling and special precaution
    must be taken throughout their determination in food to achieve reliable data.
    The organic solvent is chosen depending on matrix complexity and target-compound
    polarity (Meléndez-Martínez et al., 2021; Mezzomo & Ferreira, 2016) and may include
    antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), to protect from oxidation.
    Alkaline saponification is often performed to hydrolyze ester forms and remove
    chlorophyll and TGs, which may interfere with the analysis. Separation is performed
    using RP-HPLC with C18 (Khachik et al., 1986) or C30 columns (de Rosso & Mercadante,
    2007), which is efficient for isomer separation (Meléndez-Martínez et al., 2021)
    (Table 2). Detection, identification, and quantification of carotenoids can be
    performed using UV–Vis spectrophotometry or MS with both positive and negative
    modes of APCI (Luterotti et al., 2013; Meléndez-Martínez et al., 2021) (Table
    2). Data regarding absorption maxima and coefficients along with MS and nuclear
    magnetic resonance (NMR) references of many carotenoids are published and facilitate
    analysis and identification (Britton et al., 2004; Yabuzaki, 2017) (Table 2).
    2.5.3 Retinoids (vitamin A) Retinoids are a group of natural and synthetic analogs
    derived from retinol (vitamin A, all-trans-retinol) (Table 1). Their structure
    consists of four head-to-tail-linked isoprenoid units, which can be derived from
    a monocyclic parent molecule consisting of five carbon–carbon double bonds and
    a functional group at the terminus of the acyclic part (Figure 5) (IUPAC-IUB,
    1983). Retinoid derivatives are used as therapeutics, and thus far, more than
    2000 different retinoids have been chemically synthesized and classified into
    4 generations depending on their chemical structure (Khalil et al., 2017). In
    the human body, retinol is converted into a variety of metabolites (O''Byrne &
    Blaner, 2013), which can be characterized by their different functional groups,
    for example, hydroxyl, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, and retinyl ester. Within the
    body, retinol is mainly stored in the liver (Blomhoff et al., 1991), in the form
    of retinyl esters, with hepatocytes involved in processing and storage (Blaner
    et al., 1987; Blomhoff et al., 1985). Retinol and its derivatives have antioxidant
    properties (Dao et al., 2017) and are involved in several biological processes,
    including the vision cycle (Thompson & Gal, 2003), immunity (Huang et al., 2018),
    and embryogenesis (Zile, 1998). Lacking the ability to synthesize retinoids, their
    dietary intake is essential to prevent vitamin A deficiency (VAD), which represents
    a severe global health problem, especially in developing countries (Palmer et
    al., 2017). VAD is associated with night blindness and xerophthalmia (McLaren,
    1999; Palmer et al., 2017). The recommended amounts of retinol are given as retinol
    activity equivalent (RAE) with 900 μg RAE daily for men and 700 μg RAE for women
    (Trumbo et al., 2001). Approximately 70% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin
    A can be reached with a plant-based diet in the form of provitamin A (carotenoids)
    (Britton & Khachik, 2009; Miller et al., 2020; Müller, 1997), whereas less than
    30% is possible with an animal-based diet (Frank et al., 2006). Retinoids are
    present in many different foodstuffs, including egg, meat, and dairy products
    (Parrish & Bauernfeind, 1977; Rühl, 2007). High contents of retinol are found
    in the livers of calves (188 ± 125 mg/kg liver), pigs (174 ± 118 mg/kg liver),
    and chicken (97 ± 44 mg/kg liver) (Howells & Livesey, 1998). Furthermore, retinol
    is present in milk (0.03–0.6 mg/L; Chauveau-Duriot et al., 2010), butter (7.99
    ± 0.72 mg/kg; Hulshof et al., 2006), and cheese (∼0.287 mg/kg) (Ikram et al.,
    2021). An alternative to retinol is provitamin A (carotenoids), mainly β-carotene
    (Rühl, 2007), the enzymatic cleavage of which results in the formation of retinal,
    a precursor of retinol, and retinoic acid (Harrison, 2012). Retinol is sensitive
    to oxygen, light, and temperature (Chen et al., 1994), and thus, food processing
    and storage can induce alterations. A conversion of all-trans-retinol into its
    cis-isomer occurs under harsh milk-processing conditions, potentially lowering
    the nutritional value (Panfili et al., 1998). From an analytical perspective,
    exposure to light should be avoided to prevent degradation. Moreover, samples
    should be analyzed immediately or stored at −80°C until analysis. Extraction and
    analytical methods may differ greatly among foods, as food matrix complexity determines
    the requirement of saponification to recover fat-soluble vitamins, as well as
    individually adjusted conditions. Moreover, accurate quantification should consider
    all possible retinol isomers because conversion may take place during food processing
    or storage. Retinol and β-carotene concentrations are determined by HPLC using
    various detectors, including DAD, UV–Vis detector, and fluorescence detector (FLD)
    (Bertolín et al., 2018; Bouzari et al., 2015; Chauveau-Duriot et al., 2010; Gleize
    et al., 2012; Hulshof et al., 2006) (Table 2). Chromatographic separation of compounds
    is achieved with different types of C18 and C30 columns, and concentrations are
    determined using external calibration curves of standard compounds. Coupling of
    a C18 to a C30 column in nonaqueous reversed-phase HPLC–DAD with tandem MS spectrometry
    allows the detailed analysis of retinoids present in milk samples collected from
    different species (Rocchi et al., 2016) (Table 2). 2.5.4 Coenzyme Q Coenzyme Q
    (quinone, Table 1) is a family of lipophilic molecules found in every living cell
    (Prakash et al., 2010). In humans, the dominant form is coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) (Pravst
    et al., 2010), which is found in high concentrations in the heart, kidney, and
    liver (Åberg et al., 1992). CoQ10, a redox molecule that exists in an oxidized
    (ubiquinone) and reduced form (ubiquinol), consists of 10 isoprenoid units attached
    to a 1,4-benzoquinone moiety (Figure 5). The quinone ring allows electron transport,
    crucial for its biological functions. To synthesize CoQ10, two biosynthetic pathways
    are required. The isoprenoid side chain is constructed from enzymatic reactions
    involving acetyl-CoA, and the benzoquinone head group is derived from tyrosine
    (Shukla & Dubey, 2018). CoQ10 participates in a variety of activities, including
    free radical scavenging (antioxidant), cell redox balance regulation, and ATP
    production (Barcelos & Haas, 2019; Prakash et al., 2010; Varela-López et al.,
    2016). Dietary uptake is unnecessary, although many food products naturally contain
    CoQ10. High amounts can be found in the hearts and livers of beef (113.0 and ≤50.5
    mg/kg, respectively), pork (≤282.0 and ≤54.0 mg/kg, respectively), and chicken
    (≤192.0 and ≤132.2 mg/kg, respectively), as well as in oily fishes, such as herring
    and mackerel (Pravst et al., 2010). Moreover, olive oil (85.3 ± 5.8 mg/L; Borges
    et al., 2017), soybean oil (97.6 mg/kg; Rodríguez-Acuña et al., 2008), and rapeseed
    oil (46.4 mg/kg; Rodríguez-Acuña et al., 2008) are rich in CoQ10. Processing influences
    the CoQ10 content, for example, its concentration is lower in soy milk than in
    soybean (Kubo et al., 2008). Moreover, the initial concentration of CoQ10 differs
    depending on genetic and environmental factors, as shown in olive oil (Žmitek
    et al., 2014). The analysis of CoQ10 is challenging as the benzoquinone ring is
    susceptible to oxidation and the isoprenoid units are hydrophobic (Turkowicz &
    Karpińska, 2013). Different approaches were used for the analysis. HPLC-DAD has
    been used to quantify CoQ10 in different food items (Mattila & Kumpulainen, 2001).
    However, detection with an electrochemical detector is commonly used in food research,
    for example, to determine CoQ10 in olive oil and other food products (Borges et
    al., 2017; Kubo et al., 2008). Furthermore, HPLC coupled with an MS detector,
    using negative atmospheric pressure ionization (API) in combination with selective
    reaction monitoring (SRM) has been used to determine CoQ10 concentrations in several
    types of oils (Rodríguez-Acuña et al., 2008) (Table 2). 2.5.5 Tocochromanols and
    vitamin E Among the prenol lipids (Table 1), in the subcategory quinones and hydroquinones,
    are the lipid-soluble vitamins E and K (Figure 5). Neither are single compounds
    but are grouping terms for structurally similar compounds that exhibit distinctly
    similar biological activities. Generally, vitamin E comprises eight compounds,
    four tocopherols, and four tocotrienols. They all share the basic structure of
    a 6-chromanol ring system with a 15-carbon isoprenoid side chain (Figure 5) (Eitenmiller
    & Lee, 2004; Galli et al., 2017; Szymańska et al., 2020). The four different homologs
    of tocopherols (α, β, γ, and δ or a, b, g, and d-T) and tocotrienols (α, β, γ,
    and δ or a, b, g, and d-T3) differ in the number and position of methyl groups
    in the chroman ring system. The four tocopherols have fully saturated side chains,
    whereas tocotrienols have side chains with double bonds at carbons 3′, 7′, and
    11′ (Eitenmiller & Lee, 2004; Galli et al., 2017; Szymańska et al., 2020). All
    homologs are collectively referred to as tocochromanols. Although tocochromanols
    with one single double bond in the side chain have been reported for over 20 years,
    it recently became clear that these tocomonenols and even dienols are more widespread
    in lipid sources rich in vitamin E (Kröpfl et al., 2021; Müller et al., 2020).
    However, the biosynthesis, roles, and vitamin E/antioxidant activities of tocochromanols
    are not fully characterized. In addition to their vitamin function, tocochromanols
    are efficient radical scavengers and represent the most important lipophilic antioxidant
    in food, improving stability and shelf life (Eitenmiller & Lee, 2004; Niki & Abe,
    2019). The main dietary sources of vitamin E are usually fats and fruits or vegetables.
    Owing to their generally lower lipid content, fruits and vegetables contain 0.1–3
    mg/100 g of tocochromanols (Chun et al., 2006). Conversely, seeds and nuts with
    generally higher lipid contents have up to 30 mg/100 g (Szymanska et al., 2017).
    The highest contents are found in plant oils, of which the levels in wheat germ
    oil can exceed 200 mg/100 g (Szymanska et al., 2017; Trela & Szymanska, 2019).
    Another major source is food supplements, which have either α-tocopherol (or α-tocopheryl
    acetate) added as a single compound or dedicated vitamin E–rich extracts, for
    example, from palm oil or rice bran oil. These concentrated extracts can contain
    30% or more of tocochromanols. In some instances, tocochromanols are also present
    as FA esters, for example, in capsicum fruits, where they can even represent the
    dominant form over the free alcohol (Krauß et al., 2018; Krauß et al., 2020).
    In the human body, tocochromanols are important in vivo antioxidants in lipophilic
    environments, counteracting free radicals and oxidative stress and thus protecting
    UFAs and other labile compounds from oxidation. In addition, they have anti-inflammatory
    and cardioprotective functions (Galli et al., 2017; Szymanska et al., 2017; Kamal-Eldin
    & Appelqvist, 1996). Importantly, the structural features of tocochromanols determine
    their vitamin E and antioxidant activities. Of all homologs, α-T has the highest
    vitamin E activity, whereas the other tocopherol homologs and tocotrienols exhibit
    up to 30-fold lower activities (Kamal-Eldin & Appelqvist, 1996; FAO/WHO, 1998,
    2002). Notably, the antioxidant and vitamin E activities do not correlate. While
    tocotrienols exhibit low vitamin E activities, they are found to be effective
    antioxidants, although precise quantification of these effects is difficult (Jiang,
    2014; Kamal-Eldin & Appelqvist, 1996; Seppanen et al., 2010; Szymańska et al.,
    2020). Generally, tocochromanols need to be enriched or isolated from the sample
    matrix prior to analysis. This is frequently achieved through alkaline saponification
    of the major lipids and subsequent LLE, although care must be taken to avoid degradation
    (Bartosinska et al., 2016; Eitenmiller & Lee, 2004). Alternatively, they can be
    enriched by SPE or liquid–LC (Bartosinska et al., 2016). If intact tocopheryl
    esters are targeted, saponification must be avoided completely (Krauß et al.,
    2018). Tocochromanols can be determined using HPLC–UV–Vis, although higher selectivity
    and sensitivity can be achieved by HPLC–FLD. Chromatographic separation of the
    eight “classic” tocopherols and tocotrienols can be achieved using RP chromatography,
    with the smaller and unsaturated d-T3 eluting first and the saturated and fully
    methylated a-T eluting last (Grebenstein & Frank, 2012; Shammugasamy et al., 2015)
    (Table 2). The added requirement of separating the respective tocopherols and
    tocomonenols adds additional challenges to the analysis, and a-T1 was found to
    coelute with g-T (Irias-Mata et al., 2017). In part, this explains why tocomonenols
    have been overlooked for so long. In LC–MS analysis, APCI was found to be 100-fold
    more sensitive than ESI and is therefore strongly preferred (Bartosinska et al.,
    2016; Hao et al., 2005) (Table 2). Tocochromanols, after trimethylsilylation or
    acetylation, can be analyzed by GC–FID or GC–MS (Bartosinska et al., 2016). Using
    standard conditions with a low-polarity stationary phase (DB-5-type), tocotrienols
    elute after their respective tocopherols, with tocomonenols and tocodienols in
    between (Simon Hammann et al., 2016; Hammann et al., 2019; Müller et al., 2020).
    Depending on the stationary phase and conditions, peak overlapping can occur and
    separation of the g/b isomers can be difficult (Bartosinska et al., 2016). Trimethylsilylated
    (TMS) tocochromanols yield highly informative GC–MS spectra with abundant molecular
    ions as well as fragment ions, indicating methylation of the 6-chromanol ring.
    Importantly, b/g isomers have near identical GC–MS spectra, although some reports
    indicate that they can be distinguished through the intensity ratios of m/z 222
    and 223 (Hammann et al., 2019; Kröpfl et al., 2021). 2.5.6 Quinones and vitamin
    K Similar to vitamin E, vitamin K (Table 1 and Figure 5) is not a single compound
    but a group of compounds that have an important role in maintaining normal blood
    coagulation in humans. Vitamin K comprises phylloquinone (vitamin K1), mainly
    produced by plants, and menaquinones (vitamin K2; MK4–MK13), which are mainly
    produced by bacteria (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, Allergies et
    al., 2017; Halder et al., 2019). Both groups share the 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone
    backbone but differ in the side chains attached at position 3. Although phylloquinone
    has a monounsaturated phytyl chain, menaquinones feature side chains with varying
    numbers of isoprene repeating units (commonly 4–10) (Figure 5) (Booth, 2012).
    Notably, vitamin K1 can be converted into vitamin K2 by bacteria or animal tissues
    (Booth, 2012; Okano et al., 2008). In its reduced hydroquinone form, vitamin K
    acts as a cofactor for the enzyme γ-glutamyl carboxylase, which oxidizes specific
    glutamate residues in vitamin K–dependent proteins to γ-carboxyglutamate, which
    in turn converts them into their active form (Presnell & Stafford, 2002). In this
    process, vitamin K is converted into vitamin K epoxide, which is subsequently
    reduced to regenerate vitamin K (Stafford, 2005). Because phylloquinone is an
    essential electron acceptor in photosystem I, it is mainly found in the green
    parts of plants and accordingly in most leafy and Brassica vegetables. In particular,
    spinach, collards, and brussels sprouts are good sources of phylloquinone, with
    reported contents of 300–500 μg/100 g (Ahmed et al., 2011; Booth, 2012; EFSA Panel
    on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, Allergies et al., 2017; Kamao et al., 2007).
    Another important source is vegetable oils, which can contain up to 200 μg/100
    g, and spreads, which may also contain dihydrophyllquinone when hydrogenated oils
    are used (Booth, 2012; Piironen et al., 1997). In contrast, menaquinones are primarily
    found in animal-based food, particularly in liver, which can contain approximately
    500 μg/100 g of menaquinones (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition, Allergies
    et al., 2017; Koivu-Tikkanen et al., 2000). Furthermore, fermented foods, such
    as cheese (up to 100 μg/100 g) and natto (up to 1000 μg/100 g), are good dietary
    sources (Kamao et al., 2007; Manoury et al., 2013). The EFSA recommends an uptake
    of 10 and 70 μg/day for infants and adults, respectively (EFSA Panel on Dietetic
    Products, Nutrition, Allergies et al., 2017). Vitamin K introduces a second carboxyl
    group to proteins, allowing calcium chelation, thus improving blood coagulation
    (Basset et al., 2017; Presnell & Stafford, 2002). Other vitamin K–dependent proteins
    include osteocalcin, involved in bone mineralization (Basset et al., 2017; Binkley
    et al., 2002). Vitamin K deficiency is primarily evident from excessive bleeding
    due to insufficient coagulation. Similar to other fat-soluble vitamins, it is
    important to consume vitamin K with oil-based foods for increased bioavailability
    (Fusaro et al., 2017). Studies in comparable amounts of vitamin K2 in natto and
    vitamin K1 in spinach have shown that vitamin K2 is easier to absorb and has a
    longer half-life than vitamin K1, which is particularly evident for long-chain
    menaquinones with high lipophilicity (Schurgers & Vermeer, 2000). However, vitamin
    K1 absorption differs between vegetables, and few data are available on this topic
    (Booth, 2012). MK-7 also has a longer half-life and higher activity than vitamin
    K1 (measured through osteocalcin carboxylation) (Schurgers et al., 2007). Dihydrophylloquinone
    is absorbed to a lower degree than its unsaturated analog and also shows inferior
    enzyme activation (Booth et al., 2001). Owing to the labile nature of vitamin
    K forms, their analysis is predominantly achieved by RP-HPLC–FLD or HPL–UV–Vis
    or LC–MS mainly with C18 columns, although C8 or C30 have also been employed (Ahmed
    et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Manoury et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019) (Table
    2). The selectivity and sensitivity of FLD are markedly higher than those of UV–Vis.
    Unfortunately, vitamin K does not fluoresce in its native form, but nonfluorescent
    quinones can be reduced to fluorescent hydroquinones (e.g., λex 243 nm, λem 430
    nm), commonly through post-column derivatization using zinc or platinum oxide
    as catalysts (Ahmed et al., 2011; Koivu-Tikkanen et al., 2000; Kamao et al., 2007).
    In some cases, electrochemical detectors have been used (Piironen et al., 1997).
    In recent years, LC–MS/MS-based methods are preferred because they allow the use
    of stable isotope-labeled internal standards for quantification (Zhang et al.,
    2019; Huang et al., 2016). In contrast to tocochromanols, both ESI and APCI are
    viable options, allowing excellent limits of detection, around or under the μg/kg
    range (Huang et al., 2012, 2016; Japelt & Jakobsen, 2016) (Table 2). 2.6 Oxidized
    lipids and oxylipins Unsaturated lipids are inherently susceptible to oxidation,
    leading to structural changes thus frequently affecting nutritional value and
    bioactivities. In most food lipids, UFAs are the most abundant lipids prone to
    oxidation. In particular, PUFAs with easily abstractable protons in the bis-allylic
    position can oxidize quickly, even under ambient conditions (Johnson & Decker,
    2015; Shahidi & Zhong, 2010b). Although lipid oxidation is associated with a decrease
    in food quality owing to the loss of valuable FAs and the generation of unpleasant
    volatile compounds, there are also numerous lipid oxidation products, mainly oxylipins
    (a great variety of oxidized FAs), which exhibit important physiological functions
    (Barriuso et al., 2013; Shahidi & Zhong, 2010a). In addition to oxygenated FAs,
    there is a growing body of work on other modified FA, namely, nitro FAs and their
    potentially beneficial bioactivities (Mata-Perez et al., 2018). Besides FA chains,
    other labile lipids such as sterols and tocochromanols can undergo oxidation reactions
    with the loss of favorable bioactivities (Figure 6) (Lin et al., 2016; Otaegui-Arrazola
    et al., 2010). FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Some examples of oxidized
    lipid structures originating from sterol lipids, tocopherols, and free fatty acids
    (R = H) and as part of ester lipids such as sterol esters, triacylglycerols, or
    phospholipids. Upon oxidation, sterols can form, among other products, keto-,
    hydroxy-, and epoxy-sterols (B1–B3) as well as dihydroxylated respective stanols
    (B4). Common oxidation products of tocochromanols are quinones (C1), epoxy-quinones
    (C2) as well as dimers (C3) and higher oxidation products. Finally, unsaturated
    fatty acid chains can form a large number of oxidation products. Fatty acid hydroperoxides
    (A1) generally is the first principal product of lipid oxidation, which can then
    undergo further reactions leading to the formation or products such as hydroxy
    fatty acids (A2), core aldehydes (A3), as well as keto and epoxy fatty acids (A4
    and A5) and a large range of volatile products. In abiotic systems, oxidized FAs
    are initially generated either in a radical reaction through autoxidation or in
    a light-mediated reaction through photooxygenation (Belitz et al., 2001; Min &
    Boff, 2002; Shahidi & Zhong, 2010a). In both processes, the initial step in the
    reaction sequence is the generation of FA hydroperoxides. In biological systems,
    this can also be facilitated by LOX and in food with residual enzyme activity
    (such as soy products); these reactions can occur in parallel (Baysal & Demirdöven,
    2007; Gardner, 1996; Hajeyah et al., 2020). Hydroperoxides can now undergo a number
    of reactions that propagate the oxidative degradation of lipids through radical
    chain reactions, leading to secondary oxidation products, such as epoxy, keto,
    hydroxy, and core aldehyde FAs (Hammer & Schieberle, 2013; Xia & Budge, 2017).
    Through chain-cleavage reactions, most importantly the beta cleavage of hydroperoxides,
    numerous volatile products can be generated, many of which are potent flavor compounds
    that dominate the typical sensory profile of food products (Belitz et al., 2001;
    Shahidi & Oh, 2020). Oxylipins (Figure 6) are derived from the oxidation of C18,
    C20, and C22 FAs (Hajeyah et al., 2020). They are produced with high stereospecificity
    by a variety of enzymes, predominantly the LOX, cyclooxygenase (COX), and cytochrome
    P450 families (Hajeyah et al., 2020; Mosblech et al., 2009). Nitro FAs are formed
    by the reaction of FAs with reactive nitrogen species and are generated in humans
    through the electrophilic addition of nitric oxide and related species to UFAs
    in the gastric system, although they are also endogenously present in plants,
    such as olives (Fazzari et al., 2014; Sánchez-Calvo et al., 2019; Winkler & Hertweck,
    2007). Oxidized FA can be found free (e.g., oxylipins) or esterified to complex
    lipids, leading to the formation of oxidized triglycerides or oxidized PLs. Oxidized
    complex lipids can be identified by LC–MS/MS approaches. However, these modified
    lipids are scarcely studied in food, which should be counteracted in the future.
    As expected, oxidized lipids (Figure 6) are particularly abundant in food sources
    rich in (poly-) UFAs, especially upon exposure to heat and air. For example, deep-frying
    induces drastic changes in the lipid composition and leads to high quantities
    of oxidized lipids. The contents of generally less than 5 mg/g of epoxy FAs in
    native plant oils and spreads increased by several times in used frying fat, that
    is, up to 29 mg/g of epoxy FAs in (heavily used) frying fats (Brühl, 2014; Brühl
    et al., 2016; Fankhauser-Noti et al., 2006; Marmesat et al., 2008). Similarly,
    the contents of total epoxy- and keto-TGs of 2.7 mg/g in oxidized rapeseed oil
    and 28.7 mg/g in oxidized linseed oil (Steenhorst-Slikkerveer et al., 2000). Hydroxy-TGs
    were found at levels of 8.8 and 3.5 mg/g in rapeseed and linseed oil, respectively
    (Steenhorst-Slikkerveer et al., 2000). Oxidized FA content changes not only in
    the frying oil but also in the subsequently consumed food items. In an experiment,
    the contents of keto and epoxy FAs in different oils after 8 frying sessions reached
    up to 1.1 mg/g, whereas the contents of these FAs in the fried food increased
    10-fold, from 0.017 to 0.190 mg/g (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2007). Chocolate and
    biscuits are another source of epoxy FAs, containing up to 3.4 and 0.07 mg/g,
    respectively (Mubiru et al., 2014). Furthermore, the storage of oats can increase
    the contents of hydroxy and epoxy FAs from 0.1 to <2.4 mg/g if enzymatic activity
    is not diminished by initial heating (Yang, Piironen, et al., 2019). Oxidized
    phytosterols (Figure 6), known as phytosterol oxidation products (POPs), are generally
    present in lower quantities than oxidized FAs as sterols exist in lower quantities
    than FAs. For example, there is up to 13 μg/g of POPs in spreads, French fries,
    and crisps (Scholz et al., 2015). However, phytosterols and phytosterol esters
    added in high quantities to food products owing to their cholesterol-lowering
    properties lead to levels of POPs of up to 90 μg/g in these products, which increased
    to 5 mg/g after heating (Scholz et al., 2016). The health-related consequences
    of dietary-oxidized lipids are still debated, despite the important physiological
    roles of these compounds in humans (Baynes, 2007; Kanner, 2007; Otaegui-Arrazola
    et al., 2010; Staprans et al., 2005; Vieira et al., 2017). Although it is clear
    that lipid oxidation reduces the dietary value of many food products by reducing
    their content of PUFAs, it is more difficult to determine the exact role of the
    lipid oxidation products formed in this process. However, particularly for epoxides
    and reactive secondary products, such as 4-hydroxy-nonenal, multiple reaction
    paths with nucleophiles can be easily expected (Kuksis & Pruzanski, 2017; Vieira
    et al., 2017). They have been connected with inflammatory diseases as well as
    cancer and general metabolic aging, and some studies suggest that oxidized compounds
    are absorbed from the diet and in part transported to tissues (Kuksis & Pruzanski,
    2017; Vieira et al., 2017). The diverse structures of oxidized lipids are determined
    using equally diverse appropriate methods. Because there are excellent and more
    comprehensive reviews on this topic (Li, Zhong, et al., 2019), we briefly mention
    some concepts here. On a basic level, wet chemical methods, such as hydroperoxide
    and anisidine values, can be used to assess the oxidative state of food lipids
    (Barriuso et al., 2013). However, these methods do not offer any information on
    the molecular identities of present compounds and may give misleading results.
    For instance, heavily oxidized oils may exhibit relatively low hydroperoxide numbers
    because secondary reactions deplete the initially formed but rather labile hydroperoxides.
    More structural information can be attained through more sophisticated analytical
    techniques, such as NMR, which has been used for the analysis of oxidized oils
    owing to the characteristic proton shifts associated with nearby oxygen (Damerau
    et al., 2020; Merkx et al., 2018). Undoubtedly, the most detailed compositional
    information can be gathered through chromatographic methods, particularly in conjunction
    with MS. In most cases, oxidized lipids are minor compounds and require enrichment,
    for example, through SPE. For the class separation of oxidized, monomeric, and
    polymeric lipids (e.g., in used deep-frying oils), size exclusion chromatography
    has been applied with great success (Márquez-Ruiz et al., 1996). Oxidized FAs
    (after liberation from ester lipids) and oxidized (phyto)sterols were analyzed
    in detail using GC and GC–MS because their relatively low molecular weights make
    them amenable to GC (Menéndez-Carreño et al., 2016; Xia & Budge, 2017). For most
    other compound classes and essentially all intact oxidized complex lipids, such
    as PLs and TGs, predominantly LC-based approaches, such as LC coupled with tandem
    MS (MS/MS), both in NP and RP, are used (Table 2). Depending on the target lipid
    class, different ionization techniques have their advantages. For example, although
    ESI offers excellent sensitivity for the analysis of (oxidized) phospholipids,
    APCI can be more appropriate for lower polarity lipids, such as oxidized sterols
    (Domingues et al., 2008; Gorassini et al., 2017). This makes the comprehensive
    analysis of a wide class of oxidized lipids still a very challenging endeavor
    (Li, Zhong, et al., 2019). 3 FOOD PROCESSING AND ORIGIN AFFECTING LIPIDS TOWARD
    FOOD QUALITY AND SAFETY Foods can be consumed raw, cooked, or processed. In addition,
    foods can also be subjected to harvesting and transporting processes and are often
    stored. All these processes can affect the lipid profile of foods and, consequently,
    their quality and nutritional value. Few studies have been focusing on the use
    of lipidomics as a tool to evaluate how lipid profile can be changed during food
    cooking or processing, exemplified by few examples on the different conditions
    or processes to which foods are subjected. The effect of cooking, specifically
    heating, on the lipid profile has been most studied. In these studies, cooking
    processes, such as boiling, steaming, roasting, and air frying, were applied (Table
    4). These studies have evaluated changes in the lipid profile of different matrices,
    including olive oil, duck, seafood, meat, and fish (see Table 4). From these studies,
    cooking processes were found to induce a decrease in the contents of PLs, including
    plasmalogen antioxidants, UFAs, and SP (Jia, Li, et al., 2021; Li, Li, Huang,
    et al., 2020; Lozano-Castellón et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Song et al., 2020)
    (see references in Table 4). TGs were also reported to change but only in the
    studied fish (Shi et al., 2019). Food preservation processes, including gamma
    irradiation (Jia, Shi, et al., 2021) and chemical preservation (nisin, potassium
    sorbate) (Jia, Wu, et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2022), affect the lipid profile (Table
    4). Irradiation of goat meat increases the contents of some lipid classes and
    decreases the contents of others. In contrast, chemical preservation decreases
    the contents of complex lipid species. TABLE 4. Variations in food lipid profiles

    of food products (Table 3). Milk fermentation decreases the contents of PI, PS,
    and LPE (Jia, Liu, et al., 2021), Cer, and SM (Zhang, Zhu, et al., 2022), and
    increases the contents of TGs, among others (Jia, Liu, et al., 2021; Zhang, Zhu,
    et al., 2022). Variation of HexCer content depends on the fermentation type. Milk
    treated by ultrahigh temperature processing has decreased TGs contents and increased
    FAs levels (Lu, Pickova, et al., 2018; Xu, Zhang, et al., 2020) and shows an increase
    in saturated PCs (Wölk et al., 2022). The lipid profile of milk formulas is different
    from that of human milk, and their composition is quite different between brands
    (Hewelt-Belka et al., 2020). During the manufacturing of green tea leaves, there
    is a decrease in the levels of PA and glycolipids. Roasting seed and nut oils
    also affects the lipid profile, namely, the contents of PUFAs and PLs (Zhang,
    Guo, et al., 2022). Oxidation inevitably changes the lipid profile, with an increase
    in the levels of oxidized FAs (Vigor et al., 2022; Zhang, Guo, et al., 2022; Zhang,
    Li, et al., 2021). Aging of pork loins decreases the total PLs owing to enzymatic
    hydrolysis and increases the contents of LPCs (Chao et al., 2020). The levels
    of PA, PI, and PS also increase. Variation of the lipid profile, namely, in PL
    and mostly with C18:2, as well as modulation of cutin, suberin, and wax metabolism
    occurs during rice storage (Zhang, Duan, et al., 2021; Zhang, Zhao, et al., 2022).
    Molecular identity has been correlated with botanical and geographical origins
    for various types of food, mainly eggs and plant derivatives (Table 3). Interestingly,
    botanical and geographic identity or origin discrimination is mainly based on
    PL markers in most cases. Discrimination appears to be linked to complex lipids
    modulated by enzymatic metabolism. Environmental parameters (both biotic and abiotic)
    affect plant lipid metabolism, which in turn affects the quality and nutritional
    value of plant foods, and thus, this topic is starting to be studied. Adaptation
    to different growth conditions has been reported. Specifically, the levels of
    PLs with UFAs decrease in bananas during ripening (Sun, Chen, et al., 2020), and
    the GLs (TGs and DAGs) of avocado are remodeled during growth and ripening (Rodríguez-López
    et al., 2017). The metabolism of complex lipids is also sensitive to growth conditions
    and depends on maturation stage and may also depend on or be related to taxonomy.
    For example, during the embryonic development of hickory nuts, there is an accumulation
    of GLs and PLs (Huang et al., 2022). In contrast, during chilling injury of bell
    peppers, there is a variation in the levels of TG, PA, and LPA, which can be considered
    markers of this type of biotic stress (Xu, Lam et al., 2021). Interestingly, most
    of these works were published in the last 2 years, demonstrating the increasing
    interest in this area. However, additional research is needed to outline the role
    of PL, TG, and glycolipids in adaptation and modification during food processing,
    which can affect food quality, shelf life, and potentially human health. Identifying
    the lipidome of unprocessed and processed foods is important to define identity
    and quality markers and to develop traceability tools. For example, profiles of
    FAs have already been applied to traceability and evaluation of shelf life for
    bivalves, and lipidomics was applied as a traceability tool for the edible alga
    Ulva spp. Nevertheless, to take full advantage of lipidomics as a traceability
    tool, it is necessary to reach a high coverage of numerous lipidomes of different
    foods and to determine panels of identity and quality biomarkers that can be applied
    in quality control processes within the reach of routine food quality control
    laboratories. 4 ANALYTICAL CHALLENGES IN FOOD LIPIDOMICS The diversity and complexity
    of lipids is an issue for the determination of lipid composition in food items.
    A major challenge is the huge structural diversity and chemical properties of
    lipids, with many of them present in very low abundance, requiring enrichment
    procedure or derivatization to enhance the detection (Table 2). Additionally,
    different types of food have different lipidome compositions. Both impair the
    harmonization of a single methodology to cover the whole lipidome. Recently, interesting
    reviews on food lipidomics have been published, but most focusing on the lipidomic
    strategies based on LC–MS approaches commonly used to profile complex lipids in
    foods, such as PLs, GLs, TGs, and SPs (Song et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2021), or
    focused on the general workflow to provide an up-to-date overview of MS-based
    lipidomics approaches (Rampler et al., 2020). However, there is a lack of information
    on the several lipid classes that could require specific lipidomics methodologies.
    Here, a critical view of most commonly applied analytical methodologies for lipid
    analysis, the level of information achieved by each methodology, advantages and
    disadvantages of each methodology, and future perspectives are addressed. The
    analytical workflow for the food lipid analysis is selected depending on the composition
    and the lipids of interest (Table 2). Nevertheless, all workflows shared several
    common sequential steps starting from sampling, lipid extraction, fractionation/enrichment,
    and/or derivatization (optional for some lipid classes, and mandatory for others),
    analysis and detection by chromatography coupled or not with MS (data acquisition)
    and data analysis. As lipids are sensitive to oxidation (e.g., PUFA-rich species)
    and several classes are sensitive to light exposure (e.g., carotenoids), already
    the sampling, handling, and storage of food prior to lipid extraction and analysis
    is a critical point; thus, samples after collection must be stored at −80°C or
    freeze-dried and be protected from light. Lipid extraction from foods is usually
    performed with organic solvents, either by using LLE or supported liquid extraction
    (SLE). Although different organic solvents can be used, the combination of methanol
    with chlorinated solvents (e.g., dichloromethane or chloroform) is the most popular
    (Table 2). Extraction efficiencies may vary depending on the lipid composition
    of the food matrix, and the extraction method therefore can be different depending
    on the types of food (Table 3). For instance, for the extraction of volatile C8
    compounds and terpenes must be carried out byHS-SPME, or by SBSE static HS sampling,
    used to obtain volatiles from solid or liquid samples (Table 2), as liquid phase
    extraction can lead to loss of these volatile lipids. After extraction, the lipid
    extracts can be analyzed directly without further processing. However, in the
    case of specific lipid classes, either due to the low abundance, low ionization
    efficiency in MS, or low volatility for GC (Table 2), a fractionation and/or derivatization
    prior to the analysis is necessary. For instance, oil-rich foods with a low abundant
    fraction of polar lipids and a high percentage of TGs (greater than 90%) may require
    column fractionation and/or enrichment with SPE to obtain polar lipid-rich extracts
    (Alves et al., 2016). Derivatization is very frequently used the analysis of FAs,
    either esterified FAs (by alkaline transmethylation) or total FAs (esterified
    and free by acid catalyzed methylation), STs (silylation, methylation), vitamin
    D (e.g., reaction with PTAD), and oxylipins. An exception is quinone/vitamin K,
    where reduction is commonly performed after chromatography to generate fluorescent
    derivatives prior to FLD detection (Kamao et al., 2007). Different analytical
    approaches can be used for the identification and characterization of lipids (Table
    2). The choice of one analytical approach over the other may be due to the lipid
    classes to be analyzed. However, most lipidomic analyses rely on the use of chromatography,
    commonly GC or LC, with various detectors (Table 2). In GC, different columns
    can be used either depending on the lipid classes, the type of derivatized product,
    and even the same lipid class. GC–FID and GC–MS are widely used to analyze volatile
    lipids as methyl ester of FAs, terpenes, C8 compounds, sterols, and oxylipins
    (Figures 2-5). GC–FID identifies the compounds only based on the retention time
    and thus requires pure standards for a correct annotation and identification,
    which is a drawback when pure standards are not available, often the case for
    classes of low abundance such as oxidized lipids. In GC–MS, the identification
    is more robust because it is achieved by both RT and MS interpretations. Conversely,
    GC–FID is considered more robust for the quantification than GC–MS, where peak
    areas are more depending on the ionization efficiency and fragmentation behavior
    of each compound. LC can be coupled to different detectors, such as UV–Vis, DAD,
    FLD, and MS. LC–MS is increasingly used in the analyses of lipids in food (Table
    2) having the advantage of allowing the separation of lipids and higher confidence
    in the specific identification, based on MS and MS/MS approaches that provide
    a detailed structural information. This is in contrast to the other detection
    methods for LC, in which the identification is achieved by retention time and
    spectral information (in LC-UV–Vis, LC-DAD, and LC-FLD). In the LC methodologies,
    different columns (e.g., RP, NP, and HILIC) provide different results. Although
    RP is performed for most of the compounds, NP and HILIC have been used mainly
    to detect polar lipids (Table 2 and Figure 3). For analyses of quinones (e.g.,
    CoA, tocochromanols & Vit E, and Vit K), LC–MS with APCI or APPI sources was used
    to enhance ionization and thus increase sensitivity (Table 2). NP or HILIC columns,
    separation depends on the polar head group. Therefore, it is possible to separate
    the lipid classes by retention times and, thus, visualize the lipid profile by
    lipid class as species of the same lipid class coelute (in HILIC as well as RP).
    NP or HILIC columns have the disadvantage of being unsuitable for samples rich
    in neutral lipids, such as TGs, as separation within the lipid class is restricted,
    and these lipids are retained on the column after a limited number of injections,
    contributing to column bleeding. Nevertheless, these columns can be used for samples
    with a low percentage of TGs or fractionated extracts rich in polar lipids. In
    an RP column, lipids are separated according to the carbon chains of esterified
    FAs, and consequently, lipid species of different classes can have similar retention
    times, depending on the chromatographic gradient. However, with these columns,
    fractional elution is achieved with the separation of PLs, cholesterol, sterol
    esters, and TGs, although the PL species from different classes can coelute. Interestingly,
    C18 columns are the most used for LC–MS lipidomic analysis (Table 2). However,
    further efforts are needed to include more lipid classes like quinones (e.g.,
    CoA, Vit E, and Vit K) and/or oxylipins in the same LC–MS run to achieve the full
    coverage of foods lipidome. Lipidomic analysis with single-step extraction and
    LC–MS analysis usually provides a global profile of the complex lipids without
    derivatization or extensive sample manipulation, which is a great advantage. Thus
    by using LC–MS, different levels of information can be obtained depending on the
    selected instrument and method. Using a high-resolution (HR) mass spectrometer
    for the detection of lipids allows to obtain exact elemental composition of the
    analytes and at a given resolution the identification of lipid species (e.g.,
    PC 34:2). If MS2 fragmentation or even further MSn fragmentation approaches are
    applied, more structural information can be obtained. This allows the identification
    of molecular species (e.g., PC 16:0_18:2) with structural details, including,
    for instance, information about the polar head group, the acyl chains, and sometimes,
    the position of the FAs in the glycerol backbone of polar lipids. Details on MS
    and MS/MS data analysis to confirm the structure of lipids for structural identification
    have been revised (Alves et al., 2021). When looking for particular lipids, usually
    targeted approaches such as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) are used. Here,
    only lipids of interest will be detected, and therefore, a certain level of knowledge
    about the lipidome is required. Targeted methods however offer the advantage of
    high sensitivity and a rather small size of the acquired data that can be rapidly
    processed. Such methods are often used to quantify low abundant lipid species,
    for instance, as recently done for oxylipins in hazelnut oil (Sun et al., 2022).
    Targeted methods can also be designed in a way to target a huge variety of lipid
    species, as, for example, done for egg yolk with more than 900 lipid species analyzed
    by an LC–MRM method allowing discrimination among cage, barn, and free-range origin
    (Chin et al., 2023). For a comprehensive lipidome analysis and the discovery of
    lipids present in a certain food, usually untargeted LC–HRMS is applied. In contrast
    to targeted approaches, untargeted approaches aim to discover all the lipids present
    in a given sample. Such measurements usually create a large amount of data and
    often show a lack in sensitivity in contrast to targeted approaches. These data
    are usually aided by bioinformatics tools for lipidomics data analysis (Ni et
    al., 2022). Furthermore, the reproducibility, especially in the case of data-dependent
    acquisition, may not always be given and can be a drawback of such methods. In
    food research, untargeted methods can be useful to discover the lipidome of a
    given food. Untargeted lipidomics can, for example, be used to classify different
    truffle species (Creydt & Fischer, 2022), to differentiate bovine milk from different
    feeding regimes (Wölk et al., 2022), and to follow changes of lipid profiles in
    different types of meat induced by irradiation (Chiesa et al., 2022). The combination
    of untargeted and targeted lipidomics in so-called pseudo-targeted manner, combining
    the high lipidome coverage from untargeted approaches with the high sensitivity
    and reliability of targeted methods (Xu, Hu, et al., 2020), will be helpful in
    the elucidation of food lipidomes. Pseudo-targeted methods also enable for a deeper
    structural understanding as for instance shown by combining it with derivatization
    to localize the position of C–C double bonds within PUFAs (Xu, Lv, et al., 2021;
    Tang et al., 2018). To better analyze intricate lipid samples, LC–MS can be enhanced
    through the use of ion mobility (IM) to separate isobaric compounds that coelute.
    With LC–IM–MS, the lipidome coverage is expanded due to the added separation in
    conjunction with HR MS. This enables the separation of lipids based on their polarity,
    mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio, and shape-to-charge ratio. Additionally, IM such as
    drift tube IM spectrometry allows to calculate the collision cross section based
    on the arrival times, which can serve as a molecular descriptor to identify lipids
    in complex food mixtures (Paglia et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2022). Ambient MS,
    such as direct analysis in real time (DART), is a novel approach in recent years,
    employed for the comprehensive profiling of lipids as a quick, direct, and lossless
    measuring technology (H. Lu, Zhang et al., 2018). DART–MS is a well-established
    APCI-based ambient ionization method, enabling lipid analysis in various food
    samples, which was commercialized and automated for food lipid analysis owing
    to its advantages (Deng et al., 2020). In food lipidomics, DART has been successfully
    applied, for assessing the freshness of salmon by profiling and identifying its
    FAs and TGs (Fiorino et al., 2018) and for a fast characterization of sterols
    in vegetable oils and enriched margarines (Alberici et al., 2016). DART-Q-TOF
    was also applied for the authenticity and traceability of beef, dairy, poultry,
    and fish, based on their lipidomic profile (Birse et al., 2021; Fiorino et al.,
    2019; Hrbek et al., 2014; Wang, Xu, et al., 2021). Indeed, the lipidome of most
    foods is still poorly known at the molecular level and thus should be further
    explored. Lipid composition and its variability and plasticity are highly dependent
    on environmental and agronomic factors, geographical and botanical origins, ripening
    degree, cultivation conditions, processing, preservation, and storage conditions,
    which impact the food quality to a large extent. In addition, despite natural
    variability, lipid synthesis is controlled by metabolic pathways and a set of
    well-regulated enzymes. Therefore, the lipidome is expected to vary within reference
    ranges that need to be established, allowing the assessment of food quality, origin,
    authenticity, and fraud. Taking this into account, an effort is needed to develop
    analytical approaches and comprehensive databases with this essential nutritional
    information, as will be discussed in the following section. 5 COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS
    OF FOOD LIPIDOMICS 5.1 Designing food lipidomics experiments Many aspects of the
    function of lipids in foods and their effects on human health remain to be explored.
    This is partially due to the current lack of comprehensive data on the exact lipid
    composition of a particular food item. The absence of this knowledge means we
    are missing a reference source and have insufficient means of comparison when
    analyzing food lipidomes (Wang, Wang, et al., 2019). An automatically accessible
    knowledge base containing detailed information on food lipid compositions would
    enable the generation of new computational tools for a systems-level analysis
    of food lipidomics data. This would facilitate knowledge discovery and the generation
    of new research hypotheses. The need for reference data has been recognized and
    addressed in various pilot studies. A recent study (Matsuzawa et al., 2021) performed
    untargeted lipidomics on 155 agricultural products from 58 different plant species
    utilizing a rapid screening strategy with 1 technical replicate. This resulted
    in the detection of 715 different molecular lipid species. Such large screening
    studies are necessary to quickly fill the gap of missing data. However, when creating
    reference values, consideration must be given to prioritizing robustness and defining
    the influence of various environmental factors, such as soil, light, temperature,
    water, and mineral availability. To guarantee the usefulness of the generated
    data, there are foodomics-specific aspects to consider. This is essential for
    any experiment with the aim of accurately determining the lipid composition of
    a food item. In every case, controlling unwanted technical and biological variations
    during sample handling is essential. This ensures that any differences measured
    provide reliable information to properly answer the research question. Even the
    use of sophisticated statistical tools and software cannot compensate for mistakes
    made during sample preparation. Good experimental design practices establish a
    solid foundation for meaningful data analysis. 5.2 Controlling technical and biological
    variations When controlling for biological variation, the number of biological
    replicates must be sufficiently large to ensure an adequate statistical power
    of results. There are two factors complicating the determination of the necessary
    sample size: an unknown effect size and the high dimensionality of lipidomics
    data. Dimensionality refers to the number of features, in this case lipids, recorded
    in an experiment. Lipidomics data is highly dimensional as hundreds of different
    lipid species can be measured with modern MS methods. High dimensionality combined
    with an unknown effect size makes it almost impossible to estimate sample size
    without conducting a pilot study (Blaise et al., 2021). Due to time and financial
    constraints, pilot study might not be feasible. In this case, a minimum of six
    biological replicates for plant metabolomics studies is advised (Martins et al.,
    2018), and at least four biological replicates for metabolomics experiments in
    general (Alseekh et al., 2021). However, when pilot data is available, power calculation
    algorithms allow for a more accurate sample size determination (Blaise et al.,
    2021). To reduce technical variation, methods such as randomization and blocking
    should be considered. For example, regularly rotating the position of potted plants
    ensures homogeneous exposure to variations in climate and light (Martins et al.,
    2018). In field experiments, differences in soil fertility and drainage can be
    accounted for with block design. By arbitrarily distributing all sample groups
    to every block at the same frequency, the influence of variations can be assessed
    in the analysis (Martins et al., 2018). For optimal results, samples in each block
    should be harvested randomly to minimize block effects (Martins et al., 2018).
    Another source of unwanted variance is the batch effect (Liu et al., 2020). It
    occurs when samples are measured in batches and are thereby subjected to slight
    variations in experimental conditions, such as temperature or personnel. Therefore,
    the order in which samples are processed and measured should be randomized to
    avoid that batches correspond to experimental groups (Martins et al., 2018). One
    popular tool used for batch correction is ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007). Procedural
    inconsistencies can introduce technical variation and lead to changes in lipid
    composition, resulting in a skewed analysis and interpretation. Here, standard
    operating procedures (SOPs) can contribute to the accuracy of the analytical measurements
    and facilitate comparisons between datasets and even laboratories (Martins et
    al., 2018). When using SOPs, interlaboratory variation across 10 independent laboratories
    was not larger than intra-laboratory variation, showing that harmonization results
    in increasingly coherent and reproducible data (Massonnet et al., 2010; Martins
    et al., 2018). Additionally, most measured lipids are influenced by the environment
    to a much lesser degree than redox state-sensitive metabolites (e.g., ascorbic
    acid) or sugars, indicating that achieving harmonization in lipidomics experiments
    via the implementation of detailed protocols is possible and beneficial (Massonnet
    et al., 2010). 5.3 Data analysis by statistical methods In addition to controlling
    sources of variation, it is necessary to develop a plan detailing the statistical
    methods for analysis as well as the variables and outcomes to be collected. Statistical
    methods used for lipidomics in general are also applicable to food lipidomics.
    Univariate methods, such as the analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Wilcoxon rank-sum
    test, and Kruskal–Wallis, may be used to test for the statistical significance
    of one particular lipid between two or more sample groups. For example, ANOVA
    was used to evaluate the lipid coverage of the extraction methods Bligh–Dyer,
    Folch, and Matyash applied to green Arabica coffee beans (Silva et al., 2020).
    When using univariate methods, the previously mentioned high dimensionality of
    lipidomics data must be considered. Suitable multiple testing correction procedures,
    such as the Benjamini and Hochberg approach, must be performed to control the
    false discovery rate (Blaise et al., 2021). Popular multivariate analysis methods
    include the principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering, and partial
    least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (Blaise et al., 2021). For instance,
    PCA and PLS-DA were used to differentiate between wheat samples from different
    geographical regions in China (Jin et al., 2021). There is a need for tools that
    go further than the standard statistical analysis to enable the exploration of
    global changes in lipid metabolic pathways. For example, the Lipid Network Explorer
    (LINEX) integrates statistical and network-based analysis for the study of global
    lipidome changes (Köhler et al., 2021). This web tool generates a lipid metabolic
    network from experimental data using metabolic rules to match biochemically connected
    lipids on a species level and combines it with a statistical correlation and testing
    analysis (Köhler et al., 2021). The newest version of LINEX also implements a
    network enrichment algorithm that deduces changes in enzymatic activity from lipidomics
    data (Rose et al., 2023). LION/web (Molenaar et al., 2019) is another tool that
    performs enrichment analysis to elucidate trends in complex lipidomic datasets.
    It is based on a lipid ontology, which associates over 50,000 lipid species to
    biophysical, chemical, and cell biological features (Molenaar et al., 2019). Various
    reviews have been published recently that give a detailed overview of the plethora
    of bioinformatics tools that are available for each step of the lipidomics analysis
    workflow. However, based on our current understanding, there appears to be a lack
    of bioinformatics tools specifically designed for food lipidomics, indicating
    a significant gap that requires attention as well as action (Damiani et al., 2023;
    Ni et al., 2023). 5.4 Data integration and knowledge creation Most information
    about food nutrient content is stored in country-specific food composition databases,
    such as FoodData Central (U.S. Department of Agriculture—Agricultural Research
    Service, 2019) and Frida (National Food Institute—Technical University of Denmark,
    2019) (Table 5). These databases vary widely in their comprehensiveness, standardization,
    and ease of access (Delgado et al., 2021). They mostly detail the total carbohydrate,
    protein, and fat content, as well as vitamins and minerals with some also including
    the dietary fiber, carotenoid, and polyphenol content (Delgado et al., 2021).
    Most of the available lipid data concentrates on cholesterol and various types
    of FAs (SFA, MUFAs, and PUFAs, as well as n − 3 and n − 6 FA). However, in a lipidomics
    context where structural information is relevant, a more detailed breakdown of
    lipid composition in food is still needed. TABLE 5. Overview of food composition

    The approximately 150 core nutritional components tracked in national databases
    represent only a small fraction of the thousands of biochemicals found in food.
    It is therefore essential that these national databases are not only extended
    but also integrated with other compound databases. The most extensive resource
    for food composition data is currently the Canadian FooDB database (FooDB, 2021),
    recording over 15,000 distinct biochemicals present in foodstuffs (Barabási et
    al., 2020). Lipids are the largest group of molecules, of which 32% were FAs.
    Depending on the specific food item, FooDB may include information on some species
    of lipid classes other than fatty acyls, albeit usually not in a quantitative
    manner. Information on lipids in compound databases barely scratches the surface
    of the enormous variety contained within food, and information on lipid molecular
    species composition is sorely missing. A proof-of-principle study published in
    2021 determined the lipidomic profiles of green, yellow, and red bell peppers,
    with over 8000 lipid compounds detected in total. Of these, only 106 were annotated
    because others were not present in any existing metabolomics database (Sutliff
    et al., 2021). This underscores the need for expanding the availability of reference
    spectra of different foods. There are two prominent databases that contain MS
    reference: the RIKEN MSn spectral database for phytochemicals (ReSpect) (Sawada
    et al., 2012), which is a collection of literature and in-house plant metabolomics
    MSn spectra data, and the Food Metabolome Repository (Food Metabolome Repository,
    2021; Sawada et al., 2012), which contains food metabolome data obtained using
    LC–MS. Progress has been made regarding the harmonization of food composition
    data from different countries. For this purpose, various tools were developed,
    one of which is Langual (LanguaL™, 2017), an international framework for food
    description. It provides a standardized language for describing and classifying
    foods to enable information retrieval thus facilitating the linkage between many
    different food databanks from various countries (Delgado et al., 2021). In general,
    efforts to link different national food databanks with each other and set international
    standards are mediated by InFOODs (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations, 2021), the International Network of Food Data Systems from the Food and
    Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. One of the biggest projects
    connecting food databases across countries is EuroFIR (Delgado et al., 2021; Liang
    et al., 2021), the European Food Information Resource, which integrates datasets
    from 26 European countries, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, and Japan.
    In addition to allowing users to search all those datasets simultaneously via
    the Food Explorer interface, it also provides the Bioactive Substances in Food
    Information Systems (eBASIS) (Delgado et al., 2021; Plumb et al., 2017) tool,
    which is a compilation of food compositions and their biological effects, extracted
    from peer-reviewed literature as raw data and critically evaluated by experts.
    As the exact composition of a specific food item is influenced by many different
    factors, it is important to note that the information found in one database may
    not be an accurate reference for the analysis of a specific sample. This may be
    due to differences in geographical origins, variety, soil, and nutrient availability
    (Min et al., 2017; Tietel, Simhon, et al., 2020), or manufacturer and lot for
    processed foods (Delgado et al., 2021). All these show that there is still much
    work to be done to achieve a comprehensive knowledge base that can be used as
    reference for food lipidomics experiments. To accelerate progress in this endeavor,
    the potential offered by recent advances in bioinformatics and machine learning
    should be fully leveraged. One such approach was developed in a pilot project
    called FoodMine (Hooton et al., 2020) in which natural language processing was
    used to access the wealth of information that is scattered across the scientific
    literature but not yet covered by food databases (Barabási et al., 2020). The
    insights gained from such text mining tools as well as the information in existing
    databases should be curated and integrated into an all-encompassing meta-database
    connecting lipids, metabolites, diet, and disease data. This meta-database will
    enable researchers to systematically explore the entire existing body of knowledge
    on dietary lipids. With a graph data structure as the foundation, topological
    analysis algorithms can be applied to gain insight into the relationships between
    elements in the meta-database. This can provide answers to various questions,
    such as which lipids a group of foods has in common that are known to affect the
    condition of a particular disease. Uncovering these relations enables the discovery
    of new molecular mechanisms underlying diseases leading to actionable information
    to improve health. Therefore, it is vital that we now lay the foundation for these
    network approaches by generating a solid and comprehensive knowledge base to enhance
    our understanding of the complex interactions between lipids in nutrition and
    disease. 6 FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Current and anticipated global changes in climate
    and resource availability (e.g., soil and water) necessitate the reevaluation
    of food chains to ensure food security for an increasing population, in which
    the nutritional quality of agricultural products is also maintained. Intensified
    agricultural practices, including the use of poor soils and brackish water, together
    with expanding cultivation areas, have enhanced our understanding of the crucial
    link between plant nutrition and human nutrition, resulting in more aware and
    educated consumers. The connection between inevitable changes and food quality
    is made through characterization, which enables us to retain and improve food
    quality. Defining the chemical composition of food enables creating more nutritional
    food with higher contents of health-related ingredients while also gaining knowledge
    on food''s beneficial biological effects. Food lipids have been neglected due
    to technical challenges, leaving this enormous group of metabolites relatively
    unmapped. Lately, reports on their importance in nutrition, health, and disease
    have emerged, gradually revealing their significance in proper functioning, owing
    to their key roles, for example, as antioxidants, or in neural, immune, gastrointestinal,
    and cardiovascular health. In addition, research has demonstrated the involvement
    of oxylipins in disease onset and prevention. The lipid profiles of foods show
    interspecies variability and are sensitive to various environmental effects, including
    growth conditions, maturity, development, and harvest, and can also change during
    storage and processing. Therefore, the comprehensive characterization of food
    lipidomes can be used as a tool to identify and map the most productive species,
    which are more resilient to climate change and pests, leading to greater production
    sustainability. Furthermore, building an all-encompassing meta-database connecting
    lipids, metabolites, diet, and disease data comprehensively characterization the
    diverse lipidomes of various foods can contribute to healthier and more sustainable
    diets and enhance food safety by providing information on food quality and traceability.
    Future trends in food lipidomics should advance in food lipid analysis addressing
    the difficulties and challenges such as sample complexity and lipid diversity,
    while also recognizing the importance of identifying the food lipidome, the need
    for harmonization and standardization of protocols, and strive to provide clearer
    insights into the composition and role of lipids in food, enabling a better understanding
    of their nutritional impact. Moreover, the impact of food processing on food lipids,
    lipid composition, stability, and bioavailability, thereby affecting the nutritional
    value of foods need also to be explored. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Zipora Tietel and

  description: India seeks to deploy millions of solar water pumps to farmers who
    often lack access to electricity or face an unreliable power supply. Improving
    the use of this technology can bolster sustainable agriculture and expand clean
    energy services. We investigate farm-level impacts and opportunities with primary
    survey data (n = 292 farmers) and a large real-time pump operational data set
    (n = 1106 pumps). By modeling the potential solar generation of off-grid solar
    water pumps, we estimate 300-400 kWh/month of unutilized solar energy per pumping
    system, representing up to 95% of potential generation. While farmers report increased
    revenues and ease of pump operation, unsolved challenges concerning the lack of
    panel cleaning and tracking remain. Pump operational data show pump usage in the
    summer and monsoon seasons and an expansion of irrigation to grow crops in the
    winter. Relative to emissions associated with the use of diesel pumps, solar pumps
    that are highly utilized reduced life cycle CO2-eq emissions by 93% on average,
    while the pumping systems with the lowest use result in a net increase of 26%
    relative to the diesel alternatives. Based on observed usage rates, approximately
    70% of pumps had positive environmental benefits. The high share of unutilized
    solar energy provides a significant opportunity to use the energy for nonpumping
    purposes.

    To Deploying distributed energy resources can advance clean energy services in
    the Global South, but implementation challenges must be overcome in order to achieve
    their full potential. Solar water pumps for irrigation are being deployed in India
    to address challenges with existing irrigation methods such as electric and diesel
    pumps. Approximately 20 million electric irrigation pumps consumed nearly 18%
    of India’s electricity in 2021, generated by a coal-dominated power system. (1)
    The electric pumps often lack access to a reliable electricity supply. In addition,
    Indian farmers use approximately 10 million diesel pumps, consuming considerable
    amounts of petroleum and incurring high fuel costs. To address these challenges,
    India seeks to deploy 2.75 million solar water pumps to farmers across the country
    who often lack access to electricity or face an unreliable power supply. (2) In
    2021, there were 272 700 solar water pump installations nationwide. (3) The central
    Indian state of Chhattisgarh deployed over 100 000 off-grid solar water pumps
    from 2016 to 2022, the highest among all states in India, bringing water access
    to tens of thousands of farmers. The initiative has been led by the Chhattisgarh
    State Renewable Energy Development Authority (CREDA), a state-level government
    agency in charge of deploying renewable energy on the utility and residential
    scale. This uptake of distributed solar water pumps marks a departure for this
    fossil fuel-rich state which produces and exports coal, steel, and coal-generated
    electricity. (4) The successful adoption of solar water pumps helps achieve multiple
    United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), (5) as it can both promote
    affordable and clean energy (SDG 7) and support sustainable agriculture and water
    management (SDG 2 and SDG 6). Successful mass deployment of solar water pumps
    warrants a thorough investigation of how current solar pumps are being used and
    the identification of any system inefficiencies. Such studies can ensure effective
    solar water pump deployment that can ameliorate climate change impacts such as
    those of the unpredictable monsoon seasons on the state’s irrigation sector. Chhattisgarh
    ranks as one of the most polluting regions of India’s power grid, being a net
    energy exporter with surplus energy supplied by large coal power plants, with
    recent estimates showing the highest marginal emissions factors in the country,
    (6) underscoring the environmental benefits of shifting new electricity irrigation
    demand to decentralized solar power. Thus, improving the utilization of these
    solar pumping systems could yield benefits to farmers, regional air quality, and
    the overall Indian power system. Several studies have investigated solar water
    pumps used for irrigation in India and other countries. Chandel et al. (7) assessed
    the technology and identified key research gaps and barriers to the wide-scale
    use of solar water pumps in India, finding that solar pumps were cost-effective
    alternatives to diesel and grid-connected pumps for irrigation and community water
    supplies. Rathore et al. (8) investigated the policies and supporting infrastructure
    behind the growth of solar water irrigation pumps in India, finding challenges
    such as a lack of awareness and a lack of a skilled workforce required for installation.
    Shah et al. (9) compared the impacts of different solar water pump policies on
    groundwater scarcity and concluded that appropriate deployment mechanisms can
    mitigate this challenge. Other studies have examined the technical performance,
    (10,11) the water–energy nexus, (12) and the financial benefits of solar water
    pumps over diesel and grid-connected pumps. (13) Beyond India, others have examined
    the techno-economic feasibility of solar water pumps in Egypt, (14) sub-Saharan
    Africa, (15−17) and the Mediterranean. (18) Armanuos et al. (14) also estimated
    the environmental impacts of solar and diesel pumps for rice cultivation in Egypt.
    Focusing on Chhattisgarh, Sharma and Jhawar (19) examined farmers’ satisfaction
    with the technology and highlighted the need to educate farmers by running awareness
    programs about the technology so they do not revert to traditional methods. The
    study analyzed program participation data and conducted a small-scale survey of
    50 farmers. The Council on Energy, Environment, and Water also studied water pumps
    in Chhattisgarh. (20,21) Based on survey responses, farmers report that the pumps
    are used 75 days per year, suggesting unused solar capacity during the other days
    that could be used for nonirrigation purposes. However, the study did not analyze
    real pump operational data, directly quantify the additional solar energy available,
    or assess the environmental impacts of the solar water pumps. Key gaps remain
    in the literature. Prior work has largely relied on survey data that are self-reported
    by farmers, which does not adequately capture real pump operations and opportunities
    for improvement (e.g., panel cleaning and manual tracking). Real-time pump operational
    data can provide more reliable estimates of seasonal pump usage patterns, offering
    policymakers insights into the increase in agricultural productivity at the farm
    level and groundwater or surface water usage. While prior work recommends using
    the underutilized solar capacity for nonirrigation purposes, we lack reliable
    estimates of the magnitude of excess solar energy as well as its spatial and temporal
    resolution. Such estimates are essential to determine what farming and nonfarming
    equipment can be solar powered. Solar-powered nonpumping applications have important
    implications for grid-level generation, overall power system emissions, and increasing
    access to energy services. Our work addresses these gaps by using primary survey
    data and a large real-time pump operational data set to investigate farm-level
    impacts and opportunities. We are the first study to provide quantitative estimates
    for the excess solar energy using a novel combination of solar energy modeling
    and analysis of a large real-time pump operational data set. Our work is also
    the first study to provide insights into the sensitivity of life cycle emissions
    to pump usage, providing a more nuanced understanding of emissions associated
    with solar pumps than prior studies. We address the following research questions
    in this manuscript: (a) How have off-grid solar water pumps changed farming operations,
    and what are the opportunities for operational improvement? (b) What are the daily
    and seasonal pump usage patterns, and how do they vary with different farm characteristics?
    (c) What are the environmental benefits of solar water pumps compared to grid-connected
    and diesel pumps? (d) What are the magnitude and timing of excess energy available
    for nonirrigation applications when the pump is not being used? The paper is organized
    as follows: first, we provide information about the location of our study and
    the different solar water pump technologies. Section 2 provides details about
    the data and analysis methods. Section 3 presents the associated results. Section
    4 presents a discussion of our results, key findings, and policy recommendations.
    1.1. Location With the highest number of solar water pumps installed in India,
    Chhattisgarh is well-suited for our study. Agro-climatic conditions influence
    the cropping pattern of Chhattisgarh. The general cropping seasons followed in
    the state are winter (Rabi, November–February), monsoon (Kharif, July–October),
    and summer (Zaid, March–June). Farmers without irrigation pumps only cultivate
    crops in the monsoon season, whereas farmers with electric or diesel pumps may
    cultivate in the monsoon or summer seasons. (21) Rice is the dominant crop grown
    in Chhattisgarh; 3.79 million ha of the 13.8 million ha state are used for its
    production. (22) District-wide solar pump installations and associated beneficiary
    information were obtained from CREDA and are shown in Figure 1. CREDA targeted
    the deployment of solar water pumps for marginalized farmers with no access to
    grid electricity, achieving this with 66% of the pumps deployed in the northern
    hilly and southern plateau regions. Two types of solar water pumps were deployed
    in Chhattisgarh: submersible and surface pumps (see the Supporting Information
    for additional details). Figure 1 Figure 1. Spatial distribution of over 100 000
    pumps across the 28 districts of Chhattisgarh, India. The state accounts for the
    country’s highest number of solar water pumps (data from the Chhattisgarh Renewable
    Energy Development Authority (CREDA), 2022). 2. Methods and Materials ARTICLE
    SECTIONSJump To 2.1. Baseline Survey to Investigate Farm-Level Impacts To gauge
    the farm-level impacts of the pumps and understand solar pump usage comprehensively,
    we conducted an initial baseline survey from April 2021 to January 2022 of 292
    farmers across 22 districts in the state. Surveys were conducted over the phone
    in Hindi or the local Chhattisgarhi dialect, depending on the farmer’s preference.
    The study was approved by the North Carolina State University’s Internal Review
    Board (IRB 20854). The selection of farmers surveyed was based on three factors:
    (a) ensuring the representation of solar water pump characteristics, such as size;
    (b) ensuring the representation of different districts; and (c) the availability
    of valid phone numbers, based on the secondary data obtained. We asked 25 questions
    regarding (a) farm operations, (b) agricultural productivity, (c) seasonal pump
    usage, and (d) technical challenges with pump operations and the maintenance of
    pumps. Figure S1 shows the four key areas and associated topics about which farmers
    were surveyed. The complete survey is presented in Figure S2. For the farmers
    using 3HP pumps and for whom real-time pump operational data were available, in
    addition to the baseline survey, we asked questions about (a) the farming equipment
    that they use, (b) the distance between the pump and their house, and (c) if they
    planned to grow any new crops in the upcoming winter season. The surveys were
    generally conducted between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. local time, lasting 10–15 min.
    We made a total of 513 calls and received 292 responses, with 171 farmers not
    answering and 50 phone numbers that were provided being invalid. Our response
    rate to the survey was 57%, minimizing the likelihood of any nonresponse bias.
    2.2. Seasonal Trends in Pump Usage We obtained spatially resolved monthly energy
    consumption data for 1106 3HP pumps, including monthly energy usage (kWh), days
    the pump was used, and system pumping time from January 2019 to September 2021,
    with these data collected 28 595 times. To assess diurnal patterns, we also obtained
    subhourly data for a subset of 44 pumps, including over 2 million data points.
    A logger collects data from the pump controller and transmits them through a cellular
    data network. We limit this analysis to 3HP pumps because they represent nearly
    80% of the pumps installed in the state. The pump operational data covered 24
    of the state’s 28 districts, although most of the data were available in the central
    plains and northern hilly regions of the state. We determined the distribution
    of monthly pump energy usage as well as pump usage during the monsoon, summer,
    and winter seasons. Details on the data quality assessment are provided in the
    SI (see Figure S3). We categorized the seasonal usage patterns of the pumps based
    on their median energy use: low (lowest 10%), moderate (10–90%), and high (highest
    10%). Additionally, we used the primary survey data and corresponding pump operational
    data of 65 farmers with 3HP pumps to analyze the difference in median monthly
    pump usage of farmers based on three categories: (a) panel cleaning frequency,
    (b) panel tracking frequency, and (c) previous irrigation source. For the panel
    cleaning frequency category, we classified the farmers into three groups based
    on the responses from the survey: farmers who clean the panel frequently (at least
    once a week), farmers who clean the panel infrequently (once every few weeks),
    and farmers who never clean the panel. We compared the pump usage for each category
    using the median monthly pump usage and used a bootstrap method (sample size =
    100) to compute the 95% CI of the median. 2.3. Solar Generation Data We use the
    National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s System Advisor Model (Version 2017.9.5)
    to estimate the potential monthly generation, relying on typical meteorological
    year data from the National Solar Radiation Database. The inputs to the model
    are listed in Table S1. Our inverter assumptions are based on the specifications
    of a 3HP universal drive from Shakti Pumps, a pump vendor in Chhattisgarh. (23)
    We model three scenarios for PV system design to get a range of estimates for
    the excess solar energy available: (1) south-facing fixed-tilt panels representing
    a majority of farmers who do not use any tracking mechanism, (2) seasonal tracking
    for farmers who tilt the panels in summer, monsoon, and winter seasons, and (3)
    two-axis tracking representing the “best case scenario” with perfectly automated
    daily and seasonal tracking. 2.4. Environmental Impacts To compare the environmental
    impacts of solar water pumps with electric and diesel pumps, we considered three
    scenarios where the energy to operate the pumps was (a) supplied by diesel purchased
    by the farmer, (b) obtained from the grid, and (c) supplied using on-site photovoltaic
    solar energy with low-, moderate-, and high-usage patterns. We define the monthly
    energy requirement as the monthly energy used in the monsoon season (kWh per pump
    per month). This approach allows a reasonable comparison between solar and diesel
    pumps, since a farmer depending on diesel pumps is unlikely to purchase diesel
    throughout the year for irrigation. Using the same methods and input assumptions
    as Kumar and Kandpal, (24) we used a diesel emissions factor of 1.26 kg CO2/kWh
    (assuming a brake-specific diesel consumption of 0.33 kg/kWh and a carbon emissions
    factor of 0.0202 kg CO2/MJ). This emissions factor includes the emissions associated
    with upstream processes and combustion. For the second scenario with a grid-connected
    pump, we assumed an electricity marginal emissions factor of 0.973 kg CO2/kWh
    for Chhattisgarh, (6) determined by averaging the marginal emissions factors during
    the morning peak, midday, and afternoon in the monsoon season (i.e., hours of
    solar generation). The study by Shayak et al. (6) used low-order power dispatch
    models of the Indian electricity system to quantify the marginal emissions factors,
    relying on state-level demand data that accounted for imports, load shedding,
    and transmission losses. Hence, the emissions factor we used includes the emissions
    associated with the marginal operating generation unit and the transmission losses,
    which tend to be significant in the Indian power sector. (25) Since upstream and
    downstream processes for coal plants tend to account for less than 2% of life
    cycle emissions, (26,27) we omitted those emissions from our analysis. Most emissions
    associated with photovoltaics arise from upstream processes, such as raw material
    extraction, material production, and construction. Based on the prior work, we
    would expect these upstream emissions to be small (28,29) relative to coal and
    diesel power. For the third scenario with off-grid solar pumps, we assumed the
    emissions factor of 0.048 kg CO2-eq/kWh computed by Hsu et al. (30) for ground-mounted
    photovoltaic systems. We convert this value to a life cycle emissions per kW of
    installed solar basis, using their harmonized parameter assumptions for irradiance
    (1700 kWh/m2/year), performance ratio (80%), and system lifetime (30 years). For
    our analysis, we applied the calculated value of total emissions per unit of installed
    solar capacity (1960 kg CO2-eq/kW/lifetime). We calculated the life cycle CO2
    emissions factor for the solar water pump scenario for the three categories of
    usage: low, moderate, and high (Section 2.2). We first computed the life cycle
    emissions by taking the product of the lifetime emissions per kW by the rated
    solar panel system power (3 kW). We then calculated the emissions factors for
    the low, moderate, and high pump usage scenarios by dividing the resulting value
    (5880 kg CO2-eq) by the lifetime generation for the three categories. The lifetime
    generation is estimated to be the product of the annual generation (obtained by
    taking the sum of the mean monthly generations for low, medium, and high pump
    usage) and the system lifetime (30 years). 2.5. Estimating the Unutilized Solar
    Energy and Identifying Usage Opportunities To estimate the unutilized solar energy,
    we subtracted the median monthly pump operational data from the monthly modeled
    solar generation. We computed the upper and lower bounds using the two-axis and
    fixed module configurations, respectively, and used a bootstrap method (sample
    size = 100) to compute the 95% CI of the monthly unused solar energy. We then
    considered opportunities to use excess solar energy for farming and nonfarming
    equipment. 3. Results ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 3.1. Baseline Survey Findings Our
    baseline survey results provide context for farm characteristics and pump operations.
    The median farm size for farmers surveyed was 3.5 acres, consistent with the 1
    acre minimum requirement set by CREDA for a farmer to obtain a solar pump. Rice
    was the dominant crop for 94% of farmers. Flood irrigation was the most commonly
    practiced irrigation method, with 83% of farmers irrigating their fields by flooding.
    Many farmers (34%) previously depended on rainfall for irrigation, thus restricting
    their farming to the monsoon season. Among those with pumps, diesel pumps were
    previously used by 25%, surface pumps from canals were used by 18%, and grid-connected
    submersible pumps were used by 24%. Additionally, 23 of the 71 farmers (32%) who
    said they previously used diesel pumps reported that they still occasionally use
    diesel pumps for irrigation purposes, indicating that some farms have not entirely
    replaced pre-solar pump diesel for irrigation purposes. Pump operation survey
    questions showed that 85% of farmers either never cleaned the panels or cleaned
    the panels infrequently, indicating that solar generation may be decreasing due
    to soiling. Moreover, 88% of farmers reported never using the daily and seasonal
    solar tracking features. Nearly 96% of farmers reported increased farming revenue
    after the installation of solar pumps. Responses to questions on daily and seasonal
    pump usage patterns showed that 39% of farmers used the pumps throughout the year.
    Additionally, 80% of farmers reported switching on the pump in the morning, 2%
    reported switching it on in the afternoon, and 17% of farmers reported that the
    pump always remains on. All farmers surveyed as a part of the baseline survey
    reported that the pumps were easy to operate daily. When asked about any issues
    they had to report to the pump vendors, 39% of farmers reported that they had
    faced an issue with respect to the pump, which included cable malfunctions, controller
    issues, burning of the motor coil, panel issues, and pump jamming and starter
    issues. Most farmers reported that the pump vendors resolved these issues within
    30 days. Most farmers (85%) reported that they were provided operational training
    when the pump was installed and were aware of the warranty associated with the
    pump. 3.2. Pump Operation Seasonal Usage Patterns Figure 2 shows the variation
    of the monthly and seasonal energy used by pumps based on operational data from
    1106 3HP pumps. The early summer (March–April) period had the highest energy consumption
    by the solar water pumps. Since many farmers previously depended on rainfall for
    their irrigation (and thus irrigated fields only during monsoons), this result
    provides additional evidence of irrigation during the non-monsoon season. Given
    the variability of rainfall during the monsoon season (31) and the historical
    seasonality of rice production, our results show that solar water pumps are still
    used during the monsoon season in addition to rainfall. While the use of pumps
    in winter is less than in the summer and monsoon seasons, non-zero pump usage
    indicates that the pumps that previously depended solely on rainfall have expanded
    irrigation to winter months. In 2020, we found the median pump usage was 92 days
    per year, slightly higher than the self-reported survey results of 75 days found
    in Rahman and Jain. (21) We also observed a difference in pump usage based on
    the motor type, with permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) pumps consuming
    more energy than induction pumps. Figure 2 Figure 2. Monthly pump usage patterns
    from 2019–2021 for 1106 3HP pumps (top). The bottom left figure shows the monthly
    consumption by motor type. The bottom right figure shows the monthly consumption
    by season. As shown in Figure S4, the low-usage pumps were consistently used less
    throughout the year (less than 20 kWh/month, on average). The moderate-usage pumps,
    representing 80% of the pumps in the data set, showed peak usage (nearing 100
    kWh/month, on average) in the early summer months. The high-usage pumps were consistently
    used throughout the year, with average consumption ranging from 100–300 kWh/month.
    On average, the low-, moderate-, and high-usage pumps used 124, 702, and 2217
    kWh/year, respectively. We also considered diurnal patterns, as shown in Figure
    S5, for a subset of 44 pumps for which sufficient diurnal data were available.
    While there is heterogeneity in pump usage, pumping largely corresponds with the
    hottest parts of the day, presenting a risk of evaporative water loss. We also
    analyzed the difference in the monthly pump usage of 65 farmers based on panel
    cleaning, panel tracking, and previous irrigation sources. We found that farmers
    who used the tracking feature in the pump (11 out of 65) had higher median pump
    usage (74.0 kWh/month, 95% CI [58.1–89.4]) compared to farmers who did not use
    the tracking feature (median usage of 31.3 kWh/month, 95% CI [26.7–35.9]). Manual
    tracking of the panel involves loosening the bolts and tilting the solar panel
    structure. Tracking increases the solar energy available and enables higher pump
    usage. We found that farmers who previously had grid-connected pumps had the highest
    monthly solar pump usage (median usage 49.7 kWh/month, 95% CI [38.7–61.8]), and
    farmers who previously had diesel had the least monthly solar pump usage (median
    usage 24.9 kWh/month, 95% CI [17.1–32.6]). Farmers with access to canal water
    using surface pumps and farmers who previously depended on rainfall had similar
    energy usage (median usage of 34.8 kWh/month, 95% CI [24.9–41.7] and 35.1 kWh/month,
    95% CI [24.7–45.2], respectively). Previous irrigation sources can have important
    behavioral implications for the way farmers use solar pumps. Our results indicate
    that farmers with an irrigation source such as grid-connected pumps and access
    to canal water use the pumps more, on a monthly basis, than farmers who had to
    depend on expensive diesel. We found little difference between farmers who frequently,
    infrequently, and never cleaned the panels. This result could be attributed to
    the limited sample size of farmers in each category as well as the relatively
    low use of total available solar generation regardless of the cleaning frequency.
    The result can also be attributed to a potential acquiescence bias, resulting
    from how the question was framed to ask whether the panel was being cleaned. We
    believe that this bias is likely absent from the question on manual tracking since
    tracking is a more involved process. 3.3. Unutilized Solar Energy Based on typical
    solar resource data, we estimated the excess solar energy available during the
    year that could be used for nonirrigation purposes. Figure 3 shows the excess
    solar energy for the 1106 3HP pumps. The yellow bars show the estimated potential
    solar energy generation with fixed-tilt, south-facing panels. The orange and red
    bars show the additional solar energy potential with seasonal and two-axis tracking,
    respectively. The figure on the right shows the range of excess solar energy available
    (dark purple) based on the median pump usage. Since the median pump usage distribution
    was right-skewed, we used the bootstrap method (sample size = 100) to compute
    the 95% CI for each month (shown in light purple). Even the lower bound of our
    estimate shows 300–400 kWh (∼95% of solar energy potential) of monthly excess
    solar energy per pumping system that is not currently being utilized. These estimates
    would be different for low- and high-usage pumps, shown in Figure S4. High-usage
    pump systems (averaging 100–300 kWh/month) would have lower rates of unused solar
    energy. Figure 3 Figure 3. The figure on the left shows monthly pump usage patterns
    from 2019–2021 for 1106 3HP pumps, and the bars show the solar energy generation
    fixed modules (yellow), seasonal tracking (orange), and two-axis tracking (red).
    The figure on the right shows the estimate of the range of monthly excess solar
    energy consumption in dark purple (using two-axis tracking and fixed module systems)
    based on median pump energy consumption. The range shown in light purple is the
    upper and lower bounds of this estimate using a 95% CI. Our results show that
    the median pump uses 207 kWh/year, whereas the estimated generation potential
    is 4930 kWh/year, which could be interpreted as an effective solar curtailment
    rate of 96%. This far exceeds the curtailment rates of grid-connected solar resources,
    even in high solar penetration regions such as California (2.6%) and Texas (9.6%).
    (32) Overall, these estimates show great untapped potential since the average
    electrified Indian household consumes 50–150 kWh of electricity monthly across
    different states. (33) Efficient use of solar panels, including seasonal tracking
    and cleaning, would further increase the amount of solar energy available during
    the year. 3.4. Environmental Impacts of Electric, Diesel, and Solar Water Pumps
    We estimated the CO2 emissions for three energy sources: (a) diesel pumps, (b)
    electric pumps, and (c) solar pumps (with low, moderate, and high utilization).
    Since the emissions factor of diesel (1.26 kg CO2/kWh) was higher than the electricity
    emissions factor (0.937 kg CO2/kWh), the CO2 emissions mitigated by replacing
    diesel pumps would be 34.5% higher, as shown in Figure 4. Because the life cycle
    emissions of solar PV are dominated by materials and manufacturing processes,
    the per-unit emissions vary based on pump usage. The emissions factors for pumps
    with low, moderate, and high usage were 1.58, 0.28, and 0.088 kg CO2-eq/kWh, respectively.
    Solar pumps with low usage had slightly higher life cycle CO2 emissions than diesel
    pumps. In comparison, pumps with moderate and high usage exhibited substantially
    lower monthly emissions than both electric and diesel pumps. Figure 4 Figure 4.
    Life cycle CO2 emissions for irrigation using off-grid solar power, grid electricity,
    and diesel pumping systems. The bars show the average emissions, and the underlying
    box plots show the distribution of the estimated emissions based on the variation
    in monthly pump usage. The inset plot shows the solar pump emissions factor variation
    with the annual energy used by the system. The black marks on the x-axis show
    the low, medium, and high annual pump energy use, on average, based on the solar
    pump operational data. We found that solar water pumps result in a net environmental
    benefit over diesel and electric pumps only when the annual pump usage for the
    3HP system exceeds 155 and 209 kWh, respectively. These positive environmental
    benefits were observed with 70% and 69% of pumps in 2020 (n = 533) and 75% and
    70% of pumps in 2019 (n = 160). Overall, we found that, relative to emissions
    associated with the use of diesel pumps, solar pumps that are highly utilized
    reduced life cycle CO2-eq emissions by 93%, moderately-used pumps reduced emissions
    by 78%, and low-usage pumps increased emissions by 26%. For highly utilized solar
    pumps, the avoided operational emissions from grid electricity and diesel usage
    can be considerable. We conducted a simple calculation to understand the scale
    of avoided emissions if all of the pumps had high usage rates. If we assume that
    all 100 000 pumps installed in Chhattisgarh are 3HP pumps and consume 2217 kWh/year
    (i.e., the high-usage pump average), this would displace the equivalent of 0.19
    MMT of CO2 emissions had the pumping relied on grid electricity and 0.26 MMT if
    it displaced diesel power. Additionally, solar water pumps reduce other pollutant
    emissions, such as NOx, SO2, PM2.5, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) associated
    with burning coal and diesel, providing local air quality benefits. While emissions
    reductions may be a key benefit of solar water pumps, it is also important to
    understand the relative costs of deployment. With the full details presented in
    the Supporting Information (see Tables S2 and S3), we conducted a simple techno-economic
    analysis to compare the costs of solar power and diesel pumping systems. We estimate
    that the levelized cost of an unsubsidized 3HP solar pumping system is $390 per
    year, dropping to $124 per year with government subsidies. The levelized cost
    of the diesel-powered water pumping system varies greatly with its use as costs
    are dominated by fuel consumption. Under low- (124 kWh/year), mid- (702 kWh/year),
    and high-usage (2217 kWh/year) rates, we estimate the levelized annual costs for
    diesel pumps to be $138, $386, and $1037, respectively. Overall, we found that
    solar water pumping systems can reduce costs relative to diesel alternatives under
    higher utilization or when subsidized. 4. Discussion and Conclusion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To Increasing access to solar water pumping for irrigation in India has significant
    implications for sustainable development, and the substantial amount of water
    drawn from aquifers underscores the need for sustainable pumping solutions. The
    limited availability of electricity in rural areas necessitates alternative power
    sources for irrigation. Moreover, considering the vital role of subsistence farming
    in India, subsidized solar water pumping can enable economic growth in low-income
    communities. Finally, the potential negative environmental impacts associated
    with alternative pumping methods, such as diesel pumps and coal-based electricity,
    highlight the importance of adopting solar-powered solutions. Through this research,
    we investigated the farm-level impacts of solar water pumps with a primary survey
    and a large real-time pump operational data set. Our survey found that farmers
    report that the pumps offer ease of operation, increased farming revenue, and
    access to irrigation in all seasons. The summer and winter pump usage findings
    provide evidence of the expansion of irrigation to non-monsoon seasons, indicating
    increased farming productivity and increased farmer revenue. However, the survey
    also found challenges such as a lack of panel cleaning, a lack of use of the solar
    tracking mechanism, and the continued use of diesel pumps by some farmers. With
    our detailed data sets, we demonstrated that solar water irrigation may enable
    considerable reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but only if the solar water
    pumps meet utilization thresholds. Comparing real-time pump operational data with
    modeled solar generation found 300–400 kWh of monthly unutilized solar energy
    per pumping system, representing up to 95% of potential generation. Quantifying
    this excess solar energy is the first step in tapping the unused energy potential
    of solar water pumps in India. Here, we discuss the implications of our results
    from the survey, the pump operational data analyses, the environmental impact
    assessment, and the unused solar energy estimates, framed in terms of policy recommendations
    and future opportunities for improvement. 4.1. Exploring Nonuniformity in Pump
    Usage Is Important for Robust Policy Design Our operational data showed a wide
    variation in usage patterns across farmers, yielding heterogeneous benefits. The
    farmers with high pump usage consumed substantially more electricity than low-usage
    pumps (2217 and 124 kWh/year, respectively). The variation has important implications
    for overall power system emissions quantification for grid-connected systems and
    groundwater management, which require a clear understanding of current and future
    usage patterns. The nonuniformity across pump usage also has important implications
    for a robust deployment strategy. Policies that increase pump utilization will
    improve life cycle greenhouse gas impacts and the economic benefits of the pumps
    for farmers but may result in new groundwater challenges. 4.2. Creating Periodic
    Educational Campaigns Could Improve Overall System Use Our survey found that the
    solar water pumping systems are that they are easy to operate, they give farmers
    access to irrigation throughout the year, and they reduce dependence on erratic
    rainfall. Our findings with respect to panel tracking suggest that training on
    how to use the daily and seasonal tracking features of the module could increase
    the electricity available to farmers. Developing tracking mechanisms for new pumps
    that require less manual intervention could also be beneficial. Such educational
    campaigns on efficient pump operation strategies can be embedded within the program
    design.a 4.3. Standardized Pump Operational Data Can Serve as an Effective Policy
    Tool The availability of monthly solar pump data using remote sensor technologies
    in the pumps allows state agencies to monitor pump usage. Creating policies that
    promote pump data standardization across different pump manufacturers and improving
    the accessibility of data for government agencies can benefit many areas, including
    groundwater monitoring and fault management. Periodic analysis of the pump operational
    data could also replace in-person maintenance visits if trivial faults can be
    detected remotely. Anonymized pump operational data could also be made available
    to researchers studying this topic. 4.4. Using Excess Solar Energy Is a Currently
    Untapped Opportunity Given the potential to use the excess solar energy, we first
    consider the farming equipment that can use this energy. Commonly used farm machinery
    in India include tractors, power tillers, combined harvesters, threshers, rotavators,
    rice transplanters, seed drills, land levelers, and power weeders. (34) Most farming
    equipment could not readily take advantage of the remote and variable unused solar
    energy and would need to be portable, be easily electrified, and have a sufficient
    energy demand that incentivizes fuel switching (if they are diesel-powered). Rice
    threshers, which separate the grain from the straw, offer desirable characteristics
    to take advantage of the excess energy available. Farmers with small farms tend
    to not have sophisticated combined harvesters, which are machines that can be
    used for both harvesting and threshing rice. (35) Prior studies have investigated
    solar-powered threshers, (36,37) which are commercially available and can benefit
    farmers in the hilly regions of the state, where combined harvesters are challenging
    to use. The use of excess energy for direct domestic use may be challenging due
    to the distance between the farmer’s home and the solar water pump; our survey
    estimated a median distance of 1.0 km. Using this energy for domestic purposes
    is possible if the farmer were given a portable battery power bank that could
    be charged with solar pump panels. While this may be cost-prohibitive relative
    to grid-provided household electricity, this application could be particularly
    beneficial to farmers in areas with poor grid reliability who face frequent multihour
    outages. To enable alternative uses, a universal solar pump controller (USPC)
    could act as an interface to connect devices such as sewing machines, flour grinders,
    and mobile phones. 4.5. The Link between the Environmental Benefits of Pumps and
    Pump Usage Has Implications for Emissions Mitigation Solar water pumps with low
    usage do not provide the expected environmental benefits, and policymakers should
    thus consider pump usage patterns in their environmental impact analyses. One
    way to improve the life cycle emissions would be to deploy smaller-sized pumps
    for farmers with smaller farms, which could increase the pump utilization factor
    and improve the overall life cycle emissions of the solar water pump. Another
    option is to use the excess solar energy for farming and nonfarming purposes to
    achieve higher utilization levels, as highlighted above. In this paper, we demonstrated
    the benefits of solar water pumping as well as implementation challenges. While
    the lack of data prevented us from making accurate estimates of the quantities
    of water used, future work on this topic would be invaluable for understanding
    freshwater utilization and groundwater impacts. Our work identifies several opportunities
    for future improvement and provides policy recommendations to realize those opportunities.
    Our findings and recommendations can inform the future wide-scale deployment of
    these pumps in India, yielding benefits to farmers and the overall Indian power
    system. Supporting Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The Supporting Information

    water pump technologies  Two types of solar water pumps were deployed in Chhattisgarh:
    submersible and surface pumps.  Submersible pumps access groundwater by pumping
    water out of deep bore wells, whereas surface  pumps draw water from more accessible
    sources like lakes, rivers, or ponds (Chandel et al., 2015). The  ratings of the
    pumps deployed were 2 HP, 3 HP, and 5 HP. Two types of motors were used for the  surface
    and submersible pumps: induction motors and permanent magnet synchronous motors
    (PMSM).  While PMSM motors are more energy efficient (they do not incur inverter
    efficiency losses to convert DC  to AC power like induction pumps), they are more
    challenging to repair, particularly for submersible  pumps where the motor requires
    removal from the bore well (Chandel et al., 2015). To quantify the different technologies
    deployed, we obtained detailed secondary data about the location,  application
    type, and motor type of solar water pumps installed for a subset of farmers from
    2016-2020.  Based on data from 69,784 pumps installed between 2016-2020, we found
    that 79% of total pump  installations were 3HP pumps. Submersible pumps represented
    73% of total pump installations, with  nearly 44% of total pump installations
    having PMSM.  Additional survey information Figure S1: The baseline survey covered
    four key areas to investigate the farm-level impacts of solar water pumps. The

    big Earth data 1. Introduction Earth observation (EO) via remote sensing technologies
    provides information about our planet’s physical, chemical, and biological systems
    [1]. This type of information is crucial in regions which are exposed in various
    risks (e.g., climate change, droughts, floods, earthquakes, and landslides) and
    where ground data are scarce [2,3,4,5], such as the Eastern Mediterranean, Middle
    East, and North Africa (EMMENA) region [6]. We define EMMENA as the geographical
    region which includes the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt,
    Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Oman, Palestine,
    Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen (Figure
    1). The EMMENA region hosts approximately 558 million people, covers an area of
    12,046,012 km2, and is one of the most diverse regions in the world in economic
    terms, with per capita annual gross domestic products (GDP) ranging from USD 533
    in Yemen to USD 66838 in Qatar [7]. Figure 1. Countries of the EMMENA region.
    The region has a rich history and cultural heritage but has also been exposed
    to various risks over the decades [8]. The EMMENA region has been suffering from
    geopolitical tensions, political instability, and conflicts [8]. Furthermore,
    population growth and expanding urbanization in the EMMENA region have increased
    the pressure on ecosystems and on available resources [9,10,11,12]. In addition,
    this region has been characterized as a climate change hot spot, leading to increasing
    temperatures, extended droughts, and a decline in rainfall [13,14]. The agricultural
    sector, of which 70 percent is rainfed, is highly exposed to changing climatic
    conditions [14]. This is of critical importance as the agriculture sector contributes
    significantly to the national economies of many EMMENA countries. Additionally,
    climate change will have negative impacts on many other aspects including air
    quality, human health, land ecosystems, marine ecosystems, freshwater resources,
    and energy demand [15,16]. Finally, many countries of the EMMENA region are situated
    on complex topography and on tectonically active areas, thus are prone to hazards
    related to landslides and earthquakes [17]. EO plays a crucial role in understanding
    processes on our planet, enabling us to advance our monitoring capabilities over
    various domains of interest [18]. The information generated from EO enables researchers
    and decisionmakers to formulate and apply effective policies for environmental
    protection and sustainable management of natural resources. The amount of freely
    accessible EO data has been increasing over the years, mainly due to technological
    advancements and the implementation of open data policies. For example, the yearly
    volume of open and freely available satellite data increased from 0.25 PB in 2013
    (MODIS and Landsat missions) to 4.25 PB in 2019 (MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel
    missions) [19]. These data provide the opportunity to expand our knowledge in
    many thematic areas including atmosphere, water, agriculture, land, disaster risk
    (reduction), cultural heritage, energy, and marine safety and security. However,
    due to the expanding amount of data, there is a need for novel solutions to properly
    store, process, disseminate, and analyze these big Earth data sets [18]. The ongoing
    development of big Earth data techniques and the increasing availability of satellite
    EO data provide opportunities to better monitor the aforementioned thematic areas
    [20,21]. As the EMMENA region is a fairly new segment for EO activities, there
    are many opportunities to expand in EO research [6]. However, it is crucial to
    document first the current EO applications per thematic area and to identify the
    existing knowledge gaps. Currently, review papers on EO are focusing on specific
    thematic areas [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. To the best of our knowledge, there
    are no review papers available on the full range of EO applications. Furthermore,
    review studies on EO in the EMMENA region are limited. The aim of this scoping
    review is to fill this gap by focusing on the wide range of EO applications in
    the EMMENA region. The specific objectives of this study are to (1) provide an
    overview of EO studies in the EMMENA region per thematic area and per country;
    and (2) identify the EO applications and explore the existing limitations and
    knowledge gaps of the research with the highest impact per thematic area. 2. Materials
    and Methods Similar to Imane et al. [30], the search strategy consisted of three
    steps (Figure 2): Figure 2. Flow diagram of the scoping review methodology. Identification:
    The key word searches were conducted in the Web of Science™ database to find articles
    about EO in the EMMENA region for the past five years. As search terms, we selected
    the “Topic” option which searched journals’ title, abstract, and keywords for
    the following keywords: “Remote sensing OR Satellite OR Earth observations OR
    GIS OR geographical information systems”. With the ‘’AND Topic” option, we constrained
    the research to the EMMENA region by inserting the following keywords: “Algeria
    OR Bahrain OR Cyprus OR Egypt OR Iran OR Iraq OR Israel OR Jordan OR Kuwait OR
    Lebanon OR Libya OR Malta OR Morocco OR Oman OR Palestine OR Qatar OR Saudi Arabia
    OR Syria OR Tunisia OR Turkey OR United Arab Emirates OR Yemen”. Additionally,
    with the “AND Year published” option we further constrained the search to the
    past five years by inserting the following: “2018–2022”. Screening: Duplicates
    and articles not written in the English language and not having a digital object
    identifier (DOI) were excluded from the analysis. The relevance of the papers
    was further examined by consulting the keywords, titles, and abstracts. Furthermore,
    in case of uncertainty the full texts were evaluated. Articles of which their
    study area covered more than one country were named as “regional”. Author names
    and affiliations, the journal title, keywords, and abstracts, the number of citations,
    and the DOI were exported and analyzed in Excel® (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington,
    DC, USA) and in ArcGIS Pro (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). Eligibility: The papers
    were categorized into the following thematic areas based on the relevant EO applications
    (Table 1): Atmosphere (ATM), water (WAT), agriculture (AGR), land (LAN), disaster
    risk reduction (DRR), cultural heritage (CH), energy (EN), marine safety and security
    (MSS), and big Earth data (BED). The latter thematic area, which includes data
    mining and information extraction, machine learning and artificial intelligence,
    visual exploration and semantic enrichment, and geoinformation, can also be considered
    as a horizontal thematic area as its applications are often supplementary to the
    rest of the thematic areas. Articles which were not classified into any of the
    above thematic areas were named as “other” and articles which were classified
    into more than one thematic area were named as “interdisciplinary”. Thus, some
    articles were categorized into more than one thematic area. Assuming that citations
    are a relevant measure of the impact of an article, the top 20 highly cited articles
    (up to 13 March 2023) from each thematic area were included in the review. The
    categorization was carried out by two people, the person responsible for the overall
    review and an independent reviewer for each country. Table 1. Indicative EO Applications
    per thematic area. The analysis included the citation topics at the micro level,
    which were downloaded from Web of Science™. The citation topics at the micro level
    included 2437 topics which were algorithmically derived with the use of an algorithm
    developed by CWTS, Leiden [31]. Also, the analysis included the top 10 affiliations
    and the top 25 authors with the highest number of publications and their affiliations.
    Finally, data for the population, area, and gross domestic product (GDP) of each
    country within the EMMENA region were taken from the World Bank [7] and the International
    Monetary Fund [32] (Table 2). Table 2. Population (Po), area (A), per capita gross
    domestic product (GDP.P.C), and number of author and co-author affiliations (A.A)
    per country, as percentage of the total number of affiliations and author affiliations
    per capita (A.A.P.C) for EMMENA countries (measured in ppm). Data were taken from
    the World Bank [7] and the International Monetary Fund [32]. 3. Results 3.1. Overview
    of EO Studies in the EMMENA Region The total number of publications on EO applications
    in the EMMENA region from 2018 to 2022 was 7076. Following the exclusion of articles
    not written in the English language and not having a digital object identifier
    (DOI), the total number of publications dropped to 6647 (Figure 3); 1291 of these
    studies had a regional geographic focus, extending beyond country borders. The
    geographic focus of most publications was on Iran (1883 publications), while EO
    studies in Bahrain were the least common (10 publications). Similarly, for the
    author affiliation country (Table 2), Iran has the highest (2186) and Bahrain
    has the lowest (14) number of affiliations. However, 44.8% of the authors’ affiliations
    are not within the EMMENA region. Considering the population of each country,
    Cyprus has the highest author affiliation number per capita (770 per 1 million
    people). Countries that are suffering from political and military conflicts, such
    as Libya and Yemen, have the lowest author affiliation number per capita (7 and
    13, respectively). This is also mirrored in the low per capita GDP of these countries
    (Table 2). Figure 3. Number of publications on EO per country (red column) in
    the EMMENA region for the period between 2018 and 2022. The list with the 6647
    publications including author name, article title, author keywords and addresses,
    citations, and DOI is presented in the Supplementary Materials (Table S1). The
    10 institutions with the highest number of affiliations (authors and co-authors)
    as identified in the EO publications in the EMMENA region are the following: University
    of Tehran (416 records), Islamic Azad University (346 records), Tarbiat Modares
    University (196 records), National Authority for Remote Sensing Sciences—NARSS
    (173 records), Shiraz University (167 records), Centre National de la Recherche
    Scientifique—CNRS (166 records), University of Tabriz (157 records), King Abdulaziz
    University (149 records), Istanbul Technical University (137 records), and Khajeh
    Nasir Toosi University of Technology (122 records). Six out of ten of these institutions
    are in Iran. The 25 authors with the highest number of publications focusing in
    the EMMENA region are shown in Figure 4. Twelve of these authors have affiliation
    in countries not included in the EMMENA region (Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland,
    Germany, Malaysia, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and the USA). Ten
    authors have affiliations in Iran (Shiraz University, University of Kurdistan,
    Tarbiat Modares University, Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization,
    University of Tabriz, Isfahan University of Technology, and Shahid Rajaee Teacher
    Training University). The remaining three authors are affiliated with Morocco
    (Mohammed VI Polytechnic University), Cyprus (Cyprus University of Technology),
    and Saudi Arabia (King Abdul Aziz University). Figure 4. Top 25 authors with highest
    number of publications for papers on EO in the EMMENA region. The funding agency
    with the highest number of funded articles (145) is the Scientific and Technological
    Research Institution of Turkey (Figure 5), followed by the National Natural Science
    Foundation of China (108 articles) and the European Commission (104 articles).
    The list with the top ten funding agencies contains five more organizations which
    are outside the EMMENA region, namely the German Research Foundation (Germany),
    UK Research and Innovation (UK), the National Science Foundation (USA), National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (USA), and the Natural Environment Research
    Council (UK). Figure 5. Top 10 funding agencies based on the number of publications
    for papers on EO in the EMMENA region. Big Earth data is the thematic area with
    the highest contribution (27.1%) of EO research carried out in the EMMENA region,
    followed by land (21.6%), disaster risk reduction (15.5%), water (15.1%), atmosphere
    (8.6%), agriculture (5.8%), and energy (4.1%) (Figure 6). Surprisingly, while
    most of the EMMENA region countries are surrounded by sea, marine safety and security
    has the lowest contribution of EO research carried out in the EMMENA region (0.9%).
    Also, the EMMENA region is characterized by a long history and cultural richness
    [8], but EO applications on cultural heritage have a low contribution to the total
    number of studies (1.4%). Figure 6. EO applications per country and per thematic
    area (% of all clusters). A total of 495 citation topics were identified in Web
    of Science, of which the first 10 account for 46% of the total number of publications.
    These topics include the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (9%), groundwater
    (6%), evapotranspiration (6%), landslides (6%), fuzzy sets (4%), ecosystem services
    (4%), aerosols (3%), geostatistics (3%), soil erosion (3%), and tectonics (2%).
    Most publications on EO applications in the EMMENA region used Landsat and Sentinel
    data, as identified by the keyword search on the publications’ title, keywords,
    and abstract (Table 3). Sentinel-2 data (60.8%) and Sentinel-1 data (35.4%) are
    the most widely used among the Sentinel missions. Similarly, Landsat 8 (83.2%)
    and Landsat 7 (10.0%) are the most widely used data sources among the Landsat
    missions. Table 3. Percentages of satellite missions per appearance in the title,
    keywords, and abstract of EMMENA publications. The detailed analysis of the EO
    research according to the top 20 highly cited articles per thematic area will
    be described in the following subsection. 3.2. Main Outcomes of the Top 20 Highly
    Cited Articles from Each Thematic Area 3.2.1. Atmosphere The focus of the 20 most
    highly cited articles in the thematic area of atmosphere are on precipitation
    estimates (4 articles), on dust storms (6 articles), and on the impact of coronavirus
    on air quality through EO (4 articles). Spatiotemporal precipitation estimates
    of high accuracy are essential in climate studies and in water resource planning
    and management, especially in regions where in situ precipitation data are not
    available [33,34]. Amjad et al. [35] evaluated the performance of satellite-based
    (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis
    (TMPA), the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement
    (IMERG)) and model-based (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF-ERA
    interim, ERA5)) precipitation products over varying climate and complex topography.
    For their evaluation, they used 256 ground-based gauge stations between 2014 and
    2018 over Turkey. They reported that satellite-based products consistently performed
    better than model-based products in detecting and estimating daily precipitation
    intensities. Mahmoud et al. [36] assessed the accuracy of the IMERG products by
    using ground-based rain gauge observations throughout Saudi Arabia for the period
    from October 2015 to April 2016, based on six statistical indices. The authors
    highlighted the potential of IMERG products in complementing ground precipitation
    measurements. However, the accuracy of this product is limited in regions with
    high heterogeneity in the rainfall distribution and with high variability in the
    terrestrial topography. Similarly, Hosseini-Moghari and Tang [33] found poor accuracy
    of IMERG products in regions with higher precipitation in Iran. The systematic
    error varied from less than 12% in dry regions to more than 60% in wet regions.
    In their study on the assessment of satellite-based precipitation measurement
    products over Egypt, Nashwan et al. [37] evaluated the performance of three satellite-based
    high-resolution gridded rainfall datasets, namely the gauge-corrected Global Satellite
    Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), IMERG, and the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed
    Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), in the hot desert climate of Egypt with
    different statistical indices. Overall, CHIRPS was more accurate than the other
    products in estimating rainfall amounts but IMERG was better at detecting the
    occurrence of rainfall than CHIRPS. In order to overcome the contradictory results
    obtained using different statistical metrics, Salman et al. [34] proposed the
    use of compromise programming for the selection of the appropriate gridded precipitation
    datasets. Dust storms are considered a common environmental phenomenon in the
    EMMENA region with significant impact on human health, the environment, and many
    associated socioeconomic factors [38,39,40,41]. The study of Namdari et al. [42]
    examined the impacts of climate fluctuations on dust storm activity over the Middle
    East. They used aerosol optical depth, temperature, and precipitation data between
    2000 and 2015, obtained from MODIS Collection, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
    (TRMM), Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) of the NCDC/NOAA, ECMWF, and
    from the Iran Meteorological Organization (IMO). Their results indicate that long-term
    reduction in rainfall has promoted lower soil moisture and vegetative cover, leading
    to more intense dust emissions. Furthermore, short-term variations in temperature
    in hot periods exacerbate the influence on the dust storm genesis. Yassin et al.
    [38] used a backward trajectory method on the HYSPLIT model to study the sources
    of dust storms over Kuwait during a 12-year period (2000–2012). The authors compared
    MODIS satellite observations at various latitudes (1000, 3000, 5000 m) with the
    HYSPLIT model and reported similar results. The sources of dust storms were identified
    from both the Sahara Desert and the Arabian Desert. Similarly, Beegum et al. [39]
    investigated dust storms over the Arabian Peninsula using the regionally adapted
    chemistry transport model CHIMERE coupled with the Weather Research and Forecast
    (WRF) model. They found good agreement (R ~0.73 and RMSE ~0.1) in the spatiotemporal
    pattern between simulations and observations (MSG/SEVRI RGB dust, MODIS Deep Blue
    Aerosol Optical Depth: DB-AOD, Ozone Monitoring Instrument Observed UV Aerosol
    Absorption Index: OMI-AI and AERONET AOD). Boroughani et al. [40] used three statistical-based
    machine learning algorithms (weights of evidence, frequency ratio, and random
    forest) to produce a dust source susceptibility map (DSSM) in Khorasan Razavi
    Province (Iran). Land use, lithology, slope, soil, geomorphology, normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI), and distance from river data were included in the models.
    The random forest model with an area under the curve (AUC) value equal to 88%
    showed higher performance than frequency ratio (80%) and weights of evidence (81%)
    when validated with MODIS data (23 images during the 2005–2016 period). Similarly,
    Gholami et al. [41] applied eight algorithms including random forest (RF), support
    vector machine (SVM), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), radial basis
    function (RBF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), regression tree analysis
    (RTA), Cubist model and boosted regression trees (BRTs), and an ensemble modeling
    (EM) approach for generating spatial dust distribution maps in Khuzestan Province
    (Iran) and Iraq. The EM approach showed the highest performance (AUC = 99.8%)
    for generating the dust storm provenance map. Spaceborne NO2 column observations
    from two high-resolution instruments, Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI,
    Sentinel-5 Precursor) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), were used to assess
    the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on NO2 pollution in five different regions
    (China, South Korea, western Europe, the USA, and Iran) [43]. The results showed
    a 20–40% decrease in NO2 columns over China, Europe, South Korea, and the United
    States between January and April 2020, due to the lockdown measures implemented
    by the governments. A likely explanation for the absence of a decrease in NO2
    in Iran is that complete lockdowns were not enforced in Iran. The authors emphasized
    that further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of the temporary lockdowns
    on global air quality and climate and the gradual return the values of to prelockdown
    periods. On the contrary, the study of Broomandi et al. [44] showed that the COVID-19
    lockdown positively affected Iran’s air quality, as evident by the reduction in
    the levels of CO, NO2, SO2, and PM10. Similar trends of NO2 reduction during the
    lockdown were observed for other EMMENA countries, such as Egypt and Iraq [45,46].
    The remaining studies in the atmosphere thematic area focus on the improvement
    of CO2 anthropogenic emission measurements [47], climate change [48,49], aerosol
    pollution [50], drought estimation [51], and preseismic ionospheric anomalies
    [52]. Reuter et al. [47] developed a co-location method with the simultaneous
    use of CO2 (OCO-2) and NO2 (Sentinel-5) data for the identification and quantification
    of anthropogenic emission plume signals. The authors highlighted that existing
    satellites present high flux uncertainties which are expected to be reduced by
    the planned European Copernicus anthropogenic CO2 monitoring mission (CO2M), due
    to higher spatial resolution and better imaging capabilities. Long-term trends
    between vegetation and climate showed apparent climate change effects in Iran
    [48]. Using 33-year records of NDVI (calculated with data from the Advanced Very
    High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite) and climate variables, Lamchin et
    al. [48] found that the vegetation greenness trend consistently decreased (range
    = −0.47 to −0.08) in eastern Iran. Similarly, projected land use changes for Saudi
    Arabia between 2014 and 2100 showed reductions in vegetation due to climate change
    and anthropogenic activities [49]. Hossein Mardi et al. [50] examined the long-term
    temporal and spatial characteristics associated with aerosol pollution in Lake
    Urmia by using daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from MODIS satellites, between
    2001 and 2015. They found that aerosols in the area are emitted more effectively
    from bordering lands (desiccated areas, dried watercourses, and river deltas),
    rather than the Lake Urmia salt crust. The study of Alizadeh and Nikoo [51] evaluated
    the performance of three advanced fusion-based methodologies including the ordered
    weighted averaged (OWA) approach based on the ORNESS weighting method (ORNESS-OWA)
    and ORLIKE weighting method (ORLIKE-OWA) for drought estimation with the use of
    different remotely sensed precipitation data products (CHOMPS, GPCP, CMAP, PERSIANN-CDR,
    TRMM, GLDAS-2, and MERRA-2). Their results showed that the ORNESS-OWA method had
    the highest performance (MARE = 2.51% and R2 = 95%) in comparison with all other
    fusion-based models, demonstrating an effective proficiency in drought estimation.
    Tariq et al. [52] showed the feasibility of detecting earthquake (EQ)-related
    anomalies in the ionosphere with the use of the Temporal Electron Content (TEC)
    from Global Ionospheric Map TEC (GIMTEC) and ground-based dual-frequency GPS receivers.
    They used data for three major (M > 7.0) earthquakes in Nepal and the Iran–Iraq
    border from 2015–2017. Their statistical procedures showed positive ionospheric
    anomalies within 10 days before all the major earthquakes. 3.2.2. Water The main
    focus of the 20 most highly cited articles in the thematic area of water (Table
    4) is on groundwater potential mapping (10 articles) and on groundwater quality
    (7 articles Most of the EMMENA countries suffer from water scarcity because of
    the semi-arid and arid climate which, combined with the population growth and
    the growing demand for water, creates an urgent need to further explore the potential
    groundwater resources as an alternative [53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62]. Existing
    groundwater resources in EMMENA countries (e.g., Iran, Egypt) have significantly
    declined, both in terms of quality and quantity [60,63,64,65,66,67,68]. Due to
    anthropogenic activities and mismanagement, groundwater bodies in the EMMENA region
    face many threats such as brackish water [63,64,65], poor water quality index
    [66], fluoride and nitrate contamination [67,68], and high levels of total dissolved
    solids (TDS) [60]. According to Arabameri et al. [54], due to the constant technical
    advancements in the field of groundwater potential mapping, there is no current
    agreement or reference on which approach is more suitable to predict high groundwater
    potential. However, all studies have in common the use of GIS and geostatistical
    methods, including different models and algorithms. The studies used various sources
    of data (e.g., ALOS PALSAR, ASTER, Landsat, ground-based) related to water quantity,
    land use/land cover, soil and geology, digital elevation, and morphological (e.g.,
    slope, aspect) and hydrological data (e.g., river network). The choice of the
    input data depends on the site-specific characteristics of each region. All these
    studies highlighted that the results will be useful for better water and land
    management practices and policies. The remaining studies in the water thematic
    area focus on dam site selection [69], quantification of irrigation water [70],
    and on evapotranspiration estimates [71]. Jozaghi et al. [69] conducted a comparative
    analysis of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order of
    preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for the optimum dam site selection
    in Sistan and Baluchestan Province (Iran), with the use of GIS. Their comparison
    was made based on geographic (geology, land use, sediment, erosion, slope, groundwater,
    and discharge) and water quality (soluble sodium percentage, total dissolved solids,
    potential of hydrogen, and electrical conductivity) criteria. The authors reported
    that the TOPSIS method is better suited to the problem of dam site selection for
    this study area. Jalilvand et al. [70] used the SM2RAIN algorithm for the estimation
    of irrigation water use at the southern Urmia Lake catchment (Iran) based on satellite
    soil moisture observations obtained from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer
    2 (AMSR2). They found that the simulated quantities of the irrigation water were
    consistent with the observed data with an average R = 0.86 and RMSE = 12.89 mm/month.
    Zamani Losgedaragh and Rahimzadegan [71] applied three different models (Surface
    Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized
    Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS)) to estimate the amount
    of evapotranspiration over the region of the Amirkabir dam reservoir (Iran). Sixteen
    Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite images from 2011 to 2017 were used in these
    models to compute evapotranspiration and the results were validated with ground
    truth pan evaporation data. The authors found good performance of the SEBS (R2:
    0.62, RMSE: 0.93) and METRIC (R2: 0.57, RMSE: 2.02 mm) models. On the contrary,
    the SEBAL model showed poor performance (R2: 0.36, RMSE: 5.1 mm). Table 4. Research
    focus (GP: groundwater potential mapping, GQ: groundwater quality, QIW: quantification
    of irrigation water, ET: evapotranspiration estimates, DP: dam site selection)
    of the 20 most-cited papers in the water thematic area, the geographical focus
    (country), the methods used (AHP: analytical hierarchical process, Fuzzy-AHP:
    fuzzy analytical hierarchical process, ML: machine learning, AI: artificial intelligence),
    and the satellite data used. 3.2.3. Agriculture The EO applications in the thematic
    area of agriculture cover a wide range of topics such as evapotranspiration (ET)
    estimation [73,74,75,76], land suitability for agriculture [77,78,79,80,81,82,83],
    irrigation mapping [84], agricultural land loss [85], crop monitoring [86,87],
    crop production and yield prediction [88,89], crop mapping [90], stem water potential
    monitoring [91], and crop water footprint estimation [92]. Accurate assessment
    of water use in agriculture is of critical importance due to the changing climate
    and increasing water scarcity. Thus, modeling crop water use is a powerful decision
    tool for agricultural policy decisionmakers to improve water use efficiency [92].
    In their study on crop water footprint estimation, Elbeltagi et al. [92] modeled
    the green and blue water footprints of maize by using an artificial neural network
    (ANN) in major maize-producing sites in Egypt, between 2006 and 2016. Meteorological
    data were collected from the Climatic Research Unit Time Series and the Japanese
    55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) in NetCDF formats. Their model achieved high accuracy
    with deviations between the actual and predicted water footprints ranging from
    −2.6 to 6.6% and from −2.4 to 3.2% for the blue and green water footprints, respectively.
    Representative and accurate evapotranspiration maps are needed to achieve the
    planning and management of sustainable water use in water-scarce regions, such
    as the EMMENA region [76]. Jamshidi et al. [74] compared four different evapotranspiration
    methods, including ET estimates from reanalysis data (NCEP, ERA-Interim, ERA5),
    MODIS ET datasets, Landsat-based ET models (METRIC, SEBS), and in situ measurements,
    from 2009 to 2014, in southern Iran. The authors reported 4.6% overestimation
    and 11.4% underestimation of ET with the METRIC and SEBS models, respectively.
    Huang et al. [73] reported that actual evapotranspiration in daily time steps
    predicted based on the SEBAL method is underestimated for barley, cucumber, chickpea,
    and alfalfa and overestimated for wheat, potato, onion, lentil, bean, and maize
    and is close to the calculated values of SWB for tomato, colza, and sugar beet.
    Furthermore, Rahimzadegana and Janani [75] showed good efficiency of the SEBAL
    model for estimating the actual ET of pistachio. Mahmoud and Gan [76] computed
    the actual evapotranspiration (AET) over the central region of Saudi Arabia from
    1950–2013, based on meteorological data and on crop coefficients (Kc) which were
    modeled as a function of a 16-day time-series MODIS normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI). They reported that annual AET estimated by the soil water balance
    model was between 9 and 11% higher than the modeled AET. The studies emphasized
    the need for high-quality in situ data in future studies to improve the model’s
    performance. Land suitability studies were conducted both with GIS and multi-criteria
    decision-making analysis for wheat (Turkey), Citrus (Turkey, Morocco), legumes
    (Morocco), maize (Iran), soybean (Iran), rapeseed (Iran), barley (Iran), olives
    (Morocco), and jojoba (UAE) crops. The studies reported that their findings can
    help in improving the management of crop production and that future studies should
    expand on different crops and soil types. In their study on soil moisture and
    irrigation mapping in Tunisia, Bousbih et al. [84] presented a new technique based
    on the synergistic interpretation of multi-temporal optical and Synthetic Aperture
    Radar (SAR) data (Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1). Their approach is based on the inversion
    of the water cloud model, using radar data and NDVI data derived from optical
    images. Their results showed an RMSE of 4.3% and a bias of 1.9% between the satellite
    and observed data. Crop production and yield prediction using remotely sensed
    data are generally scarce in the EMMENA region due to the inter-annual variation
    in meteorological factors combined with anthropogenic factors (such as war conflicts)
    [88]. In the study on barley yield prediction in Iran, Sharifi [89] combined vegetation
    indices (NDVI and EVI) derived from Sentinel-2 data, barley yield data, and four
    algorithms, including a backpropagation neural network, decision tree, K-nearest
    neighbor, and Gaussian process regression. The latter algorithm had the highest
    performance (r2 = 0.84) and estimated yield with a root mean square error of 737
    kg ha−1 and mean absolute error of 650 kg ha−1. Qader et al. [88] developed an
    empirical regression-based model to forecast winter wheat and barley production
    in Iraq, based on MODIS satellite data and in situ crop data. They found that
    the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.70) is achieved when the vegetation index (VI) is
    at the maximum. Crop growth dynamic observations from satellites are often limited
    by the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. To address this issue, Nguyen
    et al. [87] proposed the use of data from different ongoing satellite missions
    of Sentinel-2 (ESA) and Landsat 7/8 (NASA) through harmonization techniques. They
    found that improved topographic correction models are needed to achieve higher
    performance of the harmonized products in mountainous areas. Sadeh et al. [86]
    developed a new method to fuse a time series of images sourced from two different
    satellite constellations (Sentinel-2, Planetscope) which combines the advantages
    of each satellite (high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution). This new
    technique was applied to create spectrally consistent daily images of wheat LAI
    at a 3 m resolution which were then compared with in situ wheat LAI measurements
    from Australia and Israel. Their approach successfully estimated LAI (R2 = 0.94)
    throughout the growing season for LAI < 3. Ashourloo et al. [90] examined the
    potential of automatic mapping of canola (Brassica napus L.) using time series
    of Sentinel-2 images. They found that multiplication of the near-infrared (NIR)
    band by the sum of red and green bands is an efficient index to identify canola
    during the flowering stage. The kappa and overall accuracy (OA) were more than
    0.75 and 88%, respectively. Furthermore, Helman et al. [91] examined the relationship
    between stem water potential and four vegetation indices (GNDVI, NDVI, EVI, and
    SAVI) in Mediterranean vineyards (Israel) through the use of high spatial resolution
    Planetscope images. The authors highlighted that SAVI displayed a slightly better
    correlation with stem water potential than the other three indices, likely due
    to its capacity for reducing soil effects. Urban expansion has critical consequences
    for agricultural production in the EMMENA region. Radwan et al. [85] analyzed
    24 LULC maps from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI)
    land cover viewer (http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/, accessed on 13 March
    2023) and found that 74,600 hectares of fertile agricultural land in the Nile
    Delta (Old Lands) was lost due to urban expansion from 1992 to 2015 at an average
    rate of 3108 ha year−1. Also, 206,100 hectares of bare land was converted to agricultural
    land at an average rate of 8588 ha year−1. According to the authors, more sustainable
    land use strategies are needed to minimize the threats to agricultural sustainability
    and food security. 3.2.4. Land Land degradation due to soil erosion is one of
    the major problems which the EMMENA region is facing as highlighted by most of
    the studies in the land thematic area [93,94,95,96,97,98,99]. Jazouli et al. [99]
    integrated the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) in a GIS environment
    to quantify soil loss and to map erosion risk of the Oum Er Rbia River basin,
    located in the Middle Atlas (Morocco), for 2013, 2013, and 2017. For their analysis,
    they used satellite images of Sentinel-2A, Landsat Oli-8, and ETM and applied
    cellular automata Markov to forecast the land use/land cover map and to detect
    the associated changes. Their results showed an estimated annual soil loss of
    58 t ha−1 yr−1 in 2003, while the predicted annual soil loss for 2030 increased
    to 142 t ha−1 yr−1. Different techniques can be found in the literature for creation
    of soil erosion susceptibility maps. Ameri et al. [98] used four different multi-criteria
    decision-making models (SAW, VIKOR, TOPSIS, and CF) and concluded that the VIKOR
    method has higher predictive accuracy than TOPSIS, SAW, and CF models for the
    Ghaemshahr Basin in Iran. They used the Advanced Space Thermal Emission Radiometer
    (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM) with spatial resolution of 30 m for the
    extraction and analysis of 23 morphometric parameters. Arabameri et al. [94] evaluated
    the performance of three data-driven models (frequency ratio, weights of evidence,
    index of entropy) and the AHP knowledge-based technique for gully erosion susceptibility
    mapping in the Toroud watershed (Iran). Morphological and land use parameters
    were derived from ALOS PALSAR and Landsat 8 satellite images. All four models
    showed excellent accuracy in prediction of areas prone to gully erosion. Zabihi
    et al. [97] tested the same models in the Valasht watershed (Iran) and found that
    the frequency ratio model had better performance (80.4%) than the weight of evidence
    (79.5%) and index of entropy (79%) for erosion mapping. In another study, Arabameri
    et al. [95] studied the performance of three algorithms (random forest, boosted
    regression tree, and multi-variate adaptive regression spline) for gully erosion
    susceptibility mapping in the Shahroud watershed, Iran. Landsat 8 and ASTER GDEM
    data were used in their analysis. According to the authors, the random forest
    model had the highest prediction accuracy. Similar high performance for the random
    forest algorithm was reported by Garosi et al. [96]. Finally, Arabameri et al.
    [93] proposed a new model which combines the geographically weighted regression
    technique with the certainty factor and random forest models to produce gully
    erosion zonation mapping. The proper selection of the data in these studies depends
    on their availability and site-specific characteristics. Information about the
    location, extent, and type of land use/land cover (LULC) is essential for improving
    land management practices [100]. Mansour et al. [101] applied advanced GIS techniques,
    spatial modeling, and utilization of satellite images (Landsat 5/8) to simulate
    LULC changes and to predict the urban expansion in the mountainous cities of Oman,
    for the years 2028 and 2038. Their predictions showed a 50% increase in the built-up
    area in 2038; on the contrary, vegetation will decrease by 36.5%. Ghorbanian et
    al. [100] developed an object-based land cover classification methodology using
    the Google Earth Engine in order to improve the land cover map of Iran. They used
    Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery data for the fusion of SAR and multi-spectral
    data to increase the land cover classification accuracy. The land cover map for
    Iran (2017) had an overall accuracy of 95.6%. Mohajane et al. [102] studied the
    vegetation change in Azrou Forest (Morocco) between 1987 and 2017. They combined
    Landsat images (MSS, ETM+, TM, OLI) and used the NDVI and ground-based survey
    to improve the discrimination between LULC categories. Land cover maps for each
    year were produced with the maximum likelihood (ML) classification method. The
    authors reported high classification accuracies and showed that the total forest
    cover over the 30-year period remained stable. Rasul et al. [103] developed the
    dry built-up index (DBI) and dry bare-soil index (DBSI) to map built-up and bare
    areas in dry climates with the use of Landsat 8 images. The results from the city
    of Erbil (Iraq) showed an overall classification accuracy of 93% (κ = 0.86) and
    92% (κ = 0.84) for DBI and DBSI, respectively. Rapid and extensive urbanization
    over the past few decades has led to changes in the microclimate of urban environments
    [104]. Urban regions experience warmer temperatures by absorbing a greater amount
    of solar radiation than their natural rural surroundings, a phenomenon well known
    as urban heat island (UHI). Shirani et al. [104] used satellite images of Landsat
    7 ETM+ (1999 and 2006) and Landsat 8 (2013 and 2016) to retrieve the Earth surface
    temperature of Isfahan (Iran). Their results showed an increase in the minimum
    temperature of 2016 compared to 1999 and that the heat island ratio followed a
    rising trend, moving from 0.16 (1999) to 0.3 (2016). Similarly, the study of Weng
    et al. [105] showed that surface urban heat island intensity in the city of Babol
    (Iran) increased significantly (24%) during the period from 1985 to 2017. Cetin
    et al. [106] found a temperature difference between urban high building density
    areas and other terrestrial areas, ranging from 0.4 to 2.5 °C. Knowledge about
    the distribution of soil properties over the landscape is required for a variety
    of land management applications and resources, modeling, and monitoring practices
    [107,108]. Amazirh et al. [109] developed a method for retrieving surface soil
    moisture at a high spatiotemporal resolution, by combining Sentinel-1 (S1) microwave
    and Landsat 7/8 thermal data. The authors reported a root mean square difference
    between satellite and in situ soil moisture of 0.03 m3m−3. Zeraatpisheh et al.
    [107] used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ratio vegetation
    index (RVI), perpendicular vegetation index (PVI), clay index (CI), Landsat image
    band 4 (B4), and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), derived from the Landsat
    enhanced thematic mapper, in order to predict and compare the spatial distribution
    of soil organic carbon (SOC), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), and clay content
    by using different machine learning techniques (Cubist, random forest, regression
    tree, and a multiple linear regression) in Iran. Their results showed that the
    highest and the lowest prediction accuracies were obtained for clay and SOC using
    random forest and random tree models, respectively. Fathololoumi et al. [110]
    showed that the use of dynamic (multi-temporal) satellite data fusion, rather
    than static, can greatly improve soil modeling and mapping. Accurate measurements
    of aboveground forest biomass are crucial for estimating forest carbon stocks
    and for regional, sustainable land use planning. Vafaei et al. [111] applied machine
    learning techniques in order to improve the forest aboveground biomass estimation.
    They generated three datasets including the Sentinel-2A dataset, the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2
    dataset, and the combination of the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2
    dataset (Sentinel-ALOS). They found that aboveground biomass models derived from
    the combination of the Sentinel-2A and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data had the highest
    accuracy, followed by models using the Sentinel-2A dataset and the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2
    dataset. 3.2.5. Disaster Risk Reduction Disaster risk reduction is the thematic
    area with the highest average number of citations per thematic area for the top
    20 cited papers (Figure 7). The focus of these papers is on landslides [112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122]
    and on floods [118,123,124,125]. Figure 7. Average number of citations per thematic
    area (top 20 highly cited papers). Landslides are often catastrophic natural hazards
    leading to loss of life, damage to properties, and economic disruption [113].
    All the studies on landslides have in common the coupling of machine learning
    (or artificial neural network) algorithms with spatial data types. The data used
    in these studies can be categorized into five main categories: topographical (e.g.,
    aspect, slope, elevation), hydrological (e.g., rainfall, river density), lithological
    (e.g., lithology, faults), land cover (e.g., NDVI), and anthropogenic (e.g., road
    density). Topographical and land cover data are often derived from satellite images.
    However, the source of these data was not provided in most studies. According
    to Merghadi et al. [113], tree-based ensemble algorithms achieve excellent results
    compared to other machine learning algorithms for landslide susceptibility mapping.
    Specifically, the random forest algorithm offers robust performance for accurate
    landslide susceptibility mapping with only a small number of adjustments required
    before training the model. The studies of Pourghasemi and Rahmadi [117], Youssef
    and Pourghasemi [122], Arabameri et al. [121], and Achour and Pourghasemi [119]
    reported similar robust performance for the random forest algorithm for landslide
    susceptibility assessment. Tien Bui et al. [126] applied the metaheuristic algorithm
    Harris hawks optimization (HHO) in order to improve the performance of the artificial
    neural network (ANN) for landslide susceptibility assessment in western Iran.
    The authors found that the HHO algorithm improved the performance of the ANN in
    both recognizing and predicting the landslide patterns. Shirzadi et al. [127]
    showed that the use of a hybrid approach of alternative tree decision and ensemble
    algorithms (rotation forest and multi-boost) will improve the predictions of landslide
    susceptibility due to decreasing noise and over-fitting problems. According to
    Reichenbach et al. [112], for the preparation of landslide susceptibility assessment
    there are nine steps that need to be considered, which include obtaining relevant
    landslide and thematic information, selecting the appropriate mapping unit and
    model, evaluating model fitting and predictive performance, estimating model uncertainty,
    ranking model quality, and designing the landslide protocol. Future studies should
    consider these steps and focus on the development of landslide early warning systems
    at different geographical scales. Floods are considered as a major natural disaster
    because of their devastating effects that lead to human casualties and socioeconomic
    losses [128]. Khosravi et al. [125] tested four decision tree-based machine learning
    models (logistic model trees (LMTs), reduced error pruning trees (REPTs), naïve
    Bayes trees (NBTs), and alternating decision trees (ADTs)) for flash flood susceptibility
    mapping at the Haraz watershed in the northern part of Iran. The physical factors
    needed for the models, such as ground slope, altitude, and curvature, were derived
    from the Aster digital elevation model (DEM) of 30m resolution and the land use
    and NDVI maps were extracted from Landsat 8 Operational Land Image (OLI). Their
    results showed that all models have good performances in flood susceptibility
    assessment, with the ADT model having the highest predictive capability. Tien
    Bui et al. [126] combined the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with
    two GIS-based ensemble artificial intelligence approaches, the imperialistic competitive
    algorithm (ICA) and the firefly algorithm (FA), for flood spatial modeling and
    mapping applications in the Haraz watershed (Iran). The ten factors included in
    their analysis were slope angle, elevation, stream power index (SPI), curvature,
    topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, rainfall, land use, stream density,
    and the distance to river. The results showed high prediction accuracy of the
    two ensemble models with values of MSE and RMSE for ANFIS-ICA and ANFIS-FA equal
    to 0.41 and 0.35 and 0.169 and 0.129, respectively. According to Ahmadlou et al.
    [123], flood occurrence is mainly affected by plan curvature, followed by altitude,
    geology, distance to river, slope, soil, land use, rainfall, and aspect. A range
    of models and machine learning techniques have been applied in order to improve
    the flood susceptibility mapping [118,125,126,128,129,130,131]. However, future
    studies should focus on the development of flood forecasting and warning systems
    which is essential in order to minimize the flood hazards [124]. 3.2.6. Cultural
    Heritage EO within the culture heritage thematic area includes detection, monitoring,
    mapping, and management of archaeological sites [132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140],
    looting detection [141,142], and other threats to cultural heritage sites [143,144,145,146,147,148,149].
    The studies on detection, monitoring, and management employed various satellite
    data (Corona, Landsat, Spot, Quickbird, Sentinel-2A, COSMO-SkyMed) and reported
    that there is a need for further development of machine and deep learning techniques
    in order to automate feature extraction and pattern detection in very high-resolution
    (VHR) images [132,134]. Soroush et al. [134] tested the application of deep convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) for automated remote sensing detection of qanat systems
    in the Erbil Plain (Iraq), with the use of Corona imagery. They demonstrated that
    even with small datasets, deep learning can be successfully applied to automate
    the detection of qanat shafts. According to Bachagha et al. [137], the combined
    use of LiDAR, aerial photographs, historical records, and satellite images will
    further enhance the investigation of ancient sites. By screening long Sentinel-2
    time series for Aleppo and Apamea, Tapete and Cigna [132] showed that changes
    in textural properties and surface reflectance can be associated with events relevant
    for conservation. Tapete and Cigna [133] also suggested the use of COSMO-SkyMed
    data for condition assessment of archaeological heritage and landscape disturbance
    due to their capabilities for very high spatial resolution images and for site
    revisit of up to one day. Stott et al. [139] applied airborne laser scanning (ALS)
    remote sensing and photogrammetric techniques, including enhancing local topographic
    contrast for archaeological interpretation, residual relief modeling, sky view
    factor, and local dominance, and they were able to accurately map known archaeological
    features and to detect a wide variety of previously unrecorded potential features.
    A major issue for the preservation of archaeological areas appears to be urban
    and agriculture sprawling [132,135,139,143,144,145]. With the use of multi-temporal
    and multi-sensor satellite data (Corona, Landsat, Spot, Quickbird, and Sentinel-2A),
    Elfadaly et al. [135] showed that urban fabric continuously expanded from 1984
    to 2017, posing a severe threat at the Theban temples at west Luxor (Egypt). Lasaponara
    and Masini [142] introduced an automatic method for an archaeological looting
    feature extraction approach (ALFEA) which is based on looting enhancement using
    spatial autocorrelation, unsupervised classification, and segmentation. For their
    analysis, they used images available from Google Earth. Their results from the
    evaluation procedure showed satisfactory performance from two analyzed test cases
    with a rate of success higher than 90%. According to the review study by Tapete
    and Cigna [141], a variety of satellite data were used for the detection of archaeological
    looting, such as HR multi-spectral imagery from Sentinel-2, VHR X-band SAR data
    from COSMO-SkyMed, VHR panchromatic and multi-spectral WorldView-2 imagery, and
    VHR optical data from GeoEye-1, IKONOS-2, QuickBird-2, and WorldView-3; 89% of
    the studies on looting detection exploited optical images and the majority of
    these studies used VHR images (less than 1 m resolution). According to the authors,
    the use of open high-resolution (HR) data (e.g., Sentinel-2 and Landsat) is still
    at the early stage. Currently, there is lack of common practices in the domain
    of looting detection from space, thus there is a need to move toward sharing and
    harmonization of methodologies. Apart from looting and urbanization described
    above, remote sensing techniques have also been applied in other domains which
    may threaten cultural heritage sites such as erosion [146,148], earthquakes [149],
    flooding [147], and salt weathering [144]. 3.2.7. Energy The majority of the top
    20 highly cited articles in the energy thematic area focus on the spatial assessment
    of the energy potential and on the location selection for energy plants [150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166].
    Thirteen of these studies focus on solar energy (photovoltaics, concentrating
    solar power), two studies focus on wind energy, and two studies focus on bioethanol/biogas.
    The three remaining studies focus on techno-economical assessment of energy resources
    [167,168] and on the design optimization of off-grid hybrid renewable energy systems
    [169]. The geographical focus of the studies was on Iran (nine studies), Morocco
    (four studies), Egypt (two studies), Turkey (two studies), Algeria (one study),
    and Saudi Arabia (one study). In their study on the spatial assessment of solar
    energy potential at a global scale, Pravalie et al. [157] analyzed the solar radiation
    distribution and intensity based on global horizontal irradiation (GHI) and direct
    normal irradiation (DNI) data. They found that most of the countries located in
    the EMMENA region (Saharan countries and countries located in the Arabian Peninsula)
    present superb (maximum) solar potential, thus there are opportunities for developing
    solar energy at a national or international (regional) level. However, there are
    additional factors that can affect solar power generation in this region, such
    as dust particles and dust storms, high air temperatures, insufficient financial
    resources, and political instability or war conflicts. Eleven studies in the spatial
    assessment of the energy potential and on the location selection for energy plants
    combined GIS and multi-criteria decision models (Table 5). The assessment of the
    energy potential and the location of energy plants includes a range of criteria
    such as climatic (e.g., solar radiation, sunshine, land surface temperature),
    morphological (e.g., slope and aspect), locational (e.g., distance from cities,
    roads, and electricity grid), land cover, and hydrological (e.g., distance from
    dams and groundwater) criteria [150,151,152,153,158,159]. The criteria for the
    assessment of the offshore wind energy potential include, among others, wind characteristics,
    water depth, soil substrate, and distance from the shoreline, military areas,
    parks, submerged cables, shipping routes, and fishing areas [155,156]. Finally,
    the criteria for bioethanol facility location selection include social (e.g.,
    policies, work force, societal impact, quality of life), environmental (e.g.,
    ecologically sensitive areas), and economic (e.g., investment, maintenance, and
    operation costs) criteria [154]. Table 5. Energy resource and research focus (OL:
    Optimized Location/Site, P: Energy potential, TE: Techno-Economical, OD: Optimal
    Design) of the top 20 highly cited papers in the Energy thematic area (Ref.),
    the geographical focus (Country), the methods used (MCDM: Multi-Criteria Decision
    Model, BF: Boolean-Fuzzy Logic, SO: Swarm Optimization, HE: Heuristic, MC: Monte
    Carlo), and the satellite data used. 3.2.8. Marine Safety and Security Marine
    safety and security is the thematic area with the lowest average number of citations
    per thematic area for the top 20 highly cited papers (Figure 7). Studies include
    oil spill detection and assessment [170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177], marine habitat
    mapping [178], toxicity assessment of heavy metals [179], environmental pollution
    of coastal zones [180], detection of floating plastic litter [181,182,183], marine
    mucilage monitoring [184], ecology of sea turtles [185,186,187], habitat suitability
    model for Posidonia oceanica [188], characterization of natural hydrocarbon seepage
    [189], and relative sea-level rise and potential submersion risk [190]. Oil pollution
    is among the major maritime environmental disasters and has become a worldwide
    concern due to the increasing rate of offshore oil production and transport [177].
    Abou Samra et al. mapped and examined the oceanographic parameters that may affect
    oil pollution dispersion along the offshore zone of the Nile Delta with the use
    of GIS techniques. They analyzed data of wave patterns, bathymetry, sea surface
    temperature (SST), chlorophyll content, phytoplankton concentration, and organic
    carbon concentration. They found that oil spills along the offshore region are
    primarily influenced by bathymetry and SST. Chaturverdi et al. [173] and El-Magd
    et al. [175] used SAR data from Sentinel-1 satellites to detect and map oil spills
    in the Al Khafji area (Saudi Arabia) and in the coastal waters of Egypt. Their
    results demonstrated the capability of utilizing Sentinel-1 for oil spill detection
    and mapping. Arslan [172] analyzed Sentinel-1 data to detect an oil spill caused
    by a ship on 18 December 2016 off the coast of Ildır Bay (Izmir, Turkey). Furthermore,
    Landsat 8 data were used for validation purposes by estimating brightness temperatures
    to observe oil spill changes in temperature on the sea surface. Park et al. [171]
    combined very high-resolution satellite images (Planetscope) with an artificial
    neural network technique to detect an oil spill accident that occurred on 10 August
    2017 near the Ras Al Zour area (Kuwait). The accuracy and kappa coefficient of
    the oil classification map obtained from the optical image were 82.01% and 72.42%,
    respectively. Future studies should focus on satellite data of higher temporal
    resolution to verify the results with in situ or satellite SAR data and to develop
    better algorithms for rejecting low-probability pixels and dust. Finally, there
    is a need to develop a near-real-time warning and alarm system for oil spill cases
    as a service, which can help to identify the ship or platform that is liable for
    the pollution [175]. Mateos-Molina et al. [178] analyzed a variety of different
    data sources, including Sentinel-2 and DubaiSat-2 imagery, and mapped the spatial
    distribution of coastal marine habitats in the north-western United Arab Emirates
    (UAE). Their multiple data analysis approach overcame the limitation of turbid
    waters and habitat seasonality with an overall accuracy of 77%. Ivanov et al.
    [189] studied the hydrocarbon seep characteristics and their relation to the local
    hydrocarbon field or potential hydrocarbon reservoirs in the South Caspian sea
    (Iran). They analyzed SAR images (Sentinel-1) together with bathymetry and geological
    and geophysical data with GIS. Their results showed that the oil slicks have a
    natural origin, related to the bottom seepage phenomenon and associated with an
    existing hydrocarbon system. Fatehian et al. [180] designed and implemented an
    integrated volunteered geographic information (VGI)-based system based on coastal
    pollution management concepts and public participation in order to monitor coastal
    pollution in the port city of Nowshahr (Mazandaran Province, Iran). Tourists,
    residents, and other present individuals were asked to report observable pollutants
    at their location; 86% of the reports referred to the accumulation of garbage,
    while 10% and 4% of the remaining reports were related to wastewater pollution
    and oil contaminants, respectively. According to the authors, future work should
    focus on the integration of spatial decision support systems (SDSSs) in the existing
    tool to improve coastal pollution management. El-Alfy et al. [179] used Landsat
    OLI images, synchronized with the sampling time of water and sediment samples,
    to assess the toxicity of heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides in freshwater
    and marine environments in the Rosetta area (Egypt). They found that drainage
    canals, cultivations, and urbanized zones were the major sources of contamination
    in the studied area. They recommended biological treatment processes such as using
    naturally grown plants like Phragmites australis in the contaminated sites. The
    increasing level of marine plastic pollution poses severe threats to marine ecosystems,
    thus cost-effective solutions for identifying plastic litter are essential. Themistocleous
    et al. [181] examined the potential of detection of floating plastic litter by
    introducing the plastic index (PI) and reversed normalized difference vegetation
    index (RNDVI), based on the Sentinel-2 B08 (842 nm) and B04 (665 nm) bands. They
    found that Sentinel-2 satellite images were effective in identifying plastic clusters
    in the sea, through the high reflectance of solar radiation at NIR wavelengths.
    They highlighted that future research should focus on the use of Sentinel-1 SAR
    images for the identification of plastic litter in the sea. Sannigrahi et al.
    [182] combined Sentinel-2 imagery with machine learning algorithms (support vector
    machine and random forest) for the development of an automated marine floating
    plastic detection system. The authors found that the random forest algorithm performed
    better than the support vector machine, as it detected floating plastic from real-world
    data collected from Calabria and Beirut with 91% accuracy. Zhou et al. [183] combined
    WorldView-3 satellite data with a knowledge-based classifier and concluded that
    this approach is efficient and reliable for monitoring and identifying plastic
    materials. Global warming and human activities have caused abrupt changes in marine
    ecosystems. Yagci et al. [184] investigated the potential of using the coarse
    spatial resolution MODIS products for mucilage detection and monitoring in the
    Sea of Marmara (Turkey). The validation carried out with the reference mucilage
    datasets derived from Sentinel-2A imagery and with in situ spectroradiometer measurements
    showed that the produced MODIS-based maps accurately depicted the mucilage-covered
    areas. Bakirman and Gumusay [188] combined GIS, MCDM, and remote sensing techniques
    (SPOT 7 optical imagery) for the identification of suitable habitats for Posidonia
    oceanica in Gulluk Bay, Turkey. The authors used the following criteria: depth,
    sheltered area, slope, sediment yield, and topographic position index. Their model
    identified suitable habitats for seagrass with an overall accuracy of 76%. Human
    activities have resulted in negative effects on sea turtle populations in the
    Mediterranean, thus sufficient conservation and monitoring efforts are essential
    [187]. Towards this direction, satellite telemetry and conventional GPS data loggers
    have been proven to be valuable tools for mapping the spatial ecology of sea turtles
    [185,186]. Antonioli et al. [190] studied the relative sea-level rise and potential
    submersion risk for 2100 on 16 coastal plains of the Mediterranean Sea (France,
    Spain, Tunisia, Cyprus) by analyzing LiDAR data and different climate projection
    scenarios. They estimated a potential loss of land for the above areas between
    about 148 km2 for the IPCC-RCP8.5 scenario and 192 km2 for the Rahmstorf scenario,
    impacting a coastline length of about 400 km. However, the low resolution (25
    m × 25 m) of the digital terrain model map of Cyprus prevented any further detailed
    coastal hazard assessment. 3.2.9. Big Earth Data The big Earth data thematic area
    includes technologies and development of methods and algorithms which are applied
    in the other thematic areas (Table 6). Thus, it is considered as a horizontal
    thematic area. Thirteen out of the twenty most highly cited articles which include
    big Earth data applications were categorized into the disaster risk reduction
    thematic area (Section 3.2.5), and the remaining seven are in water (three articles,
    Section 3.2.2) land (three articles, Section 3.2.4), and energy (one article,
    Section 3.2.7) thematic areas. The geographical focus of these articles is on
    Iran (14 articles), Algeria (2 articles), regional (2 articles), Morocco (1 article),
    and Oman (1 article). The average number of citations (up to 13 March 2023) of
    the top 20 articles containing big Earth data was 197. As shown in the previous
    subsections, the majority of the research carried out on big Earth data in the
    EMMENA region is applied. Table 6. Reference (Ref.), number of citations up to
    13 March 2023 (Citations), geographical focus (Country), thematic area and research
    focus (LS: Landslides, FL: Floods, GQ: Groundwater Quality, SP: Soil Properties,

    methods and techniques. 3.2.10. Other This study also identified EO studies in
    the EMMENA region which are not included in any of the above thematic areas. These
    studies include animal species detection, identification and monitoring [191,192,193,194],
    mineralogy–petrology [195,196,197], sociodemographic characteristics [198,199,200,201],
    spatial analysis of cancer [202,203], healthcare [204,205], location selection
    of shopping malls [206], optimal siting of electric vehicle charging stations
    [207], evaluation of bike-share stations [208], paleoecology [209], and examining
    the walking accessibility, willingness, and travel conditions of residents [210].
    4. Discussion 4.1. EO Studies in the EMMENA Region Over the past years, there
    has been an increasing trend in EO research in the EMMENA region (Figure 8). However,
    the number of EO studies in the EMMENA region represents only 3% of the EO studies
    carried out worldwide. Also, as we have shown in Table 2, the amount of EO research
    is highly uneven between countries within the EMMENA region. Iran is the most
    active EMMENA country in terms of EO publications, as shown both from the number
    of publications and the author affiliations. However, from our analysis we found
    that almost half of the studies were conducted by researchers not affiliated with
    the EMMENA region. We assume that, to some extent, the barrier for the expansion
    of EO research can be attributed to the lack of collaborations and knowledge transfer
    within EMMENA countries. Towards this direction, the recent establishment of a
    Centre of Excellence acting as a digital innovation hub for EO in the EMMENA region
    is a significant advancement in expanding EO research and in seeking future collaborations
    and knowledge transfer schemes among the EMMENA countries [211]. Figure 8. Number
    of EO publications per year for the EMMENA region (blue line) and the world (red
    line). The plethora of satellite data currently available are usually scattered
    among different platforms (Table 3), resulting in more time and work needed for
    data collection and preprocessing [18]. The development of a user-friendly central
    data hub (or data cubes) can resolve this issue. An example of such a central
    data hub is the GEO-CRADLE EU project which facilitates access to and sharing
    of geospatial data and information collected from satellites and ground-based
    networks in the North Africa, Middle East, and Balkans (NAMEBA) region. 4.2. EO
    Studies per Thematic Area: Limitations, Research Gaps, and Future Directions A
    general limitation on EO research which was identified in all thematic areas is
    the lack of in situ (ground truth) data. This issue has many implications such
    as on the validation of the EO outputs and on the further development of algorithms
    and models. The increasing number of countries and organizations adopting open
    data policies will partially resolve this issue, but inevitably there is a need
    for research infrastructure investments, especially in data-scarce regions. Our
    review revealed a wide range of EO applications in the thematic area of atmosphere.
    Similar to the findings of Imane et al. [30], we found that many studies in the
    EMMENA focused on dust (PM10/PM2.5), as this is a common problem among these countries.
    Also, most of the EMMENA countries are situated in water-scarce semi-arid and
    arid climate zones. Thus, as expected, EO research on precipitation estimates
    has a high research impact. In addition to this, the rise and peak of the coronavirus
    pandemic occurred within the period selected for this review, thus many studies
    related to the virus outbreak received high research interest. Future studies
    on the thematic area of atmosphere should focus on the development of EO methods
    for improved monitoring of air quality [30]. Most studies in the water thematic
    area focus on groundwater research, as shown both by the article review and the
    results of the citation topics. However, there is a range of topics where EO applications
    can contribute such as monitoring the water level of lakes, dams, and rivers with
    satellite radar altimeters and identifying the presence of different substances
    in water based on their unique spectral signatures, which can be measured by satellites
    with thermal and optical sensors and provide further information on water quality
    parameters (e.g., chlorophyll-a, total suspended sediments, colored dissolved
    organic matter) [212]. In addition to this, the management of transboundary rivers
    at a watershed level will be an emerging issue as water resources continue to
    diminish in the EMMENA region. Thus, EO applications may become a necessity in
    the emerging topic of hydrodiplomacy. EO research in the agriculture thematic
    area covered a wide range of applications. According to the World Bank, due to
    population growth agricultural production will need to expand by approximately
    70% by 2050 to cover the food need. Thus, it is important to develop sustainable
    farming practices, such as precision (smart) irrigation through EO. Such studies
    are having a great impact on agriculture, especially in water-scarce regions such
    as EMMENA. However, our review did not reveal high-impact studies on this topic.
    Also, there were no studies on the emerging subject of the photosynthetic activity
    of plants based on solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) which can be obtained by the
    Sentinel-5 satellite mission [213]. Furthermore, research on pest and disease
    detection, especially in the early stages, was limited. There is a great potential
    to advance EO research in this direction. The thematic area of disaster risk reduction
    can be considered the most impactful in terms of research interest, as it has
    on average a higher number of citations than the other thematic areas. This was
    expected, as this thematic area deals with human casualties and economic losses.
    However, our review identified research carried out only on landslides and floods.
    Unexpectedly, forest fires were not included among the top 20 articles. The choice
    of the proper parameters needed and the variety of algorithms available (machine
    learning, artificial intelligence, hybrid) along with the rapid development in
    the field of big Earth data have created confusion on which approach is more suitable
    for landslide and flood mapping. Future studies should focus on the development
    of protocols which will guide researchers and stakeholders towards the selection
    of the most suitable algorithm or method based on the specific characteristics
    of their research. Services related to early warning and decision support systems
    will upgrade EO applications, especially in thematic areas dealing with hazards
    and human health [113,117,180]. The improvement of existing services or the continuous
    development of new systems will help stakeholders and the relevant authorities
    to take the appropriate actions aiming at reducing the number of human casualties
    and severe economic losses. Similar systems will be extremely useful in the thematic
    areas of atmosphere and agriculture, with applications regarding extreme weather
    warnings and irrigation support. Research in specific thematic areas is surprisingly
    limited. The Mediterranean Sea is one of the busiest seas in the world, accounting
    for 20% of seaborne trade and over 200 million passengers [214]. Studies on ship
    detection and more particularly of those related to illegal activities were absent.
    In addition to this, the Mediterranean Sea is exposed to many risks such as rising
    CO2 emissions, pollution, marine litter, and collisions. However, this is not
    reflected by the number of studies carried out in the marine safety and security
    thematic area. We speculate that the reason for the low number of studies in this
    thematic area may be twofold: restrictions on data sharing which are often applied
    in the sea region due to security reasons and the insufficient resolution and
    revisiting time of existing non-commercial satellites which limit their ability
    to detect objects and the movement of these objects in time. Similarly, EO applications
    in the cultural heritage thematic area are very rare (1.4% of all EO applications)
    with the insufficient resolution of existing non-commercial satellites being identified
    as the main limitation. Finally, we expect that the EO research in the energy
    thematic area will attract more attention in the following years due to the gradual
    transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy. 5. Conclusions The EMMENA region
    is facing many challenges related to climate change, environmental degradation,
    energy, water scarcity, and hazards. The ongoing development of EO parallel with
    advancement in the domain of big Earth data has provided the opportunity to better
    assess and address the various challenges. This work provides an overview of the
    existing EO applications in the EMMENA region, where 6647 articles were efficiently
    categorized into the following thematic areas: Atmosphere, water, agriculture,
    land, disaster risk reduction, cultural heritage, energy, marine safety and security,
    and other. The big Earth data thematic area was identified as horizontal. A total
    of 180 articles were further reviewed from the selection of the top 20 highly
    cited articles per thematic area. The results from the top 20 articles revealed
    a high research interest in the thematic area of disaster risk reduction with
    almost two times higher number of citations than the second thematic area (water).
    The focus of these articles is limited to floods and landslides. The main knowledge
    gap was the lack of protocols and the development of early warning systems based
    on EO. The results also revealed limited research in specific EO applications
    for the water thematic area, which include water body monitoring through radar
    altimeters and water quality parameter estimation through thermal and optical
    satellite data. Also, EO research related to cultural heritage (1.4% of the total
    number of studies) and marine safety and security (0.9% of the total number of
    studies) was surprisingly rare. The main research interest in the thematic area
    of atmosphere was related to precipitation estimates, dust, and the impact of
    coronavirus on air quality. The thematic area of agriculture covered a wide range
    of EO applications (evapotranspiration estimation, land suitability for agriculture,
    irrigation mapping, agricultural land loss, crop monitoring, crop production,
    yield prediction, crop mapping, stem water potential monitoring, and crop water
    footprint estimation). The study has also identified the top authors, research
    organizations, and funding agencies for the EMMENA region. Sentinel-2 data (60.8%)
    and Sentinel-1 data (35.4%) are the most widely used among the Sentinel missions.
    Similarly, Landsat 8 (83.2%) and Landsat 7 (10.0%) are the most widely used data
    sources among the Landsat missions. The ongoing development of big Earth data
    techniques and the increasing availability of satellite EO data will enhance the
    research capabilities in the aforementioned thematic areas. Supplementary Materials

  description: Irrigation accounts for ~70% of global freshwater withdrawals and ~90%
    of consumptive water use, driving myriad Earth system impacts. In this Review,
    we summarize how irrigation currently impacts key components of the Earth system.
    Estimates suggest that more than 3.6 million km2 of currently irrigated land,
    with hot spots in the intensively cultivated US High Plains, California Central
    Valley, Indo-Gangetic Basin and northern China. Process-based models estimate
    that ~2,700 ± 540 km3 irrigation water is withdrawn globally each year, broadly
    consistent with country-reported values despite these estimates embedding substantial
    uncertainties. Expansive irrigation has modified surface energy balance and biogeochemical
    cycling. A shift from sensible to latent heat fluxes, and resulting land–atmosphere
    feedbacks, generally reduce regional growing season surface temperatures by ~1–3
    °C. Irrigation can ameliorate temperature extremes in some regions, but conversely
    exacerbates moist heat stress. Modelled precipitation responses are more varied,
    with some intensive cropping regions exhibiting suppressed local precipitation
    but enhanced precipitation downstream owing to atmospheric circulation interactions.
    Additionally, irrigation could enhance cropland carbon uptake; however, it can
    also contribute to elevated methane fluxes in rice systems and mobilize nitrogen
    loading to groundwater. Cross-disciplinary, integrative research efforts can help
    advance understanding of these irrigation–Earth system interactions, and identify
    and reduce uncertainties, biases and limitations.

    for ~70% of global freshwater withdrawals and ~90% of consumptive water use, driving
    myriad Earth system impacts. In this Review, we summarize how irrigation currently
    impacts key components of the Earth system. Estimates suggest that more than 3.6 million km2
    of currently irrigated land, with hot spots in the intensively cultivated US High
    Plains, California Central Valley, Indo-Gangetic Basin and northern China. Process-based
    models estimate that ~2,700 ± 540 km3 irrigation water is withdrawn globally each
    year, broadly consistent with country-reported values despite these estimates
    embedding substantial uncertainties. Expansive irrigation has modified surface
    energy balance and biogeochemical cycling. A shift from sensible to latent heat
    fluxes, and resulting land–atmosphere feedbacks, generally reduce regional growing
    season surface temperatures by ~1–3 °C. Irrigation can ameliorate temperature
    extremes in some regions, but conversely exacerbates moist heat stress. Modelled
    precipitation responses are more varied, with some intensive cropping regions
    exhibiting suppressed local precipitation but enhanced precipitation downstream
    owing to atmospheric circulation interactions. Additionally, irrigation could
    enhance cropland carbon uptake; however, it can also contribute to elevated methane
    fluxes in rice systems and mobilize nitrogen loading to groundwater. Cross-disciplinary,

  description: Soils are at the crossroads of many existential issues that humanity
    is currently facing. Soils are a finite resource that is under threat, mainly
    due to human pressure. There is an urgent need to map and monitor them at field,
    regional, and global scales in order to improve their management and prevent their
    degradation. This remains a challenge due to the high and often complex spatial
    variability inherent to soils. Over the last four decades, major research efforts
    in the field of pedometrics have led to the development of methods allowing to
    capture the complex nature of soils. As a result, digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches
    have been developed for quantifying soils in space and time. DSM and monitoring
    have become operational thanks to the harmonization of soil databases, advances
    in spatial modeling and machine learning, and the increasing availability of spatiotemporal
    covariates, including the exponential increase in freely available remote sensing
    (RS) data. The latter boosted research in DSM, allowing the mapping of soils at
    high resolution and assessing the changes through time. We present a review of
    the main contributions and developments of French (inter)national research, which
    has a long history in both RS and DSM. Thanks to the French SPOT satellite constellation
    that started in the early 1980s, the French RS and soil research communities have
    pioneered DSM using remote sensing. This review describes the data, tools, and
    methods using RS imagery to support the spatial predictions of a wide range of
    soil properties and discusses their pros and cons. The review demonstrates that
    RS data are frequently used in soil mapping (i) by considering them as a substitute
    for analytical measurements, or (ii) by considering them as covariates related
    to the controlling factors of soil formation and evolution. It further highlights
    the great potential of RS imagery to improve DSM, and provides an overview of
    the main challenges and prospects related to digital soil mapping and future sensors.
    This opens up broad prospects for the use of RS for DSM and natural resource monitoring.

    in both RS and DSM. Thanks to the French SPOT satellite constellation that started
    in the early 1980s, the French RS and soil research communities have pioneered
    DSM using remote sensing. This review describes the data, tools, and methods using
    RS imagery to support the spatial predictions of a wide range of soil properties
    and discusses their pros and cons. The review demonstrates that RS data are frequently
    used in soil mapping (i) by considering them as a substitute for analytical measurements,
    or (ii) by considering them as covariates related to the controlling factors of
    soil formation and evolution. It further highlights the great potential of RS
    imagery to improve DSM, and provides an overview of the main challenges and prospects
    related to digital soil mapping and future sensors. This opens up broad prospects
    for the use of RS for DSM and natural resource monitoring. Keywords: remote sensing;

    and a limited resource. They are essential to addressing the climate crisis we
    are facing. Soils are at the crossroads of existential issues such as food and
    water security and safety, climate change mitigation, and adaptation, human health,
    sustainable energy, and biodiversity protection [1,2]. Yet, around the world,
    they are under threat [3,4], even though they are essential for achieving most
    of the sustainable development goals (e.g., [5,6,7,8]). These threats continue
    to grow under human pressure [3,4]. To address this problem, policy initiatives
    are emerging in Europe, such as the Soil Thematic Strategy [9] or the E.U. Mission
    “A Soil Deal for Europe” [10]. There is an urgent need to map and monitor soils
    at field, regional, and global scales in order to improve their management and
    prevent their degradation. This remains a challenge due to the high/complex spatial
    variability inherent in soils. Providing such information by mapping and monitoring
    soil properties in a reproducible way is now possible through Digital Soil Mapping
    (DSM, [11]). The concept of DSM has rapidly developed and become operational thanks
    to the harmonization of soil databases, advances in spatial modeling and machine
    learning, and the increasing availability of spatial covariates [12,13], including
    the considerable increase in remote sensing data. DSM emerged in the early 2000s
    [11,14] as a new concept for mapping soil properties and/or soil classes using
    soil information and spatially comprehensive covariates, which builds on the work
    of Jenny [15]. In their seminal article, McBratney et al. [11] proposed a framework
    called the scorpan-SSPFe. This framework included a soil spatial prediction function
    for soil mapping with spatially auto-correlated errors, often referred to as SCORPAN.
    As defined by McBratney et al. [11], SCORPAN is based on seven predictive factors
    of soil types or soil attributes, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured
    attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the
    environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation;
    (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material,
    including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic
    position. The prediction functions can use a wide variety of statistical tools,
    including regression, classification, geostatistics, machine learning, etc. It
    is not the purpose of this review to detail these methods or their advantages
    and limitations. We refer to McBratney et al. [11], Grunwald [16], Minasny and
    McBratney [12,17], Zhang et al. [18], Wadoux et al. [19], Arrouays et al. [20],
    Wadoux et al. [19] and Chen et al. [21]. A recent trend is that the availability
    of RS products, and in particular those derived from satellite [22], airborne,
    or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery [23], has increased significantly. Thus,
    almost all DSM approaches rely on RS data to obtain spatially exhaustive environmental
    covariates [21], as well as legacy soil, geology, geomorphology, and landforms
    maps. Ustin and Middleton [24] identified and described 48 instruments and 13
    multi-instrument platforms that collected data in the 2000s, were recently launched,
    or are expected to be launched in this decade. Indeed, some of these are now being
    considered as a direct measurement of some targeted soil properties [25]. Commercial
    operations are also entering the market, providing competitive products with high
    spatiotemporal (e.g., Planet, https://www.planet.com/products/planet-imagery/
    accessed on 29 May 2023 or EarthDaily https://earthdaily.com/earthdaily/ accessed
    on 29 May 2023) and even spectral resolution (e.g., Kuva Space, https://kuvaspace.com/
    accessed on 29 May 2023). In this review, we mainly focus on satellite and airborne
    imagery as we aim to review DSM studies covering rather large areas. Nevertheless,
    we do not totally exclude examples on UAV when they are relevant for field- or
    farm-scale soil mapping or monitoring. French research has a long history in the
    field of soil RS. As early as the early 1960s, they developed innovative approaches
    for the photo-interpretation of aerial photographs for soil mapping [26,27,28],
    visual interpretation, and/or digital processing of RS images. It was stimulated
    by the launch of the first Earth observation satellite, Landsat, in 1972 and,
    in 1986, the French Satellite Probatoire d’Observation de la Terre (SPOT). Some
    pioneering French works include general books on RS applications to the characterization
    of the biosphere or terrestrial environment (e.g., [29,30,31,32,33,34]). The development
    of soil RS was notably based on French research focused on the spectral characterization
    of minerals [35,36,37] and on the soil surface status [38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48].
    In the latter case, the aim was to define soil spectral indices such as the widely
    used brightness index [49,50,51], the Transformed Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index
    (TSAVI) [52], and the theorization of the soil line concept [53]. This led to
    the physical modeling of soil bidirectional reflectance [54,55] thanks to the
    SOILSPECT model of S. Jacquemoud [56], which was followed by the MARMIT model
    of A. Bablet [57,58]. The same thing has happened in the microwave and thermal
    infrared domains [59,60]. Observation and hence, understanding the spectral behavior
    of soil as a function of its composition and structure has been the cornerstone
    for establishing relationships between the spatial distribution of soil properties
    at different scales, soil types, or soilscapes, and RS imagery products in the
    solar (e.g., [61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77]), as well as
    in the microwave (e.g., [65,70,71,73]) and the thermal infrared (e.g., [59,78,79])
    domains. Several studies have also addressed the mapping of soil color (e.g.,
    [46,51,80]) or soil moisture (e.g., [78,79,81,82,83,84,85,86]). Others aimed to
    consider the bare soil surface reflectance, roughness, rockiness, or soil cover
    by vegetation or crop residues for several applications: modeling/mapping of soil
    crusting, surface water runoff, erodibility or erosion risk (e.g., [40,47,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98]),
    and salinity [41,48,99,100,101]. Vegetation is a problem for direct RS of some
    primary soil properties that are easier to capture by images acquired on bare
    soils [102]. Therefore, several works have attempted to develop vegetation indexes
    that are nearly insensitive to the soil spectral response, unlike the NDVI (e.g.,
    [103,104]). However, (i) vegetation is one of the main controlling factors of
    soil evolution (e.g., inputs in soil organic carbon and influence on pH); (ii)
    vegetation information may also be related to some soil properties that are not
    easily detected using only soil surface response (e.g., soil depth and available
    water capacity (AWC)) and thus need to be captured for DSM. Comprehensive reviews
    of the use of remote sensing for soil and terrain mapping were made from the French
    research as early as 1974, albeit in French [31,105], and major reviews were later
    published in English by Ben-Dor et al. [106,107], Ben-Dor [108], and Mulder et
    al. [109]. The latter introduced the use of RS as primary or secondary soil data
    to improve DSM. As RS products have become increasingly available and diverse
    and also offer higher resolutions in space, time, and spectral range, updated
    reviews have been published by Demattê et al. [110] and Chabrillat et al. [111],
    focusing on the main soil characteristics monitored by RS and the perspectives
    offered by new sensors [112]. The idea of an article gathering the specific contributions
    of RS to DSM from French research originates from a scientific working group founded
    in 2015 and named Theia “CNS for Cartographie Numérique des Sols” (DSM for Digital
    Soil Mapping). This French working group aims to federate the efforts of French
    research laboratories developing digital mapping approaches for perennial soil
    properties [113,114] under the supervision of Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales
    (French Space Agency). We believe that such an approach can be useful not only
    on a national scale, but that it can also be considered as the first step to implement
    a similar approach on a global scale. The objectives of this review are as follows:
    Summarize the main soil properties and threats that have been studied on a large
    scale over the last decade using RS by the French research community; Synthesize
    the main recent methodological advances of DSM related to the use of RS products
    in France or elsewhere from French research; Highlight the complementarity of
    the new RS products and the other covariates currently used in DSM. 2. General
    Considerations on the Relative Permanence of Soil Properties DSM predicts soil
    properties that may change over different times, from brief sudden events to millions
    of years. Time intervals vary with soil properties and processes and are highly
    dependent on the controlling factors for soil formation and anthropogenic influences.
    These factors can be rather slow, such as weathering and pedogenesis, or short-lived
    when related to destructive events, such as deforestation, erosion and flooding,
    or local contamination. RS technology has evolved rapidly over the last 50 years
    or so, providing greater diversity in spectral domains, but also a drastic increase
    in their spatial resolution and revisit time. This improves our understanding
    of the relative permanence of soil properties, yet it is limited to one week to
    half a century. In this section, we will refer mainly to the international literature,
    as many concepts have emerged outside the strict French soil science community.
    Soils are continually evolving over time, and the rate of change in soil properties
    is accelerating due to global changes and continued unsustainable land management
    [2,4]. The “natural” formation time of soils, from the initial weathering of parent
    materials to pedogenic evolution, may range from about 10,000 to 2,500,000 years.
    As a result, the evolution and properties of natural soils mainly depend on age
    (time), climate (including past climates), parent material, and natural vegetation.
    It is generally accepted that the “age” factor is least used in DSM, except for
    some long periods of extreme climate (e.g., glaciation and interglacial periods)
    [16]. Therefore, the influence of past climate may be underestimated by DSM covariates
    and is often barely captured by RS products, as they do not cover the duration
    of most pedogenetic processes. Many soil properties have been affected by drastic
    changes since the impact of humans, especially by gradual or abrupt land-use changes.
    This began when humans moved from hunting and gathering to agriculture (Neolithic
    revolution). This then led to (ongoing) deforestation and the conversion of land
    to arable land, and more recently to global changes, such as anthropogenic climate
    change, industrialization, urbanization and increases in impervious surfaces,
    land-take, and changes in land use/land cover due to food demand. To differentiate
    the effects of long- and short-term periods on soil variability, researchers have
    proposed a distinction between genosoils and phenosoils [115]. This concept makes
    it possible to distinguish certain semi-permanent properties inherited from “natural”
    pedogenesis from properties that have evolved under human pressure, especially
    for the history of land use. It has led to further development and discussions
    of which soil properties can be considered more or less “permanent”, e.g., certain
    characteristics of deep diagnostic horizons [116], while others may change with
    land use, management (e.g., [117,118,119,120]), or under other circumstances.
    This concept is quite similar to the concept of soil capability vs. soil condition,
    as defined by McBratney et al. [1]. In this study, we will therefore make the
    assumption that certain soil attributes can be considered permanent (e.g., soil
    texture, soil mineralogy, and parent material) on the time-scale of RS observations
    (i.e., 50 years). Unless there is evidence that abrupt or destructive events have
    occurred, such as severe erosion or salinization. The typical duration of the
    semi-permanent changes can range from decades to centuries (e.g., soil organic
    carbon stocks and diffuse contaminant contents) to seasonal ones (e.g., deep horizon
    structure and permeability, pH, rooting depth, and soil temperature). Much more
    rapid and/or even nearly instantaneous changes are related to human actions or
    climate events, e.g., local contamination, nutrients content, topsoil structure
    and roughness, pH in limed cultivated soils, and, of course, soil moisture. It
    is therefore important to keep these different times in mind, especially when
    dealing with soil data and/or RS acquisition dates, or the time-scales relevant
    to monitoring. Note that some information gathered by RS, and even by other DSM
    covariates (i.e., relief) might not reflect the variation of SCORPAN covariates
    over large time-scales. 3. Developments Related to the Extraction of Soil Properties
    from Remote Sensing Data 3.1. Use of RS Data as a Substitute for Soil Properties’
    Measurement In many cases, RS data are directly used as a measure of soil properties,
    which Mulder et al. [109] called the “primary soil data source”. Bare soil reflectance,
    for example, has been correlated with many topsoil properties measured in the
    lab. A model or a spectral index is built to predict certain properties, a given
    behavior, or a threat to the soil from its spectral reflectance at one or more
    wavelengths. Thus, many attempts have been made to determine soil moisture [121],
    soil carbon [122], soil clay content [123,124], or soil salinity [125]. In many
    cases, therefore, RS is not incorporated into a full SCORPAN model, but directly
    used as a predictor of the soil property of interest through generalized linear
    models, partial least squares regression (PLSR), geostatistics, machine learning,
    or other prediction tools (e.g., [126,127,128,129]). In this case, uncertainties
    and biases in the predictions should be noted, and care should be taken not to
    apply them outside their domain of validity. If the results are satisfactory,
    i.e., if RS data capture most of the variability of the soil attribute in a given
    area, it may not be necessary to incorporate them into a SCORPAN model (e.g.,
    [123,124,130,131,132]). Note that these considerations do not claim that working
    on the field and taking samples are not essential. Working on the field is a crucial
    step in DSM and RS for several reasons: − Lab measurements performed on samples
    taken into the field are essential to calibrate RS and DSM predictions, and they
    must be representative from both feature and spatial domains (e.g., [12,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,126,127,133,134,135]).
    − Using more high-resolution spatial covariates does not necessarily improve the
    prediction accuracy (e.g., [12,19,20,136]). − Validation should involve appropriate
    sampling in the field (e.g., [12,17,18,19,20,21,123,126,127,131,132,137]). − The
    lack of field data is often one of the main limiting factors of RS and DSM prediction
    performances (e.g., [13,21,138,139,140,141,142,143]). − Soil knowledge acquired
    in the field is useful to improve and assess the RS and DSM prediction performances
    (e.g., [17,19,20,21,127,138,139,144,145,146,147,148]). 3.2. Most Studied Soil
    Properties in French Remote Sensing Research In order to have an overview of the
    most studied soil properties in French RS research, a dedicated bibliographic
    search was performed using the Clarivate Web of Science. The query returned 2426
    articles, which shows a high productivity. Figure 1 shows the relative percentage
    of the main soil properties selected, and we decided to focus on those properties
    that exceed 5% of the total number of French research papers. We recognize that
    there is no guarantee that the search is exhaustive, given the query process.
    However, to our knowledge, this is the best effort of such a systematic literature
    search related to French soil RS research. Figure 1. Percentage of articles by
    soil properties published by French researchers (out of 2426 articles). This citation

    All rights reserved. We selected articles whose TITLE, TOPIC, KEYWORDS AND/OR
    ABSTRACT contained “REMOTE SENSING” AND “SOIL” and FRANCE in the KEYWORDS or TITLE
    or ABSTRACTS or at least in the address of an author. Note that we complemented
    this search with other expert-based searches, notably for authors who published
    mainly in French (not included in the WOS), or French researchers whose address
    was not in France at certain periods. Second, we manually excluded articles that
    were clearly out of the scope of our searches. Finally, we grouped together some
    similar keywords when their meaning was comparable. The most studied soil property
    is soil moisture (usually topsoil moisture), which has been studied either in
    the solar domain (e.g., [39,57,58,59,78]), the thermal infrared domain [59,60,78,79],
    or the microwave domain (e.g., [84,86,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159]).
    Soil moisture is one of the most studied soil properties in France and can be
    mainly related to the ESA SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission. The
    origin of SMOS goes back to the early 1990s. As part of the development of passive
    microwave radiometers by CNES, experiments were conducted over crop fields in
    1991 and 1993 in the remote sensing facilities of INRAE in Avignon. Wigneron et
    al. [160,161] demonstrated the possibility to simultaneously extract soil moisture
    (SM) and Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), a parameter related to the vegetation
    water content, from multi-angular and bi-polarization passive microwave (MW) observations.
    Shortly after, Wigneron et al. [133,162] defined a retrieval algorithm based on
    the inversion of the L-MEB model (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere).
    This algorithm, which is well suited for a spaceborne mission, was the core of
    a research proposal submitted to the ESA Call for Earth Explorer Missions. The
    proposal was accepted by ESA in 1999 (phase A), leading to the Soil Moisture and
    Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission coordinated by Y. Kerr, its principal investigator
    [163]. The satellite was launched at the end of 2009 as part of the ESA Living
    Planet Programme. In parallel, many scientific advances have been made in the
    domain of active microwaves (radar) with the support of CNES. It is more difficult
    to extract SM from active MV sensors (i.e., scatterometers and Synthetic Aperture
    Radar (SAR)) than from passive sensors (i.e., radiometers). In active RS, measurements
    must take into account complex extinction effects due to vegetation structure
    and complex scattering effects due to soil roughness. However, while the spatial
    resolution of passive MW radiometers is limited to 35–50 km, that of active SAR
    systems can reach a few meters. Thus, the SM products retrieved from passive MW
    with low spatial resolutions mainly have applications in hydrology, climate studies,
    and meteorology [153], while the SM products retrieved from active systems can
    also find applications in agriculture [164]. The soil moisture retrieved by passive
    or active MW instruments corresponds to surface SM (1 to 5 cm in depth). Several
    studies have shown that root zone soil moisture (RZSM) can be inferred from time
    series of surface SM based on model assimilation or from simple temporal filtering
    methods [165]. Optical and thermal infrared (TIR) observations can also be used
    to map surface SM at high spatial resolution, but to date, the research is not
    sufficiently mature and no operational RS product exists [45,166,167,168]. Surface
    temperature measured by TIR sensors is related to evapotranspiration and can be
    used to estimate RZSM [169,170]. SM is an important parameter in itself, but it
    can also be used to estimate permanent soil properties. For example, temporal
    variations in SM can be used, through assimilation, to retrieve soil parameters
    such as soil hydraulic properties [134]. Soil roughness is an important characteristic
    that plays a key role in understanding/modeling different processes (e.g., slaking,
    runoff, infiltration, and erosion). It also has an important effect on the remote
    sensing signatures observed by satellites: it can be estimated because it is a
    parameter of interest in itself, or because its effects need to be corrected for
    a better estimation of other variables of interest (such as SM in the MW domain).
    Soil roughness, or micro-topography, is an important influencing factor on the
    soil spectral response to a degree similar to that of “chromophores” [65], and
    is therefore a key parameter in modeling soil surface reflectance [56]. In addition,
    it is an indicator of the water infiltration potential, soil slaking, and erosion
    risk [98,171]. Several methods have been designed to measure soil surface roughness.
    Their main disadvantages were the time-consuming and tedious nature of the measurement
    in the field. Bretar et al. [172] and later Gilliot et al. [173] developed an
    easy-to-handle and fully automatic photogrammetric method to derive digital elevation
    models (DEMs) of the soil surface with millimeter resolution from multi-angular
    photographs captured in the field. In the active MW domain, soil roughness has
    a significant effect that must be corrected to estimate other parameters of interest,
    such as SM and VOD. In the passive MW domain, soil roughness contributes to increased
    MW emissions from the soil. It is related to both micro-scale (~1 cm) and macro-scale
    (~100 m) topographic effects. The first global map of the observed roughness parameter
    from SMOS was produced by Parrens et al. [174]. The new generation of freely available
    radar sensors (e.g., Sentinel-1 since 2015) allows the scientific community to
    collect images with a revisit time (<6 days) and spatial resolution (~10 m) suitable
    for hydrological and agronomic applications, on local or regional scales [164].
    At these scales, soil roughness mapping is mainly performed on bare agricultural
    soils. The radar signal increases with the roughness (root mean surface height,
    RMSH) according to an exponential law and becomes constant after a certain roughness
    threshold. Several studies show a faster saturation of the radar signal with the
    soil roughness when the wavelength and/or the incidence angle is small [93,175].
    The third most important soil property is primarily related to soil organic carbon
    (SOC). This is not surprising considering that soils are the largest terrestrial
    organic C stocks and the question of their role in climate mitigation and adaptation
    is a hot topic [176,177,178,179]. Reviews on SOC mapping using RS are recent [180,181],
    especially using satellites [181]. Most studies rely on observation in the solar
    domain, at scales ranging from the field to regional, and finally, to national
    or even transnational scales. Most approaches have been conducted on bare, cultivated
    soils: the higher the scale, the lowers the accuracy. The prediction performance
    varies according to the type of soil [123], the date of acquisition [182], and
    the presence of crop residues on the surface [22,183]. As far as French research
    is concerned, RS studies have been conducted at local or regional scales and none
    of them have yet specifically addressed the use of RS at the national scale of
    metropolitan France. Studies at smaller scales have mainly relied on UAVs [173]
    and airborne imagery [184] at a very high spatial resolution (≤2.5 m), while at
    larger scales, most studies have relied on high-resolution satellite images: Hyperion
    [185], SPOT [186,187], Sentinel-2 [123,182], and/or Sentinel-2 with the joint
    use of Sentinel-1 [128,129]. The accuracies found for mainland France range from
    2 g kg−1 to 6 g kg−1, leaving open the feasibility of monitoring SOC according
    to agricultural C-stocking practices. This feasibility, especially the influence
    of the composition of the soil surface, is the subject of studies at the French
    and European levels. Soil color is an important soil property that is directly
    related to the reflectance of soil in the visible [46,51,80], which depends mainly
    on the so-called “chromophores” [108]: soil organic carbon content, Fe sesquioxydes,
    calcareous content, moisture, and to a lesser extent, soil texture and mineralogy.
    It is widely used in conventional mapping and soil taxonomy. The Munsell color
    coordinate system was related to visible bands by R. Escadafal [46,80], resulting
    in the cluster diagram of soil lines versus Munsell color. In our literature database,
    it was not always easy to distinguish soil color from soil brightness and soil
    albedo. While the term “soil color” is often used in soil science, the RS community
    that focuses on vegetation monitoring has investigated color-related soil surface
    properties such as soil brightness derived from the soil line concept or soil
    albedo, mainly derived from inversion of kernel-driven reflectance models on selected
    directional reflectance data [188]. Topsoil texture defined as the relative proportion
    of clay, silt, and sand is one of the most important characteristics of soils.
    It determines many of their physical and chemical properties and behaviors (e.g.,
    water retention, mechanical behavior, infiltration capacity, nutrient and pollutant
    concentrations, friability, and trafficability). Attempts to map soil texture
    have shown that the best results were achieved in the visible, near infrared,
    and shortwave infrared from hyperspectral airborne images (e.g., [124,126,189,190])
    or from multispectral satellite images [130,191,192,193]. These works have mainly
    focused on clay texture and/or clay content estimation due to the specific absorption
    of clay minerals around 2200 nm [194]. As observed for SOC estimation, the texture
    prediction performance of topsoil varies with the date of acquisition and the
    presence of crop residues on the surface [193]. Finally, in the early stages of
    the use of RS for soil mapping, RS was often used to delineate/identify soil types
    or soil classes (e.g., [61,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,75,76,195]). At the
    initiative of French geographers, in particular E. de Martonne [196], these approaches
    were initially based on the visual interpretation of aerial photographs, most
    often in photogrammetric mode for a better identification of morphological units
    [26,27,28]. We can introduce here the notion of soilscape, defined as “a landscape
    unit including a limited number of soil classes that are geographically distributed
    according to an identifiable pattern” [197]. A spatial layer of the soil factor
    can then be analyzed in terms of such identifiable patterns. Digital processing
    of single-date raster images using a per-pixel classifier [75,195,198] or “textural
    analysis” [74,76] has been proposed to mimic and replace visual interpretation.
    Some approaches have used digital clustering of soil profile data [199], through
    the DIMITRI algorithm [61,200] or hierarchical clustering [72] of semantic information
    about soil map units. The DIMITRI algorithm was later incorporated into the OASIS
    algorithm [201], whose objective is to identify repeated patterns in the image
    by calculating the “composition or class frequency vector” of a given square neighborhood
    in the image. A similar approach has been developed using the CLAPAS (CLAssement
    des PAysages et Segmentation) algorithm proposed by J.M. Robbez-Masson [202,203].
    The main soilscapes of Lebanon were derived from a single-date Landsat image using
    OASIS [76], while SPOT was used to obtain large vineyard units in the southern
    Rhone Valley [74]. First applied to non-spectral data [197,204], CLAPAS was then
    applied to a MODIS time series at four dates to map the main landscape units of
    Brittany [205,206]. Pixel-based approaches have been especially applied in contexts
    where the soil is often bare, as in arid environments [195,198] or on Mediterranean
    vineyards with bare inter-rows [75]. In addition, a pixel-based approach relying
    on both a SPOT time series and morphometric layers (elevation and derivatives)
    to map South African terroirs was a step toward DSM formalism. It performed bootstrap
    selection of the training/validation areas in order to implement regression trees,
    and then a “Hyperstat” algorithm calculated the modal value in the output map
    stack and the assignment frequency as an indicator of mapping uncertainty [77].
    Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of the number of articles by soil properties.
    This trend relates to technological advances (new satellites and sensors) and
    scientific and political interest in specific soil properties. We observe a remarkable
    increase for all properties between the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This is
    likely due to the launch of Landsat 7 and its Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)
    sensor, which allowed for more accurate assessments of the land surface [24].
    In 2008, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) made all Landsat 7 data available
    to the public [207], and even free in 2009, which led to a large increase in downloads
    and probably explains the largest increase in publications after 2010. Studies
    on some soil properties have steadily increased (i.e., soil moisture), while some
    seem to have had a rather constant interest over the last twenty years (roughness,
    temperature, color, and albedo). In particular, although almost absent in 2007,
    SOC shows a strong increase in interest. This increase is arguably related both
    to the growing interest in SOC, especially driven by the IPCC [208], and to the
    launch of satellites that better capture a wide range of SOC-related spectral
    bands (e.g., [209,210]). Despite their relatively smaller numbers, soil texture
    studies show a notable increase that is also related to technological advances
    (imaging spectroscopy (e.g., [124,126])). Figure 2. Evolution of the cumulative
    number of articles per soil property. 3.3. Trends in French Remote Sensing Research
    in Relation to Threats to Soil In this section, we focus on articles that explicitly
    mention soil threats in our corpus of publications (Figure 1). Soil threats are
    classified according to the proposals made by the EU Soil Thematic Strategy [9,211]
    and the EU soil strategy for 2030 [10]. The relative importance of soil threats
    (Figure 3) is related both to their importance in the political agenda and to
    the feasibility of using RS products to monitor these threats. Figure 3. Percentage
    of articles per soil threat (out of 857 articles where threats were explicitly
    mentioned). The strong dominance of SOC is clearly related to the feasibility
    of reporting, monitoring, and verifying soil carbon stocks according to article
    3.4. of the Kyoto Protocol (e.g., [212,213]). It also links to the COP21 Paris
    Agreement and the four per Mille initiative [177,214,215]. In addition to advances
    in temporal frequency, high spatial and spectral resolution RS imagery offers
    an unprecedented opportunity to study and monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics
    of SOC changes [111,181]. The second threat is the sealing of soils by urbanization,
    industrialization, road construction, etc. It corresponds to an almost irreversible
    loss of many soil functions and is particularly widespread in some regions of
    France (mainly peri-urban and coastal areas). The fine spatial resolution of the
    new RS sensors enables them to monitor the expansion of sealed areas over time.
    In France, the Land Cover Scientific Expertise Center (CES OSO, https://www.theia-land.fr/
    accessed on 29 May 2023) automatically produces land-cover maps for metropolitan
    France from Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B data. These maps have a ground sampling
    distance (GSD) of 10 m. They are used to monitor the rate of soil sealing and/or
    to take into account the services rendered by soils in land-use planning (e.g.,
    [216,217,218]). The third threat is erosion, which is a serious problem in French
    agricultural soils (e.g., [219,220,221]). Soil crusting and slaking have been
    studied using RS for a long time (e.g., [98,222]). High-resolution imagery is
    an increasingly used technology for mapping erosion [223]. Soil surface changes
    can also be captured by DEM series from UAVs [224]. Examples of soil contamination
    are less numerous, often related to the impact of mining or industrial activities
    on trace elements (e.g., [225,226]), hydrocarbon and oil contamination (e.g.,
    [227,228,229]), and some radionuclides [230]. Many studies are still based on
    hyperspectral, fluorescence, or photoluminescence measurements performed in the
    laboratory or by proximal RS (e.g., [226,231]). There are, however, a few studies
    using airborne hyperspectral or gamma-ray spectrometry data [227,228,230,232,233,234,235].
    The fifth most important threat is soil salinization, which is a very serious
    problem for soil fertility. It mainly concerns arid and semi-arid regions and
    is often linked to the quality of irrigation water [4]. Mainland France is not
    a salinization hot spot, except for a few local areas such as the Rhone delta
    (Camargue). However, French research is very active in the field of soil salinization
    RS. This is partly due to the history of France and its relationships with certain
    countries. This is also related to the fact that salinization crusts are quite
    easily detectable, even in the visible, and that studies on soil salinity mapping
    and monitoring have been developing for a long time and are still ongoing (e.g.,
    [99,101,198,236,237]). Other soil threats are more rarely studied using RS. Biodiversity,
    compaction, and acidification are not directly related to RS imagery. Indicators
    of soil biodiversity or acidification can, however, be captured by RS through
    vegetation or land use. In this case, they are often combined with other covariates
    in DSM tools. Figure 4 shows the evolution of the cumulative number of articles
    per soil threat. Figure 4. Evolution of the cumulative number of articles per
    soil threat. The most striking trend is the almost exponential number of articles
    on soil carbon loss. As explained above, this trend relates to both policy issues
    and advances in the feasibility of monitoring SOC. Similarly, we observe a large
    increase in soil sealing studies, related to population growth, soil sealing,
    and land-use issues, as well as the opportunities provided by new high-resolution,
    time–frequency satellites. The increase in soil erosion and contamination studies
    also relates to global issues and advances offered by new sensors. In comparison,
    studies on soil salinization remain rather stable; biodiversity is slowly emerging,
    while acidification and compaction are almost negligible. 3.4. Remote Sensing
    of Soil Properties as Training Data for Digital Soil Mapping Similar to laboratory
    measurements, RS predictions can be used as an “s” factor in the SCORPAN model
    (i.e., they are used as if they were “measurements” of the variable of interest).
    In this case, the main challenge is to incorporate the uncertainties associated
    with these inputs into the SCORPAN model. Note that this issue also applies to
    laboratory measurements, although it can be assumed that they are generally more
    accurate than those derived from RS data. Another important limitation of using
    RS data as direct inputs to calibrate DSM models is that soil reflectance only
    captures information about the surface layer, while soils are 3D objects. Only
    radar or gamma-ray spectrometry techniques are capable of observing a soil at
    depth. If the prediction does not include a spatial component, and if there are
    a sufficient number of validation points, an easy and often-used way to verify
    the absence of a spatial component is to perform geostatistical analyses on the
    prediction residuals. If there is a spatial structure on the residuals, it is
    possible to improve the predictions by kriging or find that this trend might be
    related to another covariate that could be incorporated in a SCORPAN model. It
    is important to keep in mind the consequences of uncertainty if these predictions
    are not only used to predict a value at a given time, but also intend to monitor
    changes in a soil characteristic. First, cumulative errors at two dates will affect
    the minimum detectable change (i.e., [238]). Second, it is debatable whether it
    is better to map soil attribute values at two dates and then infer changes from
    their differences, or whether it is better to directly map the changes themselves.
    Both from a spatial and soil process point of view, the spatial structures and
    controlling factors of a soil attribute at two different dates may not be the
    same as the changes between two dates. It should be noted that the above remarks
    are relevant to both for the “direct RS detection of soil properties” and DSM.
    4. Incorporating RS as Covariates in DSM 4.1. Soil Property Maps Using Remote
    Sensing on Bare Soils as Covariates in DSM Instead of using the soil spectral
    response to inverse a model prediction of a soil property, an alternative is to
    incorporate the map of that prediction as a covariate in a SCORPAN model [239,240,241].
    These studies are limited by the spatial availability of bare soil images; the
    influence of perturbing factors such as soil roughness [157], moisture, and vegetation
    residues on the topsoil [102,242]; mismatches between soil sampling and remote
    sensing acquisition dates (e.g., [186]); and, in some cases, the low variability
    and range of some soil property values [123,126,182]. Increasing the frequency
    of acquisition dates (e.g., with S1 and S2 products) now enables the detection
    of more bare soil fields and area expansion by mosaicking several images [128]
    and reduces the influence of soil moisture and crop residues on the prediction
    accuracy (e.g., [128,129]). Figure 5, extracted from [243], shows an example of
    RS data on bare soil used as covariates in a DSM model to predict SOC in a region
    of central France. Interestingly, the covariates derived from RS imagery on bare
    soil are among the most important in SOC prediction. Figure 5. Relative importance
    of the first 25 environmental covariates for SOC prediction by DSM in the Beauce
    region (France) using different learning soil data and incorporating RS data among
    the covariates. The color palette (light green to blue) indicates the degree of
    importance of the covariates; the least important covariates are in light green
    and the most influential covariates are in blue. The red squares are data derived
    from Sentinel 2 spectral bands; the pink squares are airborne gamma spectrometry
    maps; the yellow squares are other environmental covariates. Adapted from Urbina-Salazar
    et al., Remote Sensing, 2003, 15, 2410, Figure 5. In this example, the question
    of how to combine these soil predictions with a model adapted to usually vegetated
    areas remains to be solved, in order to obtain a full DSM map of soil properties
    over a large area including various land uses. This general question applies for
    nearly all RS data obtained from bare soils. If one wishes a full map of a landscape,
    RS data on bare soils are almost never available on the whole area, except for
    deserts. 4.2. Remote Sensing Data as Proxies of Soil Properties Controlling Factors
    in the SCORPAN DSM Model 4.2.1. Climate On a global scale, climate is one of the
    major controlling factors for weathering and subsequent pedogenesis. Actually,
    the birth of pedology relates to Dokutchaev’s pioneering work on the zonal climatic
    distribution of soil types in Russia (e.g., [244,245,246,247]). At this scale,
    climate is also the major controlling factor for SOC contents and stocks (e.g.,
    [177,248]), either through the effect of climate on vegetation-derived SOC inputs
    (e.g., in the hottest and driest regions) or through the effect of very low temperatures
    on lowering the rate of SOM mineralization (e.g., in the circumpolar and high-elevation
    regions). Figure 6 illustrates the global effect of climate on the world’s carbon
    stock distribution downloaded from the website https://soilgrids.org/ accessed
    on 29 May 2023. The original work on DSM at the global scale is from Poggio et
    al. [249]. As explained in this article, climate is one of the most important
    driving factor of SOC stocks at the global scale. The map clearly highlights the
    effect of temperature in the Northern latitudes and in the mountains. There is
    also an effect of a very wet and hot climate, for example, in Indonesia. Figure
    6. Global DSM map of SOC carbon stocks. Adapted from an image downloaded from
    https://soilgrids.org/ accessed on 29 May 2023—© ISRIC-World Soil Information,
    from the original work by Poggio et al. [249]. At the scale of mainland France,
    latitude and altitude are clearly the two main controlling factors for SOC, together
    with land cover (e.g., [250,251,252]). The effect of altitude was also demonstrated
    for climatic gradients related to elevation or rainfall in smaller regions (e.g.,
    [238,253,254]). Rainfall intensity is another major controlling factor for soil
    weathering [255] and erosion [256]. Finally, climate change is one of the factors
    accelerating certain pedogenic processes and threats to soil [4]. 4.2.2. Land-Cover
    and Vegetation Characteristics Land-cover classification based on RS products
    is a relevant covariate for predicting many soil attributes, in particular SOC.
    In mainland France, studies have used land-cover maps as covariates to map SOC
    concentrations or stocks (e.g., [138,250,257,258,259]). Land-cover classification
    from RS products can be a relevant covariate for predicting many soil attributes.
    Other studies have also shown that SOC sequestration potential was also related
    to land cover (e.g., [216,260,261]). Land cover is also clearly related to soil
    pH as well as parent material [259]. RS products are one of the main tools used
    for assessing human pressure on soil contamination through the distance to urban
    or industrial areas and major roads (e.g., [262,263,264]). Changes in land cover
    (and the transition duration from one land cover to another) are also direct controlling
    factors of erosion risks. In a review paper, King et al. [222] summarized soil
    erosion monitoring and modeling from RS. The first interesting piece of information
    accessible via RS is vegetation cover, as bare soils are generally the areas that
    contribute most to runoff (e.g., [265,266,267]). RS has also been used as an indicator
    of slaking [268]. Hill et al. [269] monitored land degradation, soil erosion,
    and desertification in a French Mediterranean region and demonstrated excellent
    accuracy in identifying soil degradation levels using airborne imaging spectroscopy
    (AVIRIS) and Landsat TM data. For erosion as well, the distributions of land use
    across the landscape and connectivity between fields are studied using RS and
    provide useful information on runoff concentration risks [270,271]. RS information
    on soil roughness, for example using radar data, can also significantly improve
    erosion prediction and modeling [93,222]. Finally, land cover may sometimes be
    correlated to some specific local soil properties. For example, in large, cultivated
    plains such as the Beauce region in France, small, forested plots are often related
    to very shallow soils [272]. The identification of bare soils uses vegetation
    indexes such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). These were designed
    to assess the amount of green vegetation [273]. As such, they can also be used
    as proxies of organic carbon inputs to the soil when integrated over rather long
    periods of time (e.g., monthly or annual averages, [259,260]). In this case, the
    amount of green vegetation is supposed to be related to the carbon originating
    from roots and/or crop residues. Vegetation indexes, such as land surface temperature
    (LST), as evapotranspiration factors, can also be an indicator of vegetation stress
    and the soil’s available water capacity (AWC) for plants during dry periods [274,275,276].
    In general, the AWC can be calculated using pedotransfer functions (PTFs), established
    between water retention characteristics and some other spatialized information
    (e.g., texture, depth or rooting depth, bulk density, and coarse elements, [277,278]).
    Another way to obtain indirect information about the AWC is to assimilate RS data
    into vegetation functioning models (e.g., [279,280,281]). Fusion approaches have
    also been developed to combine local soil property measurements with RS data [282,283,284].
    A recent review by Cousin et al. [285] provides an insightful overview of the
    ways to estimate the AWC using RS data as covariates for DSM AWC prediction from
    field to regional scales. 4.2.3. Relief, Topography, and Landforms Relief, topography,
    and landforms are among the main controlling factors in the SCORPAN model [11,286].
    The covariates used in DSM are generally computed derivatives of Digital Elevation
    Models (DEMs). For global mapping, Sanchez et al. [287] and Arrouays et al. [286]
    recommended using the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM at 90 m resolution.
    The main reason for recommending SRTM was its availability and reasonable resolution
    considering the number of pixels generated (about 18 billions). Of course, there
    are now more accurate DEMs available from other RS products, including Lidar for
    the most accurate ones (e.g., [288,289]). DEM derivatives have proven to be very
    efficient as covariates in DSM at different resolutions and area sizes, from field
    to national scales in France (e.g., [138,139,140,144,145,259,272,290,291,292,293]).
    The integration of DEM derivatives at various resolutions has also proven to be
    useful in capturing different scales of variability (e.g., [141,144,272]). Note
    that in some cases, elevation replaces temperature or rainfall/snowfall. It is
    clear that relief attributes directly reflect or control many factors in soil
    evolution (e.g., temperature, slope, soil depth, erosion and deposition, and alluvial
    plains). Conversely, some changes in soil surface topography can be useful covariates
    to help detect rill erosion [224], landslides [294,295], or the swelling/shrinkage
    of clay soils (e.g., [194,296,297]). Note that, although French examples are not
    dominant in the literature (e.g., [76,129,144,201,202]), the automatic classification
    of landforms from DEM and other satellite imagery is one of the classical foundations
    of spatial segmentation, which is a technique often used for large-scale DSM (e.g.,
    [142,298,299,300,301]). 4.2.4. Parent Material Historically, information about
    parent material in DSM came primarily from digitizing geological or lithological
    maps, or soil maps in which the parent materials were described. This is still
    the case for many studies. However, RS products have proven their ability to detect
    and map certain parent materials through the spectral signature of outcrops, regolith,
    or upper soil, especially using airborne gamma-ray spectrometry. This has been
    shown in France in a large number of situations (e.g., [135,141,232,272,302,303,304,305]).
    Figure 7 shows four DSM predictions of topsoil texture [305] in a French department,
    using a large set of covariates and then adding a lithology map, or a gamma-ray
    spectrometry map, or both. It shows that gamma ray spectrometry captures some
    rather large spatial patterns linked to the parent material that were not captured
    by the lithological map. Figure 7. Red/green/blue composite of predicted soil
    textures (clay/silt/sand in g/kg) for the topsoil layer in the Mayenne department
    (France). White areas are cities. Comparison of DSM predictions using the following:

    maps; (Litho): the set A plus a lithology conventional map, (γ): the set A plus
    gamma-ray spectrometry maps; (all): all covariates. Extracted from Loiseau et
    al. [305]. This article was published in Geoderma Regional, 22, Loiseau T., Richer-de-Forges

    from Elsevier®. Copyright Elsevier (2020). Applications of RS to detect typical
    parent materials or mineralogy are quite common in tropical environments (e.g.,
    [109,306]). 4.2.5. Age According to Chen et al. [21], age is the least-used covariate
    for medium- and large-scale DSM. It is a rather complicated covariate to interpret
    because it mixes the duration of weathering and pedogenesis (both its duration
    and the various climatic and vegetation conditions in which soil formation occurred).
    Overall, age is quite difficult to infer directly from RS data. Where soils have
    developed from the underlying parent material, the age can be inferred from lithological
    or geological information (see Section 4.2.4). However, to our knowledge, there
    are no RS sensors that are capable of capturing age at the pedogenesis time span.
    For shorter periods, time can be captured through land-cover change history or
    other types of measurements. Although we did not find any soil studies using gamma-ray
    spectrometry or other tools to measure the erosion/sedimentation rates in French
    soils, some works suggest that this technique may have potential for detecting
    change related to nuclear accidents (e.g., [307,308]). 4.2.6. Soil Management
    Practices In the “o” factor or the SCORPAN model, all organisms are included,
    although in most cases, “o” is represented only by vegetation indexes or biomass-related
    vegetation characteristics such as NPP. Among the organisms that have a major
    effect on soil properties and changes, one of them is obviously humans, through
    their impact on soil management practices. We refer here to a recent review by
    Bégué et al. [309], which emphasizes that the potential of RS to characterize
    cropping practices is not yet optimal, and that the new generation of high-resolution
    sensors (space, wavelength, and time) should allow for the improved characterization
    of cropping practices. In another review, Bégué et al. [310] stated that “less
    than 10% of the publications on remote sensing and agriculture actually focused
    on cropping practices” in the previous decade. In their 2018 review, they distinguished
    between three broad groups of cropping practices ([309], Figure 1): Crop succession
    (i.e., the sequence of crops or fallows in consecutive years at the field scale);
    Cropping patterns (e.g., temporal sequence and spatial arrangement of crop, fallows,
    and landscape features in a particular land area); Cropping techniques (e.g.,
    irrigation, organic amendment, crop residue management, tillage, harvesting, duration
    of bare soil, grazing of moving cattle feed, and implemented on a piece of land).
    It is beyond the scope of this study to detail all the sensors, indices, and data
    they listed in their review to detect all these soil management practices. Figure
    8 shows the main cropping practices reviewed by Bégué et al. [309]. Figure 8.

    © Bégué et al. with permission of the authors. One of their main conclusions is
    “the majority of the studies are exploratory investigations, tested at a local
    scale with a high dependence on ground data, involving one remote sensing sensor
    at a time, and are constrained by local knowledge and conditions”. However, they
    pointed out the high potential related to the increasing availability of RS data
    suitable for fine resolution and time-scale monitoring (e.g., Sentinel 1 and 2,
    hyperspectral sensors, Lidar) and the combination of different satellite sensors
    [311,312]. Research should therefore be conducted to better map these soil management
    practices. One of the major difficulties was obviously related to the low spectral,
    spatial, and time resolution. Another outstanding question is what type of information
    derived from RS should be considered as a covariate for DSM? There is probably
    not a universal answer to this question; it may depend on the case, area, or soil
    property. Nevertheless, we believe that this essential information will be incorporated
    into future DSM and will provide major advances in soil knowledge. First, it will
    better filter out some information that is often considered “noise” for some DSM
    predictions (e.g., soil roughness or dead vegetation residues for SOC). Second,
    it will provide critical information on the controlling factors of soil changes
    on the local and landscape scales. Such quantified information may include, but
    is not limited to, crop rotation [179], grassland management [313], spatial arrangement
    of crops and land use, linear features such as hedges or drips [314], soil water
    regimes and their consequences on SOC inputs and salinization, etc. Indeed, a
    large field of research is still open in order to find the right RS soil management
    and cropping practices to incorporate in the DSM covariates. A major difficulty
    could be the diversity of situations in which we will approach large-scale studies.
    A preliminary large-scale delineation of “agrarian” regions could be a solution,
    as suggested by Bellon et al. [315]. Furthermore, this typically “multi-scale”
    RS challenge may benefit from data fusion of different RS data at different wavelengths,
    resolutions, and revisit periods. Finally, from the perspective of local soil
    management and security, this is really crucial, because it can fill the gap between
    DSM and local farmers and actors, as crop and soil management practices are indeed,
    a very local way that farmers can try to improve soil conditions [316,317]. 5.
    Use of Remote Sensing to Design the Sampling Strategy for DSM When RS products
    are available and relevant in a target area, and if we assume that the SCORPAN
    model for DSM is efficient, it seems logical to optimize the soil sampling design
    based on covariate space, and thus to use for designing the sampling, RS products
    alone or with other covariates. This may be especially useful if the number of
    soil measurements/observations is constrained. This has led some authors to propose
    that soil sampling is designed in terms of covariate space. One of the seminal
    articles in this technique is the constrained Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS)
    proposed by Minasny and McBratney [318]. The cLHS sampling in the presence of
    covariates is designed to select a limited number of sites in an area. According
    to Minasny and McBratney [318], “This kind of sampling should produce a reasonably
    efficient way of sampling soil and its environment so that the range of conditions
    are encountered, ensuring a good chance of fitting relationships if they exist”.
    The last words of this quote, i.e., “if they exist”, are very important to consider.
    A strong assumption of cLHS is that the selected covariates represent the variability
    of the target variable. In other words, if a controlling variable is missing from
    the set of covariates, the sampling design has a high probability of missing part
    of the variability of the target property. The main advantage is to optimize the
    number of samples and thus the sampling effort and cost to capture the main combinations
    of the covariate feature space. One of its weaknesses is that it is not well suited
    to some spatial modeling techniques, such as geostatistics and kriging [131].
    This is because cLHS, in its process of selecting sampling points, maximizes the
    feature difference between sampling points. The residuals of the predictions obtained
    after modeling using a cLHS sampling for calibration, can, however, be analyzed
    by geostatistics or other validation techniques, on the condition that an independent
    validation set is available (see an example in Figure 9, left). Note that in the
    figure extracted from Minasny and McBratney [318], they just use the stratified
    sampling design as an example compared to cLHS. Figure 9. Example of the location

    Various adaptations of cLHS proposed by different researchers consider accessibility
    and cost, or better space filling (e.g., [319,320,321]). Space filling has the
    advantage of not missing situations that could be under-represented by clHS. If,
    for example, a large area is characterized by similar combinations in the feature
    space, it might be under-sampled, even if it contains a soil variability that
    is not captured by the covariates. Wadoux et al. [322] recently studied sampling
    design optimization for soil mapping with random forest, and concluded that cLHS
    sampling performed worse than other sampling designs. It should be noted that,
    in their study, the subsampling design was based on a preliminary selection of
    an existing set of sample sites that was already a mixed sampling design, i.e.,
    subsampling a regular grid using a method close to cLHS, and with known results
    (LUCAS Soil, [323]). In other words, the spatial coverage of their learning full
    sample was already rather efficient, and some covariates had already been used
    to locate the samples in the grid. Note that the idea of exploring the cLHS method
    using covariates on a dense set of already sampled points was also tested by Loiseau
    et al. [141], who concluded that it was efficient at highlighting situations that
    were under-sampled in the original soil legacy dataset. Briefly, they tried to
    predict topsoil particle size distribution using various DSM techniques and a
    set of covariates. When applying cLHS to the covariates, they found that the initial
    dataset missed some covariates combinations, which explained why some areas had
    a bigger uncertainty, or even a bias, in the predictions. Another interesting
    characteristic of direct RS prediction is that it can be used as a dataset to
    simulate the spatial distribution of a soil property and thus be used to simulate
    different validation sampling strategies in spatial or feature space (i.e., [132])
    and highlight their advantages and limitations. This kind of direct prediction,
    if accurate enough, can also help test different sampling strategies for the training
    dataset. This test on sampling strategies was conducted by Lagacherie et al. [131]
    in order to assess their impact on the accuracy of the prediction of topsoil clay
    content in Tunisia. In particular, they showed that stratified random sampling,
    which is often recommended for soil map validation [137], could lead to inconsistent
    results if the number of strata and/or the number of random samples taken in each
    strata were not large enough. For a recent synthesis about sampling in DSM, see
    Brus [137]. 6. Limitations and Challenges In this section, we focus on the main
    limitations of RS products for soil mapping and monitoring and some challenges
    to improving the quality and relevance of RS imagery for soil. 6.1. Using RS Products
    to Predict Soil Properties The use of RS measurements as a substitute for soil
    analyses is a way to increase the density of soil information at a low cost. However,
    this surrogate often remains difficult to obtain with satisfactory accuracy and
    broad spatial coverage. With respect to accuracy, work remains to be conducted
    to better distinguish the effects of different factors on the spectral response
    of a soil property. A typical example can be taken for mapping SOC using the spectral
    signature of bare soil. A large number of limitations include, for example, the
    following: How do we discriminate bare soil from vegetated soil, e.g., what NDVI
    threshold should we use? Which unmixing method should we use for partly vegetated
    pixels? How do we distinguish bare soil from soil covered with dead vegetation
    residues? Additionally, what threshold should we use? How do we take into account
    the complex effects of different soil properties at a given time/location (e.g.,
    vegetation, residues, moisture, roughness, SOC, and clay or lime content)? How
    do we extend the coverage of bare soils? Mosaicking is now well developed, but
    what time period should we take? What are the limitations related to mosaicking?
    How can we take into account the fact that different dates are usually associated
    with different situational conditions (e.g., moisture and roughness)? In many
    cropped regions, more and more soil will no longer be bare due to the implementation
    of cover crops and/or seeding under a vegetative cover. How do we take advantage
    of various RS products and sensors, depending on their resolution (in space, time,
    and spectral domain), remoteness and related perturbing factors? At the field
    or farm-scale, responding to these questions may imply using several RS sensors.
    For example, using UAV RS enables the selection of the most adapted dates to obtain
    bare soil imagery together with minimizing the perturbing factors of soil spectral
    data. This is, however, not feasible for broad-scale monitoring. The effect of
    some perturbing factors may also be studied using airborne imagery. Thus, studies
    comparing laboratory spectra, proximal sensing, UAV, or airborne data to satellite
    imagery, should be conducted in order to estimate/reduce the errors due to changes
    in spectral resolution/remoteness and to improve the criteria for selecting the
    relevant satellites data (e.g., [324,325,326]). 6.2. Most RS Products Only Capture
    Topsoil Information Almost all DSM attempts show that the prediction performance
    decreases with depth (e.g., [21,259]). This is easily understandable because most
    RS products only capture information about the soil surface and/or terrain attributes
    at the time of acquisition. For example, it is physically impossible to detect
    deep soil attributes with visible–near infrared RS data. Some products, however,
    have the capacity to integrate a response over a less limited depth (radar and
    gamma-ray). Therefore, one challenge is to better incorporate different sensors
    that are capable of obtaining information at different depths into the DSM framework.
    Other information than bare soil spectra can be useful to map soil properties
    at depth. Gamma-ray spectrometry data, however, comes mainly from low elevation
    airborne sensors, which are not yet available in many parts of the world. Magnetic
    surveys are most often used for detecting soil pollution (e.g., [327,328,329]).
    They may also, however, reveal lithology, weathering, and water regime of soils
    (e.g., [330,331,332]). Yet, to our knowledge, there are no studies using airborne
    magnetic data as covariates in DSM. Another challenge is to integrate some soil
    knowledge into the DSM. For example, it is well known that in many cases, soils
    are organized in topo-sequences or “catenas”. This is the case of erosion catenas
    from a plateau to a gentle slope. At the top of the eroded portion of the catena,
    one can obtain information about deeper horizons present on soils developed on
    the plateau, as these underlying horizons may have been exposed at the surface
    by erosion. The same inferential information can be incorporated into DSM in the
    case of steep slopes, where outcrops can provide information about the parent
    soil material. In this case, a sampling design based on topo-sequences and available
    high-resolution RS imagery can be very efficient (e.g., [333]). This type of integration
    of soil knowledge into the DSM is not trivial because it requires a soil scientist
    to know the soil spatial organization and the scales involved in order to incorporate
    such information into the DSM. In some cases, these rules are described in conventional
    soil maps, and a challenge is to take them into account to disaggregate complex
    soilscape map units into more precise classes (e.g., [146,147,334,335,336]). Finally,
    a solution often chosen to address the limitations of bare soil RS and to obtain
    information on some deep soil properties is to incorporate other RS data, such
    as vegetation indices or land-cover changes, as covariates in a DSM model (see
    Section 4.2, and further, Section 7.2.2). At the global scale, Padarian et al.
    [337] recently used a semi-mechanistic model combined with an MODIS time series
    of changes in land cover to model changes in the global SOC stocks from 2001 to
    2020. Though this approach is still not perfect, because it does not take into
    account climate change and some inherent soil properties, it provided an estimate
    of the global losses of SOC stocks, mainly due to the conversion of forests to
    cultivated lands. 6.3. Relative Permanence of Soil Properties and Revisit Time
    for Soil Monitoring In Section 2, we described the relative permanencies of soil
    properties. One question is how these relative permanencies relate to current
    and future satellite revisit times. Indeed, it is a great advance that satellite
    revisit times are becoming shorter, especially with some of the commercially available
    data products with multiple weekly flybys. Some applications might expect us to
    be able to deliver soil information corresponding to this time span. The challenge
    is the number of cloud-free days due to weather conditions, especially in the
    northern or mountainous regions of France. Even when there are no clouds, we may
    be confronted with shadow effects, and the topographic image corrections may not
    be accurate enough to monitor mountainous regions. Another challenge is dealing
    with the observed spatial and temporal heterogeneity that is inconsistent with
    our understanding of the relative permanence and natural variability of soil properties.
    Finally, how do we translate this into effective sampling designs for soil monitoring?
    At field or farm-scale levels, UAV imagery helps design more efficient field sampling
    designs for monitoring, especially for SOC. It can also increase the density of
    observations in space and time and help to select the relevant soil signals and
    filter/correct some perturbing factors. One challenge is to combine detailed surveys
    and RS products (from proximal sensing to UAV, airborne, and satellite data) in
    order to better calibrate the models obtained by hyperspectral and high-resolution
    satellite sensors and better design and optimize field sampling. A final challenge
    is to make a clear distinction between what the changes in carbon storage and
    the changes in carbon sequestration are [179,215,260]. A promising way, at least
    for topsoil, could be to relate soil spectra to pools of SOC with different residence
    times. Several studies have shown the potential of laboratory Vis–NIR and MIR
    spectroscopy for an efficient estimation of SOC fractions, SOC monitoring, and
    modeling (e.g., [338,339,340]). To our knowledge, the feasibility of upscaling
    this kind of relationship to RS data needs to be assessed. This may increase the
    usefulness of RS to map and monitor SOC pools. 7. Main Progresses, Perspectives,
    and Prospects 7.1. The Increasing Availability of Remote Sensors and of Their
    Spatial, Spectral, and Temporal Resolution over Time Taking the first Landsat
    satellite (1972) as a starting point, the last fifty years have been characterized
    by the launch of an increasing number of Earth observation satellites with different
    spatial coverages and resolutions, spectral bands, and revisiting times. Meanwhile,
    a large number of airborne spectral sensors have been tested on smaller spatial
    coverages in order to explore or simulate the potential of new sensors, to obtain
    faster images and shorten revisit times. These technological advances have improved
    the DSM in several ways: The increase in spectral range and spectral band resolution
    has led to a drastic increase in the number of soil properties that can be predicted
    using RS (e.g., [43,107,341,342,343,344,345]). The increase in spatial resolution
    allows the mapping of increasingly fine spatial distributions of soil properties
    and their controlling factors (e.g., [325,343,346]). Shorter revisit periods allow
    for the better detection of changes in soil properties over shorter time periods
    and better capture of soil management effects (e.g., [347,348,349,350]). Increasing
    the number of RS products over time allows both the design of composite products
    and a shift from static mapping to monitoring certain changes (e.g., [128,326,351]).
    Merging data from RS products generally provides better predictions than using
    a single RS product (e.g., using a time series to increase both the prediction
    accuracy and map coverage [352], using synergistic information to retrieve soil
    information [353] or fusing products to increase both spatial and temporal resolution
    (e.g., [354,355,356,357])). Several missions with high signal-to-noise ratios,
    high spatial resolution, but limited coverage per day have been launched recently:
    the Italian PRISMA (PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, launch
    22 March 2019, 30 m; [358,359]), the German EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis
    Program, launch 1 April 2022, 30 m, [360]), and the Japanese HISUI (Hyperspectral
    Imager Suite, launch 5 December 2019, 30 m; [361]). The Italian–Israeli SHALOM
    (Spaceborne Hyperspectral Applicative Land and Ocean Mission, launch 2024, 10
    m [362]) is also expected to be launched soon. In addition, some global mapping
    missions are planned or under study for the coming years, with variable spatial
    coverage and different ground sampling distances, such as the former HyspIRI mission
    [363,364] and the Sentinel-10/CHIME (Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission
    for the Environment) satellite proposed as an ESA candidate mission [365]. This
    wide range of satellites will represent a major step toward multi-resolution and
    multi-precisions soil mapping. Virtual satellite constellations (LANDSAT/S2, PLANET,
    EarthDaily…) are promising tools for the future. One of the challenges is to harmonize
    the data because the sensors, acquisition conditions, and even the processing
    chains are different. 7.2. The Increasing Importance of RS Data in DSM The trends
    we have observed and the future of RS in DSM can be schematically divided into
    the following two categories: The use of RS products as surrogates for in situ
    measurements. The incorporation of RS products as covariates for DSM. In this
    section, we summarize the main conclusions that can be drawn from this review.
    7.2.1. Use of RS Products as Surrogates for In Situ Measurements As developed
    in Section 3.4., and already highlighted by Lagacherie and Gomez [240], in some
    cases, “the estimations of soil properties at each pixel of a hyperspectral image
    is assumed to be precise enough to be considered as a measurement of a soil property
    and to be used as such for feeding DSM models”. The huge advantage of these situations
    is that the spatial sampling is much denser than what is usually available for
    the soil data to train DMS models. A better coverage of spatial soil variability,
    especially short-scale variability, which is often not captured by existing soil
    data, can be expected. Moreover, there are still large spatial gaps in the available
    soil information to run DSM models around the world [13]. Therefore, these myriad
    surrogates for in situ measurements pave the way for both filling gaps in learning
    data and revealing finer spatial structures. These surrogates have proven to be
    efficient for some soil properties in the case of airborne hyperspectral imagery
    (e.g., [124,126,132,240,282]). However, we need to consider that these surrogates
    have uncertainties, and that the relationships that enabled the estimation of
    these surrogates should not be applied outside of their domain of validity. This
    is a big challenge, as soil data are still missing in large parts of the world.
    7.2.2. Incorporation of RS Products as Covariates in DSM We have seen that RS
    products can be used as covariates in DSM models (see Section 4.2). This is primarily
    because many RS products not only reflect soil surface properties, but can provide
    spatiotemporal information about two categories of information that can be used
    in DSM. RS products can provide information on the controlling factors of soil
    formation and changes. This is particularly the case for vegetation indexes, which
    provide indirect information about SOC inputs to soils. Conversely, soil moisture
    and temperature products can provide indirect information on the mineralization
    rate of SOC. Land cover and changes in land cover are related to different soil
    outputs and inputs that can influence pH, C and N cycles, nutrients, and possible
    sources of contamination. Airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy can provide information
    on the soil depth, presence of peats, soil weathering, and the nature and mineralogy
    of the parent material, or help better map clay content and/or mineralogy. The
    high-resolution DEMs derived from RS are essential to capture the different scales
    of soil processes and soil erosion/redistribution in the landscape at different
    scales. They are also very useful information for water redistribution and thus
    water regimes. One big challenge with the multiplication of RS imagery is to conduct
    the right selection of covariates to avoid overfitting and respect the parsimony
    and relevance principles in DSM. Several ways of selecting covariates have been
    proposed and cited in this review. We must keep in mind that among the criteria
    used for selecting covariates and/or aggregating them in synthetic ones, we should
    take into account not only parsimony and redundancy, but also their meanings in
    terms of soil science. Conversely, another big challenge of DSM and data-driven
    modeling is to use them as knowledge discovery tools that may reveal or help with
    the understanding of new soil processes at various scales. In other words, RS
    and DSM are not only tools that can extend the spatially statistical relationships
    established on a set of leaning variates; they should also be able to discover
    new soil processes. Although still underutilized, information on soil management
    practices at the field level is probably one of the most promising covariates
    with the development of hyperspectral sensors with high spatial and temporal resolution.

    Abstract Agriculture is considered a significant climate change (CC) driver due
    to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the loss of fertilizers that contribute
    to water eutrophication. On the other hand, climate change effects are already
    impacting agriculture, endangering food security. This paper explores the dichotomies
    of the effects of agriculture on CC as well as of CC on agriculture, focusing
    on the contribution that nanofertilizers can bring to this complex system in both
    directions. The strategies to reduce CC while adapting and mitigating its effects
    must be a global effort. It is not possible to focus only on the reduction in
    GHG emissions to stop the effects that are already being felt worldwide. Nanofertilizers,
    especially slow- and controlled-release nanofertilizers, can reduce the nutrient
    input and also boost productivity while mitigating some CC effects, such as soil
    nutrient imbalance and agricultural emissions. As so, this review highlights the
    benefits of nanofertilizers and their role as a part of the strategy to reduce
    the reach of CC and mitigate its ever-growing effects, and presents some guidelines
    for the increased use of these materials in order to enhance their efficacy in
    this strategy. Keywords: controlled-release nutrients; emission reduction; nanofertilizers;

    essential to feed the world’s population, which is projected to reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 [1]. It is also essential for the production of many resources that are
    essential in several economic activities [1]. Agriculture contributes to Climate
    Change (CC) but is also affected by CC [1]. Consequently, agricultural production
    has to adapt and evolve in order to maintain the necessary ability to provide
    food and resources. Agriculture accounts for 10% of the European Union’s (EU)
    GHGs and 11% of the USA’s GHGs [1,2], being responsible for CO2 and non-CO2 emissions
    of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) generated by crop, livestock activities,
    energy, and fertilizer use [3,4]. Combined, N2O emissions and CH4 emissions from
    enteric fermentation account for more than 80% of total agricultural GHG emissions.
    The slight reduction of 2% registered in the EU’s agricultural GHG emissions from
    2005 to 2021 is not enough [1]. The United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDG) urges our societies to produce and consume goods in more sustainable
    ways, while the European Green Deal sets that all sectors shall contribute so
    that, by 2050, we shall achieve climate neutral economy. In addition, European
    Climate Law goes further, setting the target of reducing net emissions of GHGs
    by at least 55% (compared to 1990) by 2030 [5,6,7]. Therefore, agricultural activities
    are facing a huge challenge to change the cycle of intensification due to chemical
    fertilizer use that ultimately increases emissions, contributing to CC. Intensive
    agriculture and heavy fertilizer use are also related to losses of nutrients to
    water bodies, causing high concentrations of nutrients and, in the end, eutrophication
    [1]. Although not directly linked to climate change, this may result in a series
    of disturbances in the aquatic ecosystem [1]. The effects include shifts in the
    composition of flora and fauna, which in turn affect habitats and biodiversity,
    cause the depletion of oxygen in the water, and reduce water quality [1]. Additionally,
    intensive agriculture can contribute to land degradation, soil salinization, the
    decline in genetic diversity in crops and livestock, and the use of large amounts
    of water [8]. On the other hand, by this time, agriculture is already one of the
    economic sectors with the largest CC effect stress, and the increased demand for
    food supply adds even more pressure to the production chain [8]. The climate is
    changing, heating rapidly due to human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change (IPCC) states that the average global temperatures have increased
    by 1.2 °C since 1880, while all the projections point out that warming beyond
    1.5 °C can have irreversible and permanent consequences for humanity. As GHGs
    contribute more than 2/3 to global warming, CO2 concentrations are very concerning,
    and they are at their highest level ever [9,10,11]. Global warming and CC are
    increasingly affecting ecosystems around the world, causing natural resource depletion,
    melting of glaciers, ecosystem changes, increased climate extremes, land degradation,
    freshwater scarcity, biological invasions, loss of biodiversity, acidification,
    and subsequently, impacts on human life [10,11,12,13,14]. All of these represent
    management and policy challenges [15,16]. The susceptibility of a system to be
    affected and to be unable to cope with CC adverse effects is defined as vulnerability
    to CC. It is a consequence of a multitude of factors, such as climate exposure,
    the magnitude of expected CC, ecological sensitivity, and adaptive capacity [15,16,17].
    The world needs to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture and adapt its food-production
    system to cope with and reduce vulnerability to CC [1]. Strategies for GHG reduction
    include climate-smart farming methods, run-off reduction, and methods to boost
    crop resistance, all of which can be achieved by the use of nanofertilizers [18].
    Fertilizers are chemical or natural substances that provide nutrients to plants.
    Nanofertilizers also provide nutrients to plants, but in a much more efficient
    way. According to Robert Mikkelsen [19], there are three classes of nanofertilizers:
    nanoscale fertilizers, nanoscale additives, and nanoscale coatings. These classes
    are characterized as nanomaterials containing nutrients, traditional fertilizers
    with nanoscale additives, and traditional fertilizers coated or loaded with nanoparticles,
    respectively. Manjunatha et al. [20] present some potential nanofertilizer designs,
    such as slow-release, quick-release, specific-release, moisture-release, heat-release,
    and pH-release nanofertilizers, and the ISO also defines controlled-release fertilizers.
    In the slow release, the nanocapsule slowly releases nutrients over a long, specified
    period of time by hydrolysis, biodegradation, limited solubility, and/or other
    mechanisms, meeting crop requirements and reducing the number of fertilization
    applications and the amount of fertilizer used, while increasing nutrient use
    efficiency (NUE) [20,21,22,23,24]. The quick-release nanofertilizers refer to
    a design where the nanoparticle shell is shattered when it comes in contact with
    a surface, while in the specific-release design, the shell breaks apart upon contact
    with a specific chemical or enzyme. In the moisture-release fertilizer, the degradation
    of the nanoparticle and the nutrient release is due to the presence of water.
    In the heat-release design, the nanofertilizer is released when the temperature
    exceeds a set point, and in the pH-release design, the release is dependent on
    the specified pH conditions. As for the controlled-release nanofertilizer, it
    is defined as a design in which nutrient release is controlled, releasing nutrients
    at a known rate and according to the stated time to meet crop requirements [20,24].
    For this review, the data were primarily obtained by research papers in the Web
    of Science, Science Direct, MDPI, Frontiers, and Springer databases, complemented
    by governmental and relevant international institutions’ publications; this review
    highlights the benefits of nanofertilizers, their role as a part of the strategy
    to reduce the reach of CC and mitigate its ever-growing effects, and presents
    some guidelines for the increased use of these materials, in order to enhance
    their efficacy in this strategy. 2. Agriculture as a Driver of Climate Change
    Agriculture is a significant contributor to anthropogenic global warming and CC,
    caused by multiple climate pollutants, mainly CO2, CH4, and N2O [1,25,26]. These
    GHGs are released by farming activities but also by storing, processing, and other
    related activities in the food chain [1]. It is important to observe that there
    are significant differences between CO2, N2O, and CH4, since the first is a stock
    pollutant, and the last two are mainly flow pollutants with less persistence in
    the atmosphere [26,27]. While the main focus is predominantly on the direct agricultural
    emissions that are dominated by CH4 and N2O [26], it is also important to look
    at indirect emissions. Indirect agricultural emissions and environment pollution
    arise from farm machinery, fertilizer production and utilization, use of pesticides,
    and deficient irrigation strategies, contributing to the total estimated GHGs
    [28]. Current agricultural practices are focused primarily on boosting yield and,
    consequently, use large amounts of fossil energy to produce mechanical energy,
    fertilizers, and other chemicals [29]. The soil surface is a part of the climate
    system, and it is involved in the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P)
    cycles [30]. Therefore, the total global GHG emissions from agriculture, including
    farming (10–12%), land use (6–17%), agri-related chemical production and distribution
    (4%), and farm operations, including irrigation (0.2–1.8%), is quite high (20.2–34.8%)
    [28,31]. 2.1. Nitrous Oxide (N2O) Emissions Although its contribution to GHG emission
    is smaller than other gases, N2O has 273 times the global warming potential of
    CO2 and 109 years of atmospheric lifetime [32]. It was estimated that agriculture
    accounts for 27% of global N2O emissions, and this will increase by 35–60%, accounting
    for 16% of total non-CO2 emissions by 2030, even though this may be underestimated
    [29,33,34,35,36]. Numerous complex and interacting factors influence N2O emissions
    in crop systems [35,37]. The most important to be mentioned are fertilizers, mostly
    N fertilizers [38,39]. The increase in N2O emissions from agricultural soils is
    due to increased N content from fertilizers and the growth rate of its use to
    meet growing agricultural demand, combined with the consequent growth rate of
    crop residues [35,40]. The excess of fertilizer use contributes to the buildup
    of inorganic nitrogen in soils, which results in greater leaching and denitrification
    when inefficient N utilization, over-doses, or non-synchronized mineral fertilization
    occurs [41]. The available N is not completely taken up by the plants and is subject
    to microbial turnover processes that produce nitrous oxide. Inorganic fertilizer
    has a greater contribution than ammonia-based N sources, such as urea, when applied
    in unfavorable conditions such as wet, cold, and water-logged soils [28,37]. The
    excess N is responsible for imbalances in the N cycle, leading to associated increases
    in environmental risks, including intensification of emissions, soil acidification,
    biodiversity losses, and risks to human health [41]. Moreover, environmental and
    management factors such as climate, soil characteristics, the cultivation system,
    tillage, crop rotation, and operation timing are determinants of soil N2O production
    [42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. The use of tillage contributes to organic matter
    breakdown and accelerates the release of N2O [28]. Other indirect sources of N
    are volatilization and atmospheric deposition of ammonia and nitrogen oxides from
    fertilizer and manure application onto agricultural land, coupled with the result
    of surface run-off and leaching (Figure 1) [35,51]. Figure 1. Nitrogen cycle,
    in [51], under Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY). As a staple food
    for millions of people around the world, rice cultivation is a special case of
    attention. Water-logging and soil texture must be considered, since they are key
    factors conducive to N2O emission. In water-logging conditions, Panchasara et
    al. [28] found that the peak N2O emissions occurred when soil pore space was 70%
    filled. As there is no technology for N2O removal from the atmosphere, it is important
    to avoid N2O emissions, which can be achieved by proper fertilizer management
    [29]. Improving fertilizer formulation, release, and placement can reduce N2O
    emissions by delaying nutrient delivery to the roots and increasing plant uptake
    and use efficiency [29]. EPA [35] points out that a 20% reduction in fertilizer
    use could potentially achieve 46% of emission mitigation in croplands, and, combined
    with no-tillage cultivation practices, it could represent 80% of global emission
    reduction potential [35]. 2.2. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions It is not simple
    to quantify CO2 emissions from food systems, due to the complex processes involved
    and the difficulty in applying sectoral boundaries [26]. However, it is admitted
    that a small portion of agricultural CO2 emissions occurs directly from agricultural
    production, resulting from urea application and liming. A larger portion is the
    result of indirect energy-use from agricultural operations, such as the use of
    fossil fuel by machinery, CO2 emissions from land-use change and from input utilization
    (e.g., fertilizers), production, and transportation [26,52,53]. A huge amount
    of fossil fuel energy is used to produce fertilizers, with concomitant large CO2
    emissions [54]. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for crops and livestock production,
    and the majority of P fertilizers are derived from mined rock phosphate (80%),
    which requires large quantities of resources and energy [55,56,57]. According
    to the Institute for Industrial Productivity [58], ammonia (NH3) manufacturing,
    in 2011, contributed 1–2% of worldwide CO2 emissions. Carbon dioxide is the most
    important GHG, having multiple years of atmospheric lifetime [32]. Besides fossil
    fuel energy, obtaining hydrogen from hydrocarbons to produce ammonia is an important
    source of CO2 and CH4 emissions [54]. As N fertilizer is the most used worldwide,
    and all synthetic N fertilizers are derived from ammonia, this comes with a cost
    [54]. Ocean acidification is another negative and very concerning consequence
    of the increase in CO2 release, since about one-quarter of the total CO2 emitted
    is dissolved in the oceans, where it forms carbonic acid and decreases surface
    water pH [59]. These modifications impact the capability of shell formation and
    the survival capacity of many marine species at a global scale, since ocean acidification
    occurs all around the globe [59]. On the other hand, soil can act as a carbon
    sink, and it is estimated that it could sequester between 0.4 and 6.8 Gt CO2 year−1,
    values that could be enhanced by the improvement in fertilizer use efficiency
    and the application of other best management techniques and practices [60]. The
    route to reducing CO2 emissions from crop production can be traversed by changing
    to green energy production, but decreasing fertilizer needs and improving the
    efficiency of fertilizer use may also have some reduction potential [26]. 2.3.
    Methane (CH4) Emissions Methane is a greenhouse gas that has proximally six times
    the global warming potential of CO2 and 12 years of atmospheric lifetime [32].
    The emissions of CH4 are due to numerous cropping practices, such as the application
    of fertilizers, as described before; soil incorporation of crop residues; the
    quantity of organic material available to decompose; cultivation of high organic
    content soils; inappropriate irrigation practices; and livestock waste management
    [28,35,61]. The growing demand for animal and agricultural products induce growing
    animal and agriculture waste and, consequently, increases the rate of CH4 emissions
    [28,40]. The anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in water-logged fields
    depletes the oxygen present in the soil and water, and produces CH4 from the decomposition
    of soil organic matter via methanogenic microorganisms [35]. Due to the great
    importance that rice cultivation has, this is also a considerable CH4 source.
    It is estimated that rice cultivation will account for 4% of total non-CO2 emissions
    by 2030. A 30% reduction in the utilization of fertilizers in rice crops could
    account for a potential reduction of about 12 MT CO2eq [35]. The improvement in
    efficiency in agricultural practices and a shift to sustainable consumption patterns
    can contribute to reducing methane emissions [1]. 2.4. Nitrogen and Phosphorus
    Flows to Terrestrial Biosphere and Water Bodies Global warming is not the only
    consequence of agricultural activities. Nutrient pollution results from livestock
    and crop production, and although P and N are essential to crops, the use of synthetic
    fertilizers greatly impacts terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems [62,63]. Human
    activities cause pressure on N and P cycles, causing imbalances and producing
    more reactive forms of nutrients. Besides run-off from excess fertilization, the
    increasing amount of N2O in the atmosphere can suffer re-deposition in the soil,
    leading to soil acidification and further water contamination [54,64]. Although
    soils act, to some extent, as P reservoirs for future crops, the excess fertilization
    could lead to long-term legacy P [63], particularly as it is predicted that global
    mineral P inputs will increase from 7.5 to 12.5 Tg year−1 from 2005 to 2050 values
    [63,65,66,67]. The excess of nutrients is, in this case, lost in run-off water
    or by leaching and percolation to the groundwater by the lack of assimilation
    capacity of the crops [59,68,69]. According to the FAO [70], 20% of the applied
    N accumulates in the soil and biomass, and 35% ends up in the ocean. These lost
    nutrients accumulate over time, contributing to the proliferation of algae and
    aquatic plants in rivers and lakes. Globally, an area of 240,000 km2 is affected
    by oxygen depletion due to fertilizer-induced eutrophication [70]. N and P run-off
    from farmland and pastures is the leading cause of eutrophication [71] and, ultimately,
    is leading marine and aquatic systems to cross their ecological limits [59,63,72,73].
    Eutrophication is responsible for poor water quality, impacting drinking water
    quality, increasing the treatment demand, and posing a threat to animal and human
    health [72,73,74]. Li et al. [75] conducted an extensive scientific review where
    it was concluded that eutrophication is responsible for freshwater’s increasing
    CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. Not only is it estimated that shallow lakes in a
    eutrophication situation emit nearly 50% more methane when compared to lakes with
    no eutrophication, but the large amount of N can also lead surface waters to shift
    from being N2O sinks to emitters [75]. The implementation of practices optimizes
    the circular economy and the efficient use of fertilizers, as their appropriate
    timing, rate of delivery, and placement can boost crop production, reduce losses
    and environmental impacts, and ensure food security by reducing the dependency
    on scarce resources [63,76]. An overview of how agriculture impacts climate change
    is presented in Table 1. Table 1. Agriculture as a driver to climate change—overview.
    3. Climate Change Effects on Agriculture To meet the increasing Human need for
    food, crops require the proper environment to grow. The impacts of CC are already
    being felt, not only by agriculture, but also by fisheries, aquaculture, and in
    forest production [1,11]. Furthermore, GHG emissions will have an impact in the
    years to come, reducing the quality of air, soil, and water, and aggravating climatic
    effects on yields [11]. In general, the effects of global warming will increase
    air, soil, and water temperatures. Air temperatures aggravate the melting of glaciers,
    endanger coastal agricultural land, and could extend growing seasons in several
    areas, which might require more irrigation, increasing the demand for groundwater
    and the depletion of water resources [77]. Soil temperature increases organic
    matter (OM) mineralization, reduces soil capability to capture CO2 from the atmosphere,
    lowers the uptake of nutrients by the plants, and reduces microbial activity,
    water holding capacity, and soil particle size, leading to constraints in cationic
    exchange capacity while increasing soil evaporation and salinization and/or sodicity,
    leading to more pressure on water requirements [77]. The increase in air and soil
    temperatures combined impacts several biologic processes, such as seed germination,
    plant emergence and growth, root extent, and fruit maturation [78]. Water temperature
    influences fish stock distributions, and alterations could result in the appearance
    of invasive species, which endangers habitats and water quality [1,4]. Extreme
    climatic events, such as droughts and heavy rain, will exacerbate many global
    warming effects, such as soil erosion, depletion of soil nutrients, increased
    run-off, lower soil water reserves, and alteration of soil properties such as
    pH, which is essential for nutrient availability to the plants [77]. Adding to
    that, the great surface N2O deposition from the atmosphere will induce acidification,
    adding up to the nutrient imbalances in the soil [54,64]. Changing temperatures
    and rainfall patterns are conducive to the expansion of pests and diseases, alter
    plant biological cycles and pollinator activity, and increase food security risks
    [79,80]. 3.1. Temperature and Rainfall Patterns Increasing air, soil, and water
    temperatures impact agriculture and biota. With regard to air temperatures, besides
    the direct impact on food production, it has a cumulative effect with other derived
    effects from CC, such as Earth’s hydrological cycle [81]. It increases evaporation,
    causing over-drying effects in some areas, and also results in more storm events
    in other areas, leading to the disruption of several natural processes that affect
    plants and animals. In the latter, it could result in higher precipitation and
    even flood risk [81]. The intensification of glaciers melting due to global warming
    endangers coastal agriculture, but in high latitudes and in the short term, it
    could be a drought-resilient source of water [82]. At first, melting glaciers
    help mitigate water stress downstream, supplying water for agriculture and human
    consumption, but in the future, this is not a sustainable water source, and ultimately,
    it will lead to harmful environmental and ecological consequences as the glacier
    shrinks and the water supply diminishes [82,83,84]. Glacier melting also contributes
    to the rising sea level and, being associated with global warming and the increase
    in sea temperature, results in an increase in salinity from 1 to 33% in coastal
    agricultural land over the past 25 years [77]. Sea level rise and storms can also
    cause soil erosion and agricultural area losses, and further intensification of
    saltwater intrusion [77]. IPCC [11] states, with moderate confidence, that in
    the last 50 years, Human-induced global warming has been responsible for slowing
    down the agriculture productivity in the areas located in low and mid-latitudes
    [11]. Although warmer air temperatures can extend growing seasons in several areas,
    such as large parts of northern Europe, it can also require more irrigation, increasing
    the demand for groundwater and further intensifying the stress over water resources
    [1,77]. Southern Europe is located in an area that will suffer from more frequent
    extreme heat and water stress in summer months, and is already experiencing severe
    heat waves. There, higher temperatures and reductions in water availability are
    already reducing crop productivity. To overcome these, some crops might be cultivated
    when it is possible later in the autumn or winter [1]. Plants respond to high-temperature
    stress in various ways, altering physiology, biochemistry, and gene regulation
    pathways [85]. Usually, heat stress is not an isolated variable, and plants often
    suffer from drought and/or salt stress at the same time [85,86]. Nonetheless,
    it has its own effects on plants that depend on species and genotype and has wide
    variations [85,86]. Furthermore, plants have biological limits related to maximum
    temperatures that can be tolerated [87]. Higher air temperatures accelerate phenological
    development and abbreviate each growing stage; while the metabolic activity of
    plants increases, transpiration rates are intensified, and the yields are reduced
    [88,89,90]. Most plants (which include cotton, wheat, rice, barley soybeans, sunflower,
    potatoes, and vegetables) use a one-step process called C3 pathway to fix C via
    the Calvin Cycle. In the face of increased temperature, these crops suffer an
    intensification in photorespiration that leads to a lower net photosynthetic rate
    [90]. The C4 plants (such as corn, sugar cane, maize, millet, sorghum, pineapple,
    and flowering plants) have two steps in the process, resulting in higher efficiency.
    Therefore, for the foreseen higher temperatures, C4 crops present more tolerance
    than C3 [91]. Some plants (permanent crops) require a specific number of chill
    hours to break dormancy, and with higher mean average temperatures, these crops
    could be forced to extend their crop cycles, leading to higher irrigation requirements
    [90,92]. Pollination is key for crop productivity all around the world, and the
    effects of warmer temperatures and changing precipitation patterns can induce
    mismatches between the earlier flowering and harvest dates and the pollinators’
    hatching time [1,80,93]. These newly imposed conditions are prone to pest and
    disease proliferation, reducing crop yields even more and contributing to food
    security risks [1,94]. Air temperature influences soil temperature, which is crucial
    for crop production. Therefore, global warming is responsible for soil temperature
    increase in recent years and can compromise yields around the world [95,96]. The
    dynamic of air/soil temperature is also relevant as it influences the energy flux
    from the soil [78]. Despite its importance, studies about soil temperature increase
    and its effects on soil properties as well as on crops are scarce. Nonetheless,
    they reveal some important information. In the last 10 years, studies show that
    soil temperature across the United States (US) suffered an alteration of +0.32
    °C, whereas records in China report a 1.9 °C amplification in 50 years (1961 to
    2011), and in Germany, reports are for a ≈1.8 °C increase in 67 years (1951 to
    2018) [78,97,98,99]. Soong et al. [100] used a model to simulate and predict the
    global mean soil temperature increase for the end of the century, and the results
    show the same rate of warming in the subsurface and at 100 cm depth. Additionally,
    2.3 ± 0.7 °C and 4.5 ± 1.1 °C were found for Representative Concentration Pathways
    (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. The IPCC RCPs describe different 21st century
    scenarios of GHG and air pollutant emissions and atmospheric concentrations, in
    addition to land use. RCP4.5 refers to an intermediate scenario, while RCP8.5
    refers to a very high GHG emission scenario [95]. Although asymmetric, the results
    show soil warming worldwide and cause alarm, considering that an increase of 2.3
    °C in 100 cm soil depth is critical for ecosystems, numerous soil processes, and
    crops’ growing phases [99]. Among these effects are seed germination, plant growth,
    root extension and development, and fruit maturation, which are affected by both
    soil and air temperature as well as by the dynamic between air and soil temperatures
    [78,98,101]. Change in soil temperature also influences soil moisture content,
    water-holding capacity, and soil particle size. Increasing the temperature at
    the soil surface raises the evaporation rate and the mineralization rate of soil
    organic matter, and impairs the soil’s capacity to sequester C [102]. It constrains
    the movement of water and impairs water holding capacity [102,103]. Increased
    soil temperature can also reduce clay size and organic matter content, causing
    lower cation exchange capacity [104,105] while increasing soil salinization, especially
    in arid and semi-arid climates [103]. Nishar et al. [106] mimic soil warming by
    studying thermal sites and found that higher soil temperature decreases root biomass
    and retarded vegetation regeneration. The authors found that higher temperature
    is correlated with low soil moisture, pH, and an imbalance in soil chemistry.
    These results were also found by Jiao et al. [107] when studying soil temperature
    coupled with increase aridity and reduction in precipitation. The authors reported
    that the soil from more arid and warmer ecosystems presented lower soil organic
    C and total N and P, provoking imbalances in C/P/N ratios. In these conditions,
    C/P and N/P ratios decrease while C/N increase, negatively affecting the provision
    of nutrients to the plants and possibly leading to impaired plant growth and yield
    production [107]. Water temperature is rising and, coupled with air temperature,
    is contributing to rising sea levels. A direct consequence is flooding coastal
    areas with saltwater and gradually contaminating the soil with increased salt
    content [108]. Additionally, all species have a preferred temperature range to
    live in and a limit that cannot be crossed under the penalty of annihilating the
    species from the ecosystem [109]. In lakes and reservoirs, water temperature is
    also responsible for chemistry alterations, such as the amount of dissolved oxygen,
    whose reduction depletes water quality and alters natural processes. The higher
    amount of soluble salts present in the water can directly injure roots, reducing
    water and nutrient uptake. Poor water quality is responsible for slow plant growth,
    unaesthetic yields, and in the worst cases, crop death [110]. Evaporation is exacerbated
    by air and water increase temperatures, making native species more susceptible
    to competition and disease [109]. 3.2. Extreme Climatic Events Extreme climatic
    events will exacerbate the effects of global warming and are already affecting
    global food production. Extreme climatic events cause food insecurity and economic
    losses as droughts, floods, wildfires, and marine heatwaves impact and impair
    food availability [11]. Droughts occur in most climatic zones, but some areas
    are most susceptible to them. For instance, in the Mediterranean area, large increases
    in temperature, as well as longer drought periods and extreme rainfall events,
    are already impacting production and are forecasted to worsen in the next decades
    [11,111]. Longer, dryer, and hotter seasons will require more irrigation in vast
    areas, and have been found to significantly decline crop productivity [11,112,113].
    Global warming has increased aridity, and global drought areas are expanding due
    to decreased precipitation and an increase in evaporation processes, exacerbating
    land degradation, desertification, and nutrient imbalances in soil [107]. Nutrients
    suffer different extents of decoupling, and C, N, and P responses to drought could
    result in severe C-N-P imbalance and ultimately lead to crop and biodiversity
    loss [107]. Additionally, Sardans and Peñuelas [114] establish that drought effects
    can be more important on P uptake than on N uptake, decreasing the adjustment
    of P uptake efficiency and triggering reductions in plant storage, which can further
    affect N/P ratios [114,115]. Additionally, heavy precipitation events will contribute
    even further to soil erosion, increase agricultural run-off, and cause depletion
    of soil nutrients and alterations to soil properties, leading to a net loss of
    farmland [77,116]. Mean rainfall reduction causes serious consequences in soil
    salinity that are spreading, and it is estimated that more than 50% of global
    farmlands will be salinized by 2050 [117]. Salinization affects the environmental
    quality, nutrient cycle, and agricultural productivity via osmotic stress and
    ion toxicity [118]. Osmotic stress is a short-term effect caused by the reduction
    in osmotic potential between root and soil solution resulting from Na+ and Cl−
    uptake, which reduces water availability [119]. Ion toxicity, however, affects
    crops when Na+, Cl−, or SO24− are in very elevated concentrations and affect nutrient
    uptake, reducing crop development and yields [120,121,122,123]. Some studies point
    out that CC, specifically alterations in temperature and rainfall, will influence
    other soil properties, such as pH, due to increased acidification of soil. This
    will occur because extreme rainfall events contribute to the leaching of basic
    cations from the soil exchange complex into surface and groundwater, transferring
    alkalinity and then leaving acidified soils [124]. As a critical variable, pH
    affects several conditions in ecosystems, impacting nutrient and toxic elements’
    bioavailability, root physiology, and rhizosphere microorganisms [107,125]. 3.3.
    GHG Besides global warming, increasing GHG concentration in the atmosphere can
    directly affect agriculture [126]. As observed before, in high concentrations,
    N2O can suffer volatilization and re-deposition, contributing to soil acidification
    [54,64]. Increased methane concentration leads to increasing surface ozone (O3)
    concentrations which can be absorbed by plants, reducing photosynthesis and growth
    while increasing their sensitivity to diseases, resulting in compromised crop
    yields [4,11]. Higher surface O3 concentration leads to stomatal uptake of O3
    into the leaf’s interior instead of normal direct plant surface deposition, causing
    crop damage [127]. Stomatal uptake of O3 is strongly dependent on stomatal opening
    and closing and concomitant environmental conditions [128,129]. Thus, the closure
    of the stomata, caused by several factors, such as CO2 concentration increase,
    reduces the uptake of O3 and its damage [130]. On the other hand, higher CO2 also
    enhances photosynthesis, which could impair O3/CO2 relationships in crops [131].
    Besides the increase in photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance reduction,
    CO2 reduces plant transpiration, improving water and light use efficiency [132].
    However, the extent of the improvement effect of CO2 on crops is also influenced
    by factors such as water and nutrient availability, diseases, or pest presence
    [90]. Under higher atmospheric CO2 levels, C3 plants are more efficient in using
    ammonium as an N source in comparison to C4 plants [133], having a more relevant
    increase in productivity due to the fertilizer effect on photosynthesis [91,134,135].
    However, under drought conditions, C4 crops may have an improved benefit from
    CO2 increase [91]. According to Hinsinger et al. [125], CO2 concentration buildup
    can result in a decrease in rhizosphere pH by the formation of carbonic acid in
    the rhizosphere and may dissociate in neutral to alkaline soils, altering the
    bioavailability of nutrients. An overview of how climate change impacts agriculture
    is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Climate change effects on agriculture—overview.
    4. Agriculture Potential for Reduction According to the FAO [70], the principal
    measure to mitigate pressure on aquatic ecosystems is to impose a limit on the
    export of nutrients at the farm level. Agricultural run-off can be diminished
    in three general ways: source control, process control, and end treatment. In
    the first case, the aim is to decrease the application of nutrients through the
    better application of fertilizers, which is allied to conservation tillage and
    meticulous irrigation practices [136,137,138]. Controlled-release fertilizers
    are found to have a great contribution to agricultural run-off control and, coupled
    with no tillage, can achieve a N and P run-off reduction of more than 60% [139].
    Process control uses technologies such as ecological ditches to effectively reduce
    or eliminate the contaminants in the run-off, using the principle of a surface-flow-constructed
    wetland [140,141,142]. Finally, end treatment is the last possibility to reduce
    the impact of run-off. Drainage systems, buffer bands, and constructed wetlands
    are common examples of end-treatment technologies [143,144]. The limits to its
    mitigation could be accomplished by policies and incentives such as taxes and
    subsidies [70]. Tradeable rights for every kg of nutrient surplus, such as N surplus
    permits, are more representative of environmental impacts than nutrient inputs
    as they consider several chemical forms [145,146] and can be more cost-efficient
    in addressing eutrophication [147]. Other, more traditional regulatory instruments,
    such as water quality standards, pollution discharge permits, mandatory best practices,
    and others, are still vital to reducing agricultural pollution [70]. The potential
    of environmental impact reduction for agricultural emissions involves the decarbonization
    of energy production, the use of the best available practices, the implementation
    of precision agriculture practices and climate-smart farming techniques, the improvement
    of irrigation management practices, better fertilizer usage practices for the
    improvement in NUE [1,26,28,35,148], as well as the retrieval and reprocessing
    of resources [63]. All the pointed-out options come with constraints, from technical
    challenges to economic cost, or from farmer’s acceptance to political constraints;
    nevertheless, to comply with the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement and
    Green Deal, all sectors must take measures to decrease their emissions and negative
    impacts [26,149]. Despite the great volume of GHGs that agriculture emits, better
    integration of innovative techniques into production methods, more efficient application
    of fertilizers, and better manure management can effectively reduce its weight
    [26]. Reducing agricultural emissions and nutrient loss from fertilizers could
    play a significant role in climate change mitigation [26,150]. In Ahmed et al.’s
    study [151], it is observed that “variable rate fertilization”, “controlled-release
    and stabilized fertilizers”, and “improved fertilization timing” represent important
    technical GHG mitigation potentials of 176 MMT CO2e, 65 MMT CO2e, and 40 MMT CO2e,
    respectively. Moreover, in the top 15 measures recognized by the global agriculture
    marginal abatement cost curve, “Reduce nitrogen over application in China and
    India” could contribute to reductions of 88 Mt CO2e, and “expand adoption of controlled-release
    and stabilized fertilizers” could contribute to reductions of 75 Mt CO2e. Furthermore,
    rice cultivation is highlighted with “improve fertilization practices” potential
    to contribute to reductions of 449 Mt CO2e, and “improve paddy water management”
    could contribute to reductions of 296 Mt CO2e. Nonetheless, all this comes with
    a cost [151]. 5. Reducing the Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture The level
    of impact that crops are subjected to can be diminished by altering agricultural
    practices, acknowledging the effects of CC, and adopting climate-smart farming
    practices and technologies. The alteration of crop rotation to meet water availability,
    the adjustment of sowing dates, the protection of pollinators, and the usage of
    resilient crop varieties, can make a huge difference in mitigating yield loss
    [1,152]. Other practices that can be widely applied are the systematic use of
    climate forecasting tools, plant cover crops, improved methane recovery from organic
    residues, and improved NUE and plat resilience. The use of smart fertilizers,
    such as slow-release fertilizers, controlled-release fertilizers, and nanofertilizers
    (including controlled-release nanofertilizers and slow-release nanofertilizers),
    to deal with nutrient imbalances and losses to the environment is a viable option
    [153]. Moreover, irrigation practices need to continue to shift to precise application
    practices based on real-time information and crop vegetative indexes, avoiding
    over-irrigation and, ultimately, nutrient run-off [4]. However, although these
    can be effective measures, the IPCC brings to attention the fact that it is not
    enough and cannot prevent all changes related to CC, and that the reduction in
    GHG emissions is fundamental [11]. 6. Nanofertilizers as Mitigation and Adaptation
    Strategy Nutrient management is pointed out as one of the effective measures to
    be taken both to reduce agriculture impact in CC and to mitigate the effects of
    CC in agriculture. As such, fertilizer production and utilization must be considered
    carefully. Nanofertilizers, as a new and improved fertilizer option, contribute
    to the reduction in nutrients needed and to its incremented use efficiency [154].
    Several studies point to the effectiveness of nanofertilizers in crop production
    and account for the improved nutrient management achieved by its use, even in
    unfavorable conditions, such as in salinity soil [155,156,157,158,159]. Due to
    nanofertilizers’s unique properties, their use is noted as a promising strategy
    to solve land quality degradation, low crop productivity under abiotic stress,
    nutrient deficiency in plants, nutrient imbalances in soil, and nutrient leaching
    losses [160,161]. A greater surface area exhibited by materials at the nanoscale
    results in a larger reaction surface, aiding the occurrence of metabolic reactions
    in plants, including higher, slower, and more adequate nutrient uptake, as needed
    by crops [156,162,163,164,165,166,167]. Several release mechanisms are possible
    with the use of these materials, such as target delivery and slow- and controlled-release
    mechanisms, responding to environmental triggers and biological demands. Das et
    al. [154] achieved nutrient savings and crop improvements by pre-treating seeds
    of beetroot, carrot, fenugreek, and mustard, with nano-iron pyrite (FeS2). Soaking
    the seeds for only 12h in an aqueous suspension of nano-iron disulfide/pyrite
    (FeS2) resulted in a significant yield increase in all crops under study. At maturity,
    beetroot presented a 47% yield increase; carrot presented a 19% increase; mustard
    obtained a 65% increase in the seed yield; and fenugreek crop achieved a significant
    increase in leaves per plant, leaf area, and average chlorophyll concentration
    [154]. For tomato, the application of 8 g L−1 of silica nanoparticles (nSiO2)
    significantly enhanced seed germination potential, achieving a seed germination
    percentage improved by 22%, mean germination time improved by 4%, seedling vigor
    index improved by 508%, seed germination index improved by 22%, seedling fresh
    weight improved by 117%, and seedling dry weight improved by 117%, when compared
    with control [168]. Tarafder et al. [169] used urea-modified hydroxyapatite and
    incorporated copper (Cu2+), iron (Fe2+), and zinc (Zn2+) nanoparticles to use
    in a field experiment with lady’s fingers (or okra). The dose of nanofertilizer
    applied was 100 times less than the conventional fertilizer and resulted in a
    significant increase in Cu2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+ nutrient uptake as a consequence
    of slow release. Enhanced vegetative growth, flower number/plant, photosynthetic
    pigments, and yield were also found in common bean plants when a combination of
    zinc oxide (ZnO), Manganese dioxide (MnO2), and molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanoparticles
    was supplied to the crop via foliar application [170]. Furthermore, although not
    linearly correlated to concentration, all the foliar applications of nanofertilizer
    had a significant induced improvement in nitrogen, copper, manganese, potassium,
    zinc, and phosphorus uptake [170]. Another interesting discovery resulting from
    the application of nanofertilizers was made by Abdel-Aziz et al. [155], who, besides
    obtaining higher yield in wheat using nano-chitosan–NPK, also observed the acceleration
    of plant growth, resulting in a reduced life cycle (40 fewer days), which can
    be an advantage concerning irrigation requirements in CC conditions. As abiotic
    stresses are a major concern for crop production and are exacerbated by CC, the
    nanofertilizers’ positive results found in salt stress and high-temperature stress
    conditions are a breakthrough finding. Under salt stress conditions, Wahid et
    al. [157] found that green synthesized silver (Ag) nanoparticles had a positive
    effect on wheat survival and development by positively regulating numerous metabolic
    traits such as seed germination, antioxidant, amino acid, potassium, and nitrogen
    content [157]. Furthermore, in these conditions, the foliar application of nano-silicon
    (Si) in peregrine by Ashour and Mahmoud [171] also reflected enhanced plant weight,
    number of branches, leaves per plant, and higher leaf area. Under high-temperature
    stress, plants suffer declined pollen germination, seed set, and seed yield percentages
    [172]. In a study where high temperature (38/28 °C) and optimal temperature conditions
    (32/22 °C) were compared, selenium (Se) nanoparticle treatment in grain sorghum
    aided in alleviating the stress effects on the crop. Using 10 mg L–1 Se nanofertilizer
    via foliar application, the authors verified enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity
    that resulted in a stimulated antioxidant defense system, improved the pollen
    germination percentage (14%), and thus significantly increased seed yield (26%)
    under high-temperature stress [172]. As nanofertilizers can provide controlled
    or slow-release nutrients according to crop demand, they could also contribute
    to the synchronization of macro and micro nutrients, achieving better balance
    in soil and synergetic effects for crops [166]. Thus, soil properties and health
    are also improved as nanofertilizer can release nutrients at a slower rate than
    conventional fertilizers, opposing nutrient imbalances, contributing to better
    soil fertility and organic matter content, amending problems in soil structure,
    and contributing to food quality and safety [161,173,174,175,176]. Besides evident
    crop and soil benefits, the use of nanofertilizers can reduce GHG emissions to
    the atmosphere, not only by the reduction in input for the same result, but also
    by reducing soil emissions after nanofertilizer use as demonstrated by Mohanraj
    et al. [177]. In their study, the authors applied nano-zeolite-based nanofertilizers
    carrying NO3− or NH4+ forms of N in rice soils and evaluated N2O and CH4 emissions
    compared to the control. The results showed that, although not having the same
    effect, both nanofertilizers reduced emissions when compared to control. The lowest
    N2O emissions were recorded for nanofertilizer-NH4+ (0.88 mg m−2 day−1, compared
    to 1.67 mg m−2 day−1 of control, which was the highest recorded), and the lowest
    CH4 emission was obtained by nanofertilizer-NO3– (13.6 mg m−2 day−1, compared
    to 14.5 mg m−2 day−1 of control and nanofertilizer-NH4+), which suggest that the
    better release of nutrients achieved by the nanofertilizers contributes positively
    to crop NUE and to the reduction in soil emissions [177]. Despite the uncertainties,
    good nutrition boosts crop resistance to abiotic stress, but furthermore, the
    nanofertilizer formulations can include biostimulants that can promote crop health
    and resilience (Figure 2). Nanofertilizers can also improve the ability of plants
    to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) by increasing photosynthetic efficiency. At the
    same time, the use of nanofertilizers can contribute to improved yields and reduce
    emissions from soil, confirming the IPPC [153] statement that nanotechnology is
    a very promising advance in technology that contributes to plant health and improves
    crop resilience against several risks, including CC. Figure 2. Nanofertilizer
    benefits to crops under abiotic stress due to CC. As revealed, the utilization
    of nanofertilizers can have advantages in reducing the effects of the CC/agriculture
    dichotomy, but to actually achieve some level of relevance, its use must be more
    effective and widespread. Nonetheless, these materials have some limitations to
    their use as public acceptance, safety assessment methods, exposure levels, and
    other possible nano-toxicological effects on the environment and human health
    that are not yet perceived. To overcome these concerns, a greater investigation
    into the properties and biological reactivity of nanomaterials must be carried
    out, and specific regulatory policy must be produced, as well as specific safety
    testing guidelines [178,179,180]. To increase the widespread safe application
    and concomitant efficacy of nanofertilizers in reducing agro-related CC and CC
    effects in agriculture, some guiding principles should be followed: The materials
    to be used in nanofertilizers must be studied for their safety. A good example
    is to use the ones that have already been proven to have high biodegradability,
    high biocompatibility, and decreased cytotoxicity, such as the ones studied for
    medical devices or resulting from green synthesis; Nanofertilizers should be studied
    and applied to specific crops in order to eliminate the nano-phytotoxicity effect
    in a fit-to-purpose, precision application; When available, commercial nanofertilizer
    formulations should be chosen over traditional ones, increasing yields, improving
    soil conditions, and reducing emissions; The commercially available nanofertilizer
    options must be increased to become a viable and consistent alternative for producers;
    The inclusion of biostimulant substances in the formulations should be considered
    in order to increase crop resistance and resilience. The encouragement to increase
    nanofertilizer improvement and utilization can arise from policy. Establishing
    limits for synthetic fertilizer allowed per ha/crop or economic benefits for the
    utilization of new fertilization forms could be a strategy to create change. Alternatively,
    the market is already promoting change as the cost of conventional fertilizers
    increases and the demand for more efficient options rises. 7. Conclusions and
    Perspectives This paper addressed the dichotomy between agriculture and climate
    change, referring to the questions raised by agricultural activities that produce
    effects on CC and, on the other hand, the effects and consequences that CC has
    on agricultural activity. Climate change is negatively impacting agriculture,
    and the need to provide food for the world’s growing population results in the
    pressing need to intensify this activity. Ultimately, this also adds pressure
    to agricultural systems and thus exacerbates climate change. To mitigate the effects
    of this dichotomy several actions can be taken, including the decarbonization
    of energy in all sectors of the economy, the effective reduction in GHG emissions,
    and the change in cultural practices, including the adoption of climate-smart
    practices, which comprise a more efficient use of nutrients and the careful and
    efficient use of water resources through the change in irrigation techniques.
    Due to their physicochemical characteristics, nanofertilizers present some potential
    applications to combat the increase in CC and mitigate the effects that are already
    in place. The reduction in inputs and nutrient loss is a truthfully appealing
    fact. Thus, the effect on soil nutrient imbalance and the reduction in soil emissions
    due to the application of nanofertilizers are compelling arguments for their utilization.
    To increase the efficacy of nanofertilizers in the adaptation and mitigation of
    the agriculture/CC dichotomy effects, some guidelines were formulated from the
    increased number of research studies for fit-to-purpose nanofertilizers to eliminate
    nano-toxic concerns for crops and humans, as well as the increment of commercially
    available nanofertilizers options, to create a viable alternative for producers
    to use. In conclusion, the increase in nanofertilizers brings several benefits,
    and they are viable assets for the adaptation of agriculture to CC effects and
    to mitigate agriculture contributions to CC. Author Contributions R.S. contributed

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) 1. Introduction Nowadays, several municipalities
    implement the smart city model [1] to improve the quality of life for their citizens
    and the efficient use of city resources. Intelligent services can decrease operational
    costs and resource expenditure in smart cities. They can enhance performance and
    operations in a wide variety of smart city applications (SCAs) including transportation,
    healthcare, energy, education, and many more. Smart services are provided by various
    cutting-edge technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples of these technologies
    include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data analytics,
    and robots. IoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful
    human life benefits [2]. IoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart
    things into urban environments where innovative services are offered to support
    every activity at any time and from any location [2]. Things are monitored by
    IoT applications that make direct decisions for their efficient management. Moreover,
    things state their conditions, such as battery status and fault reporting for
    prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state of the infrastructure
    and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices can also obtain physical
    environment information such as temperature. In a CPS, the computation, networking,
    and physical processes are put together to control and monitor the physical environment
    of a smart city [4]. In smart cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical connections
    between the virtual and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can be
    sustained by the ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform
    for computation and IoT data storage [5]. FogC offers reduced latency, greater
    mobility, location awareness, streaming, and real-time response for SCAs [6].
    Smart cities have dispersed vast numbers of sensors, and thus large-scale data
    processing requires a complex infrastructure. Robotics in the cloud can be an
    effective computing tool for IoT applications that require a lot of data processing
    [7]. To improve the services offered by smart cities, big data analytics is employed
    to generate intelligent and optimal temporary and lasting decisions [8]. The abovementioned
    technologies are used to implement numerous smart city services [9,10]. For instance,
    intelligent transportation services are applied to improve route planning and
    avoid jamming in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety and
    make possible self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart traffic
    light controls are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy
    management and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids
    and smart buildings. These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable
    energy. Additional smart services are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges,
    tunnels, water networks, train and subway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural
    health monitoring is also feasible using smart services [11]. Last but not least,
    there are smart services that focus on monitoring the environment, public safety,
    and security of citizens [12]. All these smart city services necessitate a reliable
    networking infrastructure to efficiently exchange messages between the modules
    of a smart city system implementing a particular smart service. In particular,
    smart city services need a variety of networking and communication technologies
    for their completion because they are proposed for dissimilar scales. For example,
    smart services for smart buildings must be implemented based on Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
    or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols. On the other hand, smart services
    for the smart grid must be mainly implemented using the WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) network
    protocol. From another viewpoint, smart city services can exploit dissimilar network
    and communication models and solutions. Until now, the networking and communication
    components of smart city systems have received little research attention. To the
    best of our knowledge, a comprehensive survey of network architectures and protocols
    for IoT applications in smart cities does not exist and is the goal of this study.
    The communication and networking issues involved in smart city systems are examined
    in this study. This paper considers networking technologies, topologies, and communication
    requirements for such systems. It also examines if current network protocols are
    appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent developments
    in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active area, this paper
    is important to support new research in this field. The paper contributes as follows:
    It presents network requirements of the major SCAs including intelligent transportation,
    smart buildings, pipeline monitoring and control, smart water networks, smart
    grids, and manufacturing control and monitoring. It reviews networking architectures
    used for the above applications focusing mainly on the protocols’ suitability.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;
    Section 3 presents network requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;
    Section 4 and Section 5 analyze protocols and network architectures for smart
    grids, smart buildings, smart water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart
    transportation; Section 6 summarizes the paper, while Section 7 provides open
    research directions; lastly, Section 8 concludes the paper. Figure 1 provides
    the layout of the survey. Figure 1. The layout of the survey paper. Systematic
    Literature Review Article Selection Method: We provide a Systematic Literature
    Review (SLR) methodology [13] with particular notice to studies related to networking
    architectures or protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. The SLR was employed
    to systematically study networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications
    in smart cities. We proposed a research question to cope with the key issues of
    networking architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart cities. Question
    Formalization: Key issues and challenges in the field were identified. Such issues
    were network architectures for IoT, network protocols for IoT, IoT applications
    for smart cities, and smart city applications. This study answers the next research
    question: RQ: What is the emphasis of networking architectures or protocols for
    IoT applications in smart cities? This question determines the number of studies
    focusing on network architectures and protocols for IoT applications for smart
    cities that have been published to date to emphasize its significance in smart
    cities. Article Selection Process: The article selection process is performed
    in three stages: Automated keyword-based search; Selection of the article based
    on the title, abstract, and quality of the publication; Elimination of inappropriate
    articles. In the first stage, the search process is automatically performed using
    searching on popular academic databases such as IEEE explorer, ACM, Wiley, Springer,
    Science Direct, SAGE, and Google Scholar. The following search string was defined
    by adding other spellings of the main elements to find relevant articles. The
    search string was as follows: (“IoT” OR “Internet of Things”) AND (“network architecture”
    OR “network protocol” AND “smart cities” OR “smart rural” OR “smart village” OR
    “smart traffic” OR “smart transportation” OR “smart street lights” OR “smart energy”
    OR “smart grid” OR “smart buildings” OR “smart home” OR “smart residence” OR “home
    automation” OR “smart water” or “smart waste management” OR “smart healthcare”
    OR “smart rural” AND “Cloud Computing” OR “edge computing” OR “software-defined
    networking” OR “Artificial Intelligence”). We found 264 articles from journals,
    conference proceedings, books, and patents. These articles were published between
    2013 and 2023. In the article selection based on the quality of the publisher
    stage, the search string was constrained by searching for conference papers and
    journal articles of IEEE, ACM, Sage, Wiley, Science Direct, and Springer, in order
    to guarantee that only high-quality publications and articles were selected for
    the review. Consequently, 240 articles were selected. In the third stage of eliminating
    the inappropriate articles, a Quality Assessment Checklist (QAC) based on [13]
    was developed, wherein those articles emerging from the initial search were refined.
    After reading the abstracts, we eliminated the unrelated articles. The entire
    body of the remaining papers was checked, and those which were not related to
    our concerned field were also crossed out. After eliminating inappropriate articles,
    only 226 studies were identified. 2. Smart City Applications This section discusses
    the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what type of assistance is
    needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs, their advantages and
    design problems were addressed. In the energy sector, SCAs are being used to increase
    the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of electric energy generation
    and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart grid is a new power grid system
    that automatically collects and reacts to available information about supplier
    and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply self-monitoring and superior
    control mechanisms for power generation and consumer demand, improving grid reliability
    and efficiency. CPS systems are also used to manage the process of producing renewable
    energy from wind turbines [15]. Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings
    to monitor and manage energy consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the
    buildings, including the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems;
    appliances; and lighting systems. Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep
    track of the current state of the environment and energy consumption, are typically
    included in smart building systems. A centralized monitoring and control system
    receives observations and measurements from these sensors. Based on reported observations,
    current operational circumstances, and environmental factors, the control system
    employs intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems employed in the buildings
    to optimize energy consumption. Intelligent transportation is another SCA that
    has attracted a lot of interest in the transportation sector. Applications related
    to vehicle safety are among the most crucial types of such applications. Vehicles
    can be equipped with a variety of safety features, such as blind spot monitoring,
    emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane change warning signs.
    To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-automatic operations.
    Real-time and reliability support in detection and response are these applications’
    most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing vehicle safety must be
    dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects such as threat observations,
    decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software cannot handle
    high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices and guarantee real-time
    and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial
    SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring
    equipment to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed
    data and intelligent software that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.
    Intelligent traffic light controls, which incorporate device monitoring across
    numerous locations to precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application
    of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent
    traffic lights. Water networks are maintained using smart city technology to increase
    their intelligence, efficiency, dependability, and sustainability. CPS systems
    are integrated into water networks to add smart characteristics to the processes
    of water distribution [19]. Offering early warning systems to identify problems
    in water networks is one of these duties. For instance, it is simple to identify
    leaks and pipe bursts. Quick, temporary fixes can be implemented to prevent water
    wastage and future network threats or damage [20]. WSN-based monitoring of greenhouses
    is another SCA. Such monitoring provides well-organized control for appropriate
    soil, climate, lighting, and water level in greenhouses [21]. Other smart city
    systems are deployed in the industry to automate, control, monitor, and improve
    manufacturing procedures [22,23]. Finally, smart-healthcare systems based on edge
    computing [24] are proposed to monitor and examine the physical health of users
    [25]. Figure 2 shows some important applications including smart traffic surveillance
    and management, smart healthcare, weather and air quality monitoring, smart waste
    management, smart street lighting, smart emergency response system, and smart
    home. Figure 2. Facilitating networking and communication amongst SCAs. Analysis
    of Smart City Applications/Systems This subsection analyses the SCAs shown in
    Figure 2. Smart Traffic Surveillance Systems: These systems are based on centralized
    processes and may fail due to networking problems. Thus, to automate such an innovative
    system, centralized and distributed methods must be used to maintain local servers.
    Javaid et al. [26] suggested a smart traffic management system using a mixture
    of centralized and decentralized processes to optimize the flow of vehicles on
    roads and an algorithm to manage a variety of traffic conditions efficiently.
    In the context of smart cities, effective traffic management implies that a decision-making
    model identifies and quantifies traffic congestion as well as predicts traffic
    patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered a theoretical analysis that takes into account
    such effective traffic management. Notably, existing decision-making models are
    primarily devoted to urban and highway traffic management, not considering the
    closed campuses and collector roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] identified this
    weakness and proposed an IoT-based system model that collects, processes, and
    stores real-time traffic data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based traffic
    management system, various challenges emerge. These challenges include security
    issues, extremely sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required
    adjustments, and specific information fields in the protocol header and structure,
    as well as higher costs. Smart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of
    health parameters, these systems are progressively being associated with and connected
    via the Internet to numerous types of available smart wearable sensing and computing
    devices. These systems face several problems [29] that must be resolved. A security/privacy
    perspective, inter-realm authentication, interoperability issues, device-to-device
    informal communication, and collection and management of medical data are among
    the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30] addressed issues related to cyber-security
    while using IoT for such applications. They sought to examine secure techniques’
    deployment and implementation from the perspective of preventing and reducing
    cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys and reviews [31,32] on smart
    healthcare applications tackle the problem of integrating IoT systems with any
    healthcare application particularly. Weather and Air Quality Monitoring Systems:
    These systems use environmental monitoring stations, which are extremely pricey
    to acquire and maintain. For example, these stations require engineers with specialized
    skill sets and data analysts. Therefore, it is impractical to deploy such monitoring
    stations densely. Instead, they are often deployed sparsely, which creates the
    problem of limited spatial resolutions for useful measurements. Lately, cheap
    monitoring sensors have evolved in the market, significantly assisting in refining
    the granularity of monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors
    [33] emphasized the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with
    air quality monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle
    with the issue of cross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.
    Moreover, these sensors are extremely susceptible to unexpected variations in
    humidity, temperature, and wind direction, and as a result, their accuracy deteriorates
    with time. A recalibration routine might be a way to maintain and enhance such
    accuracy. However, because it would take a lot more time and work, this technique
    is highly improbable and would not work for large-scale deployments. In a weather
    monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex and involves three steps [34]:
    (1) Observing: It can be performed by monitoring satellite imagery, precipitation
    reports, surface data, and gathering data from other nearby forecasters. (2) Forecasting:
    It can be performed by forecasters as short-term and long-term forecasting. Short-term
    forecasting is carried out by evaluating the current weather conditions and projecting
    them over the next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics of the weather.
    Long-term forecasting, however, is possible through weather (numerical) modeling
    and the projection of such modeling using computer simulations. To produce these
    simulations for future forecasting, these modeling techniques use environmental
    data from satellite photography, weather balloons, and surface observations. Following
    completion of the forecasting, the forecasters translate the produced simulated
    expected output into a perceptible format for non-specialists so that they can
    respond appropriately. (3) Communicating: Finally, they communicate such output
    or forecasted information to appropriate authorities. Despite the fact that all
    of these computer models are used to forecast the weather, the success of each
    one is largely influenced by three different elements: (a) the quantity of precise
    data; (b) the length of time needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity
    of dynamic atmospheric weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data
    for a region is the placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed
    distant from rural areas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather
    enough information for desert, sea, or even rural areas to supply the computer
    models used to predict weather conditions accurately. Forecasters also use satellite
    data to combat this issue. However, because of cloud cover and significant changes
    in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, satellite data accuracy can occasionally
    be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and map information or surface/land
    features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence, it further impacts temperature
    and precipitation values significantly. This further makes things harder for a
    computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there is a need to re-evaluate and
    re-modify such models’ mathematical equations so that they can predict the changes
    more accurately. Smart Waste Management Systems: Automated smart waste management
    is crucial for the following reasons: (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure;
    (2) thin or delicate waste collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective
    waste logistics management; (4) insufficient use of cutting-edge trash treatment
    and recycling technologies; and (5) lack of workers and specialists with the necessary
    technical and non-technical skills to handle garbage disposal and the associated
    infrastructures. Smart waste management schemes include various steps such as
    (1) waste collection; (2) differentiation of waste as per their biological and
    physical properties; (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage disposal
    infrastructures/treatment plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova
    and Porras [35] identified issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing
    data from smart deployed sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some
    operational issues such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure
    and smartly managing waste vehicle routes. Smart Street Lighting Systems: This
    system is a network-oriented solution that uses streetlights fitted with specific
    actuators and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities and connectivity interfaces
    [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a mechanism that
    gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting with
    the use of smart wireless nodes (fitted out with numerous forms of sensors and
    actuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the streetlights,
    and they are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device. Zanella et
    al. [37] insist that their system could assist in gathering environmental parameters
    such as humidity, air temperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors stated
    that optimizing street lighting efficiency is a paramount concern that must be
    addressed. This monitoring system makes it possible to maximize efficiency since
    it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity in response to the time of
    day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this system is simple and
    built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns that require
    particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions and communication
    among heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right light lamp is critical
    for a power-efficient lighting mechanism. Their selection is based on how effective
    they are in terms of power usage and lifespan. The existing metropolitan system
    relies on Metal Halide (MH) or High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs,
    these bulbs are frequently seen as being inefficient in terms of power consumption
    and requiring significant maintenance, which adds significantly to the cost. In
    addition, the system should be designed following the advised design standards
    (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201) [36]. Currently, there are
    three kinds of control systems for smart lighting systems in use: centralized,
    decentralized, and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a variety
    of security assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem
    thus far. Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and
    security of its residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention,
    dealing with natural calamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data
    collection is first and foremost important for the designing portion of these
    applications. Depending on the gathered facts, the development of intelligence
    (which aids in making important decisions) and the ability to respond swiftly
    and quickly are the issues that require special attention. When it comes to gathering
    data, we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated traffic sensors. A developer
    can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will conduct predictive
    analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore, this
    kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather significant information
    that will help the relevant authorities (e.g., the fire safety department, the
    police department, and law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and
    preventive measures. The concept of widespread surveillance has important benefits
    for security and safety. However, keeping track of such vast amounts of data also
    prompts a lot of worries and issues for designers and developers, including storage;
    the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and, most importantly, the question
    of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track of each individual
    (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether this kind of
    widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such as China and
    India, where a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation. Further, Gharaibeh
    et al. [38] claimed that combining information transmission technologies with
    well-implemented data analytics models is necessary for quick and swift collaboration.
    To save as many lives as possible during natural disasters, it is imperative to
    gather, assess, and communicate vital information to the relevant authorities.
    As a result, there is currently a lot of work being done to enhance the performance
    of information exchange systems. Although this system is based on the IoT concept
    and is relatively simple, it faces important problems that need consideration,
    such as complex networking solutions and information sharing across heterogeneous
    devices on time (time-sensitive application). Smart Residence/Home Automation:
    A smart home has highly developed systems such as a control system for devices
    or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems, TVs, and other smart appliances),
    automated door openers, smart appliances that may send users remote status updates,
    smart refrigerators, and washing machines. A user can control the majority of
    smart home appliances remotely with two recently produced gadgets: Google Home
    and Amazon Echo. In a smart home, the end-user demands a high-speed internet connection,
    so they can access networking sites that control the home with HD live streaming
    services. In contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to
    computing servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence,
    data management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to
    concentrate on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than
    just recommending distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38].
    The concept of smart home automation raises serious concerns about security and
    privacy risks. A smart home includes security monitoring systems with motion sensors,
    wirelessly opening smart door locks, televisions, phones, and other smart appliances
    that are highly outfitted with cameras and microphones. Although these gadgets
    improve the system, little research has been done on their privacy and security
    features. If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we will discover
    that their manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.
    Indeed, Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully
    examining Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market.
    They argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already
    more privileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated applications.
    As a result, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this, according to a published
    document by WikiLeaks [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the
    tools to access, control, and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the
    world. Furthermore, criminal entities and hackers could seize control of smart
    personal devices, capture delicate private information, and exploit that information
    immorally typically through user tracking and profiling. Additionally, a hacker
    may break into one of these smart applications, grab vital information, and then
    use it to launch any kind of attack. For instance, based on motion sensors, security
    camera feeds, and power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where and when
    to break into the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized
    parties, they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware
    and software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard
    against all these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators, etc.,
    are impervious to such security and privacy attacks. Smart Grid Networks: The
    functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirectional (i.e., electricity
    is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers). Electricity
    has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks to the
    deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in an open-loop
    fashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures in the
    distribution sector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little or no real-time
    knowledge of the system’s operating conditions and dynamically changing load.
    There are also several technical, economic, and environmental problems with this
    conventional approach. Therefore, this conventional system must become dependable,
    manageable, and scalable, as well as flexible, secure, and interoperable [42].
    The smart grid is the next invention of the Electric Power System (EPS) that incorporates
    quicker, more secure, and reliable communication networks [43]. Smart grids supplement
    the conventional electricity grid by incorporating renewable energy sources such
    as biomass, solar energy, and wind energy. These energy sources are much cleaner
    and more ecologically friendly than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil
    fuels. However, it is important to identify the most suitable communication technology
    for the smart grid’s successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s
    overall communication style is unique compared with conventional network communication
    patterns. The communication network architecture of the smart grid must be able
    to handle information exchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,
    and numerous smart meters in such a particular environment with little to no human
    intervention. This type of communication, called Device-to-Device (D2D) communication,
    is autonomous and may be initiated in response to an event or at regular intervals.
    Notably, depending on how these smart grid applications were built, their QoS
    requirements and characteristics differ greatly in terms of delay, burst size,
    and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement of a smart meter
    event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent grid networks,
    the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the same network present
    the issues of flexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications based on the
    smart grid can be developed and implemented using the current wireless and wired
    networking infrastructure and technologies. For some devices, such as smart meters,
    designing and standardizing acceptable smart grid-based protocols is a critical
    matter [45]. Furthermore, these smart grid-based networks are too dependent on
    intelligent sensors, actuators, and other devices. This makes them extremely vulnerable
    to attacks by malicious users. These smart grids could be taken over by malevolent
    users or hackers, who could then obtain unauthorized access to many smart meters
    and alter crucial data. Moreover, as the existing electricity system is insufficient
    for establishing smart grid systems, high-level adjustments to current power infrastructure
    scenarios are required. Subsequently, these smart systems require high installation
    costs because the installation requires a large number of smart meters, sensors,
    and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efficient operation of
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free
    network channel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent
    applications. Many surveys [42,43,44,45,47] reviewed communication frameworks
    for smart grids, smart-grid-based networking technologies, traffic management,
    and the requirements of numerous smart grid applications. Further, Kansal and
    Bose [48] presented their insights on transmission grid applications regarding
    their latency and bandwidth requirements. 3. Network Requirements for SCAs This
    section considers several communication requirements including reliability, delay
    tolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security, network type, heterogeneous
    network support, and mobility support. It also studies the aptness of different
    network protocols for dissimilar SCAs. Smart city services and applications need
    robust and dependable communication support as well as an effective networking
    infrastructure, which will permit competent message-sharing procedures among the
    components of the smart city systems [49]. Every smart city system has an intricate
    networking architecture made up of various networking components. Therefore, smart
    city systems are innately required to have a variety of networking requirements.
    To access the far-off destination, which may be clouds, the network traffic from
    a broad variety of deployed diverse applications uses a common networking architecture
    and resources. These resources may consist of switches, routers, communication
    connections (links), and other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing
    faraway clouds or far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently
    brings up problems with high packet loss probability, significant delay, and constrained
    network bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered
    when developing, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart
    cities. Otherwise, users would be reluctant to approve the use of such applications
    in the absence of adequate security safeguards. Such intelligent applications
    need a high-speed networking environment where the quick reaction may be managed
    with the support of the ability of a fast-processing speed. Furthermore, a variety
    of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city, based on their usefulness
    and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have different networking
    requirements, particularly in terms of response and security [50]. For example,
    the networking requirements of smart emergency response systems are quite different
    compared to other applications such as smart healthcare systems. Emergency response
    smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick to react [50]. In contrast,
    smart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily need to be especially
    dynamic. − Network Protocols: Monitoring applications for smart cities often use
    a dense network of heterogeneous sensor nodes, including fixed sensor nodes, mobile
    sensor nodes, and crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for
    Machines (LTE-M), extended coverage GSM IoT, and fifth-generation (5G) technologies
    [52] are intriguing options to support such heterogeneous networks. First, the
    bulk of crowd-sensing nodes (smartphones) is already supported by LTE communications.
    Consequently, no further wireless communication devices are required. To save
    energy, LTE and 5G can be utilized on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads)
    to allow the data gathered by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring
    center via base stations (the backbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.
    − Zigbee [53], WiFi, and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary
    nodes to communicate within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing
    the sensor node clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network
    connectivity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes
    maintenance simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies
    also make possible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance
    of real-time monitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance, can
    accommodate video streams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.
    The fast data rates provided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous for
    the sink nodes or clusters. The use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)
    in structural health monitoring applications of bridges, tunnels, or towers is
    fairly common. The cluster heads will be able to send the vibration data in this
    situation in real time. In conclusion, practically all applications for smart
    city monitoring that demand a high data throughput and minimal delay may be satisfied
    by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there are some new sensor node standards, such as
    IEEE 802.11 ah [55], LoRaWAN [56], and Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband
    protocols offer numerous advantages: greater coverage, improved scalability, reduced
    energy usage, and increased device longevity. Researchers have tested these standards
    in more than a few applications, including street lighting, energy metering, and
    home automation, even though some are still being discussed and revised. The new
    narrowband communication standards enable the sensor nodes to run more sustainably,
    which is beneficial for applications that aim for long-term monitoring. In addition
    to these protocols and standards, the FogC architecture [58] aids in monitoring
    smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile users (the potential crowd-sensing
    providers) and the cloud are connected via fog servers. These fog servers are
    WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users are more inclined to
    participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing measurements
    to the fog server in just one hop, significantly decreasing the cost and energy
    usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the
    FogC architecture, such as the nearby traffic conditions. The service latency
    and response time are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates
    directly from the fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone
    network. Lastly, using the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is crucial
    to getting the best possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and cost. The
    networks may be hierarchical so that diverse roles and functions can be assigned
    at various layers to increase the networks’ dependability and cost-effectiveness.
    As a result, certain nodes may be able to transmit data utilizing various protocols.
    − Bandwidth requirements: Many video applications in smart cities require high
    bandwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors capture video from the physical
    environment. Moreover, video transmission is more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional
    scalar data traffic in IoT. Examples of these applications are intelligent multimedia
    surveillance systems for home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring
    systems, traffic monitoring systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based
    monitoring of an environmental system. − Delay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart
    transportation, only tolerate a small amount of end-to-end delay. For example,
    to prevent imminent danger to the vehicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data
    that are being relayed must arrive within microseconds. Therefore, the control
    systems must react in time. However, other applications have a higher tolerance
    for delays [49]. Such applications rely on data monitoring and information gathering
    for upcoming analysis. − Power Consumption: Another crucial need for applications
    is power consumption. Smart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy
    sources can tolerate protocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45]. Other
    applications have medium power needs and require energy sources with limited capacities.
    One example of such an application is intelligent transportation. Other applications
    demand protocols with low or very low energy consumption characteristics since
    they have limited energy resources. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), smart water
    networks, and pipeline monitoring for gas and oil are a few examples of such uses.
    − Reliability: The majority of applications have medium reliability requirements.
    A typical example of such applications is smart water networks. Some other applications
    have high-reliability necessities such as intelligent transportation and smart
    grids [49]. − Security: The majority of applications need medium to high security.
    Applications such as production control and monitoring, for instance, need medium
    security, whilst others, such as smart grids, need high security because of the
    sensitivity of the data and the importance of the operations carried out [50].
    − Heterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city systems use networking
    protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent transportation and
    smart buildings are two examples of such systems. These protocols must coexist
    in such situations without conflicting with one another. To ensure seamless and
    effective operation, it is also necessary to correctly map the control information
    in the headers at the various networking stack tiers used by the many heterogeneous
    protocols and networks. − Wired/wireless connectivity: The majority of SCAs that
    include wireless connectivity are UAVs and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines.
    Others, including intelligent transportation and smart buildings, use wired and
    wireless connectivity [50]. In these situations, wired networking may be used
    for communication within a specific physical system (such as within a UAV), while
    wireless communication may be used to link the physical system to other such systems
    that are comparable to it or to the backbone and infrastructure networks. − Mobility:
    Some systems, such as the smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil, and
    smart water networks, have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such as
    UAVs and intelligent transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility
    smart city systems can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and
    adaptable to node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control
    messages and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.
    Table 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network
    with low, medium, or high traffic rates and supporting high or low mobility of
    devices. Each SCA is based on different protocols and requires different bandwidth
    and latency tolerance. In each SCA, the number of devices involved differs. Table
    1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements. 3.1. Additional
    Challenges − Interoperability: Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous
    networking protocols that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at
    the physical and data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated
    seamlessly, these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks,
    the IEEE 1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface
    between physical/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this
    function. Future research should focus on the creation of similar protocols to
    increase the support system for smart city systems. − Scalability: A smart city
    platform must manage many devices that are connected to the city’s infrastructure.
    Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously produced and consumed
    by devices and client applications, must be stored and processed. The platform
    must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests from users and services
    that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change depending on the features
    of the city as well as the installed applications and services. Recently, Del
    Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source smart
    city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale systems,
    apps, and services for smart cities. − Load Balancing: To maximize the usage of
    resources, load balancing assigns appropriate resources (i.e., network resources,
    storage capacity, computational resources, and energy resources) to user tasks.
    A large-scale IoT network performs better and avoids overload thanks to an effective
    load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time, cost, throughput, performance, and
    resource usage are all improved in terms of QoS parameters. − The Cloud/Edge/FogC
    Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation of smart city prototypes.
    These computing paradigms efficiently aid in the gathering, upkeep, and analysis
    of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that demand advanced processing
    and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems for smart cities
    have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time applications present
    the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently, FogC and Edge Computing
    have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing, implementing, deploying,
    and controlling such systems/applications. These paradigms bring computing resources
    closer to the IoT/device plane so that the primary computation can be done locally
    [65,66]. Each computing paradigm offers particular assistance based on the requirements
    of the application at hand. For example, to support a cloud-based SCA, ClCom offers
    centralized storage and processing capacity. For certain SCAs, ClCom can offer
    scalable processing power and data storage [5]. The features of ClCom (e.g., powerful
    processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge software services)
    can be used to provide various support services for a variety of SCAs. ClCom can
    be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The city’s ClCom services
    can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs to gather, process,
    store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes of data are gathered
    across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The sophisticated platforms
    required for storing and analyzing this massive amount of data to improve operations
    and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing. To effectively support SCAs,
    the communication between city sensors and actuators and ClCom may involve various
    communication requirements. The network architectures used in the smart city should
    meet these requirements. Smart applications require the integration of sensors,
    actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function well with a robust network
    that offers good communication services linking both sides. The fact that cloud
    services are either provided at a single central location or across numerous distributed
    platforms in various locations is another problem that occurs when adopting ClCom
    for a smart city. For many cloud applications, the distributed ClCom strategy
    can offer greater quality and dependability support [67]. However, it is frequently
    necessary to establish effective communication channels between the distributed
    ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability and
    efficiency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control
    of network resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot be
    avoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated the QoS
    requirements of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment to recognize
    QoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog) that is inspired
    by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture [69] for a
    FogC system. 3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks A smart city
    network has the following features [70]: Large Densities: A smart city network
    has a very large density as thousands of smart devices are distributed in the
    area of a city. Abnormal Traffic Patterns: Cascading or synchronization among
    smart devices produces extremely bursty or correlated traffic patterns. These
    traffic patterns differ from the regular social-generated traffic patterns on
    which most existing schemes and technology used in our society are based. Disorganized
    Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless connectivity features, smart
    city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology. The problem arises when
    smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless channels, where packet losses
    caused by wireless channel special properties are extremely common and eventually
    have an impact on the functioning of the smart city system. Therefore, it appears
    very improbable that a single high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.
    Heterogeneity: SCAs use a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,
    latency, throughput, and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates
    at a unique trade-off threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist
    on a single platform. Coexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication
    technologies used in smart cities are distributed over the same radio space. At
    the same time, independent radio infrastructures are connected through a variety
    of wireless channels. Under such circumstances, the SCA must handle interference
    issues with competence. Security and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to
    several risks from malevolent users. The majority of specialized smart sensors,
    actuators, and other intelligent devices are developed by designers without considering
    security measures. Such applications may be highly vulnerable due to hostile actors’
    ease of access to these cutting-edge technologies and potential threats to people’s
    security and privacy. The main challenges for smart city networks are as follows
    [70]: Lack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies
    for Personal Area Networks (PANs) and the IEEE 802.11 groups for wireless LANs
    adopt the concept of single-hop ad-hoc networking. These standards permit direct
    communication between two devices that are in the transmission range of each other.
    At the same time, the multi-hop ad-hoc networking paradigm enables the communication
    between any two devices which are not necessarily in their transmission range
    [71]. A problem that researchers must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous
    sets of devices (i.e., actuators, sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate
    uniformly without any standardization. Global distributors and manufacturers must
    propose and accept standardized network solutions that enable communication between
    diverse devices on homogeneous communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is the dominant solution that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical
    Layer. This standard deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication
    range, and power consumption. Several revisions or amendments (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g
    and IEEE 802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released. The IEEE 802.15.4g
    amendment allows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing data rates and communication
    ranges compatible with neighborhood mesh (wide) networks. Then, it is followed
    by another cutting-edge modification, known as IEEE 802.15.4e, which modifies
    and enhances the method used by devices to access wireless channels while also
    using time-slotted channel hopping mode. This hopping mode further delivers low-power
    consumption and improved dependability. From another viewpoint, many researchers
    customized appropriate upper-layer protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They
    made the necessary modifications there to make smart applications compatible with
    conventional infrastructure. Since the network of low-power smart devices is confined,
    the researchers developed numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make
    them easily adaptable. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72]
    and 6LoWPAN [73], which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.
    Interference problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same
    radio space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless
    channels. Because of this, the smart application must handle interference problems
    in such situations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate
    and be compatible with one another. Vertical handover (soft): Multiple radios
    are used by the rapidly expanding number of smart devices being developed. These
    devices should be able to recognize and use the best interface that is currently
    available while balancing power usage and throughput. D2D Communications: In the
    IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication demands. Unfortunately, conventional
    network gateways cannot handle such generated messages from heterogeneous devices.
    Short Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support and recommend acceptable
    performance for longer data packet scenarios. However, smart devices communicate
    with one another using short messages (since most of them are tiny and operate
    over low-powered battery devices). To this end, short communicating messages will
    positively impact network congestion detection and avoidance policies and promote
    in-band aggregation. Local Network Traffic Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-specific
    devices frequently use the same network infrastructure. However, most cellular
    data networks are exclusively planned, implemented, deployed, and managed for
    smartphone usage. Fitting traffic from these heterogeneous devices onto a single
    platform is now the main challenge that cellular data network providers face.
    It is difficult to integrate the traffic from these two types of heterogeneous
    devices into the same network infrastructure due to several intrinsic factors
    and the specified features of this traditional network. Additionally, D2D devices
    use a more significant proportion of scarce resources than smartphones, unnecessarily
    creating a problem of unfairness in the system [74]. Therefore, we must first
    comprehend D2D traffic patterns and how they differ from traffic patterns generated
    by smartphones. Understanding traffic patterns can provide insights into managing
    and allocating shared network resources more effectively and guarantee the highest
    level of service quality for both types of devices. Security mechanisms: Denial
    of Service (DoS) attacks are a remarkable threat to the security of smart city
    networks and must be identified. Some statistical methods have been proposed to
    solve this problem. Such a statistical method is presented in [75] that is based
    on feature distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis process. Another
    security mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying users and devices
    in a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-manipulated devices.
    Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT systems such as the
    reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation attack, and the
    Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be encrypted.
    However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might be able
    to embed general-purpose microprocessors for this task. In addition, low resources
    and constrained devices can only embed application-specific integrated circuits.
    Therefore, conventional cryptographic primitives are not suitable for low-resource
    smart devices due to their low computation power, limited battery life, small
    size, small memory, and limited power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography
    may be an efficient encryption for these devices. Trust management is another
    security mechanism that detects and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure
    access control. Automated and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate
    the trust values of the participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of
    trust management schemes focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based
    access control methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large
    number of smart things storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,
    transparent, and easy access control management so that different nodes/users
    can be granted different levels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain
    technology can be used to create secure virtual zones where things can identify
    and trust each other [77]. Self-organization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can also
    be planned to set up the relationship between Blockchain and IoT, as suggested
    in [78]. Anomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that flow through
    the IoT system can vary to a great extent, in terms of either format, shape (in
    time and space), and semantics. Therefore, the process of separating normal from
    abnormal sensed data is extremely demanding. In the context of IoT applications,
    sensors are the real source of big data, which suggests that anomaly detection
    at the edge could be a powerful tool to address the inevitable data communication
    bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is concerned with identifying data patterns that
    deviate remarkably from the expected behavior. This is critical in the process
    of finding out important information about the IoT system’s functioning, detecting
    abnormalities that are often rare or difficult to model or, otherwise, to predict
    [79]. A timely identification of anomalies is vital to preventing IoT system failure.
    Advanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artificial intelligence (AI), machine
    learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) play a key role in the evolution
    of the smart city sectors [80]. These techniques are now being developed as solutions
    for completely automated IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal
    analysis of the big data is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing
    DRL/ML approaches can improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency;
    and increase precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality
    prediction, person detection, traffic management, etc. For example, an intelligent
    transportation system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize
    self-driving vehicles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques
    are also used to precisely monitor and estimate the real-time traffic flow data
    in an urban environment. In SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned
    techniques can enhance the safety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,
    management, and power grid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective
    use of smart meter big data for different applications such as load assessment
    and prediction, baseline estimation, demand response, load clustering, and malicious
    data deception attacks. In health intelligence, extensive use of AI, ML, and DRL
    techniques is implemented due to high-performance IoT devices, Cloud Computing,
    and an increase in data rates. These techniques can play a vital role in disease
    diagnosis, cure prediction, social media analytics for a particular disease, and
    medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role of AI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques
    is also outstanding. These techniques can be used from an advanced security perspective
    of IoT to confront security threats. Notably, the accuracy and precision of the
    aforementioned techniques can be further enhanced by increasing the amount of
    training data to strengthen their learning capabilities and hence the automated
    decision efficiencies [82]. 4. Protocols Used for SCAs Figure 3 shows a proposed
    taxonomy of networking protocols and architectures for SCAs. It also shows the
    challenges in IoT communications via TCP/IP. Figure 3. A taxonomy of technologies
    facilitating communication and networking for smart cities with IoT-enabled application
    protocols and suggested networking architectures and protocols. SCAs involve numerous
    smart things that operate on low-powered battery devices [83]. New connectivity
    solutions are being investigated in light of the following question: do the currently
    available methods, tools, and techniques—especially those for wireless networks—allow
    for the reliable handling of such a large number of smart devices? Yaqoob et al.
    [84] provided details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN technologies
    such as ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D communication.
    In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of connected devices,
    transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies (e.g.,
    WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve significant power consumption and are only partially
    applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies and communication
    strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication perspective.
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput performance
    for fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior context.
    Due to the limitations of its initial design, this standard does not support IoT
    applications. Hence, to enable IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the
    community (IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efficient protocol
    [55]. They aim to create a system that enables effective communication between
    several indoor and outdoor devices. Nevertheless, the real-time implementation
    of IEEE 802.11 ah may need to be improved by the absence of an appropriate interference
    mechanism. IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n,
    Cellular 3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of
    standards and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various
    SCAs. Smart home automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems
    require short-range communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g.,
    Bluetooth and Zigbee) from the WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by
    a lower bandwidth requirement, minimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication
    infrastructure environment. In contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used for
    SCAs that require longer-range communication. Such applications are smart transportation
    management systems. The protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular and WiMAX,
    can be adopted by applications that need wide-range communication, such as smart
    emergency response systems, weather and air quality monitoring systems, and smart
    grid systems. These features designed in terms of standards or protocols have
    enough capability that allows for both synchronous and asynchronous data connections.
    The best-effort traffic (which can effectively tolerate latency) allows the asynchronous
    data connections feature to be linked with smart city services or applications.
    Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connections is possible for those services
    or applications that generate traffic mandating strict QoS standards such as low
    latency and high accessible network capacity [49]. Since IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee)
    is a short-range (low bit rate) communication protocol that often suggests higher
    flexibility for small devices running on low power, such a protocol can significantly
    increase network lifetime. Moreover, such a protocol encourages and indicates
    support for applications and services with relatively relaxed latency and throughput
    conditions in WPANs. The authors of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4
    and proposed an intelligent system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted
    the benefits of using wireless emulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation
    and deployment, relatively easier in expanding a network, and flexibility in the
    system due to the use of wireless technology, which supports the usage of heterogeneous
    devices in the same implemented and deployed structure. Furthermore, they emphasized
    the advantages of employing the same intelligent infrastructure for a variety
    of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring, and cost-effectiveness.
    For example, by including specific smart metering devices such as water or gas
    meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established to
    target smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering applications.
    5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called BDMA and FBMC multiple
    access, which was first launched in 2015. In the case of BDMA multiple access,
    an orthogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that resources can be distributed
    in parallel to each mobile base station by dividing the antenna beam in accordance
    with the position of the mobile stations to enable multiple accesses to the base
    stations. Successively, this helps in improving the capacity of 5G networks [86].
    Specifically, the idea of moving towards 5G is based on current technology advancements
    and particularly on unique customer needs. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed
    that implemented 5G cellular networks should address noteworthy complications
    that are not successfully addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced network capacity and
    data rate, lower End-to-End (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and consistent user QoE
    provisioning. In addition, massive and rapid growth in the number of highly developed
    connected devices leads to a sharp increase in network traffic and a widening
    range of applications with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta and
    Jha [86] studied numerous facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive
    MIMO, traffic and power management policies, offloading (local), and self-configuring
    and organizing networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time
    managing and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days
    thanks to 5G. 5G ultimately targets some networking possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable
    and Low-Latency Communications (uRLLC), enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and
    massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC). In a smart city context, eMBB controls
    data transfer between a variety of networked user end devices, edge devices, or
    cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC aims to manage huge connected, complex devices,
    such as wearables, actuators, and sensors, through dense urban deployment. Finally,
    uRLLC takes responsibility for managing highly time-critical communication such
    as vehicular communication, base stations, and edge devices communication [87].
    Although 5G has completely brought about a new revolution in the field of networking,
    numerous unknown challenges still are possible in these cases of communication
    when 5G is deployed in the context of smart cities. One major problem is power-efficient
    communication, especially when communicating low-powered battery devices such
    as sensors and other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when two distinct
    technologies (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Specific device-level
    compatibility problems might always persist when communication infrastructures
    migrate to next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely,
    how to handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or
    difficult-to-reach places, as well as the potential high costs associated with
    building and maintaining 5G networks. Table 2 compares protocols used for smart
    cities, while Table 3 evaluates standards utilizing features and characteristics.
    Table 2. Comparison of protocols used for smart cities. Adapted and extended from
    [49,84,88]. Table 3. Evaluation of standards utilizing their features. 4.1. IEEE
    802.11 Standards Table 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features. Table
    4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features. 4.2. IEEE 802.15.1 The
    IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave time
    division duplex mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with
    a 1 Mbps data rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services
    designed to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include
    Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the
    IoT [98]. The deployment of services offered for tracking and localization devices
    is typically suggested by BLE-based devices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.
    These beacons produce a signal that other compatible devices can pick up between
    50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises greater indoor localization accuracy
    than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can be used for a wide range
    of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch of points of
    sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally, to provide
    specific services of interest, it is frequently required to combine the BLE technology
    with other technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the aim of BLE technology
    (Bluetooth Classic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous wireless connection,
    i.e., BlueTooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR). It became the perfect
    option for the IoT since it permits connectivity and audio-streaming applications
    using brief bursts of long-distance radio, which lowers the battery consumption
    of mobile devices (because they need not be connected all the time). Using the
    idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE specification, smartphones or regular
    phones can be linked to other heterogeneous devices (such as headphones) in BR/EDR
    mode. Otherwise, they can be connected to wearables in LE mode. A low-power radio
    called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends to broadcast data across 79 channels in the
    2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. Wireless audio streaming is primarily made
    possible through BCR, which has evolved into the industry-standard radio protocol
    for in-car entertainment systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims
    to transmit data over 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To
    facilitate the deployment of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks
    to provide support for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast;
    and, most notably, mesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create
    distribution and locating maps utilizing fingerprint templates for indoor device
    and user localization. Due to BLE’s greater susceptibility to abrupt fading and
    substantial changes in received signal strength, it has been proven that using
    BLE is more efficient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101]. However, Bluetooth
    technology has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly when its BR/EDR
    mode is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the master nodes
    to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered
    a variety of scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the
    BR/EDR mode reveals a lack of scalability that further restricts the performance
    of the system. 4.3. LoRA The LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications
    and operated as a low-data-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum
    that could go up to 10 km. LoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth: 125,
    250, and 500 KHz. Even while this technology can function at the largest bandwidth
    class, which further improves data rate, it still causes issues with high power
    consumption, a shorter communication range, and an increase in the likelihood
    of interference because it is free to operate in a wider frequency spectrum. This
    method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation and a CSSM variant
    with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission range will expand
    as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption will rise as
    well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby making it resilient
    to channel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not differentiate the noise
    in the channel such as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK modulation approach, which
    normally identifies signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise floor, the CSSM
    feature enables this technology to sense, perceive, and capture signals that are
    19.5 dB below the noise floor [103]. Its architecture uses a star network topology
    and includes gateways and end nodes. In this design, end nodes are referred to
    as slaves and run on battery-powered devices with limited power, but gateways
    are thought of as powerful machines that gather data from slave nodes. Furthermore,
    LoRaWAN is a communication layer that operates on top of LoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates
    the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability and suitability for
    low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over cellular technologies,
    which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice, LoRaWAN improved
    network features and functionalities by addressing the concept of a specialized
    server (network) and specifically defining numerous device types to meet the needs
    of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet filtering, and
    packet scheduling are all made possible using specialized network servers. LoRaWAN
    has also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission power and
    rate, which aids in optimizing network performance in terms of power consumption
    and throughput. This technology can be employed for a wide range of applications,
    such as smart health nursing [104], traffic monitoring [105], agriculture monitoring
    [106], localization [107], and smart grid applications [108]. In particular, this
    technology is useful for non-latency-sensitive applications and those that call
    for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al. [109] and Adelantado et al. [110]
    emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart metering, tracking, and localization-based
    applications. At the same time, it is not so feasible for real-time monitoring
    and video surveillance. 4.4. WiMAX WiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential
    peak data rate of 60 Mbps for an entire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps
    for an entirely uplink operation, based on the original IEEE 802.16 air interface
    standard (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amendment [112]. It can be done using
    two antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz. Additionally, it may provide
    support for multimedia services with different traffic characteristics and wide
    area mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety of QoS
    scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous traffic, such as Internet data
    traffic, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio traffic, and voice and video streams
    [113]. Table 5 shows the specified WiMAX standards and their operational parameters
    [114]. This standard provides a communication channel between geographically separated
    devices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges between 30
    km and 100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such as high installation
    costs and the possibility of complications and irregularities when dealing with
    high-definition multimedia traffic. Table 5. WiMAX standards and their operational
    parameters. Wireless network traffic has recently increased extraordinarily due
    to the rapid proliferation of smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators.
    These devices, along with smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based
    specialized devices, are the most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network
    environments. In such a dense network environment, interference is a critical
    issue that must be addressed if satisfactory performance and, thus, proficient
    spatial frequency reuse is required. Subsequently, the standards IEEE 802.11 were
    designed and implemented to support these requirements. Numerous international
    organizations, including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved their technologies
    in response to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance, the original
    IEEE 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior throughput
    performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as
    a result, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a result,
    to address the challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11 ah Task Group
    (TG) was formed by the IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to redesign and
    extend the applicability of WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They focused on the
    critical issue of power-aware efficient schemes and protocols to extend the functionality
    and applicability of 802.11-based networks while dealing with a variety of small
    power-constrained smart outdoor and indoor devices [55,97]. 4.5. Challenges in
    IoT Communication Using the TCP/IP Protocol Suite In IoT, smart sensing motes,
    devices, and actuators share unique features such as constrained memory, power,
    and processing capabilities; the need for facilitating real-time requirements
    of smart applications; extremely vulnerable radio environments; and little to
    no human involvement after deployment [115]. By enabling communication amongst
    these devices utilizing low-power-cost technologies, a new infrastructure for
    deployed smart services has been formed. Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP
    protocol suite might provide a solution and be flexible enough for a variety of
    evolving IoT communication scenarios. Unfortunately, there were additional challenges
    that network administrators, designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers
    were searching for the best way to install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally
    use the system’s limited resources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of such
    power constraints, researchers highlighted the requirements of low-power Layer-2
    technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4) and low-power WiFi usage. In contrast
    with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies operate with smaller maximum
    transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission speeds. IoT network protocol
    designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining the ideal MTU size. Another
    obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless networks and
    thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies. This vulnerability
    brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture: (1) The current IP addressing
    model cannot assist mesh communication (since it relies on a multi-link subnet
    prototype) at all. (2) In mesh communication, the multicasting and broadcasting
    communication methods are quite expensive, power-demanding, and prohibitive as
    the network nodes are extremely power constrained. Moreover, unicasting is the
    only remaining alternative method. (3) Unicasting is power intensive in and of
    itself because it may take many hops while forwarding and may wake up an excessive
    number of nodes that are asleep. Notably, idle nodes and hops can modify the radio
    state’s operation mode to save power. Additionally, a large amount of power is
    used and saved by a node during transmission, reception, overhearing, idle, and
    sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful delivery, we cannot just
    alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective coordination and intricate
    synchronization [117,118]. (4) There is a high requirement for scalable routing/forwarding
    schemes for IP communication to take place over mesh architectural systems. (5)
    For many IoT applications requiring data prioritizing and customized control,
    original TCP-suited features such as those operational on fixed MSS sizes (such
    as MTU sizes) that further lead to silly window syndrome or in-order byte-stream
    delivery to ensure dependability, are unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF
    started defining standard Internet protocols such as RPL [120] for such specialized
    environments to minimize protocol overheads that impair the computing ability
    and memory management of these specialized resource-constrained devices. WiFi-based
    infrastructure networks enable backhauling support, which helps establish and
    sustain seamless connectivity among smart IoT devices. In smart home wireless
    networks, this form of connectivity can be provided through TCP connections. The
    TCP/IP protocol suite supports dependable data delivery and congestion control
    strategies to maintain network throughput performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP
    is a protocol that has been regularly modified and improved over the years to
    effectively transport large amounts of byte-stream in-ordered data via resilient
    P2P connections with comparatively lower latency needs. IoT services deal with
    atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP protocol suite-based protocols,
    such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns adequately [119]. There are severe
    problems that TCP faces when it deals with an IoT application: (1) TCP connection
    establishment and termination (three-way handshaking) incur significant overhead
    in the system as most communication in an IoT application includes the transmission
    of brief segments and relatively little data. (2) TCP functionality needs resilient
    P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these connections in an IoT network
    environment because smart sensors and other connected devices switch their mode
    of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119]. (3) Some IoT applications
    might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns, and enabling such patterns
    via TCP will result in substantial network overhead in the entire IoT system and
    high-power consumption. (4) Some IoT services have very granular delay requirements,
    and any extra delay in the form of connection establishment or MSS creation (waiting
    for data to fill the entire MSS) is completely unacceptable for their performance.
    Thus, TCP is unable to provide much support for these IoT services. (5) IoT applications
    that rely on wireless communication scenarios must deal with critical wireless
    channel characteristics such as channel error, interference, and wireless interface
    properties that result in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer contention-induced,
    and collision-induced packet losses. When TCP operates in such a setting, its
    stringent in-order delivery requirements and retransmission policies (i.e., fast
    retransmission) may occasionally result in very serious system problems such as
    Head-of-Line (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in a
    reduction in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121,122,123,124].
    Furthermore, wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may further
    impair TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP Retransmission
    Time Out timer. Some standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement
    Layer-4 functionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed to
    utilize UDP as an underlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should depend
    on an application’s requirements, which may vary from application to application.
    However, TCP and its updated variants rely on the concept of data delivery deferment
    and try to perform retransmissions from an already created copy in the sender
    buffer. However, this is not the only approach to dealing with packet losses in
    the network. Another method is for AppL to accept packet delivery that is not
    completely flawless and proceed with its current operations. This feature will
    be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution. Additionally, retransmission
    is an additional option. However, AppL should handle this retransmission rather
    than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost
    data bits, doing so enables the source application to reconstruct them. Furthermore,
    in situations where real-time services are severely constrained, the transmitting
    application may transmit fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair”
    the effects of the initial loss [126]. Clark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these
    concepts and subsequently introduced the concept of Application Level Framing
    (ALF). Implementing Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself brings the idea of employing
    ALF into the system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF, a network can recognize
    individual Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently can offer support for
    flexible Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission procedures
    for diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using in-network
    caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails
    to provide support for the ALF scheme [119]. 4.6. Compound TCP for IoT Compound
    TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel utilization
    and fairness performances. It will play a significant role in home networks with
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128]. Pokhrel and Williamson [115]
    studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an IoT scenario involving sensors
    and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home appliances). They
    analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of connections made
    using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks in the presence
    of significant buffer-overflow-induced losses and severely degraded transmission
    channel circumstances. The authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements
    for all IoT devices as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional
    bandwidth-hungry Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated
    a thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted
    classical devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overflow-induced losses
    and significantly deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of
    [115,129] suggested models that aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion
    and flow control of several concurrently running competitive long-lived compound
    TCP connections. In evaluating and developing these models, they considered MAC-level
    retransmissions, link-layer contention, channel failures, and collision. The authors
    of [130] utilized a transient model suggesting a new queue management scheme to
    capture the interactions of short-lived TCP flows (the most workable flows in
    IoT scenarios) over conventional traffic patterns over WiFi networks. However,
    the performance of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using
    a single shared Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale
    well and provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially
    when wireless channels are often reused by several APs [131]. 4.7. Viewpoints
    of Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems The network architectures for IoT are
    heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular
    Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due to
    the large-scale production of intelligent sensing devices, survivability and self-organization
    of deployed functional networks are essential. A WSN is deployed for a variety
    of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and military applications. It
    is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which the sensor nodes communicate
    over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered, low-power sensors capable
    of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating, and regulating communication.
    Numerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2, TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have been
    suggested. Therefore, some standards were introduced to enable interaction and
    other compatibilities among these numerous heterogeneous platforms. For example,
    the IEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT.
    WSNs provide critical functionalities for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered
    battery-operated End Devices (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to
    the Internet. A WSN can be considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several
    equipped sensor nodes. Due to the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability
    must be obtained from the viewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability
    issue, various works suggested a standardized arrangement that could enable the
    usage of IP over LoWPAN. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability
    for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard outlines
    the physical and data link layers of the network and offers a low-cost framework
    for network operations. To link LPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may be used as
    an adaptation layer to enable sensors to implement an IP stack and become approachable
    by other conventional devices over the Internet. This adaptability layer also
    supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables a variety of applications and
    permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding algorithms at the Internet
    layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot be supported
    when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72] considers the
    LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained, and they
    are connected by some lossy links that only support low data rates. These links
    are thought to be extremely unstable and have poor performance in terms of packet
    delivery rates. In such specialized networks, the traffic patterns are often P2MP
    and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint (MP2MP) rather than just P2P [72]. These networks
    contain hundreds of smart devices. This makes the implementation of routing policies
    more difficult than ever. In addition, numerous existing traditional ad-hoc wireless
    network routing methods, such as DSR and AODV, cannot manage these unique situations
    and unforeseen circumstances. Designing and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking
    settings has been more difficult due to the mobility aspect and the resource limitations
    at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’ design principles emphasize QoS
    elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end latency [134,135]. The forwarding
    rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations take into account the
    increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the node energy [117,136].
    As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and maintain solely inside their
    operational infrastructure, this was very feasible. However, the interoperability
    of these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when such networks are integrated
    with IoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration with IoT needs novel routing
    policies that support scalability and assure QoS, fairness, and connectivity between
    two nodes (both in APs and ad-hoc networks) with the least amount of power consumption.
    The standard classical forwarding strategies were intended to ensure QoS between
    a pair of devices/nodes. In the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures
    should suggest enough fairness so that each node can sufficiently get enough chances
    to communicate with nearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing
    solutions are followed to decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation.
    Researchers have often raised concerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules,
    which lead to the consumption of excess energy in networks while taking into account
    mobile and static ad-hoc network scenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood
    of frequent network disconnections, route failures, and even network partitioning,
    all contributing to the system’s significant MAC-level and routing-level overhead
    problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the high-power consumption problem,
    many researchers presented numerous smart routing paradigms [118,134,135,137].
    Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the desired QoS. Cross-layer
    design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion control are
    well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless channel
    attributes. Therefore, significant work has been done in these areas. These designs
    provide support for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely variable channel
    parameters at lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing and Transport
    layers to further optimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations decisions
    [121,134,135,138,139,140]. The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) indicates
    how well a device can hear a signal from an AP or router. A network layer forwarding
    policy can effectively utilize the RSSI (accessible through lower layers dynamically)
    to assess link quality. AODV and DSR are examples of the traditional ad-hoc routing
    protocols used in various smart forwarding systems designed for IoT scenarios.
    The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing mechanisms were suggested for the IoT
    scenarios and talked about node and link disjoint paths while discovering routes.
    However, the proposed schemes do not shed light and discuss anything related to
    performance issues when there is a significant level of interference in the network
    because of traffic running parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned techniques
    do not always perform well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay. Recently,
    the scheme [140] considered different critical factors such as interference level,
    link-layer contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related
    to wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution
    policies’ efficiency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,
    different possible disjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might
    be able to interfere with one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting
    behavior in wireless communication. Consequently, such separate disconnected pathways
    could be utilized to enhance the performance of the network as a whole [138,140].
    When employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend on WSN-based networking
    connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from smart things to sink nodes.
    These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes (IoT-GW). To balance energy
    usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous such static and mobile IoT-GWs
    can be deployed in the system. In the whole system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous
    types of critical data, are connected to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee
    specified three forms of devices: Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee
    End Device, and three forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh. Moreover,
    the Zigbee stack embraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the case of star
    network topology, the Reduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e., RFDs and FFDs)
    can communicate with the PAN central coordinator only. They are not capable of
    communicating with one another. Here, the PAN coordinator may be powered by mains,
    while the RFDs and FFDs run on low-powered limited battery devices. Moreover,
    in the case of the mesh network topology, any device can communicate to within-range
    devices at a point of time. Moreover, this topology contains a PAN coordinator,
    which can communicate with other RFDs and FFDs. Furthermore, this networking topology
    offers support for the usage of the integrated forwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree
    and AODV routing procedures. Lastly, the tree (cluster) network topology is a
    subset form of mesh networking topology, consisting of RFDs and FFDs (which may
    act as coordinators). However, the FFD count could be more than the RFD count
    in the network. RFDs may attach to tree (cluster) network topology as the end
    nodes in the system. The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization functionalities
    to other connected coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single PAN
    coordinator amongst these coordinators [144]. 4.8. IoT Application Protocols Each
    IoT application is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.
    These protocols can be the following: Representational State Transfer Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is the primary client/server protocol
    that adopts the request/response model. HTPP has been related to the REST architecture
    [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar entities over web-based services.
    The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices to make their status readily
    available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions
    [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE techniques
    of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build a REST model for dissimilar
    IoT devices [148]. Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [149]: It is a lightweight
    RESTful protocol lately standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
    CoAP is used by IoT devices for IP-based, HTTP-like interactions. It uses UDP
    with acknowledgment messages to set up reliable communication based on a request/response
    interaction. It has reduced complexity, and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained
    IoT applications and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) [150] is established for IoT messaging. According to MQTT design
    principles, network bandwidth and device resource requirements should be kept
    to a minimum while also aiming to assure dependability and some level of delivery
    assurance. Since June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by ISO as a standard (ISO/IEC
    20922). The protocol continues to progress by formalizing popular capability options
    and adding new functionalities. The most recent version, MQTT v5.0, was released
    in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe paradigm. Clients connect
    to a centralized broker when using MQTT. Open Platform Communications Unified
    Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoperability standard is used for the secure
    and reliable exchange of data in the industrial automation domain and other industries.
    It is platform independent and ensures the seamless flow of information among
    IoT devices from multiple vendors. It supports two different communication methods:
    the Client/Server method as well as Publish/Subscribe (e.g., over UDP or MQTT)
    to mainly meet different industry requirements from the production systems to
    edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main IoT vendors including IBM, AWS, Google
    Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage secure, standardized information exchange
    in edge-to-cloud applications based on OPC UA. Extensible Messaging and Presence
    Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is based on text messages that
    use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which it can implement both request/response
    and publish/subscribe methods by using suitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant
    messages between clients, and this happens in real-time using a push mechanism
    to avoid increasing unnecessary network loads. XMPP also determines the state
    of an XMPP entity as online, offline, busy, etc. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
    (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing business messages between applications
    or organizations using TCP. It connects systems, feeds business processes with
    the information they need, and reliably transmits onward the instructions that
    achieve their goals using the point/point and publish/subscribe interaction modes.
    AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of message orientation; queuing; routing;
    security; reliability; and interoperability. Data Distribution Service (DDS) [154]:
    DDS was developed by the Open Management Group (OMG). DDS is a real-time M2M protocol
    that enables dependable, high-performance, interoperable, scalable data exchanges
    using a publish–subscribe pattern. DDS provides low-latency data connectivity,
    high reliability, and scalability in publish–subscribe and request/response patterns
    over TCP and UDP. The needs of various IoT applications requiring real-time data
    exchange can be addressed using DDS. Such applications are air traffic control,
    transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart grid management. Lastly,
    Glaroudis et al. [155] provided a comparison among IoT application protocols in
    terms of well-accepted key performance indicators and discussed their suitability
    in the framework of smart farming. 5. Networking Architectures and Protocols 5.1.
    Generic Architectures Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an
    urban IoT’s enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated
    the implementation of an IoT island as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City
    of Padova. In the IoT, two methods provide data access to objects/things. The
    first involves deploying multi-hop mesh networks with short-range communication
    among network nodes using unlicensed frequency. The second involves using licensed
    frequency band long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM). Centenaro et al.
    [156] presented a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wireless connectivity)
    called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based on a star topology
    characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed
    sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide connectivity
    in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed the
    advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efficiency,
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled
    SCA that uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled
    street lighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental
    research facility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander supports
    testing proposed protocols, services, and configurations in a realistic setting
    at an appropriate scale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is a significant
    part of IoT. Vilajosana and Dohler [159] reviewed currently used smart city M2M
    technologies (i.e., sensors, data loggers, wireless modems, and gateway). They
    considered one of the most famous deployment use cases, i.e., smart parking. In
    any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount of M2M communication requests
    occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways cannot face this challenge.
    Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control model for M2M communications.
    Their model differentiates all M2M requests into delay-sensitive and delay-tolerant.
    Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant requests by routing them into one low-priority
    queue, aiming to reduce the number of requests from various devices to the access
    point in the IoT for smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up
    architecture after analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture
    has four layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each
    layer integrates security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer,
    located at the bottom of the architecture, collects data from physical devices.
    The transmission layer is located above the sensing layer. Several communication
    technologies are used to transmit data from the transmission layer to the (upper)
    data management layer. The data management layer performs data fusion, data analysis,
    data processing, and data storing. It stores valuable information that various
    applications use at the application layer to provide services. The majority of
    the above works mainly focus on a single characteristic, such as quality of service
    [162]. Marques et al. [163] proposed a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities
    infrastructure management architecture that allows the integration of physical
    objects, communication infrastructure, cloud platform, and IoT-based services
    in a pervasive way. This architecture (Figure 4) is generic and includes four
    layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication, (3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.
    Figure 4. Architecture design. Adapted from [163]. The Physical Objects Layer
    enables IoT sensors to collect data that will feed the smart city architecture
    with information used to offer services. After the sensors collect data, a Communication
    Device is used to collect sensor data. A communication device can implement different
    technologies (e.g., RFID, Bluetooth, and Zigbee). Sensor data are processed by
    a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing unit responsible for gathering
    information used by the application providing a service. The local processing
    unit brings elements of edge computing, as it pushes part of the computation to
    edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating all the computation in a centralized
    remote server. The Communication Layer: The architecture supports a variety of
    network access technologies. The communication layer supports the implementation
    of various wireless technologies. The local processing unit located at the Physical
    Objects Layer defines the technology to be used and relays data to the communication
    layer using the interface of a network access point. The Cloud Platform Layer
    provides three services: processing, database queries, and data storage. In the
    context of providing services for smart cities, each of these services can be
    dynamically allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably, only
    some applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation
    is optional. The Services Layer implements four groups, which are called classes
    of services: (I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III) Infrastructure,
    and (IV) Technology. In each class, different kinds of applications can be implemented
    to deal with the challenges of smart cities. This architecture is a generic solution,
    so the underlying layers are designed to offer support to the applications. Therefore,
    it can be adapted to the specific implementation of a given service. To this end,
    the authors adapted their architecture to a waste management scenario. Another
    multi-level smart city architecture [164] was built on semantic web technologies,
    and its design is mostly used in smart city wireless sensor network applications.
    Data collection, data processing, integration and reasoning, and device control
    and alerts make up its four layers. Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s
    edge, Gheisari et al. [165] suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in
    the smart city that protects privacy. Saadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer
    architecture for mobile object authentication in the context of IoT smart cities.
    Their architecture is based on the applicability of a proposed hierarchical elliptic
    curve identity-based signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167] presented
    a Fog-based smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network (FOCAN).
    To reduce latency and increase the efficiency of services among things with various
    capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through
    the smart city environment. One of FOCAN’s primary benefits is that the IoT device
    can deliver services effectively and with less energy consumption. 5.2. SDN-IoT
    Architectures Software-defined networking (SDN) [168] is an approach to enable
    flexible and efficient network configuration to enhance a network. SDN can provide
    many advantages for configuring city networks to support different applications.
    For example, SDN can improve the QoS of city networks against link failures [169]
    and meet smart city latency demands [170]. While some efforts are investigating
    this approach for supporting SCAs, there is room for developing more advanced
    management and networking mechanisms in SDN for efficient, reliable, and secure
    network configurations in smart cities. Jazaeri et al. [171] considered the advantages
    of integrating edge computing, SDN, and IoT technologies and reviewed different
    frameworks and platforms. Liu et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples
    urban sensing applications from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture,
    centralized controllers manage physical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition,
    transmission, and processing services to develop urban sensing applications. Bi
    et al. [173] proposed a scalable SDN-enabled architecture that integrates a variety
    of smart city components and provides reliable and timely scheduling for big data
    transfer to support smart city services. They also studied the time-constrained
    big data transfer scheduling (TBTS) problem under this architecture and proposed
    a heuristic with an intelligent scheme that can maximize the throughput and schedule
    the multi-flow transfer dynamically. IoT systems collect and process data vulnerable
    to availability, integrity, and privacy threats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed
    a collaborative and intelligent-network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)
    architecture, namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT networks. SeArch is a security
    architecture in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS nodes, i.e., Edge-IDS,
    Fog-IDS, and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration among nodes.
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy
    in smart cities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network architecture
    for the smart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN and Blockchain technologies.
    To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, their architecture
    is divided into core and edge networks. By designing a hybrid architecture, their
    architecture inherits the strength of centralized and distributed network architectures.
    “PrivySharing” [177] is a Blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving
    and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. This framework protects
    data privacy by segmenting the blockchain network into different channels, consisting
    of a limited number of approved businesses and handling a certain category of
    data, such as health, smart auto, smart energy, or financial information. Additionally,
    smart contracts contain access control rules that regulate who has access to the
    users’ data within a channel. In addition, private data gathering and encryption
    are used to further isolate and safeguard the data within a channel. Islam et
    al. [178] designed a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT ecosystem
    that addresses the existing challenges through the use of the technologies Blockchain,
    SDN, and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architecture
    confronts the problems of scalability, flexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats. 5.3. Architectures
    for Smart Grid The automated and intelligent management of the next-generation
    electric power systems determines their effectiveness and efficiency. Smart Grid
    (SG) is the name given to the next generation of electricity systems, which are
    anticipated to offer various benefits over the current systems in terms of digitization,
    flexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustainability, and customization [179].
    Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies to improve power quality.
    Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric devices remotely in
    real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate their local devices.
    The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented by using the electrical
    and communication infrastructures that connect the transmission and customer domains.
    The distribution domain includes distribution feeders and transformers to supply
    electricity. It interacts with much different equipment, such as distributed energy
    resources (DERs), plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure
    (AMI), and sensors with communication capability. The distribution domain is responsible
    for delivering electricity to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability.
    To provide quality electricity, the stability of this domain is monitored and
    controlled. Typical applications [44] of the smart grid communications network
    are automatic meter reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and
    DERs/microgrid. DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked
    to the distribution system. Distributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS),
    or a combination of renewable and non-renewable sources are all possible sources
    for DER. Solar panels, wind turbines, combustion turbines, fuel cells, battery
    storage systems, etc., are a few examples of DER. An electric power system with
    one or more DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid. The communication
    infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities of the smart grid and
    complies with performance standards. This infrastructure connects a huge number
    of electric devices and manages complex device communications. As a result, it
    is built in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected individual sub-networks,
    and each sub-network is responsible for separate geographical regions. The extremely
    dispersed smaller area networks that support the power systems at various locations
    are connected by WANs, which act as the communication’s backbone. When the control
    centers are located a great distance from the substations or the end-users, the
    real-time measurements made at the electric devices are transported to the control
    centers through the WANs, and in the opposite direction, the WANs carry out the
    instruction communications from the control centers to the electric devices. The
    authors of [43] present a communication architecture in an SG. This architecture
    includes (1) an energy smart house with electric appliances connected to the smart
    grid, (2) a residential complex with AMI, (3) a residential subdivision installed
    with solar panels, (4) a PEV charging station, (5) a power substation, and (6)
    power transmission lines. In this architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as
    the backbone in connecting the distributed sub-networks. Demertzis et al. [180]
    presented and categorized the communication network standards that have been established
    for smart grids and should be considered in planning and implementing new infrastructures.
    Such standards are IEC 61850 for substation automation. This standard is based
    on open architecture and incorporates sampling and timing synchronization specifications
    based on IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181]. Notably, IEEE 1588 is the standard
    for a precision clock synchronization protocol for networked measurement and control
    systems [182]. Due to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)
    throughout the power grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution
    networks in smart grids would undergo significant changes to accommodate the nature
    of non-radial power flow. For the most part, the low-voltage distribution networks
    where RERs (such as solar cells) may be attached are not monitored by the majority
    of the present supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for power
    grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control, Abdrabou [183] presented
    a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse structure that may
    supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage distribution networks.
    A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also presented as a useful method
    for prioritizing data transfer across the newly introduced network architecture.
    HetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network design with a specific QoS routing method
    for power distribution grid applications. It delivers QoS assurances across the
    network while taking into account three factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability.
    The authors created two components to accomplish this: A multipath routing mechanism
    that compensates critical applications for their high-reliability requirements
    by using end-to-end physically disjoint paths, and Altruistic resource allocation
    with the QoS routing mechanism that targets communication with QoS guarantees
    for applications with strict QoS requirements. The findings in [184] show that
    the HetGrid overlay network architecture enables extremely effective, trustworthy,
    and QoS-aware communication in heterogeneous networks. The major characteristics
    that set SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are the ability to execute
    two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time pricing. The present
    SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to be protocol independent.
    Therefore, global communication network management and monitoring approaches have
    been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network administrators may more
    efficiently manage their networks by separating the control plane from the data
    plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication networks. SDN
    implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efficiency and resilience.
    SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and protocols by virtue
    of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity capabilities to
    cope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185] presented SDN-based
    SGC architectures, along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for
    SDN-based SGC and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied
    to SDN-based SGC. Alam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication
    networks in terms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,
    and applications. They proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication Network
    for Smart Grid. CR is a software-defined radio (SDR) platform that can quickly
    reconfigure its operating parameters, such as modulation/demodulation, compression
    algorithm, and error coding techniques, according to changing circumstances and
    requirements, through cognition. In such an SDR platform, radio transceivers can
    switch functions and operations on demand only. Molokomme et al. [187] reviewed
    architectures that aim to accomplish the various and strict QoS requirements in
    SG communication systems. Wireless communication networks have been motivated
    to harvest energy from ambient environments and run energy-efficiently for economic
    and ecological benefits through improvements in the smart power grid and the advocacy
    of “green communications”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments in energy
    harvesting, redistribution, trade, and planning for future wireless networks integrating
    with smart grids. The authors considered the optimization of various energy-harvesting
    wireless systems as well as traditional models of renewable energy-harvesting
    technologies. Moreover, they discussed how to distribute redundant (unused) energy
    generated by cellular networks, plan for energy under dynamic pricing when smart
    grids are in place, and engage in two-way energy trading using smart grids. From
    a different viewpoint, including IoT devices and providing connectivity, automation,
    and monitoring for such devices enables SG systems to sustain multiple network
    operations during the generation, distribution, transmission, and expenditure
    of energy. Numerous IoT-aided SG systems have been proposed in the literature.
    The survey [189] on IoT-aided SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures,
    uses, and prototypes. 5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings There are various
    building applications such as heating, cooling, load control, air quality, ventilation,
    lighting, water management, and cooking gas management. A smart building incorporates
    the major building systems on a common network and functionality to provide operational
    efficiency, fire safety, and security. A smart building architecture (SBA) manages
    several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation, air cleaning,
    HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation and monitoring);
    smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management); a smart fire
    detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart building [190]
    has security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality system, a fire alarm
    system, a water management system, and an energy management system. Moreover,
    it can detect intrusion and supports HVAC services. Diverse SBAs include complex
    operational systems, sensing, and communication technologies. Such architectures
    have converged into an IP-based architecture. This convergence is occurring rapidly
    with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices driven through IoT concerning
    conventional building management and smart buildings. Traditionally, numerous
    building systems utilized varied forms of networking protocols and cabling systems.
    This variety makes the whole system more complex and highly infeasible from both
    a deployment and a system administration standpoint [191]. SBAs entail making
    plans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational technologies that improve
    the application’s, service’s, or provision’s operational steps while also boosting
    the well-being of its users. Researchers, policymakers, and implementers should
    pay attention to several crucial issues, such as reliable communication/connection
    procedures, power-efficient measures, competent security measures, efficient sensors
    and actuators, and data analytics procedures. Amalgamating new systems and technologies
    with conventional (base) technologies to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes,
    but is not limited to, WSN deployment; advanced power-aware traffic engineering
    policies; cloud, edge, and fog computing paradigms; big data engineering and analytics;
    and human–computer interaction procedures [192]. The rapid development of ICT
    technologies has enhanced the connectedness of intelligent sensing, actuators,
    and communication devices to real-time physical entities. Recently, smart sensing
    mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology have boosted the area of
    SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies for a particular smart
    building domain poses significant difficulties, including heterogeneity of IoT
    devices and applications, workable networking protocols and architectures, power
    efficiency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One solution is the SDN paradigm,
    which manages the network more efficiently than a customary one. SDN also assists
    network services, including storage, routing, dynamic bandwidth management, and
    QoS. Hence, these simplifications offer a creative environment through the implementation
    of proper software tools for smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation
    for intelligent infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home
    automation and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing
    based on SDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that
    improves critical SB parameters such as bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency,
    latency, security, and reliability. Silva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things
    (WoT) SBA that is integrated with the representational state transfer (RESTful)
    application programming interface (API). The RESTful API employs HTTP requests
    (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT data. Regarding network
    performance and smart building power management, the authors showed how their
    recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance. Smart sensing
    devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or modifying
    vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.
    These systems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms, power,
    and transceiver modules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based SBAs for
    assessing and regulating air quality, smart lighting systems, fire detection systems,
    power management, and other basic building operations. An indoor-air-quality-based
    SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for monitoring and regulating
    air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing system was initially
    suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature, and relative humidity.
    Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198]. Considering smart
    indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed in the literature.
    In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system to satisfy the users’
    needs. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption reduction via energy-efficient
    smart lighting systems. Today’s smart building employs low-power usage LED-based
    light sources that last longer than Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In
    reality, the development of control technologies, heterogeneous networks, and
    embedded systems has made it promising to create smart innovative lighting systems
    that can effectively address the problem of energy conservation. Researchers have
    recently begun testing by integrating different power-saving techniques in a single
    illumination system for improved energy efficiency while enhancing lighting performance
    without sacrificing user satisfaction. According to the authors of [201], using
    several cheap detectors, as opposed to a single expensive sensor, would result
    in improved performance and higher power savings. Considering the same motivation,
    various authors [202,203,204] have suggested similar types of smart lighting systems
    for several room types, such as classrooms and offices. In [205], the authors
    provide a deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing on
    power savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration
    of visible light communication technology [206]. Recently, researchers focused
    on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work performance and thermal comfort, to
    propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented Technologies (OOT) have
    been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal comfort while conserving
    energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the drawbacks of the
    automatic control used today. In practice, thermal comfort analysis is based on
    parallel objective and subjective evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises
    monitoring, assessing, and recording the status of environmental parameters through
    dedicated sensors and instruments following standardized guidelines. Subjective
    evaluation involves monitoring, assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal
    sensation, and thermal environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor
    results as the cumulative method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found
    in [193]. Green building refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that
    adjusts to predetermined circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation,
    the system makes full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather
    data and subsequently allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The
    ambient intelligence concept aims to conserve natural resources with limited and
    efficient use of them to offer comfort to the occupants. Through unconventional
    energy sources, it also meets some of the conventional energy requirements [207].
    Many aspects of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and power efficiency, are
    the subject of extensive study. However, one of the most important functions of
    an SB system is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by HVAC
    systems [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial buildings
    for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for this
    context. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of rated fan
    energy can be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect on a building’s
    indoor temperature. The method of computational control for passive and active
    sources was used in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized the problem that
    the ambient and active sources of lighting, heating, ventilation, cooling, and
    shading are not synchronized in buildings. Such a computational control scheme
    is also suitable for reducing daily power usage. Similarly, numerous methods [211,212,213]
    considering HVAC systems have been proposed with respect to frequency regulation,
    predictive control, and smart controller. An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks
    environmental situations. It also notifies when measurements exceed thresholds
    and provides data on energy usage and consumption. In addition, it can autonomously
    turn equipment intermittently at programmed times. As individuals spend more time
    indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed spaces) than outdoors, the air quality
    inside buildings should be improved along with that of the external surroundings.
    This is the task of indoor Air Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS). The basic parts
    of an AQMS (Figure 5) are a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal
    conditioning circuit, a small amount of external memory, and a communication module
    that is typically wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors
    that can detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2,
    CO, and O3, as well as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity
    and temperature. These sensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values
    of the real-time indoor air quality parameters and an external memory used to
    store real-time data [214]. When deploying such systems, various communication
    (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and LoRAWAN technologies, are considered.
    Figure 5. Air Quality Monitoring Sensor System. Adapted from [215,216]. Figure
    5 shows a typical sensor system for an indoor environment for air quality monitoring.
    Figure 6 shows an SBA architecture [217]. The system of this architecture collects
    vital information about the various air quality parameters, including CO2, CO,
    particles (Particulate Matter PM10 and PM2.5), and some other crucial parameters
    such as humidity and temperature. By using gas sensor boards and wasp motes, the
    authors created a method for collecting and monitoring the indoor atmosphere.
    For monitoring CO2 and CO parameters, they also used TGS 4161 and TGS 2442 gas
    sensors. These sensors usually work using the resistive heating principle. The
    TGS 2442 sensor has excellent sensitivity to fluctuations in CO gas concentration.
    This sensor’s internal resistance, or “IR”, is inversely proportionate to the
    amount of CO present. As the CO content rises, the IR falls. While TGS 4161 also
    offers low power consumption and suggests better performance in detecting changes
    in CO2 gas concentration, the TGS4161 is ideally suited for indoor air control
    applications as it can measure 350–10,000 ppm carbon dioxide. The authors used
    the DustTrak DRX, a specialized aerosol laser photometer that simultaneously measures
    mass and size fraction, for PM1 and PM2.5 monitoring purposes. To define and create
    an interface to the deployed sensor for wireless transmission of gathered aerosol
    data, this photometer is connected to a base station device via LAN. The authors
    also set up ZB (ENs) at each location that was taken into consideration, which
    sent updates on the air quality and aerosols at regular periods to BS (ZBC) that
    had already been set up. Figure 6. IAQMS architecture. Adapted from [217,218].
    This system assesses the indoor air quality to assess the current state of the
    indoor environment while simultaneously providing real-time inputs for HVAC system
    management. The authors also designed a toolkit that analyzes real-time air quality
    data and displays them through meaningful representations to service the SBAs.
    Likewise, Lozano et al. [216] proposed another IAQMS technique that considers
    a star topological architecture [217]. The ZB (ENs) in this technique is based
    on the XBee and XBee pro-version modules. Nevertheless, the suggested scheme [216]
    considers a single pollutant only, i.e., suggesting using a GAC sensor. Conversely,
    the authors of [215] further claimed that they considered seven pollutants in
    their proposed implementation. IoE for Smart Building: To achieve optimal functionality
    and energy-efficient performance, Kim et al. [218] offered an overview of the
    design and implementation of energy-related SB technologies, including energy
    management systems, renewable energy applications, and current advanced smart
    technologies. Undoubtedly, the electricity sector of smart cities is impacted
    by the Internet of Energy (IoE), which aims to increase energy efficiency, prevent
    energy waste, and enhance environmental conditions by integrating IoT technologies
    into distributed energy systems. Two examples of IoE technology are intelligent
    sensor use and the incorporation of renewable energy sources. As a result, the
    IoE is becoming a tool for legal science to support the goals of a smart city.
    Metallidou et al. [219] discussed the factors that prompted the European Union
    to create regulations to make it easier to transition current towns into smart
    cities, starting with existing structures. To achieve energy efficiency, the authors
    suggested a smart building template that uses IoT technology to manage the performance
    of all technical systems. In addition, they suggested an automated remote-control
    technique supported by a cloud interface to enhance the certification of existing
    buildings for energy performance. This technology reduces time-consuming processes
    and stores the energy performance of each building on a cloud platform to make
    decisions and put measures in place. A review of current tactics in the field
    of active building energy management systems (BEMS) was offered by Mariano-Hernández
    et al. [220]. The authors reviewed articles on several BEMS management techniques
    for residential and non-residential buildings, including Model Predictive Control
    (MPC), Demand Side Management (DSM), Optimization, and Fault Detection and Diagnostics
    (FDD). MPC predicts building response to control requests, while DSM is an agreement
    of actions to improve the energy system on the user side. FDD is an automatic
    procedure of detecting and separating flaws in BEMS to protect a system from additional
    harm. Moudgil et al. [221] examined cutting-edge academic and industrial research
    to discover significant technological solutions that improve the integration of
    IoT in building infrastructure (BI). Their review also identifies key technical
    and non-technical problems that must be resolved through extensive research for
    BI to fully incorporate IoT. The authors contend that IoT in BI is still not operationally
    capable. IoT and BI stakeholders must make a concerted effort to give modern BI
    access to a generic IoT framework with cognitive intelligence and context-aware
    computing capabilities. 5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring Retrofitting
    the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some benefits,
    including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert
    utilities to pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network, allowing
    them to remotely adjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224]. Automation
    can be used for both operational procedures and components that provide functionality.
    For instance, when a water problem occurs during operation or with the element
    itself, the smart components inform the system center and then take action to
    avert a crash. The water utility can also determine a sensor’s requirement for
    maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic self-verification mechanism
    [225]. In [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid architecture
    that includes technical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework. Moreover,
    this smart water system (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms, simulation
    procedures, diagnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control mechanisms.
    Although an SWS incorporates offline performance, real-time performance is defined
    by online procedures such as online data monitoring, online data assimilation,
    online modeling, online charting, and online results output. An SWS must have
    real-time functionality to implement the necessary smart features [227]. Researchers
    put a lot of effort [228] into developing water systems that operate intelligently.
    Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time controlling, etc., which seek
    to reduce the lag between system input and system output, should be added to the
    smart performance of SWS. It was discovered that using SCADA would considerably
    increase the data transfer efficiency [229]. A smart water architecture [230]
    often includes five layers: (1) the physical layer; (2) the sensing and control
    layer; (3) the communication layer; (4) the data management layer; and (5) the
    data fusion layer. Within the framework of the GST4Water project, the authors
    of [230] presented a system that allows for receiving consumption data sent by
    a generic smart meter installed in a user’s house and transferring them to a cloud
    platform. The consumption data are saved and processed to characterize leakage
    at the district meter area and the individual user level. Meanwhile, the processed
    data are returned to the Water Utility and can be used for billing. On the other
    hand, they provide regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness of
    their consumption behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework
    based on FIWARE that aims to realize a highly flexible standards-based open-source
    software solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting
    of various FIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis
    et al. [232] considered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding
    conventional water metering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted
    bi-directional (whenever required) data exchange between water flow devices, metering
    equipment, and end-users. The authors’ ultimate objective is to design, implement,
    and deploy more sophisticated infrastructure offering improved performance in
    bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit the amount of data that needs to be
    shared between the various system layers, their approach makes use of the FogC
    paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water grid model. The Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the Efficient Water Resources
    Management project was funded by the European Commission under the auspices of
    the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the Smart Water project is to
    examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively managing urban water systems,
    with a focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues
    such as leakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.
    Kulkarni and Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,
    proposed a framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost
    of ownership, and highlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’ Smart
    Water case studies. Pipelines are used to transport water, gases, and oil. Since
    they are frequently underground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes them, which
    may result in leaks. In addition, water in the pipelines may get contaminated
    by infectious agents or substances that are mistakenly or purposely introduced
    into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline networks is crucial for maintaining
    public health and protecting the environment. The sensor node deployment profoundly
    impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline network monitoring, including
    coverage area, coverage population, and detection time. The sensor nodes should
    typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s junctions [234]. Given the
    design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor node deployment challenges
    are therefore formulated as integer optimization problems, where the integer variables
    represent the maximum amount of sensor nodes that must be placed at each junction.
    The deployment difficulties for pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging
    to solve because of the integer decision variables. Pipeline network flows are
    not predictable. As a result, depending on the flow pattern, the sensing performance
    of a deployed sensor node may vary. As a result, the flow pattern is taken into
    account in [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to decide
    how to deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a
    branch and bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify the
    ideal answer, the time complexity is typically significant. This means that large
    pipeline networks cannot be used with the method. Similarly, the study in [236]
    considers the various demand patterns of water flows through pipes. The authors
    used a genetic-based method to find the best deployment locations to increase
    coverage under various monitoring station demand patterns. The global optimum
    of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach. The performance of
    the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices. Consequently,
    we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks. Singapore’s WaterWise@SG
    program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate burst incidents [237,238].
    PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to find pipeline leaks, where
    three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure. To reduce
    water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track water consumption
    for businesses. A Steamflood and Waterflood Tracking System [240] has been created
    to find irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks and bottlenecks. With
    the aid of all these technologies, the investigators had the opportunity to evaluate
    the efficiency of the monitoring algorithms. However, these technologies rely
    on fixed sensors, and we still need to put innovative testbed models and systems
    built around crowd sensing and mobile WSN into place. 5.6. Architectures for Smart
    Transportation The Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce
    traffic congestion and accidents. It also enables information exchange involving
    the vehicle and all entities that may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking
    and vehicle intelligence are the two technologies that underpin IoV implementation.
    The three components that compose vehicle networking are the onboard information
    service, VANET, and mobile network. VANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range
    communication. Providing remote location, remote diagnostics, navigation, and
    other information services is referred to as an onboard information service. Every
    car can be utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks to mobile networks. Vehicle
    intelligence is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence
    (AI), big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing (CogC),
    to facilitate information sharing among people and vehicles, as well as between
    vehicles and the environment, infrastructure, or other vehicles. Vehicular networks
    consist of data-gathering sensors and inter-vehicle communication systems. Such
    networks require an open and flexible layered architecture to handle characteristics
    such as interoperability, scalability, dependability, and modularity. Recently,
    the research community proposed efficient vehicle network architectures. For example,
    the Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture [241] includes seven layers. Offering services
    and choosing messaging protocols are tasks that fall within the application layer.
    Data preprocessing, big data processing, and intelligent transmission are all
    tasks that the multimedia and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems,
    the cloud service layer’s ClCom and cloud virtualization technologies offer hardware
    computing platforms, infrastructure, and software services. In the UIoV architecture,
    the communication layer and the intra–inter devices layer are merged to accomplish
    the connectivity of many heterogeneous objects and networks. Notably, there is
    no intra–inter devices layer in classical architecture. The UIoV system’s physical
    objects layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter devices layer
    for additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are
    identified using the Identification Layer. Liu et al. [242] suggested another
    IoV network architecture to increase the flexibility of application management
    while enhancing the scalability and dependability of information services. This
    architecture has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety of
    nodes with various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of
    IoV is frequently changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced
    and transmitted at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the
    underlying resources, the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes
    and the network, computation, communication, and storage resources in IoV. To
    execute applications such as road safety management and data sensing, the control
    layer’s SDN controller is responsible for scheduling the abstraction resources
    of the virtualization layer and interacting with the application layer. A difficult
    topic in network architecture design is dealing with diverse networks. Interoperability,
    scalability, dependability, and adaptability are some of its network features.
    The design seeks to increase layer separation and network architecture’s total
    number of layers. In addition to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture
    should facilitate the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other
    communication devices. By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving
    systems, the learning ability of autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved.
    Utilizing both physical and network data space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles
    (CIoV) paradigm [243] improves network security and transportation safety. CIoV
    enables IoV to bear more accurate perceptive ability through cognition in the
    intra-vehicle network (driver, passengers, smart devices, etc.), inter-vehicle
    network (adjacent intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network (road environment,
    cellular network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture includes
    a cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road
    condition investigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture of
    CIoV. The gathering and preprocessing of big data from several sources are done
    by the sensing layer. As opposed to the previous communication layer (of other
    architectures), the architecture’s communication layer uses a cloud/edge hybrid
    structure to accommodate various application schedules. The data cognition engine
    at the cognition layer processes and interprets heterogeneous data streams (machine
    learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety of cognitive analysis approaches.
    The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in charge of allocating and scheduling
    network resources with the aid of technologies such as NFV, SDN, network slicing,
    and self-organized networking (SON). There are primarily two categories in the
    application layer (i.e., usual application services and intelligent transportation
    applications). Efficient message authentication and integrity are required to
    guarantee vehicle privacy and safeguard vehicular communications. To protect V2V
    and V2I communications in the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber
    threats, Karim [244] provided a cryptography-based routing solution. This solution
    includes a data encryption and decryption mechanism based on attributes and identity
    that has the lowest computational overhead while keeping the optimum level of
    security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245] suggested a seven-layer network architecture.
    The user interface layer, which controls information exchange between the user
    and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units (RSUs) and onboard
    sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing and filtering
    layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data before sending
    the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission. Making
    choices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities of control
    and management. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing layer
    to create the pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop assaults,
    the security layer directly manages each of the layers above. A unique network
    architecture with enhanced throughput, reduced latency, higher security, and widespread
    connectivity was recently proposed by Ji et al. [246]. This architecture consists
    of four layers: Security authentication layer: The RSUs on the road may monitor
    traffic environment data in real-time after setting several sensors, surveillance
    footage, and radar. This layer determines the legality of the car and RSU that
    are requesting to join the network. Perhaps an illegal vehicle or an RSU that
    has been installed unlawfully will attempt to steal or alter the information of
    a real vehicle. Data acquisition layer: This layer collects and categorizes many
    types of data from various networks. To ensure that the data can be sent to the
    edge layer securely, it digitizes the data. Edge layer: Edge devices produce several
    data streams. As a result, processing and analyzing data in one go using ClCom
    will result in significant delays. As a result, we must process data more closely
    related to the data source. The edge node, a physical device situated closest
    to the data source, is used by the edge layer to carry out basic processing and
    analysis on the acquired local data. It releases data analysis findings for nearby
    traffic incidents and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a local
    decision-making plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud data
    center’s computing power. Cloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses
    the information it has collected about global traffic in this tier, develops a
    plan, and rationally distributes traffic resources. This layer, having the ability
    to implement connection management, data management, aided autonomous driving,
    intelligent navigation, path planning, and information security, is the “smart
    brain” of the IoV. A blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)
    for the smart city was presented in [247]. Building innovative distributed transport
    management systems is made possible by the robust and secure Block-VN architecture.
    The authors considered how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused
    on networking and vehicular information. To handle real-time transportation data,
    Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing transportation data using Spark
    and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four layers: data collection and
    acquisition, network, data processing, and application. Each layer is built to
    process and manage data in a structured manner. On the data processing layer,
    Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing the suggested event and
    decision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249], the data are made available
    to a smart community member. The suggested approach was examined using transportation
    datasets from some reliable sources. The outcomes demonstrate data processing
    and real-time distribution to citizens in the shortest amount of time. Spark with
    the Hadoop environment produces findings that are quite accurate. From another
    viewpoint, Social IoV (SIoV) are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks
    [250], where vehicular nodes share/exchange information with different entities
    and are thus forth comparable with traditional social networks. Kerrache et al.
    [251] proposed a trust-aware communication architecture for social IoV (TACASHI),
    which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication architecture
    for SIoVs. 5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart Villages The smart village
    paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities using IoT technologies.
    In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried out, including smart agriculture,
    waste management, irrigation management, livestock management, smart energy, smart
    healthcare, and smart education. A smart village or smart rural area can enable
    real-time data analytics and automate decision-making for local villagers regarding
    healthcare, agriculture, environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from
    a smart city as there are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and
    sustainability) between urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart
    village goal, The European Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in
    which it proposed to interfere ICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254]
    addressed the meaning of “smart” in rural contexts as well as its link with sustainability.
    The European Commission-funded Smart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the
    ultimate goal of encouraging and motivating communities to create and execute
    smart village methods and tactics throughout Europe as a tool for rural development,
    serving as the authors’ primary source. IEEE Smart Village [256] also supports
    the world’s energy-impoverished communities by providing a complete solution combining
    renewable energy, community-based education, and entrepreneurial opportunities.
    Malik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart villages with
    different technologies. They concluded that digitization is only possible if a
    reliable and robust network and communication infrastructure are installed in
    the village environment. Shrestha and Drozdenko [258] proposed a Smart Rural framework
    to mitigate the effects of climate change using IoT and the Cloud, building a
    prototype on the Louisiana Tech University campus. Their framework is an energy-efficient
    monitoring system for observing the environmental conditions that affect agricultural
    production and human health. It consists of the following subsystems: Wireless
    Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud Services, and a Web Dashboard. The dashboard converts
    raw sensor data into meaningful information from which public officials and residents
    can adapt to or frustrate the effects of climate change. Monzon Baeza and Alvarez
    Marban [259] proposed a flexible and scalable Smart Rural system for gathering
    and processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional communication
    coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in separate
    segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS). Their
    proposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs of the
    system in the collection of IoT data from these remote rural areas, its coverage
    by space vehicles, and its processing and storage through 5G terrestrial networks
    and cloud services. Their proposal includes the deployment of IoT sensors and
    the development of Amazon Web Services. Conversely, the part of the space segment,
    considered by HAPS, has been simulated for different space channels. This method
    provides a complete and automated smart rural system that allows access to these
    IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet. To provide secure services
    close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored the integration of a Distributed
    Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with IoT in improving security and privacy
    solutions for villagers and consumer electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,
    the authors designed and evaluated the performance of an Intrusion Detection System
    (IDS) in a DFC-based smart village environment. Moreover, they discussed open
    security issues and challenges regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages.
    Rohan et al. [261] proposed a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering
    the resource constraints in a smart village. The authors illustrated the concept
    of collaborative edge computing as applicable to reduce cost and better manage
    the existing infrastructural facilities. Collaboration occurs between the multiple
    IoT edge devices (e.g., the edge data centers or edge routers) for data processing
    and storage. For example, in times of high computational load demand, one village’s
    edge devices can collaborate with another village’s edge devices. 6. Summary Various
    SCAs have different network requirements such as bandwidth, delay tolerance, power
    consumption, reliability, wireless connectivity, mobility, security, and privacy.
    Therefore, they need different protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network architectures
    for IoT are heterogeneous and include various network technologies such as WiFi,
    WSNs, Mesh Wireless Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile Communication
    Networks (MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these architectures must
    allow interoperability, while cross-layer design-based recommendations for power
    consumption and congestion control are well-suited proposals. State-of-the-art
    generic network architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm and are
    based on FogC to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.
    Fog and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in
    the future to fulfill QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efficiency.
    The CR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this technology
    can quickly reconfigure the operating parameters of the SG communication system
    to the changing requirements through cognition. By extracting usable data from
    both the physical and network data space, it is possible to increase network security
    and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures will become cognitive.
    These architectures will include cognitive data engines that will conduct cognition
    of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis,
    emotion analysis, and road condition investigation. The networking performance
    of SDN is better than the customary networking of smart buildings (SB). However,
    as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been facing some challenges such as
    network management in terms of maintenance, east–west interface, southbound interface,
    traffic management, energy, ML-based SDN networking for SB, and the network resources
    issue of SB SDN-based networking. 7. Open Research Issues −Network slicing management
    is required: IoT services such as smart transportation and smart energy have diversified
    requirements. To accommodate diverse IoT services, the network slicing paradigm
    is suggested because it enables multiple independent logical networks running
    on the same physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented an architecture
    for intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT) focusing
    on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).
    The authors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing
    management in this field. −NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The
    ETSI Industry Specification Group proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions
    that were before performed by some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the flexible
    provisioning of software-based network functionalities on top of an appropriately
    shared physical infrastructure by separating the network functions from the underlying
    hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing inexpensive commodity servers, it solves
    the issue of operating costs associated with administering and controlling this
    closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is used in conjunction with NFV (the
    software-defined NFV architecture), it can overcome the difficulties associated
    with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic resource management [263].
    SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service environment through NFV. As a
    result, the need for specialized hardware and labor-intensive effort to fulfill
    a new service request is avoided. In conjunction with the use of SDN, NFV also
    allows real-time and dynamic function provisioning along with flexible traffic
    forwarding. The SDN-IoT network may be improved and secured with NVF. It enables
    the software-based deployment of network devices as virtualized components. Throughput
    is increased because of NFV integration in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances
    network performance. To this end, Sinh et al. [264] proposed a practical model
    for hosting IoT services and building SDN controller applications to show that
    SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services. Recently, Mukherjee et al. [265]
    proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV implementation for smart
    cities. −Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology can
    address the bandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can be enabled
    with cognitive functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum accessing,
    circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs and services can be based
    on CR technology because it can do dynamic sensing and cognition of the surrounding
    environment. For example, in smart grid applications, cognitive IoT can achieve
    the objective of enabling users to know their energy consumption at any time and
    anywhere [267]. In smart home applications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can
    handle potential heterogeneous network interference [268]. At the same time, cognitive
    IoT can help with smoother real-time monitoring over longer distances in the healthcare
    industry without worrying about spectrum availability [269]. The complete utilization
    of cognitive radio technology in IoT demands extensive research in spectrum optimization,
    standardization, hardware design, privacy protection, heterogeneous network fusion,
    scalability and flexibility problems, etc. [270]. For this reason, many CIoT-based
    smart city network architectures must be proposed to solve such problems. In this
    regard, Park et al. [271] suggested a CIoT-based smart city network architecture
    that outlines how data collected from SCAs may be analyzed using the CogC paradigm
    and manage the scalability and flexibility challenges. −Challenges in IoT communication
    through TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access Points (APs) can utilize identical
    WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interference problems that can
    significantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many APs can provide
    support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with the DownLink
    multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY layer technology
    (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the capacity of WLANs
    by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations. As a result,
    it is possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to the number of antennas
    on APs. Thus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel and Singh [131] stressed
    the employment of CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods with many APs to improve
    the Compound TCP’s performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL
    method can accelerate the learning processes of the transport protocols such as
    Compound TCP. In FL, training data are dispersed across a large number of clients,
    each having unreliable and comparatively slow network connections, with the aim
    of developing a high-quality centralized model. The authors of [131] insisted
    on using these specialized strategies to coordinate numerous APs with regard to
    losses caused by unique wireless channel characteristics and WiFi downloading
    and uploading dynamics. Through the use of FL and CR approaches in dual AP settings,
    it is now possible to improve the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions. Another
    study [274] assumed TCP Cubic [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the
    FL approach for IoVs. The authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting
    the FL technique, which enhances the efficiency and privacy protection for the
    case of IoVs. −Digital Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources,
    personnel, procedures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital
    twin. Digital twin technology can be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including
    humans, IoT devices, aircraft engines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original
    vehicle is created, for instance, when an automobile business creates a virtual
    representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car model. If a manufacturer creates
    a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the replicated process
    is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a profile of the
    actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this virtual graphic,
    the dynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation are depicted.
    The digital twin can offer the location, state, and/or status of physical assets
    in real-time due to continual learning and advancements. This fusion of the real
    and digital worlds enables organizations to monitor systems, set strategies, and
    anticipate problems before they occur. Digital twins are created using digital
    twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure graphs, AI, software
    analytics, and the IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is demonstrated.
    This technology can efficiently administer the city, from urban planning to the
    optimization of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before
    putting them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.
    If a digital twin is in place, government organizations can only fully assess
    what might be achieved with the data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic
    opportunity, and establish a more cohesive community. Although the idea is currently
    novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few years [277]. −The 6G Network
    for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense and AI-centric
    city because massive device connectivity with vast data traffic is estimated in
    the future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted to the concept
    of Internet of Everything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart cities should have
    a huge bandwidth, low latency, and AI integration. Such networks should also provide
    ubiquity, high QoS, and on-demand content for thousands of interconnected devices.
    The 6G network [278] is the problem-solving network of futuristic cities, with
    huge bandwidth and low latency. It is under development for wireless communications
    technologies supporting cellular data networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks
    will probably be broadband cellular networks, in which the service area is divided
    into small geographical areas (cells). It is expected that 6G will be supported
    by existing 5G infrastructures such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing, together
    with new infrastructure. The network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:
    (1) ultra-fast data rates as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than
    1 ms; (3) increased mobility and coverage; (4) flexible and efficient connection
    of trillion level objects; (5) peak spectral efficiency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very
    high system reliability; and (7) improved network security [279]. However, the
    main problem of 6G is that transmitting at a higher frequency spectrum is prone
    to high path loss, making the distance for transmission limited [280]. The expected
    6G of the radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the capability
    of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability
    of carrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks, such
    as short-range and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can introduce
    complications and hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore, such complications
    of THz waves must be considered, and efficient AI-centric multilayer physical
    network architectures of 6G must be proposed for futuristic smart cities. Farooq
    et al. [280] considered the expectations from a network of futuristic smart cities
    and the problems of THz waves and proposed a conceptual terrestrial network (TN)
    architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a scalable multilayer architecture
    designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart cities. It provides an on-ground
    cloud network that helps smart devices to run AI applications partially on their
    own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore, the distributed and edge computing-oriented
    infrastructure of Bee Hive provides security and reduces traffic load on the upper
    layer of the network. Undoubtedly, pervasive AI is the main enabling technology
    in 6G, while some forms of AI are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples
    of using AI on wireless communications have been proposed, from physical layer
    designs (e.g., channel estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation
    (e.g., traffic control and cache storage management), to security and authentication,
    to dynamic cell and topology formation and management, to fault prediction and
    detection, etc. However, DL-based solutions require high computational complexity,
    which might not fit in current mobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity,
    Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based RL algorithms must be carefully designed
    to decrease the computational resources required on these devices [282]. Quantum
    communication [283] offers a promising approach to avoiding the challenge of limited
    computational resources and energy efficiency. Applying Artificial Neural Networks
    in IoT also comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy and computational/energy
    requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above issues and envisioned
    6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous systems. Apart
    from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important enabling technologies
    of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies are as follows: Reconfigurable
    Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reflect signals and help in places where
    maintaining Line of Sight (LoS) is difficult. RISs will be mainly deployed on
    doors, windows, and buildings. Cell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology
    is introduced in 5G with a more dense network of access points (APs), and this
    is further developed in 6G to include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287].
    Cell-Free Massive MIMO improves spectral efficiency in communication networks,
    but there are some health risks associated with such a dense network of APs. CubeSat
    communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class spacecraft)
    is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up to 6U, and
    U being 10 × 10 × 10 cm cubic units. UAVs/satellite communication. Terahertz communication
    and Optical Wireless Technology [289]. Blockchain technology [290] and quantum
    communication [283]. The development of futuristic smart cities keeps up with
    the development of energy-efficient 6G communication. Kamruzzaman [291] presented
    the key trends in the IoT for energy-efficient 6G wireless communication in smart
    cities. He argues that the application of IoT devices to 6G in smart cities will
    provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency rate, up to 1000 km/h mobility rate,
    100 bps/Hz spectral efficiency, and 1000 GHz frequency. This will resolve the
    issues of energy inefficiency and other concerns in conventional communication
    networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efficient 6G in smart cities via IoT devices
    probably will solve various problems that are encountered by existing smart city
    systems. In futuristic smart cities, residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer
    interface (BCI) technology [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on
    the signals and information that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable
    headsets and devices. It uses human consciousness more than external sources for
    better interaction. As humans have five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell,
    and taste), BCI comprises five datasets, comprising features of human senses that
    are used for human interaction with the machine [292]. 8. Conclusions Utilizing
    resources efficiently, reducing operating expenses, and enhancing city dwellers’
    quality of life are the objectives of the smart city paradigm. This goal is obtained
    by combining various technologies including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big data
    analytics, and robots. For this model, the effective networking and communication
    between the many components required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving
    its objectives. The ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic
    and manageable platforms for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings,
    smart home, smart water, and smart transportation systems. The networking needs
    of the key SCAs were examined in this research, and the appropriate protocols
    that can be applied at different system levels have been identified. Additionally,
    we provided examples of networking protocols and smart grid, intelligent building,
    smart residence, and smart transportation system architectures. We concentrated
    on key criteria for a variety of networking designs, such as energy savings, routing,
    security, dependability, mobility, and support for heterogeneous networks. In
    addition, we presented open research issues. This survey can assist researchers
    to recognize research gaps/problems working in the networking architectures for
    smart cities, and it provides an overview of available protocols and architectures
    for SCAs. Author Contributions Conceptualization, D.K.; methodology, D.K. and

  description: This study examined the interaction between land use and land cover
    (LULC) dynamics, trend and thermal stress distribution using the universal thermal
    comfort index (UTCI) and different LULC classifications under two Coupled Model
    Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (i.e., SSP
    370 and 585) climate and land use scenarios for the historical (1959–2014) and
    future period (2045–2100). The moderate to strong cold stress in the annual and
    winter climatology in the midlatitudes was replaced by no thermal stress in the
    summer, while the summertime ranged from moderate to strong heat stress. A negative
    correlation was observed between thermal stress and southern hemispheric primary
    forests. Perennial croplands had the most dynamic changes in intensity during
    the historical period. Primary and secondary forests had an active influence on
    global thermal stress. Areas in the tropics recording moderate heat stress coincided
    with secondary nonforest, pastureland, and annual cropland expansions. The conversion
    of forest to range land and croplands and the subsequent negative forest trends
    increased the severity of thermal stress. The future projection showed intense
    thermal stress; however, the SSP-585 signals were more potent. As a result, cooling
    demands will rise, and heating demands will decline, yet, improved thermal comfort
    necessitates a higher cooling capacity, especially in the summer. Thermal stress
    may make it difficult for many cooling systems to meet people's energy demands.
    These could be a driving factor in shaping better land use policies, improving
    energy demand preparedness, and elucidating the potentially severe impacts of
    thermal stress.

    Highlights • Primary nonforest and secondary forests actively influence global
    thermal stress. • Negative forest trends increased the severity of thermal stress.
    • Future cooling demands will rise, and heating demands will decline. • UTCI trend
    decreases at higher latitudes in the winter. • Sub-periods with fast annual LULC
    changes recorded more significant UTCI trends. Abstract This study examined the
    interaction between land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics, trend and thermal
    stress distribution using the universal thermal comfort index (UTCI) and different
    LULC classifications under two Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)

    for the historical (1959–2014) and future period (2045–2100). The moderate to
    strong cold stress in the annual and winter climatology in the midlatitudes was
    replaced by no thermal stress in the summer, while the summertime ranged from
    moderate to strong heat stress. A negative correlation was observed between thermal
    stress and southern hemispheric primary forests. Perennial croplands had the most
    dynamic changes in intensity during the historical period. Primary and secondary
    forests had an active influence on global thermal stress. Areas in the tropics
    recording moderate heat stress coincided with secondary nonforest, pastureland,
    and annual cropland expansions. The conversion of forest to range land and croplands
    and the subsequent negative forest trends increased the severity of thermal stress.
    The future projection showed intense thermal stress; however, the SSP-585 signals
    were more potent. As a result, cooling demands will rise, and heating demands
    will decline, yet, improved thermal comfort necessitates a higher cooling capacity,
    especially in the summer. Thermal stress may make it difficult for many cooling
    systems to meet people''s energy demands. These could be a driving factor in shaping
    better land use policies, improving energy demand preparedness, and elucidating
    the potentially severe impacts of thermal stress. Previous article in issue Next

    ONI Oceanic Niño Index 1. Introduction The increase in the world''s population
    has led to land use land cover (LULC) modifications while impacting the ecosystem,
    environment and biodiversity [1]. This increased the global bioenergy and food
    demand which has been associated with the rise in global warming levels [[1],
    [2], [3]]. LULC changes also cause the depletion of natural resources, a deterioration
    in ecosystem services, and modifications in the occurrence and intensities of
    climate extremes, terrestrial surface biogeophysical properties [3,4]. According
    to Zvoleff et al. [5], land use change is how human activities alter the natural
    landscape. Population dynamics, urban expansion, food production and consumption
    trends, energy demand, deforestation, growth in croplands, natural landscape modification,
    and disproportionate mining of natural resources are the main drivers of land
    use change [[6], [7], [8]]. These changes affect the land-air interface, the hydrological
    cycle, and ecosystems at different scales. According to Ellis and Ramankutty [9],
    human activity has disrupted around 75% of the world''s natural forests since
    the last ice age. With the industrial revolution advancement and globalization
    trends, intensive land utilization, LULC change became a pertinent issue. For
    instance, mechanization, chemical fertilizers, sophisticated irrigation systems,
    the green revolution, and population growth all increased croplands [10]. Natural
    short- and long-term processes such as wildfires, desertification, land degradation,
    and glaciation/de-glaciations have also been associated with unavoidable changes
    in LULC [11]. Several studies [[12], [13], [14], [15]] have reported the link
    between climate and land use to be multidimensional and remarkably complex. While
    land plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere interchange, it also regulates
    the global concentration of greenhouse gases via the release of stored carbon
    [16]. For example, Laskar and Bohra [17] observed a strengthening or weakening
    of the Indian summer monsoon due to LULC modifications, resulting in water scarcity,
    increasing temperature and delayed rainfall accompanied by heatwaves and thermal
    stress. Bergkamp [18] noted that climate change-related issues would exacerbate
    with more modifications to the natural forest and consequently modifies the pattern
    and circulation of global wind systems [19,20]. Haughan [21] associated forest
    losses with a negative trend in rainfall. Ravindranath and Sukumar [22] found
    that tropical forests are diminishing due to forest fires [23]. Additionally,
    climate extremes associated with LULC changes will negatively impact water quality
    and quantity [24,25] and aggravate flooding, storm surges and urban heat island
    [26,27], heat and cold waves [28], and related thermal stress [29]. As a result
    of the accompanying heat or cold waves, the energy demand is modified. Graczyk
    et al. [30] examined Poland''s energy demand increase and reported that energy
    consumption during the summer months was similar to that of winter in recent decades
    due to the longer and more intense heatwaves. Hosseini et al. [31] argued that
    cooling demand in Sweden would be five times higher within the next decade, while
    the heating demand was projected to decrease in the future. They concluded that
    thermal stress could raise annual overheating hours by 140% in residential areas.
    Similarly, Yang et al. [32] projected an increase in thermal stress in Europe
    due to increased heatwaves frequencies. However, this will raise cooling demand
    by 28%, while the cooling systems indoors could be damaged due to overheating.
    Du et al. [33] related air-conditioning load in Hong Kong to urban heat islands
    and concluded that increased thermal stress during heatwaves would raise energy
    demand for space. Besides energy consumption, the 2021 IPCC report [3] specified
    that thermal stress due to increased global temperature would reduce labour efficiency,
    trigger substantial economic damage, and harm health (e.g. heat stroke and frostbite)
    [34]. Mora et al. [34] reported that more than 50% of the world''s population
    would be adversely affected by thermal stress by the end of the century. Previous
    studies have either examined the effect of thermal stress on regional energy demand
    or assessed the changes in the occurrence of extreme climate events due to climate
    change. Others [28,[35], [36], [37]] examined the different heatwaves characteristics
    and projections; however, most studies solely evaluate the influence of air temperature,
    which is a poor indicator of human heat stress. In humid tropical climates, for
    instance, estimating heatwave intensity based on temperature may underestimate
    the severity of a heatwave, as excessive humidity throughout successive hot days
    can magnify the impact of strong heatwaves [38]. Therefore, human-perceived thermal
    stress in terms of relative humidity, solar radiation, air temperature and wind
    speed dynamics may display distinct features from temperature-based heatwaves.
    Also, this perception could be different if examined on seasonal scales, during
    climate variability modes like El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or at different atmospheric
    circulation domains. Heatwaves projections have been based on climate models.
    Nevertheless, there are often contradictions between climate models and reference
    data due to the various land surface schemes and modelling of factors [37,39,40].
    Therefore, these biases must be rectified before generating climate impact projections
    [[39], [40], [41]]. Also, the role of LULC dynamics in modulating thermal stress
    has not been clarified. Previous studies do not also provide an informed decision
    on which LULC category significantly impacts changes in thermal stress. This is
    important due to the interdependence of the LULC categories dynamics on the thermal
    stress response. Hence, quantifying the marginal and conditional effects of different
    LULC categories on thermal stress is crucial because a LULC category that may
    appear to be influential marginally may be independent of the thermal stress response
    when considered conditionally on another LULC category [37,42]. Therefore, the
    present study contributes to a better understanding of the interaction between
    LULC dynamics and thermal stress distribution using the universal thermal comfort
    index (UTCI) [43] derived from bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
    Phase 6 (CMIP6) [44] models. Here, the UTCI was used to categorize thermal stress.
    It is superior to other indices in depicting thermal conditions because it combines
    an advanced body''s physiological model with a front-line clothing insulation
    model for outdoor climates [45]. Understanding the interaction between LULC dynamics
    and thermal stress could be a driving factor in shaping better land use policies,
    sustainable land use practices, improved energy demand preparedness and elucidating
    the potentially severe impacts of thermal stress under different climates, and
    land use scenarios, seasonal and climate variability modes. 1.1. Material and
    methods UTCI was initiated using ERA5 [46] relative humidity, wind speed, radiant
    and air temperature during the historical period (1959–2014), while the future
    projection (2045–2100) was based on four CMIP6 models, with the multimodel ensemble
    mean (ENS) (Table A1), under the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) regional
    rivalry (SSP3), and fossil-fuelled development (SSP5). A trend-preserving Inter-Sectoral
    Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP) approach [47] was used to bias-correct
    the CMIP6 models before being used to generate UTCI. Notably, all corrected models
    exhibited similar UTCI signals (Fig. S1). ENS was subjected to validation at different
    time scales (Fig. S2). There was a consistently good performance across the time
    scales. This demonstrates that bias correction lowers the disparities between
    observed and simulated climate variables; reducing uncertainty in uncorrected
    CMIP6 models. As a result, ENS was used in the subsequent sections. Furthermore,
    the two SSPs were integrated with climate model projections based on long-term
    global average radiative forcing levels provided by two carbon representative
    concentration pathways (RCPs), 4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 [44]. The CMIP6 dataset combines
    observations with other exogenous forcings like volcanic aerosols, solar variability,
    and changes in the atmospheric composition of greenhouse gases and atmospheric
    aerosols [48]. While SSP585 is the only SSP with emissions adequate to provide
    the 8.5 W/m2 level of forcing in 2100 [49], SSP370 represents the medium-to-high
    end of projected future emissions and temperature scenarios [44]. In SSP585, technical
    advancement, notably agricultural production, is strong while characterized by
    fast and resource-intensive development and material-intensive consumption habits.
    As a result, the SSP585 scenario uses very high amounts of fossil fuels, ups the
    global food demand by a factor of two, and ups greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
    by up to three over the century. On the other hand, SSP3 assumes that population
    growth is high in developing countries and moderate in industrialized nations,
    while economic progress is gradual and material intensive. Also, changes in land
    use are rarely controlled. The historical LULC data was derived from the History
    Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) [10]. HYDE offers long-term historical,
    spatially specific time series of population estimates and land use reconstructions
    from the Holocene to the present at 0.5° resolution. The information for the future
    LULC was derived from eight distinct marker SSP-RCP scenarios developed from two
    separate Integrated Assessment Models [50]. The Regionalized Model of Investment
    and Development (REMIND) [51] and the Model of Agricultural Production and its
    Impacts on the Environment (MAgPIE) [52] comprise the REMIND-MAgPIE integrated
    assessment modelling framework. The REMIND global multiregional energy-economy
    general equilibrium model combines a macroeconomic growth model and a bottom-up
    engineering-based energy model. Subsequently, pricing and quantity data exchange
    on bioenergy and GHG emissions couples REMIND and MAgPIE [53]. The baseline REMIND-MAgPIE
    SSP5 scenario, which has a radiative forcing near RCP8.5, provides the basis for
    the future LULC SSP585 scenario [53]. LULC SSP370 scenario [54] is derived from
    the Asia-Pacific Integrated assessment Model/Computable General Equilibrium model
    (AIM/CGE [54]) along with a land use allocation model [55]. AIM couples the economy,
    energy systems, land use, and climate. AIM dynamically modifies prices until the
    supply and demand for products and services, including those related to energy,
    industry, agriculture, and forestry, are balanced. Future LULC datasets have a
    spatial resolution of 0.25°. All datasets were regridded to a 1° by 1° resolution
    using bilinear interpolation to eliminate the erroneous scale gap effect [37].
    Finally, the UTCI and LULC changes for the historical and future periods under
    SSP 370 and 585 were analyzed. 2. Calculation 2.1. Thermal stress categorization
    The UTCI was used to categorize thermal stress. This gives a one-dimensional variable
    that accurately captures physiological responses to a multidimensionally defined
    actual thermal situation [56]. Additionally, it was built to function effectively
    across spatiotemporal scales and in all climates and seasons. The classification
    of UTCI is based on the physiological stress level. UTCI values (in °C) greater
    than 46 are categorized as extreme heat stress, from 38 to 46 as very strong heat
    stress, between 32 and 38 are strong heat stress, from 26 to 32 as moderate heat
    stress, between 9 and 26 as no thermal stress, from 0 to 9 as slight cold stress,
    from 0 to −13 as moderate cold stress, from −13 to −27 as strong cold stress,
    from −27 to −40 as very strong cold stress and below −40 is classified as extreme
    cold stress. The technical details of UTCI calculation is presented by Refs. [43,45].
    2.2. LULC transitions The geographical distribution of LULC dynamics involves
    examining the land transitions, determining the pattern of change, and establishing
    the evolution processes through intensity analysis [57,58]. The intensity analysis
    aimed to answer the following questions: (a) The interval intensity: When does
    the yearly pace of LULC change become comparatively slower vs quicker? (b) The
    category intensity: Which LULC categories are largely inactive compared to active
    at a given time? And (c) Transition intensity: which transitions, within a specific
    LULC category and time frame, are actively avoided vs targeted? The yearly intensity
    change St for the time interval is given as: (1) The uniform line of intensity
    U is given as: (2) The gross gain annual intensity of category j for time interval
    is given as (3) The gross loss annual intensity of category i for time interval
    is given as (4) The transition annual intensity from category i to category n
    in time interval is: (5) Uniform transition intensity values from all non-n categories
    to n category at a time during time interval is given as (6) Where is the transitioned
    pixel numbers from category i at the time to category j at time , J is the categories
    number, i is the index for a category at the initial time point for a particular
    time interval, j is the index for a category at the ﬁnal time point for a specific
    time interval, m is the index for the losing category in the transition of interest,
    n is the index for the gaining category in the transition of interest, T is the
    number of time points, t is the index for the initial time point of the interval
    ; where t ranges from 1 to T-1, Yt is the year at time point t. More technical
    details are highlighted in Aldwaik and Pontius [57,58], Exavier and Zeihofer [59].
    2.3. Thermal stress response to LULC categories Due to the mutuality of different
    LULCs, the causal influence of different LULC categories on the thermal stress
    response was also quantified. Several methods have been proposed to assess this,
    but the most popular is the permutation of importance based on the random forest
    algorithm [60]. However, this approach is not suitable for highly correlated events
    as it is crucial to distinguish between an event''s conditional and marginal influence.
    Therefore, a modified machine learning random forest algorithm- Conditional Permutation
    Importance (CPI) [42,60,61] was used to understand the thermal stress response
    to LULC dynamics. This modified algorithm accounts for both the conditional and
    marginal influence of LULC dynamics on UTCI changes. The CPI is presented as.
    (a) For the regression trees in the random forest (7) (b) For the classification
    trees in the random forest (8) (9) where and are the prediction error of tree
    t in a random forest with predictors p and ntrees of trees based on the out-of-bag
    sample , respectively, before the permutation of the out-of-bag values of . is
    the out-of-bag cardinal number sample for tree t, and I (k) is the indicator function.
    is the function , which is the random forest prediction of the out-of-bag observation
    i before permutation. is the ith observation after permutation. The forest permutation
    of importance is the average overall tree-wise permutation . (10) where  =  .
    In the CPI, out-of-bag values of one predictor are conditionally permuted on other
    predictors . Further details on CPI is documented in Debeer and Strobl [60]. Subsequently,
    the Mann-Kendall test [[62], [63], [64]] quantified the spatial trend, while the
    Student''s t-test at a 95% confidence level [39,65] enumerated the significant
    plot. 2.4. Selecting climate variability modes One of the global climate variability
    modes is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO; El Niño and La Niña). El Niño
    is the unusually warm surface water in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The
    west coast of the Americas receives a rush of warm water from the east. Trade
    winds are much stronger than usual during La Niña occurrences, bringing warmer
    water into Asia. These episodes in the eastern tropical Pacific was categorized
    using the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) [66]. The Niño 3.4 region''s (5°N-5°S, 120°-170°W)
    average sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly over the previous three months defines
    the ONI. El Niño and La Niña episodes are recognized as five overlapping 3-month
    periods with anomalies of +0.5 °C or higher for the former and −0.5 °C or lower
    for the latter. For this study, a super La Niña or super El Niño year exhibits
    SST anomalies ≥1.5 °C. 3. Results 3.1. UTCI climatology, LULC trends and correlation,
    and demographic variables The delineation of the different atmospheric circulation
    cell domains in conjunction with the topography is shown in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows
    the distribution of the dominant LULC on a global scale. In Fig. 1b, primary land
    is the natural vegetation, whether forest or nonforest, that human interventions
    have not altered (e.g., farming) since the simulation''s inception. Additionally,
    secondary land refers to naturally occurring vegetation (forest or nonforest)
    that regrows after prior human disturbance. The simulation assumes that even being
    quite mature, secondary lands cannot change into the primary condition. Download

    Index (UTCI, oC) Climatology (g–i) between 1959 and 2014. In 1 b, primf means
    primary forest, primn is primary non forest, secdf is secondary forest, secdn
    is secondary non forest, range is rangeland, pastr is pasture, cper is perennial
    cropland and cann is annual cropland. Summer refers to northern hemispheric June,
    July, August, and September, while Winter refers to northern hemispheric December,
    January and February. The percentage per grid cell area of the dominant LULC categories
    for 1959 and 2014 (Fig. A.1) shows a general reduction in primary forest for all
    continents by up to 20%. In contrast, the secondary forest increased, notably
    in Asia, Europe, and North America. Over Africa, the primary nonforest areas significantly
    reduced. This means this LULC category has been transformed into other LULC categories.
    There is also a consistent increase in rangeland, especially in Asia and Africa.
    The LULC trend (Fig. A.2) shows a general negative decadal trend in the global
    primary forests, ranging from −1 to −11%; however, most pixels were replaced by
    positive trends in secondary forests except for some areas in southeastern China.
    There was also a general negative trend in primary nonforest in Africa; this same
    region also witnessed a positive trend (up to 11%/grid cell area/decade) in secondary
    nonforest. There was a prevalent positive trend in the annual and permanent croplands
    in Africa, South America, Asia, and Oceania, with values ranging between 0 and
    5%. The demography shows the rural, urban, and total population (Fig. 1d–f). For
    example, in comparison with the urban area coverage, most of the urban population
    in the USA lives in the urban areas with the highest population cluster (∼1 million
    people/grid cell) in the highly developed urban areas (17%/grid cell area) (Fig.
    1c). However, the high disparity between the urban (1.3 million) and rural (2.3
    million) populations, especially in India, shows that people prefer rural areas
    over urban centres. Hence, the effect of urban heat islands is reduced in areas
    with a low concentration of urban population. The climatology of the UTCI (Fig.
    1g–i) demonstrates different distributions across seasons. Most tropical north
    and south countries show no thermal stress in the yearly climatology. However,
    the summertime ranged from moderate to strong heat stress. In contrast, the moderate
    to strong cold stress in the annual and winter climatology in the midlatitudes
    was replaced by no thermal stress in the summer. The correlation between the dominant
    LULC categories and the yearly UTCI (Fig. A.3) shows significant negative correlations
    in the southern hemispheric primary forests. However, a high correlation (>−0.54)
    was seen in areas with higher percentages of primary forest grid cell area (Fig.
    S3). Forest lowers the daytime surface temperature, thereby reducing the UTCI
    values. The positive correlation in most northern hemispheric primary forests
    may be due to the forest and leaf types. For example, dark leaves of trees can
    also raise temperatures by absorbing sunlight. Furthermore, most ssecondary forests
    witnessed a positive correlation with UTCI. Similarly, most areas with negative
    correlations for primary nonforest turned positive for secondary nonforest. This
    shows that alteration in the LULC modifies the UTCI. Over Africa, places with
    positive correlations over rangelands were reversed over pasturelands. In general,
    both annual and perennial croplands mainly exhibited positive correlations with
    UTCI in the tropics, while this was reversed in the mid-latitudes. This may be
    a result of their fast thermal conductivity. 3.2. LULC categories transition and
    change intensity An 11-year rolling period over five periods, i.e., 1959–1970
    (Period 1), 1970–1981 (Period 2), 1981–1992 (Period 3), 1992–2003 (Period 4) and
    2003–2014 (Period 5), for the historical period and 2045–2056 (Period 1), 2056–2067
    (Period 2), 2067–2078 (Period 3), 2078–2089 (Period 4) and 2089–2100 (Period 5)
    for the future periods under SSP 370 and 585 were analyzed. 3.2.1. Categorical
    and transition states In the historical Period 1 (Fig. 2a), the secondary forest
    had the most prominent global gain area (∼2.5 million km2), while the primary
    forest had the smallest. Even though the uniform intensity gain in this period
    was 0.4%, secondary forest and secondary nonforest recorded more active gain intensity
    (>0.4%), while primary nonforest and primary forest recorded 0.1 and 0% gain intensity,
    respectively. It is worth noting that a uniform intensity would exist if the transitions
    were distributed uniformly among the LULC categories available for the transition.

    Fig. 2. Categorical intensities of all LULC types (a and b), and Transition intensities
    for (c) secondary non forest (d) primary forest for the historical period. Active
    transitions are the areas extending beyond the uniform rate line, while passive/dormant
    transitions fall below the unform rate line. In historical Period 2, secondary
    forest retained the most gained area (∼1.9 million km2), but the pastureland recorded
    the most actively gained intensity (2.4%). The same holds for historical Period
    3, although with an increased gained area and intensity. In historical Period
    4, secondary nonforest witnessed the biggest gained area (over 3 million km2)
    while the most actively gained intensity was recorded over pastureland. In contrast,
    the most actively gained intensity was observed over the perennial cropland (10%);
    however, with a small gained area (<10,000 km2) for historical period 5. For loss
    areas and intensities (Fig. 2b), primary forest lost more areas (over 3 million
    km2) during the historical Period 1. Still, the most active loss was from pastureland,
    while the primary nonforest loss intensity was dormant. During the historical
    Period 3, the primary nonforest loss intensity was more active. However, the pastureland
    recorded the most active loss intensity, while the primary nonforest witnessed
    the most lost areas (over 3 million km2). The gain and losses comparison in historical
    Period 4 revealed that the perennial cropland had the most dynamic active change
    intensities, although the lost area was more than the gained area. As an example
    of transitions from other LULC categories to a targeted category, the transition
    intensity for secondary nonforest gain (Fig. 2c) revealed that most gains were
    from the primary nonforest for all sub-periods (with a range of between 1.1 million
    km2 in period 1 to 1.8 million km2 in period 3). However, the most active gain
    intensity was from pastureland in periods 3 (0.6%) and 4 (0.5%). Fig. 2d elucidated
    the loss areas and intensity from primary forest to other LULC categories. For
    the whole period, losses in the primary forest resulted in gains in the secondary
    forest. Likewise, the most active loss intensities were to secondary forest throughout
    the sub-periods except for Periods 4 and 5, when pastureland overshadowed the
    secondary forest by > 0.5%. The projection period (Figs. S3 and S4) showed a dominant
    gain LULC category switch. Under SSP 370 Period 1, annual cropland gained the
    most (1.8 m km2), while pastureland had the most gained and actively gained intensity
    (2%). However, the gained area and gained intensity were reduced for Period 5
    by 200,000 km2 and 1%, respectively. Under SSP 585, the projection Period 1 showed
    a dominant gained area for secondary forest (1.2 million km2), while the most
    actively gained intensity was the pastureland (1.8%). However, in Period 5, the
    secondary forest had the dominant gained area (2.4 million km2) and most actively
    gained intensity (0.7%). Furthermore, losses from primary forest were evident
    for all periods and SSPs. However, lost areas from other LULC categories to secondary
    nonforest differ, but most losses were from the secondary forest. Moreover, the
    highest loss intensity was from perennial cropland under SSP 585 (1.3%). 3.2.2.
    LULC dynamics, net change, and evolution Fig. 3 shows the LULC dynamics during
    the historical period. In Fig. 3a, the transition from various LULC categories
    was evident between 1959 and 2014. For example, the total size of the primary
    forest was 48 million km2 in 1959 but reduced to 38 million km2 in 2014.0.15 million
    km2 was lost to primary nonforest, 7.8 million km2 to secondary forest, 1.5 million
    km2 to rangeland, 0.39 million km2 to pastureland, and 0.54 million km2 to annual
    cropland (supplementary file Table T1). Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    4 was the most dynamic (>0.4% in annual change area), while subperiod 2 was the
    least (<0.3%). The primary nonforest recorded the most significant gross changes
    (−1.5 billion km2 to < 500 million km2) and net loss, while the secondary forest
    had the highest net gain (Fig. 3c). The evolution of the LULC (Fig. 3d) shows
    differences in the LULC categories for different years. In general, the primary
    forest and primary nonforest decreased across the years while rangeland, secondary
    nonforest, secondary forest and annual cropland increased. For the future, under
    SSP 370 (Fig. S5), the primary forest reduced by 2.3 million km2 while losing
    0.31 million km2 to primary nonforest, 7 million km2 to secondary forest, 0.15
    million km2 to perennial cropland and 0.85 million km2 to annual cropland. All
    subperiods except period 5 showed fast dynamics; however, period 2 showed the
    highest annual change area of 0.3% of the domain. The results for SSP 585 are
    presented in Fig. S6. Although the uniform rate of annual change area for the
    historical period was 0.37%, the future scenario indicated 0.28% and 0.19% under
    SSP 370 and 585, respectively. These dynamics were further assessed over the six
    continents (Table T2). For example, 0.23 million km2 of primary forest in Africa
    was lost to secondary forest; in Asia, it was 1.9 million km2; in Europe, it was
    4.5 million km2. In general, Europe lost most primary forests to secondary forests.
    The sub-periodical changes and transformations for the historical and future time
    slices are presented in Tables T3-T6. 3.3. UTCI dynamics and trend Fig. 4a–f shows
    that the thermal stress ranged from excess cold stress to moderate heat stress
    during the historical sub-periods. However, the trends (Fig. 4g-l) varied between
    −4 and 4 °C/decade, with Periods 2 and 3 having the most spread of high trends.
    Even though the spatial spread of the thermal stress looked similar, the trends
    varied. This implied that, for example, places with negative trends tend towards
    the upper bound of the previous thermal stress category. In contrast, areas with
    positive trends tend towards the lower bound of the next category. The significant
    trends also varied. The least significant trends were observed in Periods 2 and
    3. Considering the entire period (Fig. 4l), the southern hemisphere experienced
    more negative trends than the northern hemisphere. Download : Download high-res

    Dots represent significant correlation at a 95% confidence interval. The five
    periods are represented in Fig. 3b. MHS is moderate heat stress, NS means no thermal
    stress, SLCS means slight cold stress, MCS denotes moderate cold stress, SCS means
    strong cold stress, VSCS is very strong cold stress, and ECS denotes extreme cold
    stress. During the summer (Fig. S7), the thermal stress ranged from very strong
    cold stress to strong heat stress. However, the spread varied for each sub-period.
    Additionally, Periods 3, 4 and 5 witnessed more strong heat stress than other
    sub-periods. The trends varied from −5 to 7 °C/decade, with Period 4 having the
    least spread of positive trends. However, like the annual scale, the least significant
    trends were observed in Periods 2 and 3. The winter spread is described in Fig.
    S8. For the projection under SSP 370 (Fig. S9), the annual thermal stress ranged
    from very strong cold stress to very strong heat stress, while the trend ranged
    from −4 and 4 °C/decade. Period 5 had the least significant trends. Under SSP
    585 (Fig. S10), the annual thermal stress ranged from very strong cold stress
    to very strong heat stress, while the trend ranged from −2 and 4 °C/decade. Periods
    1 and 2 had the least significant trends. Compared with the LULC dynamics, it
    was evident that sub-periods with fast annual changes recorded more significant
    trends than sub-periods with slow yearly changes. 3.4. Distribution of UTCI over
    different LULC The spread of thermal stress over different LULCs was examined
    to understand the distribution of the thermal stress category. Also, years with
    ENSO were included to investigate ENSO''s effect on thermal stress distribution
    over the LULC categories. The summer thermal stress distribution over the tropical
    north (Fig. 5) indicated that the mean distribution over the primary forest experienced
    no thermal stress in 1959. The 75th percentile experienced moderate heat stress,
    while the 25th experienced no thermal stress. However, the distribution ranged
    from slight cold stress to slight heat stress. Notwithstanding, most of the distribution
    lay within the no thermal stress zone. The secondary forest distribution followed
    the same pattern, although with an overshoot at both ends of the range. The secondary
    nonforest had a mean distribution, the 25th and 75th percentile experienced moderate
    heat stress. The spread varied from no thermal stress to very strong heat stress.
    The annual cropland''s mean and 75th percentile lay in the moderate thermal stress
    zone, while the 25th percentile experienced no thermal stress. Pastureland''s
    range varied from strong cold stress to strong heat stress. The mean and 25th
    percentile lay in the no thermal stress zone, while the 75th percentile experienced
    moderate heat stress. The perennial cropland ranged from no thermal stress to
    strong heat stress. The mean and 75th percentile for rangeland lay in the moderate
    heat stress zone, while the 25th percentile experienced no thermal stress. The
    mean and 75th percentile of the primary nonforest lay in the moderate heat stress
    zone, while the 25th percentile experienced no thermal stress. The range was between
    no thermal stress and very strong heat stress. Download : Download high-res image

    non forest, secdf is secondary forest, secdn is secondary non forest, range is
    rangeland, pastr is pasture, cper is perennial cropland and cann is annual cropland.
    During super La Niña (1999), most of the distribution followed what was earlier
    reported; however, the shape of the distribution differed. During super El Niño
    (1987), the thermal stress range mimicked the earlier reported range for each
    LULC category; however, some other distribution properties differed. For example,
    in 1959, the 75th percentile of secondary nonforest experienced moderate heat
    stress, but in the super El Niño year, it changed to strong heat stress. For the
    future under SSP 370 (Fig. S11), the lower bounds of primary forest, secondary
    forest, pastureland, and rangeland experienced slight cold stress, while others
    experienced no thermal stress between 2045 and 2067. The upper bounds of all LULCs
    except the primary forest witnessed very strong heat stress during the same time
    frame. However, the range for most LULC categories varied from no thermal stress
    to extreme heat stress from 2078 to 2100. Under SSP 585 (Fig. S12), the distribution
    for all LULC categories except for primary and secondary forests varied from no
    thermal stress to strong heat stress in 2045, while from 2078 to 2100, it varied
    from no thermal stress to extreme heat stress. However, the density shapes, curves,
    and data point frequencies varied for each LULC at various periods [28]. Figs.
    S13–S17 depict the thermal stress distribution over the atmospheric circulation
    domain during the historical period, while Figs. S18 and S19 describe the future
    distribution under SSP 370. Figs. S20 and S21 described the same properties under
    SSP 585. 3.5. LULC classes modulating thermal stress and regional thermal stress
    distribution While the various LULC categories have different modulating influences
    on the thermal stress distribution, it is vital to determine the LULC category
    modulating thermal stress the most. Fig. 6 revealed that primary nonforest influenced
    thermal stress distribution more than any other LULC category in Africa, Asia,
    Midlatitude North, Tropical North and the entire globe in the historical period.
    However, in the future period under SSP 370 (Fig. S22), annual cropland was the
    most influential LULC category over Africa, South America, and the Tropical North.
    At the same time, secondary forest ranked first over the Tropical South, Europe,
    North America, Oceania, and the entire world. Furthermore, under SSP 585 (Fig.
    S23), primary forest ranked first over Africa, Asia, North America, South America,
    Tropical South, and Polar north for the future. Download : Download high-res image

    during the annual and summer periods for the historical and future time slices.
    For the annual season, most areas in Europe, Central Asia, and North America witnessed
    thermal stress (i.e., cold or heat stress). However, most regions of North Africa,
    the Middle East, Caribbean, Pacific, and Sub-Saharan Africa recorded no thermal
    stress. Moreover, in the future projection under SSP 370 and 585, the thermal
    stress had spread to regions with little or no historical thermal stress in Sub-Saharan
    Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Nevertheless, fewer places in Europe
    and North America witnessed thermal stress. Download : Download high-res image

    White dots represent areas without thermal stress. Furthermore, the summer climatology
    revealed that most regions in North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, and the
    Pacific witnessed thermal stress during the historical period. However, the future
    projection under the two scenarios showed the spread of thermal stress into areas
    that initially did not detect thermal stress in Sub-Saharan Africa, North America,
    and the Caribbean. The Pacific witnessed a similar spread pattern, and Australia
    saw less thermal stress in the future. The winter climatology is presented in
    Fig. S24. The distribution of annual thermal stress and LULC for the designated
    historical periods (1959 and 2014) and future periods (2014 and 2100) under SSPs
    370 and 585 are described in Fig. 8. In 1959, moderate heat stress was domiciled
    in the tropics between 20°S and 20°N. The moderate heat stress strip in Sub-Saharan
    Africa coincided with the rangeland straits, while other tropical areas with moderate
    heat stress were seen over the primary forest and primary nonforest. In the Midlatitudes,
    thermal stress ranged from no stress to moderate cold stress, with the LULC covering
    primary and secondary forests, annual cropland and rangeland. In 2014, more areas
    in the tropics recorded moderate heat stress—this coincided with the expansion
    of secondary nonforest, pastureland and annual cropland. There were fewer areas
    with slight cold stress in Spain and France, which could be traced to the evolution
    of the rangeland. Particularly in Turkey, the intrusion of rangeland from the
    south and more annual cropland altered the distribution of slight cold stress.

    8. Distribution of annual thermal stress and LULC for selected historical years
    (1959, 2014) and future years (2014 and 2100) under SSPs 370 and 585. VSHS is
    very strong heat stress, SHS is strong heat stress, MHS is moderate heat stress,
    NS means no thermal stress, SLCS means slight cold stress, MCS denotes moderate
    cold stress, SCS means strong cold stress, VSCS is very strong cold stress, and
    ECS denotes extreme cold stress. In 2045 under SSP 370, more areas in the tropics
    recorded moderate heat stress compared to 2014 due to the reduction in primary
    forest cover. The expansion of pasture, annual cropland, and rangeland led to
    the spread of moderate heat stress in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the Middle East,
    more areas reported moderate heat stress due to increased rangeland. In 2100,
    strong heat stress was established in most tropical regions. Most countries in
    Africa ranged between moderate heat stress and strong heat stress due to the complete
    replacement of forest with rangeland and annual cropland. In China, moderate and
    slight cold stress was drastically reduced due to secondary nonforest and rangeland
    expansion. In 2045 under SSP 585, most Russian regions experienced strong cold
    to moderate cold stress due to the distribution of forested and primary nonforested
    areas. The distribution of the primary forest enhanced the slight cold stress
    tongue in North America. In 2100, the slight cold stress tongue completely disappeared
    because secondary forest had replaced primary forest. As the forest disappeared
    in Russia, the slight cold stress regions also disappeared. In general, regions
    previously with no thermal stress witnessed a range of extremes ranging from moderate
    heat stress to very strong heat stress. 3.6. Energy demands Due to the shifts
    in thermal stress distribution across the periods and under different climate
    change scenarios, it is also crucial to quantify the energy demands required to
    offset thermal discomfort. Here, the heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree
    days (CDD) were analyzed. HDD shows how much energy is needed to heat an environment
    to a comfortable temperature in cold weather. In contrast, CDD shows how much
    energy is required to cool an environment to a comfortable temperature in hot
    weather. High values of CDD mean more energy to cool the environment, and high
    values of HDD mean more energy to heat the environment. Fig. 9 elucidated the
    climatology of heating and cooling degree days for the historical and future periods.
    Very high CDD (between 11,714 and 16,400) was observed in many countries in West
    Africa, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Oman and some parts of Australia and India during
    the historical period. However, in the future, under SSP 370, many countries in
    the tropics with previously low CDD exacerbated to high CDD, especially in North
    America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and South America. Also, this pattern
    became more intense and widespread during SSP 585. This mimicked the thermal stress
    and LULC cover pattern in Fig. 8. Hence, the LULC dynamics influenced the thermal
    stress, which modified the degree days. The HDD during the historical period was
    highest in most parts of Greenland (16,400). However, the future periods had a
    reduced HDD in places with previously high HDD. CDD increased in the future while
    HDD reduced because cold stress reduced in the future while heat stress increased.
    This means less energy is spent on cooling while more energy is spent on heating
    to attain thermal comfort. CDD increased towards the poles, while HDD decreased
    towards the equator. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download

    days for the historical and future periods under SSP 370 and 585. To show the
    seasonal variation in energy demand, the CDD was used as an example (Fig. 10).
    The highest positive significant annual trend (Fig. 10a) was recorded in Saudi
    Arabia during the historical period (452–527° days/decade). This means the energy
    consumption of Saudi Arabia in cooling the environment increased between 1959
    and 2014. However, the trend was lower in the Midlatitudes (between −2 and 189°
    days/decade). Under the projection scenarios, more countries experienced widespread
    high significant positive trends. Notably, most parts of South America, Sub-Saharan
    Africa, South Asia, the Pacific, and the Middle East were accustomed to high values
    (between 302 and 527° days/decade). However, the spread of high positive values
    was more intense in SSP 585. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    blank spaces. There was not much difference in the significant summer and annual
    trends during the historical period. Moreover, for SSP 370 and 585, most regions
    in the Midlatitudes witnessed high positive significant trends, especially in
    North America, Europe, and Central Asia. Due to the season interchange between
    the northern and southern hemispheres, some parts of the southern hemisphere (e.g.,
    Australia, South Africa, and Argentina) recorded a negative CDD trend. Nonetheless,
    the CDD trend was highest in the future under SSP 585. Significant negative trends
    were consistent in the future in areas close to the Himalayas mountains of Asia.
    4. Discussion This study examined the influence of LULC on the global distribution
    of thermal stress and its implication on energy demand under two climate and land
    use change scenarios for the historical and future periods. A global primary forest
    loss of up to 20% for all continents was observed. However, most pixels were replaced
    by positive trends in secondary forests. This agreed with Ellis and Ramankutty
    [9], who reported that human interventions had altered most global natural forests
    since the last ice age. There was a consistent increase in the rangeland and a
    widespread positive trend in the annual and permanent croplands. According to
    Richard [67], most forest loss is due to the expansion of croplands and pastureland,
    degraded lands and rangelands. SSP 585 scenario depicted a strong expansion of
    global cropland into rangeland, nonforest and forest land due to the rising food
    and feed demand and highly intensified future livestock production systems. In
    contrast, SSP 370 scenario attributed a strong expansion of global cropland and
    pastureland, leading to significant deforestation [68,69]. The climatological
    distribution of thermal stress varied per season. Most tropical north and south
    countries revealed no yearly thermal stress. The moderate to strong cold stress
    in the annual and winter climatology in the midlatitudes was replaced by no thermal
    stress in the summer, while the summertime ranged from moderate to strong heat
    stress. This resulted from the terrestrial responses to solar heating imbalances,
    controlled by the dynamic interaction between the Earth and the sun throughout
    the year [70]. A negative correlation was observed between UTCI and southern hemispheric
    primary forests, while most northern hemispheric primary forests exhibited positive
    correlations. Although forest lowers the daytime surface temperature due to an
    increased latent heat flux [26,67,71], the positive correlation in most northern
    hemispheric primary forests may be due to the forest and leaf types, stomatal
    conductance and forest albedo [72,73]. The historical period transition states
    of the different LULC categories revealed that the perennial cropland has the
    most dynamic active change intensities, although the lost area was more than the
    gained area. In addition, losses from primary forests were noticeable for all
    periods and SSPs. While there were differences in lost lands between other LULC
    categories and secondary nonforest, secondary forest losses accounted for most
    of the losses. Moreover, under SSP 585, perennial cropland saw the most significant
    loss intensity. Rangeland, secondary nonforest, secondary forest, and annual farmland
    increased over the years, while primary forest and primary nonforest generally
    decreased. Like the historical era, the future periods under various climate change
    scenarios demonstrated that primary forest and primary nonforest continued to
    decline. In contrast, rangeland, secondary forest, and annual cropland increased
    but with varying magnitudes. On the continental scale, Europe lost most primary
    forest to secondary forest. This suggested that human activities have impacted
    many naturally occurring European forests [74]. On UTCI dynamics and trends, the
    annual thermal stress ranged from excess cold stress to moderate heat stress during
    the historical sub-periods. In general, the southern hemisphere experienced more
    negative UTCI trends than the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, a decreasing trend
    of UTCI at higher latitudes in the winter was prominent [75,76]. Unlike the historical
    period, the annual thermal stress ranged from very strong cold stress to very
    strong heat stress for future projections. It should be noted that sub-periods
    with fast annual LULC changes recorded more significant UTCI trends than sub-periods
    with slow annual LULC changes. Therefore, the role of LULC dynamics cannot be
    neglected in determining significant UTCI trends. Although research has shown
    that prolonged exposure to severe heat has detrimental effects in tropical areas
    [77], it is worth noting that heatwaves are a distinct sort of high-temperature
    event, and the abnormal circumstances must continue over successive days. Therefore,
    those results cannot be expected to directly and thoroughly indicate heatwave
    effects on thermal stress because thermal stress considers temperature, wind,
    humidity [78], and body physiology. Nevertheless, metropolitan regions are more
    susceptible to heat waves than rural regions. In such regions, extended outdoor
    exposure increases the possibility of heat stress [79]. In addition, urban heat
    island effects [26,80] extend the duration of heat episodes during heatwaves [81];
    however, this manifests differently zonally [37]. For instance, previous studies
    have shown that the cumulative length of heatwaves did not increase in most mid-latitude
    metropolitan regions [37]. However, this is not the case for metropolitan centres
    in the tropics [37]. This illustrates that other climatic factors greatly influence
    the duration of heatwaves in midlatitudes. Thus, the dynamics of human-perceived
    heatwaves or thermal stress differs from temperature-based heatwaves. Nonetheless,
    the summer thermal stress distribution over the tropical north showed that the
    mean distribution over the primary forest experienced no thermal stress at the
    start of the study. However, each LULC estimated data point frequency correlates
    to each density curve''s width [28]. The curve''s characteristics mentioned above
    often varied for each LULC at various periods. It is noteworthy that the thermal
    stress distribution over different LULC categories may have similar thermal ranges
    for different years; however, the distributions differ due to the various land
    management practices and different land-atmosphere interactions [82]. For example,
    Halder et al. [83], Crompton et al. [84], and Roy et al. [82] reported reduced
    evapotranspiration, moisture convergence and surface roughness when forest cover
    was replaced with cropland, thereby increasing the seasonal temperature, consequently
    modulating the thermal stress spread. Conversely, increased irrigational activity
    on croplands could offset the rise in thermal gradients caused by land conversion
    because irrigation lowers temperature [85]. This is observed over some cropland
    areas of the tropics (Fig. A.3). LULC dynamics could modify moisture transports
    and other extreme events, e.g. low or abnormal shifts in monsoon precipitation
    [86,87], heat stress [88,89] and enhance regional humidity [85,89]. Additionally,
    primary nonforest influenced thermal stress distribution more than any other LULC
    category in the historical period. However, in the future period under SSP 370,
    annual cropland was the most influential LULC category over Africa, South America,
    and the Tropical North. The distribution of annual thermal stress and LULC for
    the designated historical periods showed that areas in the tropics recorded moderate
    heat stress—this coincided with the expansion of secondary nonforest, pastureland
    and annual cropland. The evolution of rangeland diminished Spain and France''s
    slight cold stress distribution. In general, regions previously with no thermal
    stress in the historical period witnessed extremes ranging from moderate heat
    stress to very strong heat stress in the future. This is unconnected from the
    combined effect of climate and LULC change [15,26,88,89]. In agreement with Ramirez-Beltran
    et al. [90], the highest category of thermal stress was observed in the super
    El Niño year. High CDD was found in the tropics for past and future periods. However,
    many tropical nations with historically low CDD increased to high CDD in the future
    under SSP 370. During SSP 585, this signal was more robust. This closely resembled
    the thermal stress and LULC pattern under different scenarios. Thus, thermal stress
    influenced LULC dynamics, which controlled the CDD. Due to a future decrease (increase)
    in cold stress (heat stress), CDD increased while HDD decreased. This implies
    that less or more energy is required to cool or heat to achieve thermal comfort
    in the future [32]. However, there was also a significant positive trend in decadal
    CDD. These posed tremendous challenges to densely inhabited cities with complex
    urban infrastructures and systems [30,32,33]. Hence, sustainable and resilient
    energy solutions should be in place to mitigate the impending challenges [91].
    5. Conclusion This study characterized the interaction between LULC dynamics,
    trend and thermal stress distribution under different climate and land use change
    scenarios. We reported that LULC dynamics modulate thermal stress''s spread, intensity,
    and categorization. However, primary nonforest influenced historical global thermal
    stress distribution more than any other LULC category. The conversion of forest
    to range land and croplands and the subsequent negative forest trends increased
    the severity of thermal stress. The future projection showed intense thermal stress;
    however, the SSP 585 signals were more potent. The thermal stress trend demonstrated
    that many regions observed steady heat or cold stress strengthening, thereby exposing
    the local population to above-average heat or cold stress and health danger. Still,
    synergizing health, climate and LULC information would provide decision-makers
    with an integrated risk monitoring and early warning system [75] for thermal stress
    outlook at various scales and prevent thermal stress hazards (e.g., heat strokes).
    Remarkably, the thermal stress and LULC future projections could offer science-based
    recommendations for adaptation strategies, defining precise goals for sustainable
    national, regional, and local land policies. Given the projected future climate,
    afforestation is one of the low-regret solutions that provide comparably huge
    advantages at a modest cost. Additionally, it can offer various regulatory, provisional,
    and cultural ecosystem services like food production, flood control, CO2 sequestration
    and flood prevention [92,93]. In the future, cooling (heating) demands will rise
    (decline), yet, improved thermal comfort necessitates a higher cooling capacity,
    especially in the summer. Since the cooling/heating systems typically rely on
    electricity, this results in a higher power and electrical grid loads. Increased
    thermal stress may make it difficult for many cooling systems to meet people''s
    energy demands; as a result, overheating and system malfunction are likely to
    occur in the future. Consequently, future energy designs and solutions should
    not ignore extreme climatic events and thermal stress amplification. The resolution
    of the climate and land use models constrains the scope of this investigation.
    In the future, more bias-corrected climate models and LULC models with more classes
    should be implemented. Additionally, more reference datasets could be adopted.

    1 afterwards. Field surveys using 64 ground control points determined that erodibility
    varies from 0.17 to 0.49% in the study area. Orchards, farms, rangelands, and
    forests with moderate or low vegetation cover were the most vulnerable land uses
    to soil erosion. The results of GloSEM modeling revealed that climate change is
    the main cause of change in the rate of soil erosion. The results also established
    that when the combined effects of land use change and climate change are taken
    into account, soil erosion has increased under SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, and SSP5-RCP8.5
    scenarios, so that about 80% of the region has experienced moderate to very high
    erosion. Therefore, both natural factors (e.g. climate change) and human factors
    (e.g. agricultural development, population growth, and overgrazing) are among
    the drivers of soil erosion in the study area.

    ecosystems through changes in ecosystem components. These changes can in turn
    impact natural disasters (Sholihah et al. 2020). While the damage caused by most
    natural disasters is temporally immediate, floods often have more lasting consequences
    such as property damage and reduced crop yields. Additionally, floodwaters can
    become contaminated and consequently cause diseases (Arnell and Gosling 2016;
    Adikari and Yoshitani 2009). Based on the reports by the Emergency Events Database
    (EM-DAT), Asia is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods;
    in the period from 2000 to 2019, 7,348 major disaster events were recorded in
    Asia, claiming 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people, and costing approximately
    $2.97 trillion dollars (UNDRR 2020; Adeel et al. 2020). More recently, climate
    change has become a major factor affecting floods by concentrating total annual
    rainfall in increasingly sporadic and intense rainstorm events (Cramer et al.
    2014). Floods can also cause damage to the environment through affecting ecosystem
    components such as soil through soil erosion and degradation (Nepal et al. 2021).
    Although soil erosion is only one of the manifestations and aspects of land degradation,
    it can be considered the most critical (Lal 2008). Soil erosion is a complex process
    with direct and indirect socio-economic and environmental impacts. The type and
    severity of soil erosion is determined by factors such as landform and geomorphology,
    physical and chemical properties of soil, hydrography, rainfall regime, land use,
    land cover, and land management practices (Salvati et al. 2013; Masroor et al.
    2022). By reducing soil nutrients, soil erosion increases food production costs
    (Quinton et al. 2010; Brevik et al. 2020) and, as a result, causes economic and
    environmental damage (Telles et al. 2011). Modern societies increasingly depend
    on cultivated lands, so that more than a third of earth’s land area is currently
    covered by agricultural lands (Foley et al. 2011). 95% of global food production
    relies on the cultivation of plants and livestock, which is itself dependent on
    the capacity of soils to sustain living organisms (FAO 2015). In recent decades,
    the unbalanced development and expansion of agricultural lands have led to a significant
    increase in soil erosion, especially in developing countries (FAO 2015). Inattention
    to topography, texture and structure of the soil, and a mismatch between soil
    and climatic conditions (Pal and Chakrabortty 2019a) and the ecological needs
    of cultivated crops are among the most important causes of severe soil erosion
    in agricultural lands (Chandra pal et al. 2021). Therefore, attention should be
    paid to two key issues in agricultural science to reduce soil erosion: land suitability
    for crop selection, and optimal cropping patterns (Derakhshan-Babaei et al. 2021;
    Akbari et al. 2019; Neamatollahi et al. 2017). Human activities such as agricultural
    development have been significant drivers of soil and environmental degradation
    in recent years (Montanarella 2015; Mueller et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2016; Nga
    et al. 2018). Therefore, soil erosion assessment has been proposed as a method
    to respond to these concerns, especially in industrialized countries (Nachtergaele
    2004). The latest report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations (FAO 2015) on global soil resources highlights the worrying condition
    of the world’s soil resources and emphasizes the threat of soil erosion to the
    environment on a global scale. The most significant anthropogenic drivers of soil
    erosion are land use change and climate change (O’Neal et al. 2005). Past works
    on soil erosion have shown more interest in soil erosion in arable lands (Boardman
    and Poesen 2006). At the same time, assessment of soil erosion in natural lands
    has been limited due to the lack of climatic and soil data on local and global
    scales (Bosco et al. 2015; Akbari et al. 2016b) as long-term assessment of soil
    erosion requires reliable long-term data (Salvati et al. 2013; Cox et al. 2018).
    In response, semi-empirical methods have been developed to incorporate existing
    knowledge to generate actionable results (Borrelli et al. 2020). To estimate soil
    erosion in agricultural lands, models such as CREAMS, SLEMSA, GUESS, USLE, RMMF,
    and MUSLE have been developed, while others such as EUROSEM, RUSLE, WEPP, and
    CORINE have been created for rangelands and watersheds (Panagos et al. 2014; Silva
    et al. 2012; Tsara et al. 2006; Aiello et al. 2015; Chandra Pal and Shit 2017).
    Among these models, the RUSLE model has been applied to estimate present and future
    soil erosion in many locations around the world due to its simplicity (e.g. Pal
    and Chakrabortty 2019b; Pal et al. 2021; Aiello et al. 2015; Bhandari et al. 2015;
    Das et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2015; Kouli et al. 2009; Samanta et al. 2016). Recently,
    integrative approaches such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Evidential Belief
    Function-Logistic Regression (SWAT-EBF-LR) (Chakrabortty et al. 2020a) and Geographically
    Weighted Regression-Artificial Neural Network (GWR-ANN) (Chakrabortty et al. 2020b)
    have also been employed to estimate and identify soil erosion potential hotspots.
    Integrating the output of such models into risk-based management can reduce the
    impact of uncertainties and losses (Sarbazi et al. 2021; Akbari et al. 2016a).
    In this context, risk assessment allows the preparation of maps of potential and
    actual risks (Akbari et al. 2022) using a method of risk assessment selected based
    on the type of risk being studied (i.e. direct or indirect, tangible or intangible)
    (Merz et al. 2010). Recent advances in remote sensing (RS) have made earth observation
    data more available and more accurate, and have expanded our data processing capabilities,
    ushering in an array of new indicators to capture important variables in erosion
    risk assessment such as vegetation (Liu et al. 2021). In this regard, models that
    consider the impact of climate change and land use parameters through incorporating
    RS products can assist us with evaluating the risk of soil erosion and therefore
    contribute to more accurate and more reliable risk assessment. The Global Soil
    Erosion Modeling Database (GloSEM) utilizes the RUSLE model and offers a more
    comprehensive modeling framework for estimating future global soil erosion scenarios
    (Borrelli et al. 2020). Although there are examples of risk assessment for flooding
    risk in Iran, the literature on the topic is limited in terms of scope (both temporal
    and geographical) and the methods utilized to perform the analysis. In this study
    we address this gap by performing risk assessment using a recent case of flooding
    in western Iran. Iran was affected by three strong weather systems from November
    27, 2018 to April 12, 2019. During this period, western and southwestern Iran
    experienced unprecedented flooding, leading to immense costs in terms of human
    lives and economic damage. We used these events to assess soil erosion in one
    of the most-severely affected regions in the country and performed soil erosion
    assessment under current and projected conditions using the Global Soil Erosion
    Modeling Database (GloSEM). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study area Lorestan province
    is located in the west of Iran and has an area of 28064 km2 (8.1% of the total
    area of Iran). The province is located between 46° 51′ and 50° 01′ E, and 32°
    37′ and 37° 34′ N. Based on the latest national census, the population of the
    province was 1,760,649 people in 2015, with the largest population belonging to
    Khorramabad county, and the smallest to Romeshkan county. Natural and agricultural
    land uses in the province include forests (43.34%), rangelands (30.12%), deserts
    (0.41%), agricultural lands (18.57%), and orchards (7.55%) (Nabati et al. 2020).
    In the past decade, the area of agricultural lands in Lorestan province has increased
    remarkably, increasing from 3.2% of total national agricultural land in 2011 to
    4.7% in 2020 (Iranian Ministry of Agriculture statistical yearbook 2020). The
    province overlaps with the watersheds of two major rivers in Iran (Karkheh and
    Dez), and receives more precipitation than its neighbors due to its location and
    elevation. The province is susceptible to floods, especially since warm rainfall
    in April can accelerate snowmelt and flooding (Sharafi and Noorollahi 2020). Data
    shows that 436 spots in the province are vulnerable to floods (Hydrological Report,
    Regional Water Company 2019). Figure 1 shows the geographical location of the
    study area and its flood-prone regions. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the topographical,
    meteorological, and hydrological characteristics of the province. Fig. 1 The geographic
    location of the study area and flood-prone regions Full size image Table 1 The
    topographic, meteorological, and hydrological characteristics of Lorestan province
    Full size table Table 2 Topographic and meteorologic characteristics of the counties
    in Lorestan province Full size table Lorestan province experienced serious instances
    of flooding on 27 November 2018, 4–5 December 2018, and 7–8 February 2019, 4–5
    April 2019, and 11–12 April 2019. The high intensity and large volume (up to 170
    mm) of rainfall caused significant damage across the province, especially in Khorramabad
    and Poldakhtar counties, which are more vulnerable to flooding (Hydrological Report,
    Regional Water Company 2019). The extreme precipitation events flooded most of
    Poldakhtar county and parts of Khorramabad, Delfan, and Kuhdasht and damaged many
    urban and rural residential and commercial units, as well as impacting infrastructure
    including main roads, interurban and rural road structures, water supply lines,
    power lines, the telecommunication network, and oil and petrochemical facilities
    (Hydrological Report, Regional Water Company 2019). A warming climate and changing
    precipitation patterns in the study area have contributed to more severe flooding
    as warm rainfall in spring leads to the melting of the snow accumulated in mountainous
    areas. The role of snow as a contributing factor to extreme hydrological events
    and natural hazards has been established in past research (Akbari et al. 2017).
    Furthermore, vegetation cover in the province has been under increasing pressure
    as a result of human exploitation (e.g. wood harvesting and grazing). Finally,
    the soils in the study area include inceptisols, vertisol, and entisols (Hydrological
    Report, Regional Water Company 2019), all of which are very sensitive to erosion
    (Soil Taxonomy 1975). 2.2 Database Meteorological data were accessed from meteorological
    stations in the study area for the period before the floods (11/01/2017 to 30/04/2018)
    and the flooding period (11/01/2018 to 30/04/2019). The time intervals were selected
    to include the rainy season in the study area. The soil map of the study area
    (at 1:100,000 scale) was initially used to investigate soil characteristics. A
    field survey using 64 ground control points (GCPs) in different land units was
    then conducted to update the soil map. A digital elevation model (DEM) provided
    by Iran’s National Cartographic Center was used to calculate topographic variables.
    The elevation model had a cell size of 30 × 30 m and was prepared based on 1:50,000
    topographic maps and 1:50,000 contour maps with a 20-m elevation difference between
    contour lines. Sentinel-2 images and a mosaic of 9 frames for the period before
    and after the floods (11/01/2017 to 30/04/2018 and 11/01/2018 to 30/04/2019, respectively)
    were used to evaluate vegetation cover. Sentinel-2 is an earth observation project
    developed by the European Space Agency as part of the Copernicus program and includes
    two identical satellites (Sentinel-2E and Sentinel-2B). Sentinel 2B is capable
    of multispectral imaging in 13 bands including the visible, near-infrared, and
    short-wave infrared spectra. Images are recorded at 5-day intervals and are available
    to the public for free. In this research, images captured by Sentinel 2B on April
    30th, 2018, and April 30th, 2019 were used. The list of images is presented in
    Table 3. Table 3 List of images downloaded from the Copernicus website Full size
    table Future changes in soil erosion were predicted using the Global Soil Erosion
    Modelling Database (GloSEM). GloSEM was developed based on the RUSLE model to
    provide a more comprehensive framework for global assessment of soil erosion under
    different scenarios (Borrelli et al. 2020). This database uses the latest climate
    change and land use change scenarios (Shared Socio-economic Pathway-Representative
    Concentration Pathway, SSP-RCP) to simulate erosion in the future. GloSEM takes
    advantage of the land use change scenarios for 2070 extracted from the Land Use
    Harmonization project and the climate change scenarios developed by the European
    Union’s Joint Research Centre. In this database, uncertainties in predictions
    are assessed and validated using Monte Carlo-Markov Chain (MCMC) methods. 2.3
    RUSLE model In this study, soil erosion following flooding in Lorestan province
    was evaluated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model in
    ArcGIS 10.8. Integration of the RUSLE model in GIS allows for the estimation of
    sediment yields and identification of vulnerable areas (Pal and Chakrabortty 2019b).
    RUSLE has shown strong performance in various settings ranging from mountainous
    terrain to tropical forests (Samanta et al. 2016; Sadeghi et al. 2014). The model
    takes advantage of a rainfall and runoff erosivity factor, which improves model
    implementation compared to its predecessor (USLE). The revised version of the
    global soil erosion equation is used to evaluate and predict erosion, and to develop
    conservation plans based on six factors (Eq. 1). $$SE=R*K*L*S*C*P$$ (1) where
    SE is average annual soil erosion per unit of area (t ha− 1 y− 1), R is the erosivity
    factor (MJ mm ha− 1 h− 1 y− 1), K is the erodibility factor (t ha MJ− 1 mm− 1),
    L is the slope length factor, S is the slope steepness factor, C is the cover
    management factor, and P is the support practices factor (note: L, S, C, P are
    dimensionless) (Pal and Shit 2017). The flow diagram for calculating soil erosion
    before flooding (01/11/2017 to 30/04/2018) and after flooding (01/11/2018 to 30/04/2019)
    is depicted in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 The flowchart for calculating soil erosion before
    and after flooding Full size image Information layers which were subject to change
    before and after flooding such as NDVI and erosivity (R) were calculated separately
    for each period. Other factors such as L, P and K were considered unchanged. Figure
    3 shows the map of variables used in the RUSLE model. Fig. 3 The data used in
    the RUSLE model Full size image 2.3.1 Rainfall and runoff erosivity (R) Rainfall
    is a major driving force of soil erosion since raindrops (through splash erosion),
    and runoff flow erode the surface (Pal and Chakrabortty 2019b). The annual R-factor
    is computed based on complete long-term records of storm kinetic energy and maximum
    thirty-minute intensity, known as EI30 (Morgan 2005; Renard et al. 1997). R was
    obtained based on annual average total erosion of rainfall events using Eq. 2
    (Arnoldus 1980). $$R= \\sum _{j=1}^{12}1.735*10\\left({1.5log10\\left(\\frac{{P}_{i}}{P}\\right)-0.08188}\\right)$$
    (2) where R is rainfall erosivity (MJ mm ha− 1 h− 1 year− 1), Pi is monthly rainfall
    (mm), and P is annual rainfall (mm). Rainfall erosivity values were interpolated
    in ArcGIS 10.8 using kriging/cokriging. 2.3.2 Soil erodibility (K) Soil erodibility
    (K) reflects the inherent vulnerability of soils to water erosion (Renard et al.
    1997). K is defined as the “average annual soil loss per unit of rainfall erosivity
    under a standard circumstance of bare soil under no conservation practice” (Morgan
    2005; Wischmeier and Smith 1978; Renard et al. 1997) have provided a formula for
    calculating K based on soil texture and structure, organic matter content, and
    profile permeability (Pal and Chakrabortty 2019a). Thus, soil erodibility was
    determined based on sand, clay, silt, and organic matter content according to
    Table 4. To convert soil erodibility to metric units, the figures in Table 4 were
    multiplied by 0.1317 to give K in terms of t h MJ− 1 mm− 1. Table 4 Soil erodibility
    factor (K) based on texture and organic matter content Full size table 2.3.3 Slope
    length (L) Slope length (L) affects sheet, rill, and inter-rill erosion (Wischmeier
    and Smith 1978). L is the horizontal distance from the upstream source of flow
    to the point where the slope changes significantly. Soil erosion increases with
    increasing slope length (Renard et al. 1997; Krishna Bahadur 2009). More advanced
    methods for topographically complex units employ approaches which incorporate
    contributing area and flow accumulation (Desmet and Govers 1996). The slope map
    was obtained based on the DEM raster using the spatial analyst toolbox in ArcGIS
    (Table 5). To calculate L, Eq. 3 was applied to the DEM (Moore and Burch 1986):
    $${L ={(Flow\\,Accumulation \\times Cell\\,Size/22.13)}^{0.4}(SinSlope \\times
    0.0896)}^{1.3}$$ (3) where L is slope length, Flow accumulation is the accumulated
    slope area contributing to flow in a given cell, and SineSlope is slope in degrees.
    Table 5 Support practices factor (P) for different slope classes based on Wischmeier
    and Smith (1978) Full size table 2.3.4 Cover management (C) The cover management
    factor (C) is the ratio of the amount of soil lost from cultivated land to the
    amount of soil lost from the same land under continuous fallow without vegetation
    (El Jazouli et al. 2017; Alkharabsheh et al. 2013). An increase in C leads to
    an increase in exposed soil, and thus an increase in potential soil loss (El Garouani
    et al. 2008). C is calculated using empirical equations based on field measurements
    of ground cover (Wischmeier and Smith 1978). The most appropriate method for determining
    vegetation cover is to employ the normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI),
    which is obtained using satellite imagery (Renard et al. 1997). NDVI is an indicator
    of the energy reflected by the earth (Kouli et al. 2009), and ranges between − 1
    and + 1. In this study, NDVI was calculated based on satellite images according
    to Eq. 4: $$NDVI=(NIR-IR)/(NIR+IR)$$ (4) where NIR is the near-infrared band,
    and IR is the red optical band. Due to the Mediterranean climate of Iran, most
    of the rainfall occurs in autumn and winter; therefore, the formula presented
    by Lin et al. (2002) provides a more appropriate estimate of the status of vegetation
    and the cover management factor (C). In this method, C is obtained based on Eq.
    5: $$C={exp}\\left[{-\\alpha \\frac{NDVI}{(\\beta -NDVI)}}\\right]$$ (5) where
    α and β are dimensionless parameters, and NDVI is the normalized difference vegetation
    index (Chakrabortty et al. 2020c). 2.3.5 Support practice (P) The support practices
    or conservation practices factor (P) is calculated as the ratio of soil loss after
    implementation of support practices to soil loss in the absence of support practices
    (Renard et al. 1997; Pal and Chakrabortty 2019a). In large areas such as our study
    area, P is estimated based on slope since areas with similar slopes often experience
    the same level of protection from erosion. Accordingly, we used the table provided
    by Wischmeier and Smith (1978) to derive P. 2.4 Prediction of the combined impacts
    of climate and land use changes on soil erosion We compared the predictions made
    by GloSEM with our regional evaluation of soil erosion in Lorestan province. The
    impacts of climate change on rainfall erosivity (R) were considered under RCP2.6,
    RCP4.5, and RCP8.5, and the impacts of land use change on support practices (P)
    and cover management (C) were considered under SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, and SSP5-RCP8.5.
    The combined effects of these changes were investigated in the framework of the
    RUSLE model. SSP1 represents the most sustainable trajectory, with minimal pollution
    or environmental degradation. In this scenario, land use is highly regulated and
    controlled, food is traded on an international level, and international collaboration
    against climate change begins early (after 2020). SSP2 assumes a continuation
    of historic social, economic, and technological trends in the future. Land use
    change is not regulated and an international collaboration to control climate
    change is delayed until 2040. In SSP5, the world seeks sustainable development
    through competitive markets, innovation, and collaboration for rapid development
    of technology and human capital under the guidance of emerging industrial economies.
    Land use change is unregulated and unplanned although deforestation might slow
    down in the later years (Memarian and Akbari 2021). 3 Results RUSLE applications
    usually estimate soil loss at the annual timescale (Renard et al. 1997; Sadeghi
    et al. 2014), as a result, our findings are reported on a per year basis despite
    the selected periods being shorter. The data layers (maps) extracted for R, K,
    L, C, and P were integrated using the raster calculator in ArcGIS 10.8 to quantify,
    evaluate, and generate the maps of soil erosion risk and severity for Lorestan
    province. The values of R, K, L, C, and P are shown in Table 6. Table 6 Descriptive
    statistics for RUSLE factors Full size table 3.1 Impact of rainfall erosivity
    on soil erosion Meteorological data for the region showed that the average R-factor
    for the period before and after flooding was 58.87 and 157.6 MJ mm ha− 1 h− 1
    y− 1, respectively. Rainfall intensity, duration, and frequency are the main determinants
    of runoff generation. All three factors were extremely high for the precipitation
    that occurred in Lorestan province, especially on April 12, 2019 (Table 7). The
    value of R more than doubled at most stations following the floods, with the exception
    of Aligudarz. The largest absolute increase in R occurred in Khoramabad (from
    40.63 to 158.8 MJ mm ha− 1 h− 1 y− 1) and the smallest in Aligudarz (from 71.56
    to 139.6 MJ mm ha− 1 h− 1 y− 1). In terms of relative increases in R, Khoramabad
    ranked first (290% increase), followed by Kuhdasht (218%), and Borujerd (205%).
    Table 7 Values of R for meteorological stations in the study area Full size table
    Maps obtained from the analysis of meteorological data showed that the highest
    value of R belonged to the southern parts of the province such as Poldakhtar county
    and the northern and western parts such as Dorud, Khorramabad, and Delfan counties
    (see Fig. 2). Official reports by the local departments and organizations also
    confirm this finding (Hydrological Report, Regional Water Company 2019). These
    areas are high-risk flood zones because of severe land use changes (such as Poldokhtar)
    or due to being located in mountainous terrain (such as Dorud, Khorramabad, and
    Delfan). 3.2 Impact of soil erodibility on soil erosion Soil erodibility was obtained
    based on the percentage of clay, silt, sand, and organic matter in the soil profile
    according to the soil map and the data collected at 64 ground control points (Table
    4). The results show that erodibility varies from 0.17 to 0.49. The highest figures
    were observed in orchards, agricultural lands (i.e. rainfed agricultural lands
    in the southern parts of the region), and rangelands and forests with moderate
    and low vegetation cover (i.e. piedmont plains of the central region). Khorramdareh
    county, with the largest area of rainfed and irrigated arable lands, and Poldakhtar
    county with the largest area of rangelands and forests with moderate and low vegetation
    cover, face the highest rates of erosion. The areas between Borujerd and Dorud
    and between Azna and Aligudarz had relatively small K values. 3.3 Impact of topography
    on soil erosion The value of the slope length factor (L) varied from 0 to 0.27.
    About 71% of the study area is mountainous and has a slope greater than 25%. This
    steep mountainous topography has played an important role in shortening the time
    of concentration of runoff (Tc) and flood generation. In addition, the prevalence
    of fine-grained and impermeable formations in the region produces large amounts
    of runoff after each rainfall (Hydrological Report, Regional Water Company 2019).
    High and mountainous areas are generally located in the northern and eastern parts
    and piedmont plains and lowland areas are found in the southern and western parts.
    The slope map also showed variations in slope ranging from 1 to 48%. The average
    slope of the region is about 19%, which indicates that the region is mountainous.
    Under rainy conditions, steep slopes are prone to landslides and increased soil
    erosion. 3.4 Impact of land use on erosion NDVI was calculated based on the analysis
    of Sentinel-2B satellite images for the period before and after the floods. The
    results showed that vegetation cover was moderate in the eastern and northern
    parts (mountainous areas with moderate density pastures and forests) and low in
    the western and southern parts (low-density pastures with seasonal agricultural
    lands). The large value of the cover management factor (C) in the study area indicates
    a high risk of soil erosion. The map obtained for the support practices factor
    (P) showed that the highest values belong to areas with steep slopes. In the study
    area, P varied from 0.5 to 1, with the lower values associated with the southern
    parts such as Poldakhtar, Dasht mountain, Delfan, and Selseleh, which are mostly
    located on plains and foothills. 3.5 Spatial distribution of soil erosion Analysis
    of the spatial distribution of soil erosion showed that the southern parts (such
    as Poldakhtar) and central and eastern parts (such as Khorramabad and Aligudarz)
    experienced significant soil erosion. The map obtained from the combination of
    different soil erosion factors in the RUSLE model (Fig. 4) showed that the study
    area was affected by different factors before and after the floods, but changes
    in climatic parameters played an important role in both periods. We also found
    that the floods occuring between 01/11/2018 and 30/04/2019 substantially increased
    soil erosion. Soil erosion rate in the pre-flood period was 4.12 t ha− 1 yr− 1,
    but increased to 10.93 t ha− 1 yr− 1 after the floods (Table 8). While the majority
    of the study area experienced low to moderate erosion before the floods, more
    than a third (about 36%) of the study area faced moderate to high erosion post-flood.

    and after flooding (B) Full size image Table 8 The area of soil erosion risk classes
    in the study area Full size table 3.6 Predicting future soil erosion The projections
    provided by GloSEM were used to predict future soil erosion in the study area
    using the RUSLE model. The predictions showed minor deviations from the figures
    published by the European Union and USDA, indicating the accuracy of our predictions.
    This agreement also shows that the global estimations available from GloSEM are
    reliable and valid predictions on the regional scale. Figure 5 presents the area
    of different soil erosion risk classes under different land use change-climate
    change scenarios. Our results showed that land use changes in the southern and
    eastern parts of the study area will lead to reduced organic matter content, reduced
    soil quality, and changes in the physical and chemical properties of the soil.
    Along with increased erosivity of rainfall, these factors will increase soil erosion
    in the area. There was also a marked difference between different scenarios in
    terms of erosion risk in the eastern-most part of the study area, near Aligudarz.
    The models created for future conditions show that climatic changes are the main
    drivers of the increase in soil erosion. Combined land use change-climate change
    simulation indicates significant soil erosion under SSP1-RCP 2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5,
    and SSP5-RCP8.5 scenarios (Table 9). The results showed that when the combined
    effects of land use change and climate change are taken into account, soil erosion
    will increase under SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5 in about 80% of the
    region. Under SSP1-RCP 2.6, more than 60% of the study area will face high to
    very high risk of erosion. However, the same two categories will cover more than
    70% of the region under SSP5-RCP 8.5. A comparison between SSP1-RCP2.6 and SSP5-RCP8.5
    also shows an increase of more than 10% in the areas facing high erosion risk
    by 2070, and a decline of almost 9% in the share of areas facing moderate risk
    of erosion. Fig. 5 Soil erosion in the study area in 2070 under different climate

    table 4 Discussion This study evaluated soil erosion in a particularly flood-prone
    region in western Iran before and after extreme weather events in 2018 and 2019.
    The results indicate that the unprecedented amount of rainfall increased erosion
    risk and exposed vast parts of the study area to increased erosion. Past research
    confirms this observation; although various factors are involved in increasing
    the intensity of soil erosion, the variation in climatic parameters due to climate
    change has come to play a very important role in recent years (Borrelli et al.
    2020). Before the recent episode of flooding, snow had covered the mountainous
    areas of the region. Following an increase in air temperature and rainfall, the
    accumulated snow melted, which intensified the floods. In addition, due to the
    large amount of rainfall on April 12th, 2019, soils were almost saturated, which
    reduced the infiltration rate and increased runoff generation (Hydrological Report,
    Regional Water Company 2019). These findings indicate that the large differences
    in erosion before and after floods are attributable to the erosivity factor in
    the RUSLE model. Yao et al. (2016) also report that soil erosion was driven mainly
    by R and was significantly impacted by K, particularly during rainy periods. Similarly,
    Polykretis et al. (2020) indicate that R was a more dominant factor in determining
    the intensity of monthly and seasonal fluctuations in water erosion than the other
    factors considered in the RUSLE model. The results of a historical study for the
    period between 1938 and 1988 by Kakembo and Rowntree (2003) also support our findings.
    The researchers found that gully initiation and intensification coincided with
    extreme rainfall events in Eastern Cape, South Africa. According to the available
    official reports, soil salinity is more severe in Poldakhtar county, compared
    to other counties; the droughts in recent decades have also increased salinity
    (Akbari et al. 2016a). Increased soil salinity has reduced permeability and increased
    erosion during floods, which partly explains the severity of flooding and erosion
    in Poldokhtar county. The cities of Khorramabad, Delfan, and Selseleh in the northern
    and central parts of the study area have highly erodible soils due to extensive
    dryland agriculture. This result is supported by findings by Polykretis et al.
    (2020), reporting that olive groves faced a higher risk of water erosion than
    other land uses. In contrast, mountainous lands in the eastern and northern parts
    of the study area were less erodible due to their dense forest cover. Overall,
    the results showed that human activities and natural factors such as extensive
    and continuous drought along with erosion-sensitive soils have increased erodibility.
    Long-term drought has also increased rainfall erosivity in the area. According
    to a report by the Hydrological Report, Regional Water Company 2019 using standardized
    precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI), about 78% of the province has experienced
    moderate to severe drought; while central counties have been less affected (e.g.
    Selseleh county with only 5% of its area being affected), those in the southern,
    northern, and eastern parts of the region have been severely impacted (e.g. Poldakhtar
    county, with 99% of its area affected). Masroor et al. (2022) report a positive
    relationship between drought indices and soil erosion values. An important part
    of this correlation was due to the effect of drought on the quantity and quality
    of vegetation, which itself had an effective role in reducing the energy of raindrops
    and consequently reducing the amount of soil erosion. The role of the slope length
    factor (L) was consistent with the changes in the elevation and slope of the area.
    It should be noted that despite their gentle slope, mildly sloped and flat regions
    experience more erosion because soils are deeper in such areas, and therefore
    there is a larger amount of soils that can be eroded. On steep slopes, however,
    what little soil exists is quickly eroded, i.e. the amount of soil is the limiting
    factor for how much erosion occurs, although potential erosion might be higher
    compared to flatter areas. The results obtained by Salvati et al. (2013) indicate
    the importance of topography in the severity of soil erosion. They specify that
    increasing the slope in lands with low vegetation density increased the severity
    of soil erosion. Meshesha et al. (2012) also report a positive correlation between
    slope and soil loss in the Central Rift Valley in Ethiopia, stating that areas
    with slopes > 10° made up only 12% of their study area, but contributed disproportionately
    to soil erosion (31.7% of soil loss). They report that areas with steep slopes
    experienced erosion rates as high as 130 t ha− 1 yr− 1. Nabati et al. (2020) utilized
    climatic, soil, and topographic variables to determine suitable areas for agriculture
    in Lorestan province. They found that only 19.88% of the province is suitable
    for irrigated agriculture and 54.2% is suitable for rainfed agriculture. Vegetation
    cover, along with slope angle and length, are major determinants of soil erosion
    and sediment production (FAO 2015; El Jazouli et al. 2017). A study by Khademalrasoul
    and Amerikhah (2021) in the neighboring provinces of Khuzestan and Chaharmahal
    Bakhtiari similarly highlights the importance of the vegetation cover factor.
    The authors report that the lowest C factor and water erosion potential were observed
    in areas with the highest NDVI. A study by Prasannakumar et al. (2011) in the
    Siruvani watershed in southern India similarly attributes the increase in soil
    erosion to shifting cultivation patterns, and forest degradation. Moreover, Chinnasamy
    et al. (2020) indicated that floods and the associated erosion were due to a combination
    of rainfall events and changes in land use and land cover. The changes in land
    use also affect river morphology and behavior during floods, which in turn affects
    soil erosion. The results of field surveys and satellite imagery show that the
    main river beds have been widened and displaced and that the direction of flow
    has been altered. The reason for the displacements is the intensity of floods,
    loose and erodible alluvial sediments, and the interventions of rural communities
    in the form of expansion of agricultural lands on river banks. Shifting and widening
    of river beds has also caused the erosion of agricultural lands. According to
    the available reports and field studies, agricultural development and land use
    changes are the main causes of land degradation (Memarian and Akbari 2021; Derakhshan-Babaei
    et al. 2021; Nga et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2016) in the southern and central parts
    of the study area. These results are consistent with that of Memarian and Akbari
    (2021) on the impacts of climate change on soil erosion. According to a FAO report
    (2015), both natural factors such as climate change, and anthropogenic factors
    such as agricultural development, population growth, and overgrazing, intensify
    erosion. The pre-flood and post-flood periods in our study area clearly show the
    effects of both categories of factors on causing and intensifying erosion. Alkharabsheh
    et al. (2013) evaluated the impact of land cover change on soil erosion hazard
    in northern Jordan during a 17-year interval and found that the main driver of
    soil erosion in the region was land use change. A study by Haregeweyn et al. (2017)
    similarly implicates a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors in soil
    erosion. The researchers state that variations in agricultural practices, slope,
    and population density were strongly linked with variations in soil erosion. Although
    future changes in land use can impact soil erosion by changing the area of agricultural
    lands in either direction, the fact that the global climate is moving towards
    more extreme events suggests that soil erosion will become more severe in the
    future. A comparison of the scenarios showed that although land use change can
    impact global soil erosion (especially through increasing or decreasing the area
    of agricultural lands), the shift in global climate toward more extreme hydrological
    cycles will act as the main driver of the increase in soil erosion. Similar to
    our findings, Pal and Chakrabortty (2019b) predicted increases in soil erosion
    in the future (from 5 to 15 year return periods) in the Dwarkeswar River basin
    in India. An increasing trend in average annual soil erosion was observed under
    RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, with the lowest and highest predictions
    belonging to RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, respectively. A comparable result is reported
    by O’Neal et al. (2005) in their study on the impact of climate change in the
    Midwestern United States. They predicted significant increases in runoff (10–310%)
    and soil loss (33–274%) in 2040–2059 relative to 1990–1999. However, the decisions
    made by land managers and environmental policymakers will be highly impactful
    on soil erosion. Despite the considerable soil erosion during floods, these conditions
    could evolve into an environmental catastrophe by 2100 according to land use change
    and climate change scenarios if adequate measures are not adopted by the responsible
    entities (Chandra Pal et al. 2021; Memarian and Akbari 2021). 5 Conclusion This
    study assessed the impacts of flood disasters and determined areas facing possible
    or potential soil erosion risk based on the RUSLE-GloSEM approach in western Iran
    in a GIS environment. Although various factors are involved in increasing the
    intensity of soil erosion, changes in climatic parameters, mainly due to climate
    change, play a very important role. In the study area, rainfall erosivity caused
    significant damage both before and after the floods. The highest amount of rainfall
    erosivity belonged to the southern parts of the study area such as Poldakhtar
    county (mainly due to land-use change, as most of the population is directly and
    indirectly involved with agricultural production) and the northern and western
    parts such as Dorud, Khorramabad, and Delfan counties (due to mountainous terrain).
    These areas constitute the high-risk flood zones in Lorestan province. Before
    the recent episode of flooding, snow had covered the mountains in the region.
    Following an increase in air temperature and rainfall, the accumulated snow melted,
    which intensified the floods. In addition, due to the large amount of rainfall
    on April 12th, 2019, soils were almost saturated, which reduced the infiltration
    rate and increased runoff generation. Additionally, continuous and long-term droughts
    in the study area have contributed to erosion. About 78% of the province has experienced
    moderate to severe droughts although central areas have suffered less severe erosion
    compared to the rest of the study area. Overall, orchards, farms, rangelands and
    forests with moderate or low vegetation cover were the most vulnerable land uses
    to soil erosion. Khorramdareh county, with the largest area of rainfed and irrigated
    farms, and Poldakhtar county with the largest area of rangelands and forests,
    faced the highest rates of erosion. Due to the continuous drought in the study
    area during the past years, vegetation cover has declined across the province,
    depriving soils of protection against water erosion. Droughts in recent decades
    have increased soil salinity as well. Soil salinity is more severe in Poldakhtar
    county (in the southern part of the study area with extensive areas devoted to
    agriculture). Moreover, droughts have subsequently reduced permeability and increased
    soil erosion during floods. Analysis of the spatial distribution of soil erosion
    showed that the southern parts (such as Poldakhtar) and central and eastern parts
    (such as Khorramabad and Aligudarz) have experienced significant erosion before
    and after floods. The results indicated that both natural factors such as climate
    change, and anthropogenic factors such as agricultural development, population
    growth, and overgrazing have intensified erosion. Studies conducted in different
    regions of the world have shown that variations in agricultural practices, slope,
    and population density are strongly linked with variations in soil erosion. According
    to a FAO report (2015) both natural factors such as climate change, and anthropogenic
    factors such as agricultural development, population growth, and overgrazing intensify
    erosion. The study area clearly shows the effects of both categories of factors
    (natural and anthropogenic) on causing and intensifying erosion. The results indicate
    the importance of topography for the severity of soil erosion. Increasing slope
    in lands with low vegetation density has increased the severity of soil erosion.
    Our results also showed that land use changes in the southern and eastern parts
    of the study area will lead to reduced organic matter content, reduced soil quality,
    and changes in the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Along with increased
    erosivity of rainfall, these factors will increase soil erosion in the area. Climate
    studies indicated that total rainfall in Lorestan province has decreased, similar
    to many other regions in Iran. On the other hand, the frequency of maximal rainfall
    events has increased. These conditions can indicate an increase in heavy and short-term
    rain storms and shortening of the rainy season in the region, which consequently
    escalate soil erosion potential. Modeling of future conditions also confirmed
    that climatic changes along with land use change are the main drivers of the increase
    in soil erosion. Combined land use change-climate change simulation indicates
    significant increases in soil erosion under SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, and SSP5-RCP8.5
    scenarios. The percentage of areas falling into the high and very high classes
    of ersosion is expected to increase in step with worsening climate change-land
    use change scenarios; while 64% of the study area falls into these two classes
    under SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP5-RCP8.5 predicts that 71% of the study area will face high
    or very hight erosion by 2070. What is clear from the outcomes of this research
    is that floods, due to their role in the destruction of vegetation and soil and
    as important factors in changing river morphology and slope topography, can more
    than double the amount of soil erosion in the studied watershed. A wide variety
    of indices and factors are included in the RUSLE model. Therefore, future research
    should focus on fine-tuning the model to better represent real-world conditions.
    Future works should augment previous studies by including other types of erosion,
    estimating erosion at shorter time scales, and improving the accuracy of the equations
    used to estimate erosion. References Adeel Z, Alarcón AM, Bakkensen L, Franco

  description: The source apportionment and transfer of Pb in a paddy soil-rice-human
    system within the Jiulong River Basin in southeast China was investigated by analyzing
    (1) the chemical fractionation of Pb in paddy soils using a modified BCR four-step
    sequential extraction procedure, and (2) the bioaccessibility of Pb in both paddy
    soils and rice grains using a Simple Bioaccessibility Extraction Test method.
    In addition, a qualitative Pb isotopic model was used in combination with IsoSource
    software to quantify the contribution of potential Pb sources. The results show
    the enrichment of Pb in agro-ecosystems in the Jiulong River Basin. Contaminant
    Pb in paddy soils was mainly present in the reducible (42.9%) and the residual
    fractions (27.1%). The average bioaccessibility of Pb in rice grains was significantly
    higher than that in paddy soil, with values of 77.85% and 37.44%, respectively.
    Lead in paddy soils was primarily derived from agricultural (35.3%), natural (25.5%),
    industrial (24.5%) and coal combustion sources (14.7%), while Pb in rice grains
    was primarily derived from coal combustion (54.1%), agricultural (35.1%), industrial
    (6.0%) and natural sources (4.8%). The bioaccessible Pb was mainly derived from
    anthropogenic sources [agricultural (42.3% for soil and 25.3% for grain) and coal
    combustion sources (25.3% for soil and 59.3% for grain)]. Lead isotopic ratios
    are an effective tracer of Pb transfer from potential sources to rice plants and
    within the rice plants. Rice plants absorb Pb from the soil and the atmosphere
    through the roots and leaves, respectively. Most of the Pb was accumulated in
    roots. The integrated use of chemical fractionation, bioaccessibility and Pb isotopic
    data provides an effective method to study the source apportionment and transfer
    characteristics of Pb in paddy soil-rice-human systems.

    Heavy metal pollution has become a global problem and is of great concern because
    heavy metals are persistent, non-degradable and may bio-accumulate in the environment
    (Wang et al., 2018b). The contamination of agro-ecosystems by heavy metals not
    only decreases the quality and yield of crops, but also threatens human health
    and the sustainable development of society (Briffa et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020;
    Wu et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2018). Among the heavy metals, lead (Pb) has gained
    considerable attention as one of the most serious global environmental pollutants
    due to its high toxicity, persistence and widespread distribution (Abbaszade et
    al., 2022; Toyomaki et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022). Paddy rice is a well-known
    food staple for more than half of the world''s population (Majed et al., 2016;
    Sharafi et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018a). Many rice growing countries around
    the world, including China, the largest producer of paddy rice in the world, have
    observed Pb contamination in paddy soil-rice systems (Ali et al., 2020; Hu et
    al., 2016; Mao et al., 2019). Pb accumulated in the paddy soil-rice system can
    enter humans through direct routes (e.g., ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact)
    and indirect routes (e.g., the paddy soil-rice-human food chain) (Ali et al.,
    2020; Briffa et al., 2020; Rai et al., 2019) and cause health risks. Therefore,
    it is essential to study the sources of Pb and its transfer characteristics in
    the paddy soil-rice-human system to develop the corresponding pollution prevention
    and control measures that are required for food security and sustainable development.
    During the past few decades, Pb isotopic tracing has been widely used to determine
    potential sources of Pb in the atmosphere (Tao et al., 2021), soil (Chen et al.,
    2022; Huang et al., 2020; Kong et al., 2018a; Kong et al., 2018b), river sediments
    (Child et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022), fly ash (Wang et al.,
    2019), and runoff water (Carrasco et al., 2018). Different sources of Pb generally
    have a specific isotopic composition, which is called a “Pb fingerprint” (Bi et
    al., 2017; Chen et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020). The isotopic compositions of
    Pb in the environment depends on the geological age and respective U–Th–Pb concentrations
    of the various source materials (Deng et al., 2021; Noerpel et al., 2020). A lack
    of isotopic fractionation by physical, geochemical and biological processes preserves
    the isotopic signature of the Pb within the source materials as it moves through
    an ecosystem (Cheng and Hu, 2010; He et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2021; Tao et al.,
    2021). The Pb isotopic composition of a particular non-source sample, then, reflects
    the relative contributions of Pb from each potential source, making it possible
    for Pb isotopic signatures to be used for source identification by comparing the
    Pb isotope compositions (i.e., 208Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/207Pb, 207Pb/206Pb) of potential
    sources (anthropogenic or natural) and an environmental media of interest (e.g.,
    soil, sediment, air, or plants). Interestingly, the total concentration of Pb
    in the environment does not always represent the fraction available for organisms
    and/or plants. Heavy metal contaminants in the paddy soil-rice system exist in
    numerous chemical fractions with varying mobility, toxicity, and bioavailability
    (Huang et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2015a; Tessier et al., 1979). To better understand
    Pb sources and its transfer through the paddy soil-rice-human system, the chemical
    fractionation and bioaccessibility of Pb should be considered. The chemical fractionation
    of heavy metals in soils can be analyzed using sequential extraction procedures
    (Fernández-Ondoño et al., 2017). One of the most widely used methods is the Community
    Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction procedure which subdivides metals
    into acid-soluble, reducible, oxidizable and residual fractions (Huang et al.,
    2014; Ure et al., 1993). The oral bioaccessibility of heavy metals can be determined
    by in vitro extraction procedures that mimic the physiological conditions found
    in the stomach or intestine (Fu and Cui, 2013). The Simple Bioaccessibility Extraction
    Test (SBET) is a single-step in vitro extraction method that simulates the action
    of gastric juices (Rodrigues et al., 2018). The method provides a rapid alternative
    to in vivo assays and has been established as the standard operating procedure
    for the in vitro bioaccessibility assay for Pb by the USEPA (USEPA, 2007). In
    recent years, numerous scholars have carried out studies on the source apportionment,
    chemical speciation and transfer characteristics of heavy metals in agro-ecosystems,
    but studies have typically focused on only one of these parameters. Studies combining
    chemical fractionation, bioaccessibility and isotopic data to assess source apportionment
    and transfer characteristics of Pb in paddy soil-rice-human systems are relatively
    rare. This study is novel, then, in that it combines total concentration, chemical
    fractionation, bioaccessibility and isotopic data for Pb in the soil-rice-human
    system of the Jiulong River Basin to (i) more accurately trace the potential sources
    of Pb in the soil-rice-human system and quantify the contribution of each source;
    and (ii) trace the transfer of Pb in the soil-agriculture-human system. The results
    of this study can provide a scientific basis for pollution prevention and the
    control of Pb contamination in agro-ecosystems in this region, and provide an
    important practical reference for quantitative studies on the sources and transfer
    characteristics of Pb in soil-agriculture-human systems in other regions. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area The Jiulong River Basin is located on the southwestern
    part of Fujian Province. There are 6.5 million people living in the Basin (Li
    et al., 2020), which as has a well-developed economy that accounts for about 25%
    of the gross domestic product (GDP) of Fujian Province (Li, 2017). Of particular
    economic significance is the basin''s well-developed agricultural economy that
    is largely based on rice, sugarcane, peanuts, bananas, and honeydew. The Basin''s
    agro-environmental safety is therefore of great significance to the sustainable
    economic development of the economic zone on the west coast of the Taiwan Strait.
    Rich reserves of mineral resources, including limestone, granite, coal, iron ore,
    and kaolinite (Lin and Zhang, 2009), are also of economic significance. The Jiulong
    River Basin encompasses a total drainage area of 14,260 km2, which is about 12%
    of the land area of Fujian Province. The primary components of the drainage network
    included the North River Basin (274 km long, with a drainage area of 9640 km2),
    the West River Basin (172 km long, with a drainage area of 3960 km2) and the South
    River Basin (172 km long, with a drainage area of 660 km2) (Yin et al., 2020).
    The Jiulong River Basin is, in general, topographically higher in the northwest
    (characterized by moderate-to low-relief mountains) and lower in the southeast
    (characterized mainly by hills and terraces). The mountain range is oriented northeast
    (NE) to north-northeast (NNE), with many ridges and canyons (Hong et al., 2009).
    The geology of the Jiulong River Basin is complex; carbonate rocks are widely
    distributed in the upstream areas of the North River Basin, whereas Mesozoic magmatic
    rocks are widely distributed throughout the Jiulong River Basin (Zhang and Zuo,
    2015). The soils in the Jiulong River Basin can be mainly divided into zonal soils
    and anthropogenic soils, which are collectively distributed over about 95% of
    the basin area. The zonal soils mainly include red soil, lateritic red soil, and
    yellow soil, which are distributed over about 62%, 16% and 8% of the basin area,
    respectively. The anthropogenic soil is mainly cultivated paddy soil, which is
    distributed over about 9% of the basin area (Yin et al., 2020). The land-use types
    in the Jiulong River Basin are mainly forest (70%), arable land (18%), urban areas,
    and residential areas (5%) (Chen et al., 2014). The land-use map of the Jiulong
    River Basin is presented in Fig. S1. Climatically, the Jiulong River Basin is
    characterized by a southern subtropical monsoon climate, with significant temporal
    and spatial differences in temperature and rainfall (Huang et al., 2013). Favorable
    soils and climate provide the conditions needed for agricultural economic development.
    Over the past few decades, the Jiulong River Basin has experienced rapid industrialization
    and urbanization, which has led to heavy metal (such as Pb) pollution of the region''s
    soils, sediments, and water bodies (Lin et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2019; Zhang
    et al., 2014). Livestock farming exists in the upstream areas of the North River.
    A large amount of cash crop cultivation exists in the upstream and middle reaches
    of the West River, while more urban and industrial activities exist in the area
    of the estuary (Li et al., 2020). A previous study found that the potential sources
    of heavy metals in the paddy soil-rice system within the Jiulong River Basin include
    natural sources, agricultural sources, industrial sources, coal combustion, and
    vehicle traffic (Huang et al., 2019). 2.2. Sample collection and pretreatment
    In this study, paddy soil and rice plant samples were collected from the rice-growing
    districts of the Jiulong River Basin during the rice harvest. Each sample was
    a composite of five sub-samples taken within a 10-m rectangle at 71 paddy soil
    sampling sites and 45 rice sampling sites (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res
    image (925KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Sampling locations of
    paddy soils, rice plants and potential sources within the Jiulong River Basin.
    Approximately 1 kg of well-mixed paddy soil (0–20 cm in depth) was collected with
    a bamboo shovel using the quadrat method and placed in a clean polyethylene sealed
    bag. The paddy soil samples were air-dried at room temperature in the laboratory
    and gently crushed with a clean wooden stick to remove stones, grass roots, and
    other debris. Some of the paddy soil samples were ground with an agate mortar
    and then passed through a 2-mm nylon sieve for the determination of soil pH; other
    samples were ground with an agate mortar and then passed through a 0.075-mm nylon
    sieve for the determination of Pb concentration and selected Pb isotopic ratios.
    Rice plant samples were uprooted and brought back to the laboratory where they
    were washed with ultrapure 18.2 MΩ water (Milli-Q® Integral system). Each rice
    plant sample was dried and divided into root, stem, leaf, husk and grain. The
    rice plant organ samples were subsequently crushed into a powder using a grinder
    and placed in clean polyethylene sealed bags. The major potential source samples
    (four natural source samples, six agricultural source samples, five industrial
    source samples, six coal combustion source samples, and five traffic source samples)
    were also collected for Pb isotope analysis (Fig. 1). The natural source samples
    included soil parent material collected from deep uncontaminated horizons at sampling
    sites 8, 16, 34 and 69; the agricultural source samples were compound fertilizers
    and calcium superphosphate commonly used in the study area, which were collected
    from farmer''s markets. The industrial source samples were Pb ore materials used
    in industry, which were collected from the local Pb–Zn deposits. The coal combustion
    source samples included raw coal, fly ash, and furnace bottom slag collected from
    coal-fired enterprises. The traffic source samples included gasoline exhaust dust
    and diesel exhaust dust collected from parking lots. All potential source samples
    were air dried, ground and sieved through a 0.075-mm nylon sieve for the determination
    of Pb concentration and Pb isotopic composition. 2.3. Chemical analysis and instrumental
    measurement 2.3.1. Determination of Pb concentrations The soil from the rice fields
    was digested in an acid mixture consisting of HNO3, HCl, HF and HClO4 to determine
    total Pb concentrations. The total Pb concentration of the different rice plant
    organs was digested by a mixture of acid consisting of HNO3 and HClO4. The digestion
    solution was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter membrane and then fixed with 2%
    HNO3 and stored at 4 °C. The Pb concentrations in the digestion solution were
    determined by ICP-MS (Agilent 7700x, Agilent Technologies, USA) (Huang et al.,
    2019). 2.3.2. BCR sequential extraction A modified BCR four-step sequential extraction
    procedure (Ure et al., 1993; Qu et al., 2017) was used to analyze the chemical
    fractionation of Pb in paddy soils in this study. Lead in the paddy soils were
    divided into (1) the acid-soluble fraction (exchangeable and carbonate-associated,
    F1) which was extracted by a 0.11 M acetic acid solution, (2) a reducible fraction
    (bound to Fe/Mn oxides, F2) which was extracted by a 0.1 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride
    solution (pH = 1.5), (3) an oxidizable fraction (bound to organic matter, F3),
    which was extracted by 0.1 M ammonium acetate solution after digestion with H2O2,
    and (4) a residual fraction (F4) which was digested by a mixture of the same acids
    used for the total digestion, including HNO3, HCl, HF and HClO4. The extraction
    procedure is summarized in Table S1. The supernatant filtrate of each chemical
    fraction was obtained following filtration through a 0.45-μm fiber membrane and
    the concentration of Pb was determined using ICP-MS (Agilent 7700x, Agilent Technologies,
    USA). 2.3.3. SBET in-vitro digestion test A Simple Bioaccessibility Extraction
    Test (SBET) was used to analyze the bioaccessibility of Pb in paddy soils and
    rice grains (USEPA, 2007; USEPA, 2008; Ning et al., 2021). The analysis involved
    the mixing of 0.4 g of paddy soil (or rice grain) and 40 mL simulated gastric
    fluid (0.4 M glycine solution adjusted to pH 1.50 ± 0.05 with HCl) in a polypropylene
    bottle (1:100 weight-to-volume ratio). The bottles were continuously shaken for
    1 h at 100 rpm and 37 °C. The supernatant filtrate of each sample was obtained
    through a 0.45-μm fiber membrane and the Pb concentration was determined using
    ICP-MS (Agilent 7700x, Agilent Technologies, USA). 2.3.4. Determination of Pb
    isotopic compositions Based on the measured Pb concentrations in the total digestion
    solution, the BCR four-step sequential extraction solution and the SBET extraction
    solution, an appropriate amount of the solution containing approximately 1 μg
    of Pb was evaporated on an electric hot plate until nearly dry, after which 1
    mL of HCl was added and evaporate to near dryness on a hotplate. Then, 1.5 mL
    of 0.5 mol L−1 hydrobromic acid was added to the digestion tube for 1 h. The solution
    was cooled and separated by centrifugation with a Bio-Rad AG1-X1 anion exchange
    resin (200 mesh). The separated solutions were subsequently placed on an electric
    hot plate and evaporated to near dryness and re-dissolved with 2% HNO3. The Pb
    isotopic compositions were then determined using an ICP-MS (Agilent 7700x, Agilent
    Technologies, USA) in isotope ratio mode. 2.3.5. Quality control and assurance
    Strict quality control and assurance procedures were used throughout each stage
    of sample analysis, including sample pretreatment, chemical analyses and instrumental
    measurements. Details are presented in Text S1. 2.4. Data analysis 2.4.1. Statistical
    analysis The soil and rice plant sampling location maps and the kriging interpolation
    analysis of the analytical results were drawn using ArcGIS 10.8. Statistical analyses,
    such as mean and standard deviation of the measured data, were performed using
    Microsoft Office Excel 2016. Pearson correlation analysis and data normality tests
    were performed using SPSS 19.0. Scatter plots, box line plots, and 3D scatter
    plots, among others were created using Origin 2023. 2.4.2. Source apportionment
    of Pb using isotopic ratios A mass balance-based multi-source hybrid IsoSource
    model was chosen for source apportionment and the model details are presented
    in Text S2. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Total concentration, chemical fractionation
    and bioaccessibility of Pb in the soil-rice-human system 3.1.1. Lead concentrations
    in the soil-rice system Descriptive statistics for the concentrations of Pb in
    paddy soils and different rice plant organs are presented in Table 1. The total
    Pb concentrations in the paddy soils exhibited a coefﬁcient of variation of Pb
    of 0.38, indicating that Pb concentrations were moderately variable (Huang et
    al., 2019). Lead concentrations ranged between 40.16 and 168.11 mg/kg, whereas
    the mean was 72.29 mg/kg. The Pb concentrations in all sampling sites were higher
    than the average background value of Pb in soils of Fujian Province (34.9 mg/kg)
    (Chen et al., 1992). Compared to the risk screening values for soil contamination
    of agricultural land (MEEC, 2018), the excessive rate of Pb was 14.1%. The average
    Pb concentration (72.29 mg/kg) in the paddy soils of the Jiuolong River Basin
    was higher than that in Hunan, China (62.07 mg/kg), Guangxi, China (31.2 mg/kg),
    the Yangtze River Delta, China (31.633 mg/kg), Jiangsu, China (49.04 mg/kg), India
    (72.05 mg/kg), the USA (55 mg/kg), Japan (29.0 mg/kg), Bangladesh (4.96 mg/kg)
    and Korea (5.3 mg/kg) (Table S2). These results indicate that Pb is enrichment
    in paddy soils. It is possible, then, that there is a risk that Pb may reduce
    the quality and safety of edible agricultural products, decrease crop growth,
    or adversely affect soil ecology. Therefore, continuous monitoring of lead contamination
    in paddy soils in the region should be carried out to track Pb contamination and
    take timely measures. Table 1. Descriptive statistics of total, chemical fractionation

    SBETsoil and SBETgrain represent the bioaccessible concentrations of Pb in paddy
    soil and rice grains determined using a Simple Bioaccessibility Extraction Test
    method (SBET). The concentrations of Pb in grains ranged between 0.02 and 0.20
    (average 0.07) mg/kg, which were all below the limit of pollutant risks in grains
    (GB2762-2017) (FDAC, 2017) (the threshold values of Pb in rice grains is 0.2 mg/kg).
    These data indicate that Pb concentrations in rice grains in the Jiulong River
    Basin meet the requirements of the national standards. The average Pb concentration
    (0.07 mg/kg) in the rice grains of the Jiuolong River Basin was higher than that
    in India (0.018 mg/kg), Thailand (0.019 mg/kg), Pakistan (0.020 mg/kg), the USA
    (0.034 mg/kg) and Egypt (0.017 mg/kg), while lower than in Hunan, China (0.248
    mg/kg), Guangxi, China (0.17 mg/kg), the Yangtze River Delta, China (0.098 mg/kg),
    Jiangsu, China (0.098 mg/kg) and Australia (0.375 mg/kg) (Table S2). The spatial
    distribution of Pb concentrations in paddy soils and rice grains were analyzed
    using kriging interpolation analysis (Fig. S2). The high Pb values in paddy soils
    were mainly in the Zhangzhou region, while the high values of Pb in rice grains
    were mainly in the Longyan region. This difference between the two indicates that
    Pb in the rice grains does not depend exclusively on the Pb in the paddy soils,
    but is influenced by a combination of other factors such as soil physicochemical
    properties, the chemical form of Pb, and Pb migration through rice plants. The
    average concentration of Pb varied within the rice plants in the following order:
    roots > leaves > stems > husks > grains. It is worth noting that the results of
    a t-test showed that the concentrations of Pb in roots were higher than in other
    plant parts (P < 0.01), which is consistent with the distribution of metals observed
    in crops in Xinjiang (Tudi et al., 2021) and Danzhai (Hong et al., 2021). Previous
    studies suggest that this phenomenon may be related to mechanisms that allow the
    plants to tolerate the metals (Baldantoni et al., 2016; Tudi et al., 2021; Zhang
    et al., 2019). 3.1.2. Chemical fractionation of lead in paddy soils Statistical
    descriptions of Pb concentrations in the four chemical fractions are presented
    in Table 1, whereas the percentages of Pb in the four fractions are shown in Fig.
    2. The average percentages of Pb varied in following order: F2 (42.9% ± 9.8%)
    > F4 (27.1% ± 4.3%) > F1 (24.9% ± 6.2%) > F3 (5.1% ± 3.2%). Thus, Pb in paddy
    soils was dominated by the reducible fraction. Previous studies have found that
    the stability of Pb species can be affected by Fe and Mn hydrous oxides which
    have a stronger binding capacity than the other reactive phases (Liu et al., 2016;
    Liu et al., 2019b; Rodríguez et al., 2009). This fraction can pose potential environmental
    risks because Pb in the reducible fraction can be released into the environment
    under the reducing conditions commonly found in the surface environment. Download

    Chemical fractions as a percent of total Pb in the paddy soils. Lead in the acid-soluble
    fraction can pose direct environmental risks when the soil environment changes
    (e.g., in terms of pH and redox potential), while Pb in the residual fraction
    poses almost no environmental risks because Pb is imbedded in the silicate crystalline
    structure of the soil materials and is unlikely to be released into the environment
    (Nemati et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2016). The percentage of Pb in the oxidizable
    fraction was lower than other fractions, perhaps because the concentration of
    organic matter was low and could not effectively compete as an absorbent with
    Fe–Mn oxides (Liu et al., 2021). The Pb in each chemical fraction may also be
    transformed under different environmental conditions. For example, prolonged flooding
    may lead to altered redox conditions in paddy soils and result in the transformation
    of Pb between the reducible and oxidizable fractions (Huang et al., 2014; Xiao
    et al., 2017). 3.1.3. Bioaccessibility of lead in paddy soils and rice grains
    The bioaccessible concentrations of Pb in paddy soils ranged between 5.40 and
    115.07 mg/kg (average 29.20 mg/kg); the range for rice grains was 0.01–0.10 mg/kg
    (average 0.05 mg/kg) (Table 1). The Pb bioaccessibility values, presented in terms
    of the percentage of bioaccessible Pb to total Pb concentrations in paddy soil
    and rice grains, were 11.20%–91.38% (average 37.44%) and 49.39%–96.54% (average
    77.85%), respectively (Fig. 3). The bioaccessible concentration of Pb in paddy
    soils was therefore much higher than in rice grains. However, the bioaccessibility
    of Pb in rice grains was much higher than in paddy soils. These data indicate
    that Pb may be more readily absorbed by the human body from rice grains than from
    the paddy soils. Download : Download high-res image (278KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The bioaccessibility values of Pb in paddy soil and rice
    grains. The bioaccessibility of Pb varies considerably between sampling sites.
    High bioaccessibility values were found even in samples with very low Pb concentrations.
    This is because the bioaccessibility of Pb in soil depends on a combination of
    factors, such as the total Pb concentration, the chemical species of Pb, the physicochemical
    properties of the soil (e.g., pH, Eh), the soil type and the climatic conditions
    in the area (Han et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2015; Xing et al., 2019). The bioaccessibility
    of Pb in rice grains may be influenced by the source of Pb and the composition
    of plant fibers (e.g., microfibers of crystalline cellulose) (Liu et al., 2017a;
    Zhuang et al., 2016). Therefore, the bioaccessibility of Pb does not depend on
    the Pb concentration. Even samples with low Pb concentration may have high bioaccessibility.
    Previous studies have suggested that oral ingestion is the most important route
    for heavy metals to enter the human body from crops (Doabi et al., 2018). The
    higher bioaccessibility of Pb in rice may make it easier for Pb to accumulate
    in humans and may create health risks during long-term exposure via ingestion.
    Therefore, Pb in rice grains with its higher bioaccessibility is a major concern.
    The relationships between the total, each of the chemical fractions and bioaccessible
    Pb concentrations in the paddy soil-rice-human system were analyzed and are presented
    in Text S3. 3.2. Pb isotopic compositions of the paddy soil-rice-human system
    3.2.1. Pb isotopic compositions of potential Pb sources Most previous studies
    have typically used isotopic ratios based on 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb for source
    apportionment. Herein, we focus on three ratios based on 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb
    including 206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/207Pb. Natural sources of Pb had
    the highest 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb values, and fossil fuel sources had the
    highest 208Pb/206Pb values (Fig. 4 and Table S3). Download : Download high-res

    of potential sources. The Pb isotopic compositions of natural, agricultural, industrial,
    coal combustion and traffic sources are distinct, and form separate populations
    of ratios. Therefore, three-dimensional models based on 206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/206Pb
    and 208Pb/207Pb can be used to resolve the sources of Pb in the paddy soil-rice-human
    system within the Jiulong River Basin. 3.2.2. Isotopic compositions of total Pb
    in the paddy soil-rice system Descriptive statistics for the examined Pb isotopic
    ratios in paddy soils and different parts of the rice plants are presented in
    Fig. 5 and Table S3. The isotopic ratios in the paddy soils ranged between 1.1673
    and 1.1874 for 206Pb/207Pb, 2.0696–2.0990 for 208Pb/206Pb and 2.4473–2.4760 for
    208Pb/207Pb. The Pb isotopic ratios varied among the different parts of the rice
    plants. The different rice plant parts can be roughly divided into two categories
    on the basis of Pb isotopic ratios, including (1) roots and stems, characterized
    by lower 208Pb/206Pb and higher 206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb ratios, and (2) leaf,
    husk and grain, characterized by higher 208Pb/206Pb and lower 206Pb/207Pb and
    208Pb/207Pb ratios. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    (c) ratios of paddy soils and different rice plant organs. 3.2.3. Pb isotopic
    compositions of different chemical fractions The examined isotopic ratios vary
    among the different chemical fractions (Fig. 5 and Table S3). Generally, the average
    206Pb/207Pb ratio of the acid-soluble fraction (1.1734) was less than the reducible
    fraction (1.1796), which, in turn, was less than the oxidizable fraction (1.1825).
    The residual fraction possessed the highest average 206Pb/207Pb ratio of 1.1893.
    The average 208Pb/206Pb ratio exhibited the opposite trend, in which the acid-soluble
    fraction (2.0925)>reducible fraction (2.0877)>oxidizable fraction (2.0858)>residual
    fraction (2.0792). There was a small overlap between the Pb isotopic ratios of
    the different chemical fractions (Fig. 7). This may be due to the combining of
    Pb from multiple potential sources in the different chemical fractions and the
    interconversion between different chemical fractions. The 206Pb/207Pb ratios in
    the acid-soluble and reducible fractions were lower than that of total Pb, while
    the 208Pb/206Pb ratios were higher than that of total Pb (Fig. 5). In contrast,
    the 206Pb/207Pb ratios in the oxidizable and residual fractions were higher than
    that of total Pb, while the 208Pb/206Pb ratios were lower than that of total Pb
    (Fig. 5). In addition, the isotopic compositions of total Pb in paddy soils are
    similar to those of the reducible fraction and, to a lesser degree, the oxidizable
    fraction. These results indicate that the source of total Pb in the paddy soils
    was a combination of Pb found in the sources from different chemical fractions.
    3.2.4. Isotopic compositions of bioaccessible Pb Descriptive statistics for the
    isotopic compositions of bioaccessible Pb in the paddy soils and grains are presented
    in Fig. 5 and Table S3. Bioaccessible Pb had a lower 206Pb/207Pb ratio and a higher
    208Pb/206Pb ratio relative to total Pb. Moreover, the bioaccessible Pb in the
    rice grains exhibited a lower 206Pb/207Pb ratio and a higher 208Pb/206Pb ratio
    relative to that in paddy soils (Fig. 5). Previous studies have argued that this
    phenomenon is due to differences in the solubility of the different Pb sources
    in the gastric phase (Farmer et al., 2011; Kelepertzisa et al., 2021; Luo et al.,
    2012). The isotopic compositions of the bioaccessible Pb in the paddy soils and
    rice grains were closer to those of the acid-soluble and reducible fractions (Fig.
    7). These results suggest that the bioaccessible Pb, which can be absorbed by
    the human body, is more likely to originate from anthropogenic sources. This result
    is consistent with the findings reported by other researchers (Li et al., 2015;
    Kelepertzisa et al., 2021). A linear regression model was developed between the
    206Pb/207Pb ratio of bioaccessible Pb in paddy soils and the 206Pb/207Pb ratio
    of Pb in different chemical fractions, respectively. The regression coefficients
    of the fitted results were in the order of the acid-soluble fraction (R2 = 0.6765)>reducible
    fraction (R2 = 0.2860)>oxidizable fraction (R2 = 0.2196)>residual fraction (R2
    = 0.0176) (Fig. S3). In light of the previous discussion, it is clear that Pb
    in the non-residual fraction of paddy soils is mainly derived from anthropogenic
    sources. The linear regression between the isotopic composition of bioaccessible
    Pb and each chemical fraction further indicates that bioaccessible Pb is mainly
    derived from anthropogenic sources. Linear regression models were developed between
    the 206Pb/207Pb ratio of bioaccessible Pb and the corresponding bioaccessibility
    of Pb in paddy soils and rice grains, respectively. The results show that the
    correlation between Pb isotopic composition and the bioaccessibility of Pb in
    paddy soils and rice grains was not significant with correlation coefficients
    ranging from 0.0007 to 0.0273 (Fig. S4). These statistical data indicate that
    the Pb isotopic compositions were less influenced by bioaccessibility. 3.3. Source
    apportionment of Pb in the soil-rice-human system Lead isotopic signatures can
    be used for source identification by comparing the Pb isotope compositions of
    potential sources (anthropogenic or natural) and environmental samples. We used
    cross-plots of 208Pb/207Pb vs. 206Pb/207Pb and three-dimensional plots based on
    206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/207Pb for the source identification of Pb in
    paddy soil-rice-human systems. The Pb isotopic compositions of paddy soils all
    fall within the region composed of natural, agricultural, industrial and coal
    combustion sources, suggesting that Pb in the paddy soil-rice system is mainly
    derived from these four sources (Fig. S5(a), Fig. 6). The Pb isotopic composition
    of traffic sources differed significantly from those of the paddy soil-rice system,
    indicating that the Pb from vehicles did not contribute to Pb in the paddy soil-rice
    system or that their contributions were negligible (Table S3). It has been suggested
    that combining Pb isotope ratios with concentrations can provide insights into
    Pb sources (Peng et al., 2022a; Peng et al., 2022b). Herein, we plotted 206Pb/207Pb
    vs. 1/[Pb] to identify the sources of Pb in paddy soils. The R2 of the best fit
    line is 0.0013 (Fig. S6), indicating that there are more than two sources. The
    Pb isotopic ratios for paddy soils also fall within the region of natural, agricultural,
    industrial and coal combustion sources, which further supports that argument that
    Pb in paddy soils was a mix of these four sources. Similarly, the R2 values of
    the regressions between 206Pb/207Pb and 1/[Pb] in the paddy soil-rice-human system
    were also low for the other sample materials including F1 (0.0372), F2 (0.0629),
    F3 (0.0393), F4 (0.0915), SBETsoil (0.136), root (0.0195), stem (0.0165), leaf
    (0.0011), husk (0.0055), grain (0.0025) and SBETgrain (0.0009). These coefficients
    indicate that Pb in these samples was also a mixture of more than two potential
    sources. According to Fig. S5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, the Pb isotopic compositions of
    samples in the paddy soil-rice-human system all fall within the region composed
    of the natural, agricultural, industrial and coal combustion sources, indicating
    that Pb in these samples were a mixture of these four potential sources. It is
    worth noting that the Pb isotopic composition of the residual fraction is more
    closely aligned with that of the natural source, suggesting that the residual
    fraction is composed largely of Pb from natural sources. The Pb isotopic compositions
    of the non-residual fraction (i.e., the acid-soluble, reducible and oxidizable
    fractions) are more closely aligned to the anthropogenic sources (i.e., the agricultural,
    industrial and coal combustion sources), suggesting that the non-residual fraction
    is composed primarily of Pb from these anthropogenic sources (Fig. 7). Download

    of Pb and bioaccessible Pb in the paddy soil-rice-human system. The mass balance-based
    multi-source hybrid IsoSource model was used to quantify the contribution of Pb
    from each source in the soil-rice-human system (Fig. 8). The contributions of
    natural, agricultural, industrial and coal combustion sources to total Pb in paddy
    soils ranged from 7.4% to 56.9% (average 25.5%), 5.3%–74.1% (average 35.3%), 8.9%–59.0%
    (average 24.5%) and 3.4%–47.9% (average 14.7%), respectively. The contributions
    of natural, agricultural, industrial and coal combustion sources to total Pb in
    rice grains ranged from 0.3% to 13.5% (average 4.8%), 19.0%–46.4% (average 35.1%),
    0.3%–16.3% (average 6.0%) and 28.94%–71.4% (average 54.1%), respectively. The
    spatial distributions of the contribution rates of each potential source to total
    Pb in paddy soil and rice grains were analyzed using kriging interpolation analysis
    (Fig. S7 and Fig. S8). The results show that relatively high contributions of
    natural, agricultural and industrial sources to the total Pb in paddy soil and
    rice grains were mainly distributed in the middle and upper basin, whereas higher
    contributions from coal combustion sources were mainly distributed in the area
    of the estuary. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Contribution of Pb from four selected potential sources to the Pb
    in the soil-rice-human system; (a) coal combustion sources; (b) agricultural sources;
    (c) industrial sources; (d) natural sources. Previous researchers have reported
    that the chemical fractionation of heavy metals can provide important information
    on pollution sources (Islam et al., 2015b; Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017).
    The average contribution of natural sources to the total Pb in paddy soils was
    25.5%, while the average contribution to the residual fraction of Pb was 60.8%.
    These values indicate that the Pb in the residual fraction is mainly associated
    with natural sources. Moreover, it indicates that Pb in the residual fraction
    is not entirely derived from natural sources; some of the Pb in the residual fraction
    may be derived from anthropogenic sources. The average contribution of anthropogenic
    sources (agricultural, industrial and coal combustion sources) to the total Pb
    in paddy soil was 74.5%, while the average contributions to the acid-soluble fraction
    and the reducible fraction were 85.6% and 75.2%, respectively. These results indicate
    that the non-residual fraction of Pb is mainly associated with anthropogenic sources.
    It also indicates that the Pb in the non-residual fraction is not entirely derived
    from anthropogenic sources; part of the Pb derived from natural sources may also
    exist in the non-residual fraction after dissolution and other effects. The source
    appointment results suggest that Pb from different sources may be present in different
    chemical fractions in the paddy soils. For example, Pb from natural sources tends
    to exist in the residual fraction, while Pb from coal combustion sources tends
    to exist in the acid-soluble fraction. However, this tendency is not obvious because
    a small overlap occurs between the Pb isotopic ratios of the different chemical
    fractions. Therefore, the Pb in each chemical fraction is more likely to be a
    composite of different sources. The average contributions of natural, agricultural,
    industrial and coal combustion sources to bioaccessible Pb in paddy soils were
    14.7%, 42.3%, 17.7% and 25.3%, respectively, while the average contributions to
    bioaccessible Pb in rice grains were 5.9%, 27.6%, 7.2% and 59.3%, respectively.
    The contribution of anthropogenic sources to bioaccessible soil Pb was higher
    than that of total Pb, while the contribution of bioaccessible Pb in rice grains
    was not significantly different from total Pb. This is consistent with our finding
    that the bioaccessibility of Pb in paddy soil is lower (37.44%), while the bioaccessibility
    of Pb in rice is higher (77.85%). Lead in paddy soil and rice grains can enter
    the human body through direct exposure (oral ingestion, respiratory inhalation
    and dermal contact) or through the food chain, after which the bioaccessible part
    can be absorbed by the human body (Fu and Cui, 2013; Rodrigues et al., 2018).
    Moreover, the bioaccessible Pb is mainly derived from anthropogenic sources, indicating
    that Pb from anthropogenic sources is more easily absorbed. The above results
    provide a scientific basis for the development of heavy metal pollution prevention
    and control strategies in the region. For the sake of human health and sustainable
    development, anthropogenic sources, especially agricultural and coal combustion
    sources, should be given priority in the development of heavy metal risk control
    measures. 3.4. Transfer characteristics of Pb in soil-rice-human systems 3.4.1.
    Tracking sources using Pb concentrations The bioconcentration factor (BCF) and
    translocation factor (TF) were used to study the translocation of Pb in the paddy
    soil-rice system. The methods used in calculating BCF and TF are presented in
    Text S4. The calculated BCFs for Pb from soil to grain were relatively low (<0.01)
    (Fig. S9), suggesting that only a small portion of the Pb in the soil was accumulated
    in the grains. Roots exhibited a higher accumulation capacity than those of leaf,
    stem, husk and grain. In addition, the Pb concentrations in roots were 46.68–1079.94
    times greater than those of the grain. Thus, we speculate that most of the Pb
    may be accumulated in plant roots after they were absorbed from the soil (Nagajyoti
    et al., 2010; Olowoyo et al., 2012). Our study is consistent with previous studies
    which have shown that Pb is generally known to be blocked from accumulating in
    roots as a nonessential element (Drozdova et al., 2019; Uzu et al., 2010). There
    may be barriers that prevent the migration of Pb from root to grain, root to leaf,
    stem to grain and leaf to grain (Meers et al., 2010; Lin and Aarts, 2012). Comparatively
    speaking, the migration of Pb from roots to grains was limited in this study,
    suggesting that the roots serve as the first barrier for the translocation of
    metals to edible parts of the plant (Shi et al., 2015). The calculated TFs of
    Pb in root-crop systems varied between parts of the crop and the TF values of
    Pb from root to each of these plant parts were less than 1 (Fig. S9). Heavy metals
    exhibited different translocation behaviors as illustrated by differences in the
    order of TFs, which varied as follows: TFroot-leaf > TFroot-stem˃TFroot-husk˃Troot-grain.
    Leaves and stems serve as important entrance pathways of airborne trace elements
    (De Temmerman et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2017b; Wang, 2013). In this study, the
    higher TFs of metals from root to leaf might be associated with atmospheric deposition
    in the region (Charusombat et al., 2010; Cong et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2019a).
    Thus, the calculated TFs from roots to leaves may not correctly reflect the actual
    migration characteristics because they may also reflect other transport pathways.
    This possibility should be furtherly explored in a future study. 3.4.2. Tracking
    using Pb isotopic compositions In order to trace the transport of Pb in the soil-rice-human
    system, the Pb isotopic composition of total soil Pb, different chemical fractions
    of Pb, different organs of rice plants and bioaccessible Pb were comparatively
    analyzed (Fig. 5). The isotopic composition of Pb in plants depends on the source
    of Pb, as Pb does not undergo measurable isotopic fractionation during uptake
    and transport by plants (Li et al., 2012). The Pb isotopic compositions of the
    rice plant roots are similar to those of the paddy soils, suggesting that the
    Pb in the roots of the rice plants is likely to originate largely from Pb in paddy
    soils. The roots exhibit a lower 206Pb/207Pb and higher 208Pb/206Pb than those
    of the total Pb in the paddy soil (Fig. 5) and were most similar to those in the
    acid-soluble fraction of paddy soils. Thus, the Pb in the roots of rice plants
    may be mainly derived from the mobile Pb fraction of the paddy soils. Previous
    studies have shown that plants are more likely to accumulate the mobile soil Pb
    fractions (Hiller et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2014; Qu et al., 2018; Wang et al.,
    2022). It is worth noting that the Pb isotopic compositions of leaves, husks and
    rice grains differ significantly from those of paddy soils, suggesting that the
    Pb in these organs is not derived exclusively from soils (Fig. 5). It is generally
    accepted that the main pathway of heavy metal accumulation in plants is root uptake
    from soils and leaf uptake from atmospheric aerosols (Cheng and Hu, 2010). It
    has been shown that atmospheric Pb can enter plants through various pathways,
    such as input through cuticle pores, stomata and drainage as well as through uptake
    by epidermal cells (Fang, 2018; Shahid et al., 2017). Soil and atmospheric Pb,
    then, are transported through the roots to the stem and from leaves to the stem
    and eventually to the grain. Grains have lower 206Pb/207Pb and higher 208Pb/206Pb
    relative to roots (Fig. 5), probably because it is influenced by atmospheric sources
    of Pb. According to the previous discussion of the BCF and TF data, the translocation
    of Pb from root to grain is extremely low in rice plants. Thus, the Pb accumulated
    in grains was likely to have been mainly transported from the leaves via the phloem
    (Liu et al., 2019a). This result is consistent with previous studies which have
    shown a considerable contribution of Pb from atmospheric sources to vegetables,
    rice and wheat grains (Bi et al., 2009; Feng et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013;
    Yang et al., 2015). In summary, rice plants mainly absorb Pb in the biologically
    active state from agricultural soils which is accumulated mostly in rice roots.
    Only a small portion migrates to the stems, while rice leaves absorb Pb mainly
    from the atmosphere, which is primarily composed of Pb from coal combustion (given
    that the Pb isotopic composition of leaves is close to that of the coal combustion
    sources). Once in the leaves, part of the Pb may migrate to the stems, rice husks
    and seeds. The quantitative analysis of Pb sources shows that Pb in the roots
    of rice plants mainly comes from natural, agricultural, and industrial sources.
    The roots of rice plants mainly absorbed Pb from the soil, so it can be inferred
    that part of the Pb from natural, agricultural, and industrial sources was absorbed
    by the roots after entering the soil. The main sources of Pb in the leaves, husks
    and grains of rice plants were coal combustion sources and agricultural sources.
    Based on the previous discussion, it is clear that the Pb in the leaves, husks
    and seeds of rice plants is mainly from atmospheric sources. Therefore, it can
    be inferred that Pb from coal combustion sources and agricultural sources is absorbed
    by rice through atmospheric pathways (gaseous, particulate matter, dust-fall).
    It can be seen that Pb isotope-based transfer tracing is more accurate compared
    to conventional BCF and TF methods, and can provide an important practical reference
    for quantitative studies on the transfer of Pb in soil-agriculture-human systems
    in other regions. 4. Conclusions Lead is enriched in agro-ecosystems in the Jiulong
    River Basin, and may pose human and ecosystem risks. Thus, Pb contamination in
    agro-ecosystems in this area should be continuously monitored. Lead in paddy soils
    was dominated by the reducible fraction; more specifically, the average percentage
    of Pb followed the order of reducible (42.9%)> residual (27.1%)> acid-soluble
    (24.9%)> oxidizable fraction (5.1%). The concentrations of Pb in grains were all
    below the limit for grain pollutants according to national standards. The average
    bioaccessibility of Pb in rice grains was significantly higher than those in paddy
    soil, with values of 77.85% and 37.44%, respectively. Lead in rice grains with
    higher bioaccessibility is a major concern. A mass balance-based multi-source
    hybrid IsoSource model was used to quantify the contributions of Pb from each
    specified source in the soil-rice-human system. Lead in the different chemical
    fractions was all mainly derived from natural, agricultural, industrial and coal
    combustion sources. The Pb from natural sources was more inclined to be present
    in the residual fraction, while Pb from anthropogenic sources tended to be present
    in the non-residual fraction. The average contributions of natural, agricultural,
    industrial and coal combustion sources to total Pb in paddy soils were 25.5%,
    35.3%, 24.5% and 14.7%, respectively, while the average contributions of these
    sources to total Pb in rice grains were 4.8%, 35.1%, 6.0% and 54.1%, respectively.
    The bioaccessible Pb, which is more easily absorbed, was mainly derived from anthropogenic
    sources [(agricultural (42.3% for soil and 25.3% for grain) and coal combustion
    sources (25.3% for soil and 59.3% for grain)]. The transfer of Pb in the agro-ecosystem
    was effectively traced using Pb isotopic compositions. Rice plants absorb Pb from
    the soil and the atmosphere through the roots and leaves, respectively. Most of
    the Pb was accumulated in roots and only a small amount migrated into the above-ground
    biomass. As a result, the average concentration of Pb in different rice plant
    organs varied in the order of root > leaf > stem > husk > grain. Lead from anthropogenic
    sources, especially coal combustion sources and agricultural sources, is more
    easily absorbed by rice plants, migrated to grains, and is mostly bioaccessible.
    The combination of total concentration, chemical fractionation, bioaccessibility
    and isotopic data for Pb can provide an important practical reference for quantitative
    studies on the sources and transfer characteristics of Pb in soil-agriculture-human
    systems in other regions. Author statement All authors of this research paper

    上一篇 下一篇 1 引言 具有得天独厚资源优势的东北地区为中国供给了近1/3的商品粮，是国家粮食安全的“压舱石”。21世纪前叶，受全球气候变化[1]、政策导向与经济发展状况[2]等一系列复杂因素的影响，东北地区粮食作物覆盖类型发生了重大调整。因此，分析东北地区主要粮食作物覆盖类型与种植模式的时空演变特征，深入揭示各类种植模式变化的驱动因素，可为东北地区种植模式优化[3]，农业高水平、高质量发展[4⇓-6]的推进，政-经-农一体化的促进提供重要决策支持，对实现农业供给侧结构性改革具有重要意义[7]。
    作物覆盖类型的精准遥感识别是明晰区域种植模式空间分布格局的前提基础。Google Earth Engine涵盖了全球范围的长时序多源遥感影像，其强大的云端算力和自由的编程空间，为大尺度遥感识别提供了便利[8,9]。相比于GEE支持向量机和分类回归树分类器，随机森林分类法因易扩展至海量数据分析、特征考虑全面、不易过拟合与生成分类特征重要性排序等优势，已成为遥感大范围复杂情境下提取作物覆盖类型的重要方法[10⇓-12]。近些年来，中分辨率光学与微波遥感影像在云平台中被广泛应用于宏观大尺度农作物的识别。光学影像具有丰富的光谱信息，基于光谱和植被指数差异区分不同作物优势明显[13⇓⇓-16]，但受厚云的影响易造成最佳物候期内数据质量低，存在可用影像不全等情况。雷达影像优秀的穿云能力与不同作物在影像上的后向散射强度差异不仅弥补了单一光学影像分类的缺陷，且扩展了遥感作物识别的分类特征，同时为多源遥感影像融合提取大范围作物提供了新思路[17⇓⇓⇓-21]。
    种植模式指某一区域或某一块耕地的年际间作物种植顺序，以连作和轮作为主[22]。东北地区的作物覆盖类型受多种因素的影响而频繁调整，造就了当前复杂且多样的种植模式[23⇓-25]。杜国明等[26]借助地学信息图谱提取了东北黑土区3年制的种植模式，发现如米米豆和豆豆米这类主要轮作模式体现了当地农户对于某一类作物的种植偏好，但由于3年的时间跨度较短，对轮作模式中偏好的捕捉难以全面。因此，可以适当扩大研究时段，明晰东北地区3年以上的作物种植类型以提取更为复杂的种植模式。
    种植模式是人与自然相互作用、相互反馈形成的，其演变过程和影响机制复杂多样，具体包括地形[27]、水文[28]、气候[29]、政府补贴、市场需求和经济投入[30]等。这些因素驱动着农作物种植类型与种植模式不断调整。当前，种植模式时空演变的驱动因素涉及层面广泛，影响机理复杂，因此有必要对种植模式的时空演变进行驱动力分析。驱动力分析方法主要包括经典的数学/统计学方法，如多元统计分析[31]和灰色关联度分析[32]，基于空间动力学的逻辑回归法[33]，以及基于空间统计学的地理探测器法[34]。其中，地理探测器能够解决多因素间复杂的交互关系问题而被广泛用于分析各种地理情景的驱动力[35,36]。
    综上，本文基于GEE多源遥感影像，结合粮食作物物候信息、多特征随机森林法与地学信息图谱，厘清2017—2021年主要粮食作物覆盖类型与种植模式的时空演变特征，选取自然与人为两方面因素，采用地理探测器分析种植模式时空演变的驱动力，以期为区域种植模式优化提供参考。
    2 研究区概况、数据处理与研究方法 2.1 研究区概况 东北地区（115°52''E—135°09''E、38°72''N—53°56''N）拥有世界上仅有的三大片最适宜耕作的黑土地之一，属温带季风气候区，是一块较为完整且相对独立的自然地理区域[37]，涵盖辽宁省、吉林省、黑龙江省与内蒙古自治区东四盟市（呼伦贝尔市、兴安盟、通辽市与赤峰市），面积约125万
    km2[38]。该区域气候资源丰富，活动积温在1500~3800 °C之间[39]，自南向北呈递减趋势。降水适中，总体年降水量介于450~850 mm[37]，由东向西逐级递减。全区雨热同期，昼夜温差大，无霜期适宜，适合一季作物生长。东北地区耕地主要位于松嫩平原、三江平原、辽河平原及各大山前平原（图1）。土类包括黑土、黑钙土、白浆土、草甸土、棕壤、暗棕壤和栗钙土等[40]，其中黑土以有机质含量高、土壤疏松、保水性好等优点而著称。如此得天独厚的资源优势使东北地区成为了中国最大的商品粮生产基地。

    of Year（DOY）介于210—280的Sentinel系列影像参与作物覆盖类型遥感识别。其中，Sentinel-1数据进行均值与Refine Lee滤波[41]处理，Sentinel-2数据进行去云与中值滤波处理。2017—2019年的粮食作物空间分布采用中国东北地区10
    m作物类型产品[42]。 图3 S-G滤波后3种粮食作物NDVI时序曲线（5天间隔） Figure 3 NDVI time series curves of

    size|PPT slide 基于NDVI阈值分割法剔除原始影像中非植被覆盖地类（城建区、裸地、水体、道路）的干扰，后续将分类系统划分为水稻、玉米、大豆、林地、草地与其他作物（高粱、马铃薯、粟、春小麦、白菜和萝卜等）6类。同时，各类属性值编号的设置与产品保持同步。最终以2019年为交叉年份定量统计产品与分类结果间的分类一致性，以及统计年鉴与分类结果间的面积一致性[43]。
    2.1.2 驱动因子数据 综合已有研究[35]与实地调研情况，选取高程、地形湿度指数、坡度、坡向、2017—2021年活动积温趋势、降雨量趋势、各市施肥成本变幅，玉米、大豆和水稻的生产者补贴变幅及粮价变幅等13种自然与人为驱动因子，揭示种植模式时空演变的主要驱动因素（表1）。

    （1）自然类因子 采用中国科学院资源环境科学与数据中心（http://www.resdc.cn/）发布的中国气象要素逐日站点观测数据集，对2017—2021年研究区内各气象站≥10°C的日均温度进行清洗与统计，并采用经验贝叶斯克里金插值法依次将5年点值积温扩展至面。
    降雨量数据来自国家地球系统科学数据中心（http://www.geodata.cn/index.html）提供的1901—2021年中国1 km分辨率逐月降水量数据集。选取2017—2021年的逐月降雨量数据，通过多维提取和地图代数功能依次计算5年的年平均降雨量并进行裁剪。后续对5年的积温与降雨数据分别进行基于最小二乘法的年际趋势[44]分析以体现气象要素逐年的连续变化情况，该方法可逐栅格模拟变化趋势以反映整个空间的时间变化特征。

    i 2 - ( ∑ i = 1 n i ) 2 （1） 式中：Slope代表各像元在研究时段内的斜率；n代表研究时间长度内数据的数量； X i 指第i个时间段研究要素的值。
    高程数据采用国家基础地理信息中心提供的1：5万数字高程模型（DEM）数据，空间分辨率为30 m。为协同其余因子统一分析，将DEM填洼后分辨率重采样至1 km，并计算坡度、坡向和地形湿度指数[45]。
    （2）人为类因子 以东北地区市级行政区为单位，采用水稻、玉米和大豆这3种主要粮食作物2017和2021年的粮价、生产者补贴及施肥成本变幅用于在人为层面解释种植模式的时空演变。其中，市级行政区划数据源自国家基础地理信息中心（http://www.ngcc.cn/ngcc/）。3种主要粮食作物的粮价数据来源于中国储备粮管理集团有限公司在全国粮价价格监测系统中公布的市级收购价，对多等级粮价平均后完成3类粮食作物粮价的录入工作。各市2017年和2021年生产者补贴具体金额来自各省财政厅下发的生产者补贴工作实施方案与下辖各市人民政府公布的有关玉米、大豆、稻谷生产者补贴发放公告以及实地问卷调查。施肥成本数据收集于各省农业农村厅的各市主要农资产品市场价格简讯，在综合收集了有机肥、无机肥、复合肥价格后，结合统计年鉴和走访调查中各肥料的施用权重，以加权平均的方式进行统计。最终通过差值运算得到40个市级行政单位的粮价、生产者补贴和施肥成本变幅。
    2.3 研究方法 2.3.1 随机森林分类法 随机森林具有不易过拟合、学习特征全面、可快速准确处理海量数据等优势[46]，满足大范围区分3种主要粮食作物的条件。综合考虑了区域内各作物物候期的光谱、纹理、植被指数、后向散射及地形共34个分类特征（表2）。经多次实验择优，设定随机森林的最佳决策树数量为155，种子数量为1000。其中，玉米、大豆与水稻样点每类各1000点以上，林地和草地样点每类500点以上，其他作物（高粱、马铃薯、粟、春小麦、白菜、杂豆和萝卜等）共计412点，涵盖70%实际调查样点，其余30%实际调查样点用于精度验证。

    2.3.2 地学信息图谱法 地学信息图谱[47]本质上是一种综合考虑时空变化的叠加分析方法。以谱定性、以图定位，这种图与谱融合的方式更加直观地展示了地学领域各要素在时空上的演变情况，可以更为全面、精准地解决多空间要素动态变化分布与占比这一问题。每一个图谱像元都涵盖了该区域内各类地物的逐期演变标签，由此在总体上构成了全域各个位置的动态谱系，综合体现了空间-时间-属性的一体化。各像元谱系的计算公式表示为：
    P = 10000 Y 1 + 1000 Y 2 + 100 Y 3 + 10 Y 4 + Y 5 （2） 式中： P 代表研究时段的种植模式的谱系编码；
    Y 1 指计算种植模式起始年份的作物属性标签； Y 2 指计算种植模式下一年的作物属性标签，以此类推。 2.3.3 地理探测器法 地理探测器[34]可快速定量解释多种具有不同空间分异特征和空间粒度[48]自变量对因变量的影响程度，拥有明确的空间统计意义和物理意义。最终计算的结果q统计量可直观地揭示各单因子和双因子交互的强弱，其大小与各因子对因变量解释力的强弱呈正相关。交互因子分析则是在单因子计算的基础上计算两因子在空间中的交集分布，把交集结果当作新的因子重新计算。其交互关系按照解释力递增顺序依次分为非线性减弱、单因子非线性减弱、双因子增强、独立和非线性增强共5种。本文运用地理探测器中的因子探测器和交互探测器来探究东北地区种植模式时空演变的驱动因素。q的具体公式如下：
    q = 1 - ∑ h = 1 L N h σ h 2 N σ 2 = 1 - S S W S S T S S W = ∑ h = 1 L N h σ h
    2 ,    S S T = N σ 2 （3） 式中：h表示各因子或因变量的分区； N h 和 N 依次代表h层和全域所含的像元数； σ h 2 和 σ
    2 分别代表h层和全域的因变量方差；SSW和SST为h层和全域的总体方差。 在驱动分析前需对全部因子进行格式转化以满足地理探测器的运行格式。首先栅格化处理人为类因子，并采用自然间断点法将全部因子重分类为5类。其次，综合考虑研究区大小与各因子空间分辨率，布设并提取出与种植模式空间分布相交的10
    km渔网。再次，基于分区统计功能，筛选出每个渔网单元内各因子等级的众数，将其视作网格内各因子的主导等级，各类种植模式同样采用该方法得到10 km区域内的主要种植模式。最后，将全部因子与种植模式编码进行空间连接，完成格式转化。
    3 结果与分析 3.1 主要粮食作物覆盖类型识别与演变 3.1.1 主要粮食作物覆盖类型识别 由随机森林决策得出2019—2021年3期随机森林特征重要性排序（图4）。其中，2019年区分6类地物贡献度大的几类特征依次为Elevation、VV、VH、B5、Slope和GI；2020年Elevation、VV、B5、VH、坡度和GCVI的贡献明显；2021年Elevation、VV、B5、Slope、VH、LSWI对各类地物区分较为重要。总体来讲，地形、后向散射、近红外光谱特征对3种主要粮食作物和非粮食作物的区分起重要作用。

    3.1.2 主要粮食作物覆盖类型时序演变 基于空间叠置分析，通过融合与面积排序总结出2017、2019和2021年面积占比最大的6种主要粮食作物时序转移类型（图6）。主要粮食作物覆盖类型转移较为频繁的区域集中于小兴安岭山前平原西南部和松嫩平原中部南部，其余地区分布广泛而松散。分析可知，豆➝米➝米演变形式为东北地区的主导时序变化形式，占全部变化面积的29.4%，主要在松嫩平原外围环形分布，三江平原内均匀分布。豆➝豆➝米演变形式占变化总面积的24.9%，大量汇集在松嫩平原东北侧和三江平原中部。米➝米➝豆演变形式占变化总面积的19.1%，在三大平原及小兴安岭山前平原上广泛分布，以松嫩平原南部最为集中。余下3种演变形式共占变化面积的26.6%，聚拢于松嫩平原东侧和东北侧，其余各地均以破碎态形式散布。总体而言，近5年东北地区玉米的种植偏好显著。

    slide 3.2 种植模式提取与空间格局 3.2.1 主要种植模式提取 为提取东北地区主要种植模式，首先基于空间叠置分析功能构建出2017—2021年5期的作物演变谱系，得到共243种年际作物种植变化编码。依据种植模式的基本概念[26]，以知识聚类[49]的方法建立二者间的信息重映射关系，并归纳出东北地区7大类共14种种植模式（图7）。具体分为3种重茬/连作种植模式（玉米、大豆重茬、水稻连作）、1种豆米轮作模式、4种重茬-偏好轮作模式（豆豆豆-豆米、米豆-豆豆豆、米米米-米豆、豆米-米米米）、4种重茬-轮作模式（豆豆豆-米豆、豆米-豆豆豆、米米米-豆米、米豆-米米米）以及2种非常规轮作模式（豆米豆-豆米、豆米豆-米米）。
    图7 种植模式编译与解码 Figure 7 Cropping pattern compilation and decoding Full size|PPT
    slide 重茬-偏好轮作模式由大豆重茬-豆米轮作与玉米重茬-米豆轮作组成，代表当地在重茬种植后即使有轮作意愿仍偏向先种植重茬作物。重茬-轮作模式由大豆重茬-米豆轮作、玉米重茬-豆米轮作组成，这体现了重茬种植后，当地农户也会正常轮作。非常规轮作在豆米豆轮作后无明显规律，因其种植面积较大，分布广且满足轮换规律，所以也需考虑在内。
    3.2.2 种植模式空间格局 7类种植模式在平原地区相互嵌套、联系紧密（图8）。玉米重茬模式是东北地区占比最大的种植模式，占全部种植模式面积的46.2%，广泛分布于东北三大平原区，自松嫩平原西北至辽河平原呈连片趋势，在松嫩平原东南部大量聚集。水稻连作面积占比23.5%，约为玉米重茬面积占比的一半，该模式集中分布于三江平原、辽河平原及松嫩平原沿河流域。大豆重茬集中于松嫩平原北部、部分小兴安岭山前平原和三江平原西部，其余地区零星散布，面积占比仅4.3%。重茬-偏好轮作模式均匀分布在三大平原内，以松嫩平原南部最为集中，占比13.2%。其余轮作模式共占12.8%，集聚于松嫩平原东北部、三江平原南部和小兴安岭山前平原，至齐齐哈尔—绥化一线以南分布较少，中断界限较为明显。

    3.3.1 驱动因子探测 图9副对角线部分展示了2017—2021年各类种植模式的单因子q统计量排序。东北地区各种植模式时空演变的单因子驱动强度表现为高程（qX2）>
    地形湿度指数（qX4）>坡度（qX1）>水稻粮价变幅（qX11）>大豆粮价变幅（qX10）>活动积温趋势（qX6）>水稻补贴变幅（qX8）>大豆补贴变幅（qX7）>玉米补贴变幅（qX9）>施肥成本变幅（qX13）>玉米粮价变幅（qX12）>降雨趋势（qX5）>坡向（qX3）。高程、地形湿度指数、坡度因子的单一q统计量顺次为0.244、0.203和0.143，体现了作物种植田块所必需的海拔适中，有一定汇水能力以及地势平坦的宏观基础；水稻和大豆粮价变幅的q值紧随其后，分别为0.132和0.113。其余单因子的q统计量<0.100，解释效果不显著。

    自然与人为因素对种植模式时空演变的交互解释力要强于单因子解释力。在q统计量排名前10位的交互因子中，高程因子对绝大部分其余因子都起到了非线性增强作用，只对少部分起双因子增强作用（表4）。高程与大豆补贴变幅、活动积温趋势、施肥成本变幅、水稻补贴变幅和玉米粮价变幅的交互q值均大于二者单因子解释力之和，即0.288、0.309、0.271、0.298和0.267，这说明在满足作物生长所必需的地形条件下，活动积温变化与经济政策的引导对东北地区种植模式时空演变具有一定的影响。相比于高程因子，地形湿度指数与其余因子的交互解释强度略有降低，但和其他驱动因子的交互解释力相比仍处于较高水平。这也满足作物需种植在具有一定蓄水能力的区域这一常理，在此基础上，气象条件与经济政策的变动会促使各年种植类型发生调整，最终产生了多样的种植模式。

    本文结果明确指出自然因素中的气象与地形因子交互后具有较高的解释力，说明气象与地形对粮食作物的空间分布有着较大程度的限制。21世纪初期受到厄尔尼诺和拉尼娜现象的交替影响，东北地区积温带开始异常波动[1]。热量资源的充足与否决定了不同品种粮食作物能否正常生长，也决定了生物量的累积情况。降雨量的高低和耕地的蓄水能力不仅影响着作物的长势状况，而且对大范围的作物空间分布有着无形的限制，高程更是主要粮食作物种植分布的重要限制因素。当前东北大田粮食作物的田间管理技术已向机械化、集成化、规模化态势大规模扩展[52]，广袤且平坦的平原地区便是其正常工作的基本条件，地形崎岖与否不仅影响着水分在土壤中的下渗程度、土壤养分的流失速度，也影响着田块机械化作业的难度与成本。
    人为因素对种植模式具有重要的影响[53]。近些年东北地区玉米的种植偏好普遍较高，尽管在多因素影响下大豆的种植意愿有所上升[54]，但个体农户依然偏向玉米种植。自2015年以来，受国家供给侧结构性改革影响，为减少中国蛋白类粮食作物进口依赖，国家开始鼓励大豆种植[55]。2017年7月，中国粮食生产开始向大豆供给侧转型，财政部、国家发展改革委和原农业部正式发布《关于调整完善玉米和大豆补贴政策的通知》用以在政策层面激励广大农户合理调整种植模式[54]。该项政策着重提高了大豆的生产者补贴，改革区域涉及东三省和蒙东地区三市一盟。至2020年，尽管东北地区大豆的生产者补贴已明显高于玉米[54]，但经实地走访得知大豆的种植偏好与玉米相比仍较低。为保障大豆种植面积，三部委联合发布《关于完善玉米和大豆生产者补贴政策的通知》，要求以省为单位设定大豆基期种植面积，2020—2022年保持不变。据实地调查，黑龙江省大豆和玉米的生产者补贴已由2017年的173元/亩、133元/亩变动到2022年的248元/亩、28元/亩。扶持偏重显而易见，但仍然屡闻“豆农生产积极性受挫”“大豆生产面积并未大幅度增长”等负面声音[2]。
    虽然国家大力提高大豆补贴，但在综合考虑大豆种植养护、产量、收购价格和废料回收方面后，其净收益并不如玉米[56]。2014年，东北地区大豆净利润为-0.19元/kg，低于同年玉米与水稻净利润，至2017年前一直呈缓慢波动增长趋势[57]。经实地问卷调查，除严格执行大豆种植政策外的区域，出于经济收益，大多数个体农户依然偏好种植玉米，如此便形成了东北地区分布最为广泛的玉米重茬模式，这种模式自绥化以南尤为常见。玉米重茬模式不仅会造成秸秆与土壤中残留大量病原菌[58]，而且会对耕地养分的平衡造成较大破坏[59]。为保障下一年收益，需投入更多肥料才能保证作物的正常生长与产出。对此，建议适当进行科学轮作[60]、大力推广秸秆还田措施[61]以确保耕地长期的健康与稳定，轮作大豆的根瘤菌对土壤中氮元素起固定作用，秸秆还田也会为耕地补充必要养分，防止水土流失[62]。
    本文表明地形、经济政策类因子对粮食作物覆盖类型的调整具有重要影响。为全面揭示东北地区种植模式时空演变的驱动机制，后续研究将考虑进一步增添各类驱动因子，并综合农业供给侧结构性改革与水土流失防治政策，深入探讨各类种植模式对土壤侵蚀及产量的响应机制，以期为东北地区耕地利用与保护提出新的优化建议。
    4.2 结论 本文基于GEE多源遥感影像，结合粮食作物物候信息，使用多特征随机森林法提取东北地区2019—2021年主要粮食作物覆盖类型空间分布，明晰了3种主要粮食作物覆盖类型与种植模式的时空演变特征，揭示了种植模式空间分异的驱动因素。结论如下：
    （1）东北地区主要粮食作物覆盖类型提取精度较高，与2017—2019年的已有产品融合度较高。2019—2021年3年总体分类的Kappa系数依次为0.908、0.905和0.853。其中，2019年3种主要粮食作物分类结果与产品的分类一致性达86.30%，与统计年鉴的面积一致性高达94.08%。
    （2）东北地区近5年粮食作物以大豆种植向玉米种植转移为主，7类粮食作物种植模式空间异质性明显。豆➝米➝米演变形式占全部演变形式的29.4%，豆➝豆➝米（24.9%），米➝米➝豆（19.1%）。玉米重茬模式占7类主导种植模式的46.2%，水稻连作模式（23.5%），豆米重茬偏好轮作模式（13.2%）。
    （3）自然与人为因素综合驱动了东北地区种植模式的时空演变。高程、地形湿度指数、坡度、水稻粮价变幅、大豆粮价变幅为驱动种植模式分异的主要单因子。交互因子对不同种植模式的解释力相比单因子提升明显，高程、地形湿度指数因子与大豆补助变幅、活动积温趋势、施肥成本变幅、水稻补助变幅、玉米粮价变幅和水稻粮价变幅的交互作用大都为非线性增强型，具有较强的解释力。
